STAND BY YOUR MEN; THE KENNEDY WOMEN, BY LAURENCE LEAMER (VILLARD BOOKS:

 The Kennedy women, like their brothers and husbands, were trained to 
merchandise the family mythology, no matter what. They were pressed into 
service most effectively in late October, 1960, the final week of the 
presidential campaign. Across America, television viewers turned on their sets 
to see "At Home With the Kennedys," one of the earliest attempts to sell a 
presidential candidate as if he were a mere celebrity. Jacqueline Bouvier 
Kennedy, the candidate's wife, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, his mother, and all of 
his sisters except for Pat Lawford sat stiffly in a living room and talked 
about Jack Kennedy's personal life. The sisters, Eunice and Jean, burbled about 
their lives at Hyannis -- the houses near each other, the children's horseback 
rides and swims. For the 1960 audience, these exotic women were like birds of 
paradise, and America, newly prosperous, was captivated by the illusion of 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' recent death, snippets from this 
commercial were aired frequently. How young all the Kennedy women looked! They 
were hardly out of their 20s, and it showed: They were proper Sacred Heart 
girls, sitting with their ankles crossed as the nuns had taught them. And, as 
if it were part of their catechism, they had already learned how to camouflage 
a lifetime of family secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting beside a tentative and delicate Jackie was her mother-in-law, Rose, in 
a good suit, her cold ambitions apparent even through a 1960 camera eye. Rose's 
cadence was robotic: Isn't Jack lucky he found a wife who is fond of 
campaigning! Jackie's response was equally stiff and equally false. "I've 
always enjoyed campaigning so much, Mrs. Kennedy. Your son, Teddy, is the 
campaign manager, as you know. . . ." How could anyone in 1960 say that the 
Kennedy women, despite being Catholic, did not represent the best of America? 
"At Home With the Kennedys" is credited with being the final salvo in J.F.K.'s 
narrow victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Would history have been different if the American public had known that the 
mystique of this glamorous family was based on a pack of lies? By this time, of 
course, Jackie, very pregnant, was desperate, miserable in her marriage. She 
was an ambitious, rather fey young woman mired in the contradictions of what it 
truly meant to be a Kennedy woman. She was surrounded by evasions and 
half-truths and had already debated leaving Jack. Off-camera as well, Pat 
Kennedy Lawford's marriage was a shambles of alcohol and indifference. The 
exuberant Kathleen (Kick) Kennedy and her older brother, Joe Jr., were long 
dead; Jack Kennedy was suffering in secret from Addison's disease, and the 
women in the family had learned to live with the horror of their retarded 
sister Rosemary's lobotomy, the result of a decision made cravenly by their 
father, Joseph Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone with a conscience in the America of 1960, Joe Kennedy was a sleaze 
who had supported appeasement before the war and he was personally repulsive as 
well, often running his hands up and down the thighs of his daughters' friends 
and talking about which women were great lays. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahead of this family were the glory years of Camelot and then murders, drug 
addictions, Chappaquiddick, William Kennedy Smith's rape trial, more alcoholism 
and lies; and courtiers who would build up their image, perhaps because, as 
Jackie once wrote, the family was like "carbonated water when everyone else was 
flat." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kennedy women gathered again more recently for Jackie Onassis' funeral in 
late May. I watched them as they appeared at the wake and in the church -- 
indefatigable, almost jaunty, a Kennedy-esque way to grieve. The wake was as 
raucous as Ethel's yearly reunions at Hickory Hill, repelling many of Jackie's 
closest New York friends. The sisters, who had called Jackie "the deb," seemed 
as if they were at a cocktail party, one friend told me. One sister had sat at 
Jackie's bedside as she slipped into a coma, narrating loudly, "So-and-so says 
they love you, Jackie!!" 
</P>
<P>
 At the funeral on Park Avenue, Ethel Kennedy bounded out of her car with her 
son Joe Kennedy Jr., smiling and waving at the hundreds of reporters gathered 
on the street as if she were on a campaign stop. It is a commonplace of 
biographers, including Leamer, to tacitly criticize this family for such 
boisterous vulgarity, for its refusal to look at shadows, to avoid pain at any 
cost. And yet the Kennedys have produced a President, an attorney general, a 
senator and dozens of grandchildren who retain a ferocious loyalty to the myth. 
</P>
<P>
 I approached "The Kennedy Women" with some dread. Its size is daunting. I felt 
the very title set up a false premise with its implication that there was 
something admirable, even exemplary, about the Kennedy women when, in fact, 
they were defined by the family men. I wondered what new material there was to 
add to the scores of books that have already been published on the family. The 
family's matriarch, Rose Kennedy, once called her own kin "a nation unto 
themselves," but she clearly had no idea that this nation would provide a 
cottage industry for dozens of biographers. 
</P>
<P>
 Leamer has done an exhaustive and admirable amount of reporting. The book is 
filled with new material about Rose Kennedy's early life and Kathleen Kennedy's 
time in England during the war. Leamer was given Kathleen's letters by the 
family, and they are fascinating documents that reveal her desperation to be 
accepted by her parents. Leamer also chronicles Joe Kennedy's appalling years 
as ambassador to the Court of St. James's, a stint marked by such anger from 
Franklin Roosevelt that after his last harsh words to Kennedy he ordered his 
secretary to "never let that man in here again." The entire story of Joe 
Kennedy's mutilation of his retarded daughter, Rosemary, is also retailed, as 
are the details of Jean Kennedy's youthful self-importance and moments of 
entitlement -- which foreshadow the behavior and brutish personality of her 
son, William Kennedy Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Kennedy Women's" strength however, is also its weakness. Leamer lacks the 
historical overview or compelling narrative vision that has made such 
biographies as Robert Caro's studies of Lyndon Johnson definitive works of 
history. At times, I felt overwhelmed by the author's inability to streamline 
some of his material. This is not to say I did not happily spend several long 
plane rides in the last month with "The Kennedy Women" -- and I was rewarded 
with many fine anecdotes and scenes: gossip as insight. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, no detail or moment is too small for Leamer, and at times there 
is a glut of information. We learn that Joe Kennedy had the largest 
long-distance telephone bill in America; that Rose Kennedy wore the wrong 
gloves to be presented to the queen; that Eunice had to sleep with earplugs and 
an eye mask. It is all here, sometimes far too much of it, the bottom pinching, 
the alcoholism of Pat Lawford, Joan Kennedy and Ted, as well as Jean Kennedy 
Smith's purported affair with Alan Jay Lerner. 
</P>
<P>
 Infidelities and craven opportunism permeate the narrative, but what is 
lacking is the author's sense of the political vision of Jack and Bobby 
Kennedy, which captivated a generation. Leamer is more interested in the 
personalities than the politics of the Kennedy White House, detailed in the 
historian Richard Reeves' fine study, "President Kennedy." In Leamer's White 
House, Eunice bombards her brother on the subject of mental health to such a 
degree he often avoided her calls; Jackie tells Oleg Cassini that she doesn't 
want "all the fat women in America" to wear her dresses, Jack Kennedy treats 
Arthur Schlesinger with a surprising offhandedness that borders on contempt. 
After Schlesinger attempted to take credit for advising the President about the 
Bay of Pigs, the President reportedly snapped: "I'll tell you what Artie can 
advise on. He can devote all of his mental capacity to advising Jackie on . . . 
furniture." Leamer's barb at Schlesinger seemed a bit gratuitous to me and I 
wondered if Schlesinger had refused to cooperate with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Leamer is adept at describing how the Kennedy women learned not to see, 
viewing character flaws and horrendous amoral behavior as "a thread that if 
unraveled would ruin the entire suit." Rose Kennedy's tendency to push away 
from pain all of her life might have been a legacy of her mother, Josephine 
Mary (Josie) Hannon. As a child, Josie Hannon, was given the responsibility to 
watch over her younger sister, Elizabeth, and a friend. The two little girls 
accidentally drowned in a pond; Josie's father laid out their two bodies in his 
parlor as a rebuke to his older daughter. This might have sent another child 
into the nunnery, but young Josie learned to hide all emotions behind a mask of 
tranquillity and she escaped her family very young to marry John (Honey Fitz) 
Fitzgerald, who became the notorious Boston mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the middle of her husband's 1913 campaign for mayor, Josie received a 
black-bordered letter saying her husband was involved with a woman named 
Toodles. Honey Fitz was forced out of the race, but Josie refused to look at 
the shadows of this relationship, as Rose would someday refuse to acknowledge 
the shadows in her own relationship with Joe Kennedy. Although Honey Fitz doted 
on his daughter, Rose, he was filled with bitterness that she chose Joe Kennedy 
for a groom. Honey Fitz had once given Rose the grandest deb party Boston had 
ever seen, but her wedding was modest and tainted by anger as Honey Fitz and 
Joe almost came to fisticuffs at the reception. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first crisis of her marriage, Rose pulled the wedding ring off and 
stood with her father. Later, she rarely spoke of her wedding day and her 
marriage disintegrated into a stage set very quickly. But what a stage set! 
Grand houses, sweeping ambitions, audiences with prime ministers and 
presidents. The back-story of Joe Kennedy's life is familiar; we know of his 
nights with chorus girls, the intense affair with Gloria Swanson, the safaris 
into the bedrooms of his daughters' friends. If Rose went to the family 
screening room, she might see her husband sitting cozily with "a secretary," 
her daughters present. Is it any wonder that the Kennedy women, Pat, Jean and 
Eunice have had their own troubling histories with men? 
</P>
<P>
 As her daughters would someday do, Rose saw her life as a complex matrix of 
obligations and duties. Leamer does not have the fascinating detail of Rose's 
purported neglect of her children that Nigel Hamilton chronicled in "Reckless 
Youth." Although Rose often didn't see her children for months, she was able to 
make her maternal concerns quite clear. For example, she kept her weight at 115 
pounds and was obsessed with appearances. In May, 1927, when Kathleen was only 
7 years old, she wrote to her mother, "I gained a pound and a half. Eunice 
gained some too. Rosemary is as fat as ever." The family was so disciplined 
that each night after dinner they were only allowed a single chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kennedy women paid a very dear price for their inability to see reality if 
it blocked their ambitions. On the night of Robert Kennedy's assassination, his 
11-year-old son, David, was alone watching TV when he saw his father gunned 
down. A campaign worker quickly scooped him up, but no one in the family 
evinced much interest in his whereabouts. Years later, he died of a drug 
overdose and Leamer reports that Caroline Kennedy went into her cousin's 
bedroom at a Palm Beach hotel to clean up the horror before the police arrived, 
although she later denied this. Is it true? If so, it means that the family 
tendencies have unhappily been inherited by one of the brightest and toughest 
young women the Kennedys ever produced. 
</P>
<P>
 I was particularly haunted by one scene in "The Kennedy Women." It is the very 
day in 1961 when Joe Kennedy has a stroke. Rose, appearing to be dutiful, is 
told by the servants that her husband has been stricken. Think of it: The 
Kennedys are at home in Palm Beach, close to excellent hospitals. She airily 
passes off the news, refuses to call the doctor, has a long lunch and then goes 
for a leisurely swim. Late in the afternoon, she arranges to get her husband to 
the hospital and by that time, he is beyond help. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of his life, of course, is spent almost comatose. In another family, 
such as the Von Bulows, this kind of neglect might have a murderous subtext. 
Rose, as Leamer has convinced us, has pushed away truth for so much of her life 
that she chose not to see how desperate her husband's condition was. Was this, 
yet again, a case of Rose avoiding the shadows of life in the Kennedy family or 
was it, just perhaps, a case when a Kennedy woman might have wreaked a fair bit 
of revenge? Is it possible that all along, Rose Kennedy, who has recently 
turned 104, knew that avoiding pain was the ultimate secret of a long life?

GET THIS MAN AN ARMANI SUIT; A PROLIFIC CHRONICLER OF 19TH CENTURY PARIS 
DESCRIBES A CITY UNCANNILY LIKE OUR OWN.; BALZAC: A BIOGRAPHY, BY GRAHAM ROBB 
(W.W. NORTON: $35; 417 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Mark Horowitz, Mark Horowitz has contributed to the Atlantic, the New 
Yorker, the New York Times Magazine. He also writes the Power Brokers column in 
Buzz magazine.

<TEXT>
<P>
 If anybody is still looking for the quintessential Los Angeles novelist, I've 
just found him: Honore de Balzac. The prolific chronicler of Paris in the first 
half of the 19th Century describes a city uncannily like my own. Nowadays Paris 
has become an upscale Disneyland for grown-ups, but Balzac's Paris was a 
caldron of greed, envy and intractable class conflict. It's pure Los Angeles, 
right down to the polluted air, the crowded, dangerous streets and awful slums 
cheek-by-jowl with ostentatious displays of fabulous wealth. The Faubourg 
Saint-Germain was a 19th-Century Beverly Hills, a place, Balzac wrote, where 
"thinking is kept to a minimum." 
</P>
<P>
 Balzac called his hometown "that insulting city," "the great melting-pot," and 
"dear old hell," but he was as loyal as a post-quake Angeleno who refuses to 
move. During one brief visit to rural Sardinia, Balzac grew homesick and 
complained: "There are . . . no prostitutes, no cheap theaters, no society, no 
newspapers, nor any of the impurities that betray the presence of 
civilization." He would have loved Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Balzac, who largely invented the young-man-from-the-provinces genre, starred 
in one himself: Born in the Loire Valley in 1799, he arrived in Paris when he 
was 20 (the same year he had Eugene de Rastignac hit town in "Pere Goriot") and 
started out in the Grub Street world of commercial journalism, churning out 
articles, reviews and the occasional pseudonymous potboiler. Not one of the 
hack writers, plagiarists and hustlers who populate his later novels would be 
out of place in a studio development office or a Writers Guild board meeting 
today. The titles alone -- "Lost Illusions," "The Splendors and Miseries of 
Courtesans" -- bring Hollywood immediately to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Like every one else in his Parisian Babylon, Balzac was not satisfied with 
modest success; he was forever planning his big financial score, from 
Mediterranean silver mines and Brazilian treasure hunts to elaborate publishing 
ventures and a scheme to sell life insurance along with special editions of his 
novels. The plans always failed and, though forever in debt, he retained a firm 
belief in second chances, which marks him as an honorary Californian. 
</P>
<P>
 He came into his own as a novelist during the 1830s, the era of the July 
Monarchy, when a new bourgeois regime presided over two decades of unrestrained 
appetite and acquisitiveness far more evocative of our own times than Dickens' 
sentimental paternalism. Balzac had found a worthy subject, and though he 
considered himself a royalist, he was the Restoration's most subversive critic. 
Oscar Wilde said that Balzac "invented the 19th Century," but Balzac would have 
given Napoleon the credit. The author kept a bust of the emperor in his study, 
with a note attached: "What he was unable to finish with the sword, I shall 
accomplish with the pen." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he died at mid-century, at the age of 51, Balzac had produced more 
than 100 novels and tales filled with countless recurring characters, all part 
of one over-arching structure entitled "La Comedie Humaine." In the 
English-speaking world, Balzac is one of the most neglected of the 19th-Century 
masters. Only a fraction of his books are in print, and apart from "Pere 
Goriot" and "Cousin Bette," which still turn up in college courses, he is 
little read in this country. Graham Robb's biography is the first written in 
English in over half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular image of Balzac derives from the idealized Rodin sculpture, made 
long after his death, and Andre Maurois's over-romanticized 1965 biography: 
that Balzac was a Romantic Artist who never left his desk and floated an entire 
fictional universe on gallons of strong black coffee. He supposedly talked to 
his fictional characters as if they were flesh-and-bone companions, and the 
classic myth is that on his death-bed he called for Dr. Bianchon, a recurring 
character in the novels, and cried out: "Only he can save me now!" 
</P>
<P>
 Graham Robb, a former Oxford fellow, provides the sober Anglo-Saxon antidote 
to the hype, but he may have gone to the other extreme. Robb is scrupulous 
about his facts -- and offers little but the facts. He shies away from the 
creative speculation necessary to synthesize a believable and compelling 
portrait. For example, he never provides more than the barest sketch of 
Balzac's crucial relationship with his mother, a tyrannical witch (if the son's 
letters are to be believed) from whose suffocating embrace he was never able to 
extricate himself. Robb only teases the reader with the possible ways in which 
she may have influenced Balzac's art; he never addresses them directly. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Robb ignores the novels themselves as a record of Balzac's 
state of mind. He favors the letters, which are a record of love affairs, bills 
paid and unpaid, and get-rich-quick schemes. But it is in the fiction that 
Balzac's genius shines, anatomizing every level of society with an 
anthropologist's eye and a psychiatrist's ear. It is the interconnectedness of 
the life and the art that is missing from this biography. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before his death, Balzac was given the kind of romantic happy ending that 
he never permitted his characters. For 17 years he had conducted a 
long-distance love affair with Eveline Hanska, a wealthy Polish countess living 
in the Ukraine. His letters to her take up two volumes in the collected works, 
but he rarely laid eyes on her. Her husband died in 1841, and Balzac finally 
married her. When she finally appeared in Paris, Alfred de Vigny wrote: "I had 
always believed the Russian woman to be a fantasy and was amazed to learn she 
was real." Balzac and Eveline were only physically together for about four 
years, but they were blissfully happy. One of her servants described finding 
the middle-aged newlyweds together at night, sitting by the fireside: "They 
talked and talked until morning. . . . Whatever could they find to talk about 
for so long?" Whatever indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Balzac believed in the talismanic power of certain objects. In his former 
house in Passy, I was once shown a set of small dolls clothed in a few shreds 
of faded material, which Balzac had supposedly used to keep track of the 
countless characters in the "Comedie Humaine." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, another little bit of "Balzaciana" recently turned up in 
Dailey Rare Books on Melrose, where I found a three-volume edition from an 
obscure French mediocrity named J.F. Ducis, who improvised French translations 
of Shakespeare without bothering to read the original. The Ducis "Othello," 
which has a happy ending, is particularly nice. The set was produced by Balzac 
under his own imprint as part of a failed attempt to become a successful 
publisher. An aura of enterprise, optimism and fraud adheres to these elegant 
little volumes, with their perfect leather bindings and gold lettering. They 
seemed right at home on Melrose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 I first encountered Balzac as a teen-ager. I identified with Lucien de 
Rubempre in "Lost Illusions" and the young Rastignac. They were both 
quintessential young men in a hurry, and so was I. Over the years, I continue 
to work my way through the "Comedie Humaine," and I still encounter Rastignac 
in later volumes. He's gotten older; he married well and become rich and 
self-satisfied. I've gotten older too, and I note the diminution of his inner 
fire with a certain grim satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "A steady course of Balzac," Oscar Wilde wrote, "reduces our living friends to 
shadows, and our acquaintances to the shadows of shades. . . . One of the great 
tragedies of my life is the death of Lucien de Rubempre. It is a grief from 
which I have never been able to completely rid myself. It haunts me in my 
moments of pleasure. I remember it when I laugh."

THE DEMISE OF A DYNASTY; BODY OF KNOWLEDGE, BY CAROL DAWSON (ALGONQUIN BOOKS OF 
CHAPEL HILL: $22.95; 480 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Draper, Robert Draper is a senior editor at Texas Monthly. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "First I cite physical conditions," begins this saga of a tragedy-stricken 
Texas dynasty, thereby setting a wryly comic tone that immediately 
distinguishes "Body of Knowledge" from its numerous Southern Gothic 
predecessors. The narrator happens to be 500-pound-plus Victoria Grace Ransom, 
a reclusive soul who dwindles her days in a metal-reinforced chair and ponders 
the demise of her once-great family within the confines of its seedy mansion. 
Victoria is both the Ransom's final progeny and its grotesque culmination -- 
"the end result of a pattern of habits," as he puts it. Yet even as she spins 
the doomful family tale for the readers benefit, our oversized heroine 
struggles to remove herself from her psychologically and physically burdensome 
legacy. Credit author Carol Dawson with the revelation that all Southern 
dynastic epics are, finally, about weight problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest anyone think that "Body of Knowledge" amount to a Faulkner-meets-Susan 
Powter satirical yarn, it should be made clear that Dawson's novel is a 
gorgeously crafted, intelligent and wholly original work that only gains power 
from its absence of solemnity. This is the Mt. Calm, Texas, author's second 
novel. Her first effort, "The Waking Spell" (another Southern 
multi-generational saga), was published in 1992 to rave reviews. "Body of 
Knowledge" confirms that Dawson is a storyteller of astonishing talent, one who 
is able to combine graceful imagery with wicked characterizations while never 
losing her grip on a complex narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 The tale of the Fanbsoms, set in the fictitious central Texas town of Bernice, 
unwinds at a leisurely pace, but proceeds along story lines that are taut with 
conflict. In 1908, Barner Ransom teams with his neighbor, Archibald Mcafee, to 
build the area's first ice-making factory. Fortune comes to both, but in their 
ensuing partnership, the Ransoms and Mcafees suffer from the entwinement. Young 
Grant Mcafee falls hard for Garner Ransom's beautiful daughter, Sarah. She 
refuses to marry; Grant impregnates her; she flees Bernice for good. Seething 
with anguish, Grant marries another woman, who in turn becomes pregnant after 
an affair with Sarah's older brother, William Ransom. Twice humiliated by 
Ransoms, Grant Mcafee vows revenge on the entire family -- a task he carries 
out with the insidious diligence of a slow-acting toxin. One by one, generation 
after generation, the Ransoms topple. Gunshot. Bludgeoning. Alcohol poisoning. 
More often than not, the act is accomplished simply by throwing the Mcafee 
shadow on the rival family, and letting the paranoia work its awful magic. It 
falls ultimately to Victoria, the novel's bloated "Body of Knowledge," to 
battle back the demons unleashed by her forefathers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson lets the tragedies veer toward the preposterous, then tightens her 
rein. While writing unobtrusively, the author is clearly having fun, and her 
playfulness is infectious. Now and again the drama is interrupted by a word 
from our fleshy narrator, Victoria: "I sat, at the age of sixteen, in my 
special steel-reinforced chair in the conservatory, eating a tubful of cheese 
scuffle beneath the wisteria while Viola described my grandfather William's 
amusement." "Body of Knowledge" is rich with humor, but also with lyricism: a 
black band marching through the "Saturday-Quiet Bernice like a Testament 
illusion," a woman's old yellow eyes with the red scrollwork of veins, "the 
quarter tones of Mother wails," "the musty aisles of oak." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having only two published novels to her credit, Dawson writes with a 
remarkably confident hand, and reaches deep to gather the essence of her may 
vivid characters -- among them the haplessly good-hearted William Ransom, his 
spiteful busybody of a sister Mavis, and their mother Arliss, the haughty 
Ransom matriarch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Body of Knowledge" avoids the lumbering qualities of so-called "historical 
novels" while at the same time being entirely faithful to its time period. 
Dawson skillfully renders a Texas altogether different from the saddle-sore 
grittiness one has come to expect after a steady diet of Larry McMurty and 
Cormac McCarthy. Bernice embodies small-town Texas living, not the frontier 
ethic; here the issues pertain to good manners, good gossip and long-standing 
grudges the origins of which are long forgotten. Because Texas is still a 
relatively young state, hamlets like Bernice are not dominated by blue bloods 
-- a family such as the Ransoms can evolve from nouveau riche to old money in a 
matter of two decades. Dawson is especially adept in her depictions of the 
town's blacks, who endure discrimination but do not suffer the heritage of 
plantation slavery. Perhaps the novel's must fully realized character is Viola, 
the Ransom's long-time servant who sits nightly in the kitchen with Victoria, 
simultaneously feeding her the family history and biscuits by the dozen. Far 
from being a simple-minded, stoop-shouldered mammy, Viola is a regal and 
thoughtful presence, "with fine proud legs" according to one admirer, and given 
to observations such as, "That boy's a real nexus." The sassy give-and-take 
between Viola and the Mcafee's servant, Dandy, are replete with crucial gossip 
and delicious put-downs. (Viola to Dandy: "I know you. Your tongue is loose as 
your leg used to be." But these scenes also provide the most penetrating 
insights into the two warring families as observed from the trenches of their 
respective kitchens. Dawson joins Nanci Kincaid ("Crossing Blood") as the only 
contemporary white novelist working today whose Southern black characters seem 
absolutely authentic. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, within the novel's prodigious cast one finds very few lifeless 
creations. Unfortunately, they appear all at the same time, as the tale moves 
on to the third Ransom generation, which consists of twins Bert and Willie (the 
former a reckless heathen, the latter a tentative bumbler), their do-gooding 
half-brother Baby Boy, and a mysterious fourth offspring whose identity, when 
revealed, surprises everyone but the reader. Not by coincidence, the story 
slackens noticeably when these characters take the stage. Only when the 
spotlight throws itself unsparingly on the last Ransom, Victoria, does the 
narrative crackle again and the novel reach its heroic conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Laced with fanciful humor that recalls the best of John Irving and anchored by 
a sense of place in the best Southern tradition, "Body of Knowledge" is 
nonetheless the work of Carol Dawson's distinctive imagination. Her story, 
which ends with the mention of fire as it began with ice, is a more like a 
literary whirlwind from which one takes leave with sudden regret and longing 
for her next no doubt sprawling endeavor.

RICHARD EDER: RYSZARD KAPUSCINSKI GOES HOME; THE VERBALLY ACROBATIC TRAVEL 
WRITER MAKES FEWER LEAPS WHEN WRITING ABOUT HIS OWN COUNTRY; IMPERIUM, BY 
RYSZARD KAPUSCINSKI (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $24; 331 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Imperium" is the name Ryszard Kapuscinski gives to the shadow that darkens 
his personal life and his life in history. In the United States we are not used 
to connecting the two: we may study history a little, but few of us think of 
ourselves as living in it. A D-day celebration is a date in our calendar of 
fuzzy remembrance shows. It belongs to June, the moonwalk belongs to July, 
Woodstock to August. Only upon a small number -- veterans -- did history fasten 
the bone-marrow grip that it has always exerted on Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 In few parts of Europe has the grip been as wrenching as in Poland. "So far 
from God, so near to the United States," Cubans and Mexicans will say of their 
countries; more in angry irony, perhaps, than in rage. Poland has never doubted 
she was near to God -- whatever others may have thought -- and it is less irony 
or rage than a doomed futility that follows upon the idea that even God hasn't 
kept her from being near to Russia. For 300 years the Russians, with Germany 
and Austria assisting and occasionally taking the lead, trundled Poland's 
borders back and forth, sometimes leaving a little bit in the middle, sometimes 
collapsing them entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Kapuscinski is a transcendental journalist. By that I mean that he has 
traveled in distant and little-known places and used what he sees and hears 
simply as the mouth of the cave. He begins with appearances, for which he has 
uncommon gifts of poetry, irony and paradox; and clambers down them into 
essences. In his books on Ethiopia and Emperor Haile Selassie, on Iran and the 
Shah, and in a collection of pieces on Africa and Central America called "The 
Soccer Wars," he unwrapped a strangeness and came upon himself inside it. He 
does not turn them into us , as explanatory journalism does; he turns us into 
them . 
</P>
<P>
 As I said, the places were all distant. Traveling, he could shed himself to 
find himself later. "Imperium" -- the Soviet Union -- allows him the mileage 
(Warsaw is farther from Vladivostok than from Tehran, Addis Ababa or Honduras) 
but it begins next door. Closer than next door: right on top of him and of his 
past and his country's past. He is writing about the whale from inside its 
belly. It cramps him and distends him; it strains and constrains his talent. 
Except sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of this account of his travels in the Soviet Union in the 
1950s and '60s, and then in 1989-1991 during perestroika, he for once recalls 
not moving but being moved upon: invaded. It was 1939 and he was a child with 
his mother trying to get back to Pinsk, then in Eastern Poland. The Russians 
had begun pushing west even as the Nazis were pushing east: the child and the 
mother were pushed along roads choked with refugees, cars and wagons and dead 
horses that had to be dragged aside. It is the Kapuscinski touch to cut so 
directly to a child's perception: "Dead horses are very heavy." 
</P>
<P>
 We have many accounts of occupations and the shattering of worlds. Kapuscinski 
recalls the occupation and shattering of his alphabet. At school the children 
suddenly had to learn Russian Cyrillic. He writes: "We begin with the letter S. 
'What do you mean by S,' someone asks from the back of the classroom. 'It 
should be with A!' 'Children,' says the teacher (who is a Pole) in a despondent 
voice, 'look at the cover of our book. What is the first letter on this cover? 
S!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of the Pinsk Poles, the teacher was soon deported west so that the 
town could be shuttled back once more within the borders of its giant neighbor. 
Kapuscinski writes well about deportations, hunger and destruction, but more or 
less as others have. Nothing else has the recollecting force of the broken 
alphabet; or of the sky-blue uniforms worn by the secret police in contrast to 
the Soviet army's mud-drab: "If someone from the NKVD is coming there is an 
azure glow for a kilometer around him." The bluebirds of terror. 
</P>
<P>
 Kapuscinski plucks such tiny strings to create a mysteriously out-sized 
resonance. He crosses the Chinese-Soviet border in 1958 aboard the 
Trans-Siberian Railroad. The passengers were meticulously searched, but the 
local Buryat tribesmen aboard got a particular going-over. Their small bags of 
kasha were emptied and the inspectors groped through them. Out of kasha, the 
author shapes the unforgettable image of a vast, robotic, leaden bureaucracy: 
</P>
<P>
 "The fingers of the customs inspectors allow narrow little streams of kasha to 
pass through them, sifting, sifting, but suddenly -- stop! The fingers stop and 
become motionless. The fingers have felt a strange grain. They felt it; they 
sent a signal to the custom inspector's brain; the brain responded -- stop! The 
fingers stand still and are waiting. The brain says, Try one more time, 
cautiously and carefully." It turns out to be a milling irregularity, he 
writes, and continues: "So, not contraband, not a trick, concludes the customs 
inspector's brain, but it doesn't give up yet. On the contrary, it commands the 
fingers to keep on sifting, keep on examining. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 During the dismal spring thaw in Yakutsk when everything turns to mud, a 
wraithlike child named Tanya tells of the tunnels of winter. An ice-haze forms 
when the temperature gets to 40 below, and people leave wakes in it. You can 
tell who has passed by their shape and direction. The children's tunnels are 
short and indistinct. The school principal's is definite and squat. Some are 
zigzag and end suddenly. They belong to drunks who collapse and perhaps freeze 
to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Such high resonances are uncharacteristically rare in "Imperium." Traveling to 
Moscow, the Ukraine, Siberia, Armenia, Georgia and the Trans-Caucasus, 
Kapuscinski can write perceptively and sometimes vividly. He finds weariness 
everywhere, with post-Soviet man depleted not so much by 70 years of repression 
as by the intense expenditure of means and energy in the repressing. 
</P>
<P>
 He attends a meeting of striking miners that rambles purposelessly until the 
director arrives, to everyone's relief, to get things on the "right" track. He 
writes of the killing of the Aral Sea by a vast cotton project that has leached 
the soil and stolen the rivers. He writes a diverting story of flying into the 
closed-off Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh disguised as an airline pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, though, he falls short of the admittedly extraordinary standards 
of his best work. Quite a bit borders on the routine, and a conclusion that he 
seems to have had little appetite to write is a dispirited exercise in Whither 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point Kapuscinski notes Russians' proud mystique of size. And, he 
observes: "It also serves to explain and justify all shortages, mistakes, 
poverty, and marasmus. It is too big a country to be reformed! explain the 
opponents of reform. It is too big a country to be cleaned up! -- janitors from 
Brest to Vladivostok throw up their hands. It is too big a country for goods to 
be delivered everywhere, grumble saleswomen in empty shops." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is too big for Kapuscinski, with his invaded heritage, to write 
about. Perhaps there is too much pain for him in the Imperium, and too little 
distance in it for his necromancy.

 "The Swimmers" (photographed by Gregg Segal, Aug. 14) brought back memories of 
growing up in Los Angeles in the early 1940s.During the summer, a friend and I 
would cut lawns and clean yards in the morning to earn a dollar between us. 
We'd then pedal our bicycles to Harvard Playground and swim all afternoon, for 
a nickel if you were 11 or under, a dime for those over 12. And I learned to 
swim there. A set of lessons cost 25 cents.

NOT TO DETRACT FROM CONTRACTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once more, The Times seems to embrace the myth that architects somehow can 
magically transform two-dimensional drawings into marvelous, livable, leakproof 
structures. Morris Newman would have us believe that architect Barbara 
Coffman's vision was perfectly realized in the Schwarzman house ("Rebuilt to 
Tilt," Style, Aug. 14). 
</P>
<P>
 As the general contractor for the project and one who spent every day for five 
months at the site, I assure you that transforming and refining this concept 
into a physical reality was no easy task. The window system as originally drawn 
was unworkable and unbuildable. Only a collaboration among the architect, the 
Schwarzmans and myself -- by trade a finish carpenter who has specialized in 
doors and windows -- resulted in the finished project being as lovely as it is. 
</P>
<P>
 In the film industry, a screenwriter writes the script, much as an architect 
draws the plans. In the former case, however, it is the director -- who takes 
the screenplay and transforms it into a visual reality -- who gets most of the 
credit for the film. Directors can win an Academy Award for their efforts; a 
general contractor seldom merits mention in an article about a project in which 
he, much like a director, brought all the elements together to create a 
beautiful structure.

THE STORM OF THE EYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wanda Coleman's "The Evil Eye" (On the Town, Aug. 14) is a timely column that 
shows the prejudice and hatred that interracial couples face daily. I am a 
Japanese American who has been in a serious relationship with a Mexican 
American for nearly two years. We are constantly being scrutinized by people of 
all races. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether we're dining in Little Tokyo or nosing around the shops on Whittier 
Boulevard, we get stares of disapproval from both Japanese and Mexicans, along 
with the requisite whispering and finger-pointing. Even in predominantly mixed 
areas, we're gawked at when we're holding hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Things have improved, but there are still walls to come down.

 I am a 45-year-old white male married to a 33-year-old Chinese woman. We have 
both experienced our share of prejudice hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months before our wedding, my wife's parents offered her $35,000 to marry 
a Chinese man -- any Chinese man -- instead. If we're in Chinatown, we get 
stares; when we're in my Wisconsin hometown, we get even more stares. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, something in Coleman's column bothered me. Why go back to a 
store to line the pockets of a perceived racist? I'd have driven miles out of 
my way to avoid doing so. And perhaps Wanda's husband would have been better 
off apologizing for cutting someone off and offering to let that person go 
ahead instead of resorting to expletives. In dodgy 1994 Los Angeles, that might 
be both the morally correct and the wise thing to do.

 An African-American woman has access to space in The Times and uses that space 
to bemoan racism she encountered in the Glendale Galleria? A travesty. Why not 
instead call for youth jobs, homes for poor-but-working families, hospice care 
for African-American AIDS victims, tutorial and educational support for 
children in "the Downs" and "the Gardens" or continued financial support for 
Crips-Bloods truce employment projects? 
</P>
<P>
 Use your access to print media to help those you left behind, not to cry in 
your caffe latte and invite us to your pity party because we don't celebrate 
your defection. We got bigger fish to fry.

 I was shocked by Coleman's reference to "the ugly glare of the Semitic-looking

encourage violence against minorities.

 I married a black man in the 1960s, eventually was divorced and successfully

L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman's litany of recent aggravations probably exceed mine for the last 
quarter-century. Anticipating trouble often means finding it. But Coleman 
shouldn't worry. In a few short years, no one -- from the sophisticated cafes 
to the wild and crazy streets -- will give a damn who you're with or even 
notice you at all.

THE BLUES PROJECT

 How ironic that in an issue condemning the pilfering of Eastern Europe of its 
artifacts ("The Sacking," by Jonathan Kandell, Aug. 14) you proudly parade 
photographs of Isaac Tigrett's House of Blues and make reference to the 
artifacts adorning its interior. No matter how honorably Tigrett came into 
possession of his booty, he has nevertheless contributed to the stripping of 
the historical and artistic heritage of a culture. The greed of selfish and 
ego-driven collectors has created a lucrative market for pilfered artifacts. 
Perhaps we will soon see some of the stolen saints, Madonnas, chalices, gold 
crucifixes and brass candlesticks adorning the interior of a stateside 
nightclub.

 Your cover photo says it all.

 The photographs by Dario Preger in the House of Blues design feature ("Out of 
the Blues," Style, by Barbara Thornburg, Aug. 14) were breathtaking -- the 
colors, the lighting, everything. We'd just been there but hadn't seen it 
through such artistic eyes. Now I want to go back again. 
</P>
<P>

 Thornburg sees fit to tout the attractions of a nightclub and eating joint 
associated with an organization called the International House of Blues 
Foundation, "a nonprofit educational network that teaches history through art 
and music." 
</P>
<P>
 One photograph shows a coffee table decorated with a statue of "Buddha 
Touching the Earth," the most sacred statue in the Buddhist world. Other Buddha 
statues serve as an accompaniment to a reading lamp and a decoration to a 
private lounge. Also misused is a statue of Ganesh, a principal and revered 
member of the Hindu pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
 What sort of international education organization could be associated with 
such blatant insults to two of the world's major religions? I can hardly 
imagine that statues of Christ or the Virgin Mary would be so mistreated.

AH, THE '50S; TWO NOVELS IN WHICH YOUNG SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLE TO SORT 
THE FACT FROM FANTASY; THE MORTICIAN'S APPRENTICE, BY RICK DEMARINIS (W.W.

<P>
 Southern California in 1953 was a Mecca for pilgrims in search of the American 
dream. The Golden State seemed to promise a new beginning to those whose 
fortunes had withered in less sunny climes. 
</P>
<P>
 Two new novels, both set in this inviting place 40 years ago, show young 
people struggling to sort the real from the unreal in a region where the 
confusion of fact and fantasy has always been a growth industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mortician's Apprentice," as its title suggests, is the more serious work. 
But serious is a relative term. Rick DeMarinis' book is a sometimes dark but 
wildly comic novel told in the first person by an 18-year-old named Osvaldo 
(Ozzie, or Oz) Santee, a San Diego resident about to graduate from high school 
in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 The only child of a Pennsylvania woman whose California roots are a mere 5 
years old, Oz grapples on his own with some of life's big questions. Like, what 
is love? And, what comes after high school? And is this really love? 
</P>
<P>
 The object of Oz's confused attentions is the beautiful Colleen Vogel. Colleen 
likes to think she resembles the movie actress Piper Laurie; when vexed, she 
looks to Oz like "a cross pixie." Colleen has already named her four future 
children with Oz. And she's made post-graduation plans for Oz to go to work -- 
forever -- for her father, Morris Vogel, owner of the Vogel-Darling Funeral 
Home. 
</P>
<P>
 Death surrounds the surf-loving Oz in his '50s coastal paradise -- from the 
corpses in "the cold room" at the Vogel-Darling Home to the smothering of the 
spirit and the culture he perceives all around him. Always looming are the 
threats of the A-Bomb, the H-Bomb, Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Balanced precariously against the doom and decay is Oz's passion for jazz 
music -- not the antique sounds of classic jazz or the cool abstractions of 
modernists like Miles and Brubeck, but the impolite hard-bop bleats and 
blarings of sax men such as Charlie Ventura, Big Jay McNeeley and Illinois 
Jacquet. 
</P>
<P>
 This jazz puts Oz in a different mind-frame, removes him from the prevailing 
mundane. "It was like being drunk," he thinks. "McNeeley's, Jacquet's, or 
Ventura's tenor sax could blast holes through your brain. Light, like the 
headlight of a train, blew through the holes. The Doppler-like shift of those 
jackhammer honks and moans and gutty rebops were boiling with love, hate, 
misery, and unapologetic fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Not much fun and lots of dull misery is what Oz fears the future holds, if he 
goes ahead and marries the undertaker's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't want to get married, Oz admits to himself. And he doesn't want to 
work for a mortician. "I didn't want to work for anybody. I didn't want to go 
to college. I didn't want to get old, wear suits, and say important things to 
important people. I didn't exactly want things to stay as they were, but I 
didn't want them to change drastically, either. I could picture myself living 
in a shack on the beach forever, humming and listening to bop." 
</P>
<P>
 To escape the stifling anxieties of San Diego, Oz drives more than once to the 
raunchy and dangerous Tijuana, in the company of friends with nicknames such as 
"Monster" -- volatile buddies who can quickly turn ugly, with or without 
whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMarinis re-creates their foul-mouthed slang with pitch-perfect tone. Much 
So-Cal lore is here, as well: Santa Ana winds and "earthquake weather," 
drive-ins and AM radio -- all rendered with a vivid immediacy that makes it 
seem brand new. The '50s of "The Mortician's Apprentice" are seen not through a 
fuzzy sitcom haze but in all their frightening complexity: bleak, exciting, 
vulgar and bittersweet. Oz rockets between euphoria and despair with the speed 
of an adolescent's hormones. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous reviewers have compared Rick DeMarinis (author of six other novels 
and three books of short stories) to a dozen American writers from Melville to 
Salinger. All this reviewer can say is: He's terrific, he's great fun to read, 
he's an original. 
</P>
<P>
 Callum, the 10-year-old pivotal figure in Malcolm Cook MacPherson's novel, "In 
Cahoots," lives a bit north of Oz's San Diego, in Garden Grove. Although Callum 
and Oz hear some of the same 1953 hit songs on the radio and feel the identical 
hot Southland winds, Callum's Southern California is a considerably happier 
place than Oz's tremor zone. This makes sense. Callum is surrounded by poor but 
loving adult groupings, in stark contrast to Oz's hilariously dysfunctional 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Callum's dad, a soda delivery man named Bud, has come to the West Coast from 
New England with hopes of a better life. So far, his and his oddball cronies' 
schemes -- the Sonja Henie Glide Salon, the mink farm, the middle-of-nowhere 
doughnut stand -- have all gone bust. But now Bud is onto a hunch he's certain 
will bring him his California gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Through hints and happenstance, Bud becomes convinced that Walt Disney is 
planning to build some kind of elaborate "fun zone" or amusement park in the 
vicinity of Garden Grove. If he can discover its proposed location, he will buy 
a small parcel of land smack in the middle -- and make the millionaires pay him 
his price. 
</P>
<P>
 Nudists, UFOlogists, fortune-tellers, Hollywood studio technicians and 
Stanford think-tankers all figure in Bud and company's goofy (or should that be 
"Goofy"?) attempts to read Walt Disney's mind. (Other 1953 time-markers in "In 
Cahoots" include the Laguna Art Pageant of Living Masters, the Pike at Long 
Beach, TV psychic Criswell and functioning orange groves.) 
</P>
<P>
 Callum observes the grown-ups with much interest. To Callum, events seem to 
carom like billiard balls. "The fun of being around adults," he figures, "was 
seeing which ball would go where. Adults were like kids without the 
restrictions. The consequences of their actions were more dramatic, which made 
them more fun to be around." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a great deal of musing about the nature of dreams here, of what 
they're made and how to be true to them. In the end, naturally enough, it's the 
youngster Callum who comes closest to tapping the site of Disney's childlike 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Cahoots" is sweet but not saccharine. Its nostalgia isn't prefabricated; 
it's earned. Malcolm Cook MacPherson has written a charming novel of a time and 
place that often seemed strangely like a movie, that was (in Kevin Starr's 
phrase) "at once true and not true . . . a place where dream and fact energized 
each other."

 the feast, time unhomogenized

 the moment when you go into

 the sky does a quick grey-to-blue

 Seen at just the right angle,

 the sunlight fires that skin to gold,

 SWIMMER IN THE SECRET SEA by William Kotzwinkle (Chronicle: $10.95; 91 pp.) "I 
built a house for us, with a room for him," writes William Kotzinkle in the 
fictional voice of Laski, "and now I'm building his casket. There's no 
difference in the work. We simply must go along, eyes open, watching our work 
carefully, without any extra thoughts. Then we flow with the night." This 
novella, first published in "Prize Stories 1975: The O. Henry Awards," has been 
out of print since 1981 and richly deserves its own covers. Kotzwinkle, who 
went on to write "The Fan Man," "Fata Morgana, " the novelization of E.T. and, 
most recently, "The Game of Thirty," like the father in "Swimmer," lives in the 
North, on an island in Maine. This account of the birth and loss of a child is 
so spare and direct and intimate that it's hard to believe this is not a 
personal history, something Kotzwinkle had to write before moving on. For 10 
years, Laski and his wife try, against medical advice, to have a child. "Life 
enslaves us, makes us want children, gives us a thousand illusions about love, 
and all so that it can go forward." They finally become pregnant. After a 
detailed, bone-crushing description of the labor and birth (the literary 
equivalent of the home video), the "swimmer in the secret sea" is born. "And 
this, thought Laski, is why we labor, so that love might come into the 
world."The rest is almost unbearably sad; every detail of the next few days in 
the hospital, then of burying the baby in the woods, from the lie that Laski 
tells the other proud father in the hallway who asks him what he had ("A boy") 
to the building of the casket (which must remind the reader of the shape and 
feel of the book), to the cry of his wife: "He never got to live at all!" It's 
a very sad story that happens all the time. "We simply must go along, eyes 
open, watching our work carefully. . . ."

 PASSION by I.U. Tarchetti (Mercury House: $12.95, paperback original; 214 pp.) 
Tarchetti, writing in the mid 1800s, was a member of a group of painters, 
composers and writers called the scapigliati, a group whose guiding principle 
was the rejection of bourgeois values and respectable behavior."Passion" 
(titled "Fosca") was written in 1869, the year of Tarchetti's death at 
twenty-nine of tuberculosis and typhus. The story, in which Gorgio, a young 
military officer on leave in Milan falls in love with Clara, a beautiful, 
robust, happy but distracted married woman, and is then transferred to Parma, 
where he becomes obsessed (half love and half death) with Fosca, his colonel's 
depressed, hysterical, extremely intelligent and very ugly cousin, is almost 
completely autobiographical. It is a feverish libretto of a book, in which the 
greatness of one's soul is measured by the ability to love and hate absolutely. 
In 1971, Italo Calvino included the book in a series he was editing for an 
Italian publisher. In 1981, an Italian film was made of the story, and Stephen 
Sondheim and James Lapine have just adapted the book to the American musical 
theatre. Choose your medium. Have something cold on hand to drink.

 THE ASSAULT by Reinaldo Arenas, translated by Andrew Hurley (Viking: $20.95; 
145 pp.) This is the fifth and last in a series of five novels that the author, 
who died in 1990, once called "a secret history of Cuba." The last, "Before 
Night Falls," was published in 1993. In "The Assault," an allegorical satire, 
Arenas lets loose, drips venom and creates a future world that is also the 
present world, in which human beings do each other every wrong and insult and 
pain-inducing thing until they resemble the worn-out husks of human animals. It 
is like reading Kafka, Borges, Huxley, Orwell and, if you're feeling good and 
can laugh now and then, a little Calvino. The thread running through each 
gruesome chapter is the narrator's desire to kill, maim, spindle and mutilate 
his mother, lest he become like her. As a bureaucrat on a tour of the 
Servo-Perimeter Satellite Cities for the government and the Represident, he 
searches for her and almost gets her several times. "And still I have not 
managed to kill her. I go outside again. It's a starry night, as they used to 
say, way back in the past. . . . I watch officers from the Post-Mortuary Prison 
carry away the bodies of people snagged during the not-night on the hooks on 
the not-benches in the not-park." The hooks are to grab and kill those 
indulging in idleness. The not-night was the idea of the Represident, who 
abolished night because it could not possibly exist in a perfect society.This 
cruel world is replete with the Bureau of Counterwhispering, the Claw of Power, 
Breeding Permits and the Multi-Family. Arenas allows himself only a few 
vomit-and-violence-free passages, particularly toward the end, where he spells 
out the reigning principles of this society: "Do you believe that a person who 
can choose, a person who is free, can bear to see other people who cannot 
choose, who are not free? What we had to do -- and this the Represident knows 
well -- was undermine everything, destroy everything that represented balance, 
that offered a point of comparison, that symbolized stability." It's one of 
those books that makes you reel, and you want to lie face down somewhere to 
sleep it off.

 NO ORDINARY GENIUS: The Illustrated Richard Feynman by Christopher Sykes (264 
pp.; $29.95). Two fine books have already been published on this feyn man: 
James Gleick's cerebral portrait, "Genius," and the farcical memoir, "Surely 
You're Joking, Mr. Feynman."But as BBC producer Christopher Sykes shows in this 
lively biography, even now, six years after the physicist's death, there is 
ample room for a third. Ever the oddball, Sykes' Feynman seems saddest when 
showered with praise: "They expected me to be wonderful," he laments at one 
point, "and I wasn't wonderful." He is happiest, in contrast, when walking in a 
park with a friend like Sykes, explaining what holds the clouds up or why the 
raindrop on the picnic table keeps its shape: "You see . . . the atoms attract 
each other -- they like to be next to each other, they want as many partners as 
they can get! Now the guys that are on the surface have partners only on one 
side, and the air on the other, so they're trying to get in to get closer . . . 
(they) are very unhappy and nervous, and they keep pounding in, trying to get 
in, and that makes it a tight round ball." Alex Raksin

PREVIEW '94; A FEEL FOR FAMILY; ABC PINS ITS SATURDAY NIGHT VALUES ON WHOLESOME 
MOVIES 
</P>

<P>
 A certain former vice president's quest for "family values" had nothing to do 
with the inception of the new "The ABC Family Movie," which premiered Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can credit Dan Quayle with this," says Judd Parkin, ABC 
senior vice president of motion pictures for TV and miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
 Parkin and ABC Entertainment president Ted Harbert realized the need for shows 
that promote "family values" on TV. Both happen to have young children. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the longest time, we've been making noise that there's nothing on 
(Saturday nights) except Nickelodeon for kids to watch with any consistency," 
Parkin says. "We had all gotten a bit burned out on the tabloid 
movie-of-the-week race. This is an attempt to try to do something different." 
</P>
<P>
 Every Saturday from 8 to 10 p.m., the "Family Movie" will rotate popular 
theatrical films ("The Bad News Bears," "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate 
Factory"), with new films such as remakes of Disney's "The Shaggy Dog" and 
"Freaky Friday"; "Fudge-a-Mania," based on Judy Blume's "Fudge" books; "How the 
West Was Fun," starring Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen; and "Father and Scout," 
with Bob Saget. 
</P>
<P>
 Parkin says he's thrilled with the response from the creative community: 
"People have been clamoring to do these kinds of films." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's goal is to present a whole range of movies that parents and their kids 
-- and don't forget about their Saturday night baby-sitters -- will watch. 
"We're kind of reinventing the (movie) wheel," Parkin explains. "We don't know 
what a Saturday-night movie is. I'd have to say what we're aiming for is 
largely an entertainment-based film." 
</P>
<P>
 Saget, the star of ABC's "Full House" and "America's Funniest Home Videos," 
headlines and is executive producer of "Father and Scout," a comedy set for the 
fall about a hapless yuppie dad who accompanies his 8-year-old son (Brian 
Bonsall) on a father-son camping trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of three daughters, Saget loves the "Family Movie" concept. "I 
think it's a great idea," he says. "A lot of families are home on Saturday 
nights. I'm so tired of watching cop shows. I'm so tired of all of this action 
stuff on shows. A lot of people don't want to see me get hit. This is not 
'MacGyver.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto "How the West Was Fun," another fall entry, which stars those "Full 
House" phenoms, the Olsen twins. In the lighthearted Western, the girls help 
their godmother (Peg Philips of "Northern Exposure") save her dude ranch from 
her conniving son (Martin Mull) who wants to turn the place into an amusement 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 Green/Epstein Productions, which produce all of the Olsens' TV movies, try to 
develop vehicles that also contain a message for viewers. "We decided that 
these kids at 8 years old have some responsibility," says executive producer 
Jim Green. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find that making these movies is really fun because we are with kids," 
adds producer Mark Bacino. " And we're not dealing with the murder of the 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Television is giving a '90s twist to four of its popular features 
-- "The Shaggy Dog," "Escape to Witch Mountain," "Freaky Friday" and "The 
Computer Wore Tennis Shoes -- for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that there's a certain nostalgic value the titles have that will pull 
in an adult audience who will probably sit there and enjoy watching it with 
their kids," says George Zaloom, who is executive producer of the Disney films. 
</P>
<P>
 Many names familiar from television star in "Father and Scout," "How the West 
Was Fun," and "Shaggy Dog." Among them: Sharon Lawrence, Ed Begley Jr. and 
Scott Weinger. Shelley Long and Gaby Hoffmann are currently in production on 
"Freaky Friday," which "thirtysomething's" Melanie Mayron is directing. 
</P>
<P>
 Signboard Hill, a division of Hallmark, originally had a deal with ABC to 
produce adult-oriented movies. (Their productions, 'Getting Out" and "Spoils of 
War," aired last season on ABC). When ABC approved the "Family Movie" concept, 
the network asked Signboard Hill to switch gears. 
</P>
<P>
 On Signboard's roster are "Johnny's Girl," a drama about a low-level crook who 
suddenly has to take care of his 18-year-old daughter; "Secrets," a period 
piece about adoption; and "The Ranger, the Cook and a Hole in the Sky," a 
comedy-adventure based on a Norman Maclean ("A River Runs Through It") story. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movies we're making or have made, I would say, require the family to 
watch together," says Signboard executive produce Richard Welsh. "I really 
congratulate ABC for doing this. I think it provides different movies for 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 "The ABC Family Movie" airs Saturdays at 8 p.m. This week: "Teen Wolf."

 PORTRAIT OF MARY by Nikki Grimes (Harcourt Brace: $15.95; 116 pp.) Nikki 
Grimes, author of several children's books including a biography of Malcolm X, 
began this project as a series of poems about the life of the mother of Jesus 
Christ.The poems became a theater piece that was performed for church audiences 
and coffee houses, and finally took the form of this narrative. A combination 
of Scripture and storytelling, in the end this is another story of child loss 
and faith. Mary, picture of grace and sacrifice, believes in the visions and 
dreams that she and her husband must act upon; marrying in spite of the 
pregnancy, moving to Egypt to escape the slaughter of the innocents in 
Bethlehem, hearing the proclamations from prophets and wise men on the fate of 
their son. Of course, there's never enough detail in this story, no amount of 
pomegranates or wet hay or lentil stew will drag it below the level of myth, 
but it breathes life into the story to be able to picture Mary's daily life and 
her hopes and fears for her son ("Why, he would be the best carpenter in all 
Jerusalem, if Joseph had his way"). In the Notes and Acknowledgments, Grimes 
describes the few places where she played with history and myth and Scripture 
-- most importantly, a section in which the risen Christ visits his mother. "I 
cannot imagine," writes Grimes as a mother who has lost a child, "that Jesus 
would have visited his friends one final time . . . and not have done as much 
for his beloved mother."

 WOMEN AND GHOSTS by Alison Lurie (Doubleday: $21; 179 pp.) Like many writers 
before her, and a little like a poet trying to write a villanelle as homage to 
the importance of form , Lurie has written a collection of ghost stories.But 
the voices of her haunted women (all suspiciously thirtysomething) are so 
deadpan, so matter-o-fact, and the objects and situations endowed with ghostly 
spirits are so everyday that the stories end up being funnier than they are 
scary; the malevolent spirits no worse than the mothers-in-law and the creepy 
husbands-to-be and the academics that populate these stories on the mortal 
side. In "Ilse's House," a young woman engaged to a real jerk is haunted by his 
ex-wife, a potato sack of a drunken housewife who inhabits the kitchen. In "The 
Highboy" (a very funny story), Buffy is done in by a top-heavy, bird-clawed 
piece of New England furniture (if it hadn't been the Highboy, it would have 
been the Spode). But some are really over the top, like "Counting Sheep," in 
which a young academic who is ambition-impaired becomes a sheep, or "Fat 
People," in which a dieter is haunted by a legion of "angry fat grey people." 
They are caricatures of our taste for horror, Edward Gorey in the 1990s, 
without the knife-edged humor that has made him timeless.

 MOTHER TONGUE by Demetria Martinez (Bilingual Press: $17; 125 pp.) The author 
of this novel, winner of the 1994 Western States Book Award for Fiction, was 
indicted on charges relating to smuggling Central American refugees into the 
United States in 1987, and later acquitted on First Amendment grounds. She has 
written a brave and complicated account of what it is to be a refugee, to help 
a refugee and to fall in love with someone fleeing an unbearable past. "His 
nation," it begins, "chewed him up and spat him out like a pinon shell." On one 
level, the romance in this story has many similarities to "The Bridges of 
Madison County." One hesitates to say it, for the backdrop of this book is the 
violence of Central America, particularly El Salvador in the early 1980s, which 
has nothing to do with Iowa or bridges or lonely photographers, none of the 
same factors creating an impossible romance. Maria falls (yes, helplessly) in 
love with the man, Jose Luis, whom she has been asked by her wise old friend, 
Soledad, to help assimilate. He is a poet, a man who has been tortured, and 
whose wife-to-be was brutally murdered by the police. He has trouble living in 
and trusting the present and is not looking to fall in love. But his 
Mexican-American savior, Mary/Maria ("a blessing name that had become my curse. 
At age nineteen, I was looking for a man to tear apart the dry rind of that 
name so I could see what fruit fermented inside") describes herself as "one of 
those women whose fate is to take a war out of a man, or at least imagine she 
is doing so, like prostitutes once upon a time who gave themselves in temples 
to returning soldiers."Her longing and his fear make the book simmer, carrying 
the reader through a somewhat hasty, pat and disappointing ending.

 "It must have been 1975 or 1976 when I first set foot in the Pines," Birney 
Imes writes in the introduction to his collection of photographs of a 
Mississippi Delta roadhouse. "I had just begun photographing seriously and 
would spend hours driving back roads looking for a site or a situation to 
photograph. It didn't take long to stumble upon the place -- the 'Eppie's Eats' 
sign out front, the rusting cars, the hedge in the parking lot dividing the 
White Side and the Black Side, and the stuff -- it was everywhere inside and 
out: coin scales, pinball machines, jukeboxes, lawn mowers, old campaign 
posters, newspapers, guns, cigar boxes, and beer signs. It was overwhelming, 
and it was irresistible." 
</P>
<P>
 In Imes' previous photo collection, "Juke Joints," as well as in this new 
book, "Whispering Pines," one sees an emerging documentary eye that is both 
dispassionate and intimate. Very few photographers get close enough to their 
subjects to avoid a kind of posed, unnatural response from people. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a question of invisibility; good photographers are very much present 
in their point of view, their selective, editorial eye, their basic visceral 
response to what's in front of them. Imes is fond of the mundane weirdness of 
peoples' lives, of what they collect and surround themselves with, of the 
accidental, unedited confusion of things that make up the uniqueness of place. 
Like William Eggleston, he has a strong sense of the South and its particular 
characteristics that penetrates -- even punctures -- the canonized cliches of 
Southern culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Mississippian and brilliant observer of everyday life in the South, 
Eudora Welty, traveled throughout the state in the 1930s, photographing people 
at home, on the street, at work or at political gatherings with an ease and 
acceptance that make her pictures sublime, natural, deeply revealing and 
unencumbered by artifice, attitude or the oppression of artistic intent. In a 
sense, they are about observing. Imes shares that quality of interest and pride 
in life in the Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 What one sees in his pictures are encyclopedic cultural moments: Against a 
backdrop of clutter, Whispering Pines proprietor Blume Triplett, rarely without 
a cigar, presides over Delta residents eating, drinking, dancing or just 
sitting around. The Whispering Pines images are both in color and 
black-and-white; the color work has the richness and precision of large-format 
photography. One's eye wanders around on shelves and counter tops covered with 
jars of Magic Chef pigs' feet, Now & Later bars, 45 r.p.m. records, endless 
cigar boxes, beer bottles, chicken-feet paperweights . . . but the stuff is a 
backdrop to the active life that makes Whispering Pines so fascinating: It's 
the people, the undeniable sense that you are in a place unlike any other, that 
the aged, chicken-clutching, gun-waving white man in plaid is a benevolent 
clubhouse impresario whose patrons, black and white, have a rich shared 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 It's in the cigar boxes that the history is detailed. Blume Triplett saves 
things; Birney Imes records the past without disturbing the comfortable 
incongruity of the boxes. They are photographed top-open and undisturbed, like 
archeological finds before the numbering and cataloguing has begun. One of my 
favorites has a black-and-white snapshot of a girl, under it a jukebox flipper, 
a boxed Hawaiian Wriggler fishing lure, some pipe cleaners, wire and a 
turntable stylus; another has five spent bullet shells, four peach pits, a door 
latch and two Gladys Knight jukebox labels. "Made in Florida. Havana Blend" 
serves as a kind of legend on the inner label of the cigar boxes. Not all of 
them are so random; one box holds a neat stack of papers, the top piece a news 
clipping headlined "Singer Charged in Mississippi -- Negro Rock and Roll Star 
Denies He Asked for Date From Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 But the best warning that Whispering Pines existed on its own, protected by 
Blume Triplett from the world outside is in one of Imes' best portraits in the 
book. It's Blume on New Year's Eve, 1988, standing in front of the neon-lit 
roadhouse, a towel with swans over his shoulders, walking stick in one hand and 
pistol pointed into the night sky in his other hand. No one could ever imagine 
the photographer saying: "Hold it a minute, a little to the left, please, let 
me fix the light. . . ." It is that quality of participation that separates 
Birney Imes from a long line of picture-takers who, even if they are at the 
right place at the right time, fail to become part of the world they are 
visiting. 
</P>
<P>
 A second volume of Imes' photographs, "Partial to Home" -- an all 
black-and-white collection -- more closely aligns Imes with an array of late 
20th-Century photographers whose formalism resides in the subject rather than 
in composition, where moment dictates frame in some cases and content certainly 
overrides the desire for neatness or balance in every picture. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl behind the Coca-Cola counter in "Man with Mouthless Fish" throws an 
eerie imbalance into an already unusual image of two men in a store, one with 
an uneven-eyed stare and the dried fish in hand, held somewhat awkwardly. Then 
there is the photo in which a half-out-of-frame arm has "The Chickenman's Dog" 
firmly by the tail in the back of a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 But the majority of images are hardly carnival-like or bizarre. Imes has a 
comforting feel for portraits, and the ones included here have a close, 
unobtrusive feel to them, as if the subjects, fully-aware of the camera's 
presence, didn't mind being watched but didn't feel like posing, either. "The 
Girl on Catfish Alley" on the cover is typical of his pictures: unromanticized, 
honest and strong. One can immediately understand that his work is beyond only 
regional significance ("Partial to Home" is published as part of the 
Smithsonian's series, Photographers at Work), and that it is through a unique 
place and culture that we learn about ourselves, when the eye is paying 
attention.

 INDIAN CREEK CHRONICLES: A Winter Alone in the Wilderness by Pete Fromm (St. 
Martin's Press: $10.95; 184 pp.). Fromm took a leave from college to guard 2.5 
million salmon eggs in Idaho because the job offered him a chance to live out 
his fantasy of being a 19th-Century mountain man.This expanded journal recounts 
his often painful efforts to hone his skills as an outdoorsman. Subzero weather 
provided valuable lessons in survival tactics, but the days spent alone 
provided more valuable insights into his beliefs about nature. (Four years 
later, he learned that fewer than 20 fish from those 2.5 million eggs returned 
to Indian Creek to spawn.) Also the author of the short-story collection "The 
Tall Uncut," Fromm takes his place among the most promising young writers 
chronicling the changing perceptions and realities of the American West.

 SIMPLE PASSION by Annie Ernaux, translated from the French by Tanya Leslie 
(Ballantine: $8.50; 64 pp.) . A bestseller in France, Annie Ernaux's novella 
explores the emotions of a sophisticated woman involved with a married man. The 
unnamed narrator savors her passion, but never loses sight of its transitory 
nature: "From the very beginning, and throughout the whole of our affair, I had 
the privilege of knowing what we all find out in the end: the man we love is a 
complete stranger." This elegantly Gallic reflection on the nature of love 
suggests an upper-class restatement of Edith Piaf's "No, Je ne regrette rien."

ON THE TOWN: MIND YOUR CIVIC MANNERS; GOOD CITIZENS KNOW THAT PLAYING BY THE 
RULES APPLIES AT ANY AGE 
</P>

 All these months of political campaigning, all the bloviating about little-c 
citizenship, as in illegal immigration . . . but not a word about capital-c 
Citizenship, as in how to be a good one. 
</P>
<P>
 The last I heard it talked about without a smirk was in grade school, 
somewhere between hygiene and music. 
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious why Citizenship isn't in any candidate's position paper: Where's 
the political hay in sermonizing like a Chautauqua orator about the very people 
you want to support you? 
</P>
<P>
 With all those murderers and welfare layabouts out there to chastise, what 
politician wants to sound so crabby and petty as to remind working people, 
middle-class people, to care for their children, vote responsibly, spay and 
neuter their pets, support parks and libraries, conserve water and recycle 
trash, refrain from dumping oil down drains, volunteer for something once in a 
while, keep their music to themselves and signal when they change lanes? 
</P>
<P>
 We know all that already, we would say in offended tones, bristling because 
some politician -- imagine, a politician! -- was telling us we could do better. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizenship is really little more than the conscious practice of civic 
etiquette, the public manners that make the places we live workable when we 
practice them, and unbearable when we don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Autry's commandments for cowboys, someone once told me, were fair play, 
truthfulness, respect for women, parents, animals and old folks, religious and 
racial tolerance, and cleanliness of thought and speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet these sound so sappy, so smug, so middle-class and middle-American that I 
had to solicit a reality check. I got it from some children whose young lives 
are about as different from mine, from Pete Wilson's or Kathleen Brown's, as 
you could find in the same city. 
</P>
<P>
 They are students at Ninth Street school, a Skid Row elementary in Los 
Angeles. Their parents, when they have more than one, are poor; a few are 
drunks or junkies. 
</P>
<P>
 The litter these kids see on their way to school from the hotels where many of 
them live, isn't just fast-food wrappers; it's used needles, used condoms, 
used-up booze bottles. Across the street, transvestite hookers in evening dress 
loiter at 9 in the morning. Some of these children have seen more blood and 
dead bodies by kindergarten than I will see by the time I retire from a 
lifetime in journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked them to tell me what it means to be a good citizen, and here is what 
they wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's when you try hard." -- Gemayal 
</P>
<P>
 "It's belonging to a club." -- Lauren 
</P>
<P>
 "When everybody learns to read." -- Kevin 
</P>
<P>
 "When you pay attention to the teacher and don't act crazy." -- Liscette 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get the buses dirty." -- Daisy 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop taking stuff." -- Linh 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone learns to read, write and work well." -- Virginia 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't pinch other people." -- Alberto 
</P>
<P>
 "Not fighting. Solve problems with words." -- Everth 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes a good citizen is a person who respects the people who surround 
them and also obeys the rules and is friendly to everybody he sees." -- Eric 
</P>
<P>
 "To be a good citizen, you don't have to do things like rob or litter." -- 
Melissa 
</P>
<P>
 "A good citizen is good people who don't run away from the police or do many 
felonies. A good citizen is somebody that helps out and pitches in." -- Paloma 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody falls, you say, 'Are you OK?' and help them up." -- Nancy 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't write on the walls. Don't use guns." -- Andres 
</P>
<P>
 So perhaps the standards, the dreams, don't change as we grow up, only the 
scale. Don't be a bully, try hard, help out, don't break the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Estela says: "Share your toys." She has my vote.

 CRAZY IN ALABAMA by Mark Childress (Ballantine: $11; 383 pp.). In this 
freewheeling novel, 12-year-old Peter Joseph ("Peejoe") watches interracial 
tensions flare into violence over the attempt to integrate the municipal 
swimming pool in the flyspeck town of Industry, Ala., in 1965.Peejoe's 
commitment to social justice grows out of the vicious fight. Childress 
juxtaposes this coming-of-age story with the darkly comic saga of Peejoe's Aunt 
Lucille. A macabre caricature of a '60s housewife, Lucille murders her abusive 
husband and carries his head around in a Tupperware bowl. Her efforts to become 
a Hollywood star prove that it isn't always worth the effort to get ahead. 
Childress' characters are two-dimensional and their escapades improbable, but 
his skill as a yarn-spinner keeps readers from noticing these weaknesses until 
they've finished the book.

 PRAYERS FOR THE DEAD by Dennis Vannatta (White Pine Press: $14; 194 pp., 
paperback original). Dennis Vannatta's stories follow the Workman family from 
1900 through the present day. The son of one of Custer's soldiers, John Workman 
takes his family from their comfortable Pennsylvania home to seek greater 
opportunities in the West. But the vast emptiness of the prairie daunts him, 
and he settles in the tiny hamlet of Sunday's Hollow in Missouri. Workman's 
descendants lead bleak lives, struggling to scratch a living from the scanty 
soil of the Ozarks. Vannatta's spare prose suggests a developing talent, rather 
than a mature one.

 THE LAND OF THE INCAS photographs by Hans Silverstein, text by Jacques 
Soustelle, translated from the French by Jane Breton (Thames & Hudson: $19.95; 
unpaginated). Soustelle's brief text traces the later history of the Inca 
empire, noting that Pizarro's conquest was facilitated by a murderous civil 
war. Silverstein's glorious photographs show life continuing in the shadows of 
monolithic ruins devoid of the exuberant decorations of Meso-American art. The 
often handsome faces of the people reveal the toll the high altitudes exact.

 THE MATERIAL CHILD: Coming of Age in Japan and America by Merry White 
(University of California Press: $12; 273 pp., illustrated). White argues that 
the image of teen-agers as a group with a distinct identity was created by 
advertisers and marketing groups in America and Japan.Teens in both countries 
are seen as materialistic, trend-conscious and rebellious. But Japanese youths 
rebel within carefully circumscribed limits: The girl with pink streaks in her 
hair dancing in a park on Sunday will wash the dye out of her hair and appear 
at school in a faultless uniform on Monday. White contrasts the strengths and 
shortcomings of the two cultures, stressing the ways in which children are 
perceived by their elders: "Being a teen in America today, according to popular 
belief, means being at risk: in Japan it means, most people imagine, being at 
promise."

 A RIVER SUTRA by Gita Mehta (Vintage: $11; 291 pp.). The Narmada River in 
central India is said to flow past 400 billion sacred places; the narrator of 
this sensual novel is a former bureaucrat from Bombay who has retired to an old 
hostel on its upper reaches.His bungalow becomes a place for travelers to 
recount their tales: A fiery martial artist-ascetic recants his renunciation of 
the world to care for his adopted daughter; an Englishman seeks to exorcise the 
passionate female demon that has possessed him; the son of a fabulously wealthy 
diamond merchant gives up his worldly goods to become a mendicant pilgrim. 
Mehta examines love in India's diverse cultures as her characters' stories 
blend like the streams that flow into the holy Narmada.

<TEXT>
<P>
 We were looking for a real motorcycle shop but all we found were places with 
$150 Harley beer mugs and "Hog" boxer shorts. Then we heard about a guy known 
as the Motorcycle Michelangelo, Billy Westbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 Westbrook was only 12 when a group of Harley riders, spying his little low 
rainbow-colored psychedelic bicycle, dared him to "chop" their bikes. The kid 
customizer painted them black, detailed their frames, and a career was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 38, Westbrook owns North Hollywood-based Westbrook Originals, where he 
turns Harley stock into one-of-a-kind classics with an innovative sculptural 
look. Unlike some Harley customizers who merely bolt on ready-made aftermarket 
equipment, Westbrook rebuilds or redesigns everything on the bike, from seats 
to wheels to handlebars. In his one-man shop, he fabricates new fenders and 
tanks, changes the front end, paints the bike and ties it all together with 
hand-welded Art Deco covers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a fast, low, stripped-down, big-motor hot rod! I don't make Christmas 
trees with stuff all over em," he says. "My bikes turn you on, to look at and 
to ride, not just now, but 10, 15 years from now, like Ray Charles or Patsy 
Cline -- stuff that lasts." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in the country, including Harley, takes note of what he does," says 
show-car painter Kit Reidel. "He's cutting edge. He makes timeless art pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 With Hollywood burning with Harley fever, Westbrook naturally has his share of 
star clients, including, James Caan, Mickey Rourke and Sly Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's not impressed by celebrities; he much rather work for someone who's 
going to take care of the bike. "This one actor left his just-painted bike out 
in the rain while he went on location and it ended up a pile of junk. It wasn't 
worth it! It was just money! So let him go to the Harley shop and get a 
bolt-on!" 
</P>
<P>
 And he's still not rich, partly because aftermarket motorcycle suppliers have 
made copies of his designs. "There's an art to making money and there's a 
talent for doing this. I want to be big time. And if I can't? I'll just keep 
making bikes." Judy Raphael

PALM LATITUDES: THE BIZ; SCORING BIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Dan Slider wanted to compose the score for the independent production "Russian 
Holiday" and the director wanted him to do it. There was just one problem: 
Whoever got the job would have to conduct the 70-piece Kirov Ballet Orchestra, 
and director Greydon Clark needed to be convinced that Slider wouldn't choke. 
</P>
<P>
 So Slider, who'd done plenty of TV work (including the main theme for 
"America's Funniest Home Videos"), wrote some sample themes and took them to 
the Los Angeles Composer's Guild, a 3-year-old organization that puts together 
a full orchestra so its 180 members can record audition and demo tapes. Next 
thing he knew, he was heading to St. Petersburg. "The director wasn't sure I 
could handle it, but now all of a sudden I'm telling him, 'Look, this is what I 
did. I stood at the podium and conducted an orchestra! I can do it for you!' 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can get a live orchestral demo rather than a synthesized version of 
your score, you already have an edge with producers," says guild founder and 
director Gloria Ching, who's now scoring her first feature film, "So Love 
Returns," for Matovich Productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice monthly, Ching books a 60-piece orchestra of top studio musicioans 
players who regularly play for film and TV, and guild members can buy half-hour 
time slots for the orchestra to play. Such orchestra sharing allowed Bahman 
Saless, a UCLA film-scoring student to net work on one of the trailers for 
"Carlito's Way." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not just novices that are taking advantage of the Ching's plan. 
Veteran TV composer David Bell ("Murder She Wrote," "In the Heat of the Night") 
recorded three one-minute sample themes for a TV Western, one of which became 
the theme for last year's CBS Western "Ned Blessing." His cost: $1,200 as 
compared to $22,000 for a full-scale union recording session. "Getting an 
orchestra together is such an overwhelming task," says Bell, "But it's 
impossible to learn to compose unless you can hear your work, and there's no 
other way to do it than with players. This is what composers dream about." Judy 
Raphael

PALM LATITUDES: WILD THINGS; SEE YOU LATER, ALLIGATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For 26 years, they waged a war of epic proportions, doing battle all over Los 
Angeles County, spending more than $2 million in weaponry and leaving piles of 
the dead and dying in their wake. At one point, just a few years ago, it seemed 
there was no end in sight, but then the tide turned and this summer, the County 
Agriculture Commissioner's Noxious Weeds and Vertebrate Pests division declared 
victory. The war against the mighty alligator weed was won. 
</P>
<P>
 The weed, which once choked the waterways and plant life on almost 6,000 acres 
now troubles less than a fourth of one acre -- a victory that allowed the 
county to turn over the problem to the state last July. 
</P>
<P>
 But the alligator weed, native to South America, was just one of a legion of 
enemies facing the 15-person division, which is devoted to controlling pests, 
from the warm and fuzzy (squirrels and gophers) to the truly strange (the 
African clawed frog and the walking catfish.) 
</P>
<P>
 It's not always an easy job -- while no one loses any sleep over the death of 
a rat or even a clawed frog, squirrels and gophers are another thing. "People 
think they're cute and don't like to poison them," says division chief Richard 
Wightman, "but they're a problem because they make lots of burrows and that 
affects the stability of the soil, particularly on hillsides." 
</P>
<P>
 Squirrel and other rodents also carry fleas that can transmit diseases such as 
typhoid and rabies. "We're out trying to protect the public's health," he says 
in answer to protestations by Chip and Dale fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle against pests such as African clawed frog and the walking catfish 
doesn't require quite as much spin doctoring. Both are fairly unattractive 
creatures that feed on young fish in local ponds -- the latter's name describes 
the fact that it use its fins to slide itself from one body of water to 
another. "It's not exactly going to hitchhike down the freeway," Wightman 
explains, "but it can get up and move to another pnd if one is too dry." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that's one less worry for Caltrans. Sondra Farrell

OUTSIDER ON THE INSIDE; A ROLLING STONE EDITOR MELDS HIS FAMILY'S IMMIGRANT 
HISTORY WITH A MEMOIR OF THE 1960S; THE RICE ROOM: GROWING UP CHINESE-AMERICAN 
FROM NUMBER TWO SON TO ROCK 'N' ROLL, BY BEN FONG-TORRES (HYPERION: $22.95; 260 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Wong Louie, David Wong Louie is the author of Pangs of Love and 
teaches at UCLA in the English department and at the Asian American Studies 
Center. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The eponymous "rice room" in Ben Fong-Torres' memoir is a storage area in his 
father's 1945 Oakland Chinatown restaurant. It doubles as a "home away from 
home" for young Ben and his siblings while the grown-ups work. Here the 
children nap, study, and listen to radio shows among shelves laden with "jars 
of fermented bean cakes and tins of salted fish." 
</P>
<P>
 In constructing his life, Fong-Torres, a former editor at Rolling Stone, 
introduces himself with this image. The rice room, he seems to say, is where 
his life begins; it is the metaphorical womb. His genetic makeup consists of 
weird Chinese food, foreign words, the "mysterious" kitchen, the "big Chinese 
cleaver"-wielding father, and a Mitchell table radio with its sane, familiar 
dramas. 
</P>
<P>
 The author's intentions are spelled out in the subtitle, "Growing Up 
Chinese-American -- From Number Two Son to Rock 'n' Roll." The hyphen that 
separates Chinese and American suggests the notion of a dual identity, a split 
personality with distinct Chinese and American halves. This is the memoir's 
thematic arc -- Fong-Torres' evolution away "from" his Chinese half (the echoes 
of Charlie Chan's Number One Son are obvious and unfortunate; why evoke and 
claim that racist stereotype?) to his Rolling Stone American self. 
</P>
<P>
 By second-generation Chinese American standards, especially in the '40s and 
'50s, his is not a particularly unique experience. But since his intention here 
is to relate his triumphant journey from immigrant ghetto to pop mainstream, he 
aggressively asserts his difference, making his eventual assimilation that much 
more impressive. From the beginning he drives home the message that his was not 
a normal childhood: his parents work in Chinese restaurants; his father cooks 
Chinese food; the family eats Chinese food; they live in Chinatown; they speak 
a strange language. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Fong-Torres writes his life as if his material were as foreign 
to him as it is meant to be for his readers. All too often he is an alien 
observer of his world. When he introduces the rice room, he does so as a tour 
guide, directing us through a bank where his father's restaurant once stood. 
The mundane becomes exoticized for non-Chinese eyes. For instance, barbecued 
pork, commonplace in his restaurant days, is "glowing bright red, with black at 
the tips," "magical," "succulent, sweet." He does the same with the Chinese 
spoken at home, littering his prose with romanizations of Cantonese, followed 
by translations into English; while this technique initially imparts a taste of 
the bilingual household, he does this to such excess that the language seems 
like a prop, linguistic paper lanterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the book's best moments are recountings of how his parents came to 
America. Especially rewarding is the section on the origins of their wonderful 
surname: While in the Philippines (at that time a U.S. possession), his father 
buys the birth certificate of "Ricardo Torres," a necessary step, since 
anti-Chinese exclusion laws of the time prohibited immigration of Chinese 
laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fong-Torres adopts a troubling attitude, calling his family "connivers" 
and "outlaws." What peculiar and problematic diction! After all, was it not 
this country's exclusion laws that necessitated the use of a paper name? 
Dropping his tour-guide posture, he might have interpreted his parents more 
sympathetically, not as criminals, but as resourceful, determined, heroic. 
</P>
<P>
 Another example of the author as alien observer of his life is his sketchy yet 
still laborious accounts of Chinese and Chinese American history. Their purpose 
is to further prove his difference, but Fong-Torres' renditions sound lifted 
from textbooks. None of the historical facts feel internalized by the author; 
he seems to have come upon these histories and claimed them, in the same way 
his dad claimed the Torres name. 
</P>
<P>
 In college Fong-Torres begins his long association with Rolling Stone, first 
as writer, then as editor. He suddenly enters the pop-culture mainstream, but 
his being a "Chinese-American" is neither a help nor a hindrance. Jann Wenner 
hires him because he is good at what he does: He's a lifelong "print junkie" 
who stole comics and Mad magazine, produced his own homemade publications, 
wrote for the college newspaper. The impact of the preceding 150 pages of 
"Chinese-American" material has no apparent bearing on how he gets to the 
magazine or how he does his job there. 
</P>
<P>
 We read memoirs because they promise an insider's perspective on famous times, 
events, and people. They are like a film that purports to be "based on a true 
story" -- regardless of the film's merits, we stay with it, drawn to the truth. 
Fong-Torres certainly knows famous times: His coming of age, professionally and 
sexually, coincides with the 1960s; he ducks the draft, reports on peace 
protests in Berkeley and the hippie scene in San Francisco, experiments with 
drugs and free love. He signs on with Rolling Stone (it was almost called the 
Electric Newspaper, we learn), deejays at FM stations, parties with Hunter 
Thompson, interviews just about every rock band that ever stepped on the 
Fillmore stage. And he knows famous people. Grace Slick, Steve Martin and Janis 
Joplin, among others, make cameo appearances; scores of names are dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 A wealth of material, indeed! Fong-Torres is in the thick of things. The '60s 
section is easily the memoir's highlight. But he leaves this reader wanting 
more. While he captures the excitement, the sense of expectancy, the frenetic 
mutability of the times, Fong-Torres skimps on details. Too much space has been 
devoted to the "Chinese-American" Ben, too little is left for the "print 
junkie." So we are teased by his ubiquitous name dropping, but there are no 
gossipy tidbits, no insights, just a bunch of names; Fong-Torres reveals 
nothing about these rock stars, and his encounters with them reveal nothing 
about him. Instead we get Ray Charles for a page and learn he is egotistical 
and wears beaded Chinese slippers; we learn that songwriter Dino Valente is 
served tea and pie by "three -- three! -- beautiful chicks." This is as close 
as we get to the rock 'n' rollers. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as he is at the center of events though, he is never a central figure 
in them; he seems strangely detached. His is the journalist's gaze, reporting 
on situations as an outsider rather than as a participant. The reportorial "I" 
never quite emerges as a character, an actor in this story. 
</P>
<P>
 This book is filled with potentially moving material. But the pity is 
Fong-Torres's strategy to tell all, rather than to focus on and develop certain 
aspects of his story. Sometimes the book reads as if the author has decided to 
include everything he can remember, as if his memory were the rice room, and he 
was taking inventory.

THE DOCTOR IS ALL EARS; CONFIDING: A PSYCHOTHERAPIST AND HER PATIENTS SEARCH 
FOR STORIES TO LIVE BY, BY SUSAN BAUR (HARPERCOLLINS: $23; 304 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Erika Taylor, Erika Taylor is the author of The Sun Maiden (Atheneum). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was walking my dog a few evenings ago when, across the street, an overweight 
blond woman with about an inch of dark roots began yelling at a shirtless, 
scraggle-bearded man: "Stop lying to me!" She dropped her purse on the 
sidewalk, sobbing. The man said something I couldn't understand, then grabbed 
her shoulders. "Let go!" The woman continued to scream at him, completely 
hysterical, until the man threw both hands theatrically into the air, then 
turned and walked away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm laughing now," he said as he went by me. "Ha-Ha-Ha." 
</P>
<P>
 Dark-roots Woman faced the small group of people who stood staring at the 
scene -- mostly Russian kids and their protective grandparents. "I can't 
believe none of you helped me." Her voice was filled with terrible anguish. 
"You people." 
</P>
<P>
 And that was the moment when I began to understand "Confiding," Susan Baur's 
brilliant and passionate examination of how the stories we tell about ourselves 
shape our lives. Baur, a therapist who works with severely mentally ill people, 
believes that stories "not only state that this and that happened to me, but 
also that I'm a certain kind of person. I am one who characteristically copes 
or suffers or goes to sleep. Taken together, the anecdotes about my daily 
doings that I share with friends or simply tell myself give me an identity as 
well as an itinerary." 
</P>
<P>
 Dark-roots Woman is a shining example of Baur's ideas. One could actually see 
her entering the story she would likely tell to others, a story of being alone 
and vulnerable in a hostile world. People had watched her get brutalized and 
had done nothing. She had been betrayed her. Yet, in reality, or my reality 
anyway, the whole episode was over in a few seconds, and the man, while 
certainly an aggressive jerk, didn't seem in those moments to be dangerous. In 
addition, with the exception of myself, the entire group of people who, in her 
eyes, had coldly refused to help, were children and elderly Russian immigrants 
who had limited English. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories we tell, Baur says, are structured around our sense of self and 
the world. It is one of the jobs of therapy to open our stories, to deepen and 
enrich them, and in the process, open our world as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Baur's thoughts are interesting, but hardly new. The qualities that make 
"Confiding" so effective come largely from her unconventional approach to 
therapy and from the beauty of the writing itself. Chapters alternate between 
case-studies of people she has seen in therapy and explorations of various 
types of mental illness. Baur manages to keep one foot in clinical description, 
an elbow in philosophy, an ear in fiction and an eye toward spirituality, while 
consistently coming through with plain old good stories. Her case studies, 
instead of reducing people to a diagnosis in a goldfish bowl, are full of 
vivid, urgent life. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Mr. Bartlett, a 50-year old man whose uncontrollable delusions are 
like a humid jungle growing over his entire existence. At the end of an 
exquisitely written chapter, full of humor and empathy, Baur says of her 
sessions with him: "We both understand that Mr. Bartlett's mind does not work 
as it is supposed to, and also that Mr. Barlett has walked too far with Bobby 
Two-Ton Eagle and the others to leave them now. To admit that all the people he 
has ever loved are delusional . . . is to label his entire past insane and his 
entire future hopeless. Both of us are willing to let the heartbreak take its 
time in coming." 
</P>
<P>
 In the only section dealing with a non-client, we meet senior therapist Ned 
Bennett, Baur's supervisor at the Rhode Island clinic where she did graduate 
work. Dying slowly of diabetes, Ned was loved almost to the point of worship by 
everyone who knew him. He was brave, loyal and kind, and he had the gift of 
making people feel that they and they alone shared a special understanding with 
him. As Ned's health worsened, he began to confide in Baur -- his abusive 
childhood, terrible prognosis, pain and fear. Their relationship became even 
closer. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning when Ned was gravely ill, Baur accidentally discovered that much 
of what he'd been telling her were huge lies. When she confronted him, Ned 
attacked, making a cruel, throw-away comment so unlike the bighearted person he 
appeared to be, that just reading it gives an almost physical sensation of 
shock and loss. The following chapter, "On Lying and Believing," is among the 
best in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Baur is exploring manic-depression, schizophrenia, pathological lying 
or family dynamics, she is unfailingly generous to the clients in all their 
quirks and contradictions (of course identities are changed). In a chapter 
titled, "The Tyrannical Nature of Explanations," she contends that most of us 
draw ironclad conclusions about life and then edit out any information that 
conflicts with our belief system. This is damaging in particular to the 
mentally ill, Baur continues, because doctors will ignore whatever doesn't seem 
pertinent to their diagnosis. This almost guarantees that no important, 
personal connections will be forged between doctor and client, and even more 
significantly, no one will really grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, as a therapist, Baur advocates something she calls, "dangerous 
listening." "When a therapist agrees to do the slow and careful work needed to 
modify the plot of a life, then such a clinician must sink into that life. . . 
. Dangerous listening wholeheartedly accepts the emotions expressed . . . but 
declines to be drowned in what appears to the client to be the unalterable 
facts of the matter, be they 'facts' about the CIA, . . . or about how life 
must be lived with an alcoholic spouse. In other words, dangerous listening 
involves both client and therapist. . . . Both are shaken and changed . . . and 
for the schizophrenics or manics telling their stories, this dangerous 
listening finally provides an opportunity to maintain their inherent 
differences and find common ground with members of the dominant culture." 
</P>
<P>
 "Confiding" is a difficult book. It demands not only concentration but also a 
willingness to examine one's own ideas about mental illness, emotional pain, 
and stories. Perhaps if the world were full of dangerous listeners, Dark-roots 
Woman would stand a better chance of finding someone truly to hear her, someone 
who would experience her story without squashing it with their own systems and 
symbols. Someone who would help to change the plot of her life.

VIEW FROM BEHIND THE CAMERA; AN AFFECTIONATE BIOGRAPHY MARKS THE CENTENNIAL OF 
JEAN RENOIR'S BIRTH; JEAN RENOIR: PROJECTIONS OF PARADISE, BY RONALD BERGAN

<P>
 With his profound insight into human nature and equal warmth and compassion, 
Jean Renoir could be as powerful a presence as his film masterpieces, "Grand 
Illusion" and "The Rules of the Game." For decades he and his Brazilian-born 
second wife, Dido, lived in a spacious, sun-filled house overlooking Beverly 
Hills, where they loved to entertain friends with good food and good 
conversation and sometimes screen one of Renoir's films after dinner. Renoir 
was as bulky and pale as Dido was slight and dark, but they made a wonderful, 
devoted couple. 
</P>
<P>
 For those of us lucky enough to have enjoyed such evenings chez Renoir, Ronald 
Bergan's "Jean Renoir: Projections of Paradise," scheduled to be published to 
coincide with the centennial of Renoir's birth, Sept. 15, 1894, brings back 
fond memories -- and offers much, much more. Indeed, Bergan's book seems the 
ideal Renoir biography -- easy, graceful and unpretentious as it goes about 
telling us about Renoir's long, rich life and career. Bergan pauses for 
judicious and incisive critiques of each of Renoir's films, illuminating 
Renoir's key concerns with love and friendship and the cruel absurdity of war, 
that enrich rather than interrupt the book's steady narrative flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Montmartre in Paris to the great painter Auguste Renoir, Jean Renoir 
had, according to Bergan, an idyllic childhood, much of spent it amid the rural 
landscapes his father loved to paint. His mother died early on but her cousin 
Gabrielle, only 15 years older than Renoir, became a model for Auguste and a 
surrogate mother for Jean and his two brothers, one of whom grew up to be actor 
Pierre Renoir, a major presence on Paris stages as well as on the screen. When 
Gabrielle died in 1959 she was living next door to the Renoirs in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many cozy relations detailed in this biography. In 1927 the 
Brazilian-born director Alberto Cavalcanti made three films with Renoir's first 
wife, actress Catherine Hessling. One of them was the 10-minute "La P'tite 
Lili," based on a popular song. Renoir appeared in it, along with his and 
Hessling's son Alain, then a small boy. So did the 18-year-old daughter of a 
friend of Cavalcanti's named Dido Freire, who would marry Renoir 14 years 
later. But before marrying Dido, Renoir had a 10-year-long relationship with 
the woman who edited "La P'tite Lili" -- and who became his editor, Marguerite 
Houlle, who later took the name Renoir. She and Renoir never married, but he 
once remarked graciously, "She was kind enough to take my name." 
</P>
<P>
 From Bergan we learn that Renoir, who had been a ceramist, really turned to 
directing to satisfy Hessling's never-to-be-fulfilled cravings to be a star. 
The reason why Renoir ended up with so few of his father's priceless paintings 
was that he sold them to support Hessling's lavish life-style and to finance 
her dreams. Bergan suggests that by the time Renoir made the film that might 
have made her a star -- "La Chienne" (1931) -- they had at last broken up. 
This, he feels, paradoxically was necessary if Renoir was to become a true 
artist himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The social consciousness which Auguste Renoir had instilled in his son came to 
flower in the darkening 1930s, and resulted in various major films, culminating 
his two prophetic masterpieces, the anti-war classic, "Grand Illusion," and 
"The Rules of the Game," in which Renoir perceived that the old order was about 
to fall. He left France for Lisbon in the fall of 1940 and arrived in the U.S. 
in Feb., 1941, at the invitation of pioneer documentarian Robert Flaherty. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, the biography becomes poignant when the director, who had never 
been big at the box office and was considered an outright failure until he was 
past 40, takes up his Hollywood exile, where he valiantly struggles to 
accommodate his artistic vision to the demands of the studio system. He 
persisted, however, and did make the outstanding 1945 film "The Southerner," 
about the struggles of a farmer to support himself. 
</P>
<P>
 While he retained a residence in Beverly Hills until the end of his life, 
Renoir did revive his career in France after the war (with varying results) and 
became the icon of the New Wave. Like Fritz Lang and Josef Von Sternberg, 
Renoir endured long periods of professional inactivity but never lost his 
interest in films and filmmakers. When Andre Malraux fired Henri Langlois as 
head of the Cinematheque Francaise, Renoir, at 73, led the successful struggle 
for his reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The further things go, the more we have two kinds of cinema," stated Renoir. 
"We have the one that makes a lot of money, and that, shall we say, stupefies 
the public with the most ordinary pap. Then there are the people who try to do 
something that's a little better." There was never any question as to which 
kind of filmmaker Jean Renoir was.

FOCUS; CHICO AND THE LAND; RAIN FOREST ACTIVIST MENDES IS THE SUBJECT OF HBO'S 
'THE BURNING SEASON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps the "B" in HBO should stand for "Biography." During the last few 
years, the cable network has had great success with its award-winning 
biographical films -- "The Josephine Baker Story," "Stalin" and "Citizen Cohn," 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Box Office's latest subject is Brazilian activist Chico Mendes, who was 
murdered in 1988 trying to save the Amazon rain forest from destruction by 
encroaching cattle ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Burning Season," which premieres Saturday, is directed by John 
Frankenheimer ("Seven Days in May") and features a primarily all-Latino cast: 
Raul Julia as Mendes; Edward James Olmos as Rural Worker's leader Wilson 
Pinheiro; Sonia Braga as academician Regina De Carvalho, and Thomas Milan as 
the brutal cattleman Darli Alves. Nigel Havers also stars as British 
documentary maker Steven Kay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Burning Season" was shot earlier this year in the remote Mexican jungle 
town of Compoapan in the state of Veracruz. The town was chosen for its 
similarity to Mendes' home of Xapuri. It was an arduous shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 40 years of doing this I never had anything more difficult," says 
Frankenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very hot," adds Julia. "Up to 107 degrees and sometimes we were 
working indoors without air conditioning, so it got very hot and outside it got 
very hot, too. You had to make an extra effort to keep up your energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Julia, Frankenheimer explains, was the first choice to play Mendes. "I think 
he is just a wonderful actor," he says. "I think he is a compassionate guy. I 
don't see anybody else playing that part." 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for his role, Juila watched documentary footage of Mendes. He also 
met with Andrew Revkin, who wrote the book "The Burning Season," on which the 
film is partially based. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a book of Chico's words, all the things that he said throughout his 
life -- that was helpful, too," Julia says. "Of course, the script (by Ron 
Hutchinson, Michael Tolkin and William Mastrosimone) was well-written and we 
kept working on it all the time to make it more specific." 
</P>
<P>
 While playing Mendes, Julia says, he made a conscious effort not to imitate 
his "outward" look or personality. "I concentrate on the essence," Julia 
explains. "I try to capture the essence of the person -- in Chico's case, his 
commitment, how he was. I don't even know how to put it into words. I just look 
at the person and try to capture something that is wordless. I make it myself. 
I come from myself being in that situation, and being kind of the essential 
person that he was, something that I feel about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very deep commitment to his people and what he believed in, to the 
point of not being able to leave and facing death, which is something he knew 
would certainly come." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankenheimer thought it was "terribly important" to have Olmos play Pinheiro, 
a major influence on Mendes' life, who was gunned down at the union hall in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is such a great actor, and also Wilson Pinheiro is such a charismatic 
guy," Frankenheimer says. "You have to have somebody who is a charismatic 
person playing him." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was glad I was given the opportunity because I think Wilson Pinheiro is a 
very important part of this whole chemistry," Olmos says. "He was the founder 
of the rubber tappers' union. He formulated it, started it and taught Chico how 
to do it. He was a very, very strong and eloquent speaker. He was a much more 
eloquent speaker than Chico was and Chico ended up being a very good speaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankenheimer and Julia, Olmos recalls, called him about participating in the 
film. "They told me it was a minor role, but it was very pivotal to the story. 
I told them all that matters to me is that the piece, the story line itself, be 
worth putting your time into it. I'd play anything from the doorstop to the 
lead, so it doesn't matter. I'm very grateful that they made it and that people 
were willing to invest the amounts of money that they did so this project would 
come to life. I think it's the kind of story that people have to see. Not only 
is it entertaining, it is substantial to our humanness." 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal of this film," Julia says, "is to bring more awareness of the rain 
forest to the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 Revkin, who was on the set for five days, believes the film captures the real 
story. "They are remarkably true to the real elements and what was going on in 
the Amazon in the 44 years of Chico's life," especially the fact that the 
union's struggle "started out as a land-rights issue and that Chico later came 
to this meeting of the minds with the environmentalists." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he's impressed with the cast, Revkin acknowledges he had to put the 
physical appearances of the real people out of his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chico was a rather portly, chunky guy who liked to show off his pot belly," 
Revkin says. "Raul is very thin, but has given an amazing performance. 
Everything about the performance is right on point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Edward Olmos, I think, is incredible as Pinheiro, a very powerful guy who 
didn't give any quarter. The original Pinheiro was like 6 foot 4 and very 
dark-skinned. It's not a good match physically, but a great match in terms of 
performance. As Darli, Thomas Milan, I thought, was really astonishing. It's 
really kind of scary -- he has the same hissing delivery." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Burning Season" premieres Saturday at 8 p.m. on HBO.

CRIMINAL PURSUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's nothing like starting the month with the discovery of a fine new 
voice. It belongs to April Smith, whose North of Montana (Knopf: $23, 293 pp.) 
introduces not only a new author but also a likable new heroine, an unhackneyed 
view of Los Angeles (the Montana is Montana Avenue in Santa Monica) and a story 
that majors in the not-quite-predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a Los Angeles writer-producer from television ("Cagney and Lacey" and 
four TV movies) knows just about all there is to know about pace, the detailing 
that generates atmosphere, and the sensitive observation (or imagination) that 
creates character. 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Grey is a part-Latino, almost-30 FBI agent, tough and plain-spoken, very 
nearly but not wholly monastic in her fierce ambition to get ahead, far ahead, 
in the local bureau. She nabs a bank robber single-handedly early on and is 
carpeted by her sexist boss for not calling for help. Nice guy. 
</P>
<P>
 She's assigned to a case involving an aging sex star (a Liz Taylor clone) who 
is accusing a doctor of turning her on to drugs. The case has curious links to 
the drive-by killing of a Salvadoran woman who may be a cousin Grey didn't know 
she had and whose surviving small children become her responsibility. The dead 
woman was a maid fired by the doctor's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The author's voice is her own, but she recalls Raymond Chandler (and more 
recent chroniclers) in her ability to evoke the city, from the decadent 
splendors of Malibu to the despairs of MacArthur Park in the hours before dawn. 
It is clear she has rubbed egos with temperamental and unlovable stars, but 
then again all her characters, large and small, spring to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot, while intricate, has a sad and logical inevitability. The 
emotionally complicated Ana, burdened by a tragic past, will be fascinating to 
meet again. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald E. Westlake's Baby, Would I Lie? (Mysterious Press: $19.95, 304 pp.) is 
a deliciously nutty sequel to his exploration of a Florida-based supermarket 
tabloid, "Trust Me on This." (Westlake was once assigned to write a documentary 
about the best-known of the scandal sheets; the documentary was in the end not 
filmed, but the research has been a treasure-trove for him.) 
</P>
<P>
 The setting is that unlikely rural show-biz capital, Branson, Mo. (the book's 
subtitle is "A Romance of the Ozarks"), where a country star is going on trial 
for murder. Sara Joslyn, who fled the Weekly Galaxy for Trend, a thoughtful and 
up-market New York magazine, is on hand to give the event the Dominick Dunne 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 A seamy crowd from her alma mater, the Galaxy, is on hand as well, buying 
witnesses and planting bugs right and left, wooing a prosecuting attorney by 
pretending to represent the Economist, leaving no dirty trick untried. The 
present journalistic feeding frenzy surrounding the Simpson case is a 
novelist's dream of perfect timing. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer's big hit (Westlake supplies several brilliant lyrics) is "If It 
Ain't Fried, It Ain't Food" and I can't imagine why nobody else got there 
first. Another of his hits is "Baby, Would I Lie?" The book of the same name is 
the funniest mystery of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In The Body Farm (Scribners: $23; 387 pp.), Patricia Cornwell extends the 
adventures of Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Richmond's medical examiner, currently on 
detached service to lend the FBI some forensic know-how. A child in a remote 
North Carolina hill town has been brutally murdered, possibly by a serial 
killer named Gault, who narrowly eluded Scarpetta once before. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can accuse Cornwell of skimping on illustrative detail. This is 
probably the grisliest of the five Scarpetta novels, including an exhumation. 
The farm of the title is the University of Tennessee's Decay Research Facility, 
which works on cadavers to yield ways of determining times of death with 
ever-greater accuracy -- an important crime-solving tool. 
</P>
<P>
 More than putrefaction is afoot, however. The murder is not quite as it seems; 
Scarpetta's old cop pal Marino is an emotional mess, and Scarpetta's difficult 
niece Lucy is working computers at the FBI's Quantico center, where Scarpetta, 
like Cornwell, spends a lot of time. Lucy, seduced and betrayed by another 
woman, provides a peculiarly affecting subplot to the search for the 
child-killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy's woes suggest that Cornwell is airing some of her own feelings about the 
difficulties of being a strong woman in a man's world. Her few lovers, 
Scarpetta muses, had been formidable but sensitive men, who could accept that 
"I was the body and sensibilities of a woman with the power and drive of a 
man." None of the new breed of women sleuths have said it more succinctly. 
</P>
<P>
 The new book is not least an anthem to the FBI, which Cornwell indicates has 
come a far piece from J. Edgar Hoover. For all its gamy images, Cornwell again 
makes forensics engrossing if occasionally bewildering. "If she drowned," 
Scarpetta says crisply, "there should be edema fluid in the alveolar spaces 
with disproportionate autolytic change of the respiratory epithelium." The same 
thought occurred to me. 
</P>
<P>
 But at last the piling up of microscopic facts, and the Holmesian deductions 
they trigger, help build uncommon suspense and tension. Cornwell knows her 
stuff, alveolar spaces but the soul as well, and how to make a story. The 
ending leaves a mystery solved, but threads remain that will lead to another 
novel, I'm sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Horses (Putnam: $22.95; 319 pp.) is by my count the 33rd Dick Francis 
novel. Amazingly, after so long a run, Francis has produced one of his best in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 His protagonist this time is a filmmaker, and Francis captures his milieu with 
the assurance of a man who has spent a lot of time on the set. The cast rings 
true, from the wizard cinematographer to the writer whining that his script has 
been eviscerated and the producer trying to placate the writer, the locals and 
the brass back in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, since we are in Francis country, the English director used to be a 
jockey until he grew too large even for steeplechasing, and got into film as a 
wrangler on an American location. Now he's back in Newmarket, filming a drama 
based on a best-selling novel, which was a thinly disguised retelling of a 
famous unsolved death, the suspicious suicide of a prominent trainer's wife a 
few years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Past and present collide during the filming, of course, and the director gets 
to jump a few fences (exciting as always), to escape attempts on his life and 
generally uphold the Francis tradition of high action in credible settings. 
</P>
<P>
 I called Rebecca Rothenberg's debut novel "The Bulrush Murders" one of the 10 
best novels of 1992. Her heroine, Claire Sharples, a government botanist 
working among the agribusinesses in the San Joaquin Valley, is back in The 
Dandelion Murders (Mysterious Press: $18.95; 304 pp.). 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the unusual nature of the work and the evocation of the valley and 
its people are the strengths of an offbeat novel. The mystery this time centers 
on the unexplainable drownings, in irrigation ditches, of two (possibly more) 
farm workers and a free-lance journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Pesticide poisonings? Could be, but there's more, and Claire is quickly into 
it and into danger. She's also hung up in a love affair with a co-worker who 
can't quite get over his ex-wife and children and is whipsawed between the 
women. The pesticides are more interesting, which is to say a good book works 
away from its own virtues. 
</P>
<P>
 Dianne G. Pugh's "Cold Call" was also an exemplary debut novel a couple of 
years ago. It introduced Iris Thorne, a Los Angeles investment counselor (as 
the author is). Thorne is back again in Slow Squeeze (Pocket Books: $20; 312 
pp.), confronting a hyper-zaftig and florid Southern lady with oodles of money 
to invest. The unveiling of Barbie Stringfellow is a superior piece of 
storytelling. Paralleling it is a portrait of a young Chicano in the office who 
is certain his heritage is against him but who is determined to make it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorne is the target this time, possibly because of the half-million she has 
in a safe-deposit box, left over from "Cold Call." Pugh has a raucous sense of 
humor, a satiric eye and an assured way with construction. 
</P>
<P>
 H.R.F. (Harry) Keating wrote the first several of his mysteries starring 
Inspector Ghote of the Bombay police before he'd actually ever been to Bombay, 
relying heavily on information from the India Tourist Office (and getting 
caught out only once, on a minor matter of a train schedule). Ghote makes his 
20th appearance in Cheating Death (Mysterious Press: $18.95; 176 pp.). 
</P>
<P>
 A student appears to have attempted suicide after stealing an exam paper and 
selling it to those due to take the exam. But appearances are deceiving (else 
the whole mystery field would turn to dust overnight), and attempted murder is 
more like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghote adrift amid the posturings and pretensions and sly ambitions of academe 
lets himself appear even more foolish than usual. But he deals shrewdly with 
rebellious students who imagine they can outwit him, and (not quite as quickly 
as the reader) untangles the mystery.

PREVIEW '94; DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN TV EVOLUTION; AN AUTUMN THEME: DADDYS 
WHOSE LITTLE GIRLS ARE GROWN-UP ACHIEVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER GLIMPSE, Jennifer Glimpse is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer.

<P>
 Fathers and daughters have been a staple of American television for years. 
Father didn't know best for just Bud, after all. He had it pretty well figured 
out for Princess and Kitten, too. But this fall, prime-time television is 
putting a contemporary spin on the father-daughter relationship: "Daddy's 
little girl" has grown up and come into her own. In three new series, fathers 
and their adult daughters find themselves in the same profession, sometimes 
working in accord, sometimes sharply at odds and frequently blurring the line 
between their personal and professional lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In the CBS comedy "Daddy's Girls," Dudley Moore stars as a father of three 
daughters who is recently deserted by both his wife and his business partner 
(who absconded together no less). As Dudley tries to put the pieces back 
together at home, middle daughter Samantha (Meredith Scott Lynn) comes to the 
rescue at his high-end women's clothing design studio and factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Meg Buckner (Cynthia Gibb) finds herself the boss of her father Jack (Dabney 
Coleman) when she becomes publisher of Your Times magazine in the NBC comedy 
"Madman of the People." Jack, a malcontent columnist who has bucked authority 
all his life, is simultaneously proud of and rankled by his daughter's new 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the NBC drama "Sweet Justice," Wall Street lawyer Kate Delacroy 
(Melissa Gilbert), collides head-on with her father, attorney James-Lee 
Delacroy (Ronny Cox), when she comes home to the South and joins the socially 
conscious unconventional firm of her father's archrival. 
</P>
<P>
 If television reflects reality, this new trend isn't surprising. Women now 
comprise more than 45% of the civilian work force and are entering the 
professions in increasingly greater numbers. A U.S. Department of Education 
survey for 1993 reported that women constituted 45% of law and 35% of business 
school students. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Carlfred Broderick, professor of sociology and director of marriage and 
family therapy training at USC, says these shows are in fact dramatizing what's 
happening in contemporary American society. "This is the first generation where 
middle-class daughters are achievers in the professional world. There have 
always been some, but this is truly now the thing that you want for your 
daughter. You want her to be an achiever and you're proud of her if she's an 
achiever rather than resentful, or thinking that she's not womanly." 
</P>
<P>
 While the creators of the new series say they weren't making a conscious 
social comment when they developed their shows, they do believe their 
television worlds reflect the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Zeitgeist is a very mysterious thing -- why a particular topic or 
relationship surfaces on several fronts at once," says "Sweet Justice" 
creator-executive producer John Romano. "I didn't go in looking for 
father-daughter, but yes, as I began to write it, I think I was feeling the 
same cultural interest as everybody else." 
</P>

 Romano says his interest in exploring the father-daughter dynamic was fed by 
his own life experiences. "I have two daughters -- 12 and 15 -- and it's the 
most interesting relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 "Madman of the People" creators-executive producers Chris Cluess and Stuart 
Kreisman were also drawn to the father-daughter subject because of personal 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have two daughters," says Cluess. "One is 10 and one is 6. And Stu is sort 
of their de facto uncle. Watching these kids grow up and being amazed by them 
and being amazed by the way we respond to that ... had a lot to do with my 
interest in (the premise)." 
</P>
<P>
 The parent-child relationships in all three shows are anything but simple. 
Fathers and daughters alike are filled with mixed and complex emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's my boss, but he's my father," says Meredith Scott Lynn of her 
relationship with Dudley Moore's character in "Daddy's Girls." "We have to deal 
with boundaries. That's going to come up for them a lot because they share a 
total work relationship. There's going to be a conflict one day where it's 
business and he's going to treat me like a daddy and it's not going to play." 
</P>
<P>
 In many instances, daughters have garnered their success in part because 
fathers have encouraged them and even served as mentors. "One of the things 
that's interesting, that is happening this generation, is that a lot of fathers 
are really sponsoring their daughters in their achievements," notes USC's 
Broderick. "I don't hear too many fathers anymore just saying, 'Give us 
grandkids.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "(James-Lee) absolutely adores (Kate), but always challenges her to do 
better," says Cox of his father role. "He delights in her company. One of the 
things that he loves to do is argue with her. One of the ways that they 
communicate is by testing 'how much do you know, how good are you at this?' He 
really appreciates and pushes her mind." 
</P>
<P>
 But encouraging a daughter's achievements isn't quite so easy for a father 
when those achievements put him at odds with the apple of his eye, much less 
threaten him professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (Jack) sees that Meg is as high-powered as he, that is somewhat of a 
pleasant thing for him," says Cluess of the father character he helped create 
in "Madman of the People." "But on the other hand, she's high-powered with 
power over him and that really bugs him." 
</P>
<P>
 "(There is a) duality of having this affection and respect for (his daughter), 
but at the same time fighting for his position not only professionally, but 
also socially as a father," says Coleman of his role as Jack. 
</P>
<P>
 For daughters closely bonded with their fathers, managing the conflict that 
arises at work can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack was Meg's "idol growing up and still is to a certain extent," says Gibb. 
"Even though she is a successful woman, an independent woman by her own right, 
she's still Daddy's little girl and she still wants Daddy's approval. She wants 
him to be proud of her and she wants him to support her and approve of what 
she's doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "And yet, he doesn't always and she has to stay firm and stay on course" in 
spite of that, Gibb adds. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how antagonistic their work situations, for all three 
father-daughter pairs, the constant factor is an abiding love. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, "They're always father and daughter," says David Landsberg, who, 
with Brenda Hampton, created and executive produced "Daddy's Girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Meg "is very strong and acts in a very strong way with (Jack) and challenges 
him and has the strength to do that," says Coleman. "But underneath, there's a 
tremendous affection from both sides that comes out sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep getting put in this position of having to deal with opposing 
(James-Lee's) views flat out, publicly," says Gilbert of her daughter role in 
"Sweet Justice." "But the sparring is part of the relationship. It's part of 
what bonds them together. You can always see the very definite love that these 
two people have for one another." 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how differently (his daughter's) life turned out from his own, 
James-Lee Delacroy still would love her, identify his own destiny with hers, 
see a reflection of himself in her," says Romano. "The thing that delights him 
even when his firm is up against her is all this genetic evidence that this is 
really his daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Romano says one of his favorite moments in the pilot episode comes at the end. 
After his firm's client has lost his case to Kate, James-Lee concedes the 
victory. "He was up against a damn good lawyer," says James-Lee to Kate, "a 
Delacroy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Daddy's Girls" premieres Sept. 21 at 8:30 p.m. on CBS; "Madman of the People" 
premieres Sept. 22 at 9:30 p.m. on NBC; "Sweet Justice" premieres Thursday at 
10 p.m. on NBC and moves to Saturdays at 9 p.m. on Sept. 24.

<TEXT>
<P>
 While some networks are exploring parent-child relations, others are exploring 
sibling relations in the absence of parents. 
</P>
<P>
 With remarkably similar premises but distinctly different approaches, a new 
comedy and a new drama explore the perils of orphans surviving parent-less in a 
sometimes hostile world. 
</P>
<P>
 Both ABC's "On Our Own" and Fox's "Party of Five" feature large families of 
children who have lost their parents to fatal accidents. Both families have 
bulldogs. And in both shows, a social service agency is watching over the 
seemingly autonomous kids with a wary eye. 
</P>
<P>
 In the half-hour comedy "On Our Own," Mrs. Doubtfire comes to television. 
Ralph Harris stars as older brother Josh Jerrico and six real-life brothers and 
sisters, the Smolletts, co-star as his younger siblings. When a children's 
service agency threatens to break up the family because they don't have an 
appropriate guardian, a distant aunt miraculously appears. Not surprisingly, 
Aunt Jelcinda, also known as "Mama J.," bears a striking resemblance to oldest 
brother Josh. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Party of Five," a family of children tragically orphaned is given serious 
treatment. While 24-year-old Charlie (Matthew Fox) is the supposed legal 
guardian, it is 16-year-old Bailey (Scott Wolf), dressed as no one but himself, 
who takes responsibility and pulls the family together. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing this series allows us to do is to try and realistically portray 
issues that these kids would face and problems that they need to solve and have 
them solve them in some way that mirrors reality," says Amy Lippman, who 
created and executive produces "Party of Five," along with Chris Keyser. "They 
go to each other or to friends or actually don't solve them the right way for 
awhile. We are not interested in resolving every episode with someone making 
the right choice." 
</P>
<P>
 "Party of Five" airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on Fox; "On Our Own" premieres Tuesday 
at 8:30 p.m. on ABC and moves to Sundays at 7:30 p.m. on Sept. 18. JENNIFER

ON VIEW; AND THE EMMY, MAYBE, GOES TO . . .

By THOMAS O'NEIL, Thomas O'Neil is the author of The Emmys: Star Wars, 
Showdowns and The Supreme Test of TV's Best. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can producer Steven Bochco top himself? That's the big Sunday night question 
when the Emmy Awards unfurl on the stage of Pasadena Civic Auditorium, 
broadcast by ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 Bochco's "NYPD Blue" made Emmy history with its 26 nominations this year, 
breaking his "Hill Street Blues" record of 21 in 1981. The drama will now 
center on whether he can surpass the record set by "Hill Street Blues" for most 
wins in a single year -- eight. 
</P>
<P>
 My prediction: a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to outguess the Emmys is always gutsy, but next to impossible unless 
you just happen to know what episodes were submitted to the judging panels and 
were lucky enough to have caught them all during the past TV season. In the 
leading series categories, that means having to be familiar with up to 30 
segments, since nominees for best comedy and drama submit two shows as examples 
of their best work and actors enter one apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 To atone for the sin of an occasional social life, this TV pundit pooled tapes 
of the top contenders and endured 65 hours of dueling cops and crackheads, 
snide dogs, stricken children and (gasp!) those miniseries. I finally emerged 
-- bug-eyed, breathless and officially brain dead -- with a rare account of 
what Emmy voters actually voted on. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year I scored 7 wins out of 11 categories by pure dumb luck. This year, 
dumbstruck after doing my homework, let's see: DRAMA SERIES 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue's" bandwagon could have crashed smack into the "Picket Fences" of 
Bochco's former "L.A. Law" protege David E. Kelly, but "Picket" (last year's 
champ), in my view, picked a weak episode among its two submissions: "Buried 
Alive," in which Dr. Jill's father gets a traffic ticket and everybody indicts 
everybody else over crimes of the heart. "NYPD Blue" entered its strong pilot 
show and "NYPD Lou," as in Lou the Werewolf. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley might have more hope beating his former mentor next year. ACTOR, DRAMA 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue's" Dennis Franz could have copped this easily by submitting the 
segment in which he falls off the wagon at the Greek wedding. (Memo to Franz: 
Emmy voters are notorious pushovers for episodes on substance abuse. Kirstie 
Alley finally nabbed The Big One for "Cheers" when she battled the bottle in 
her 1991 entry.) But now it's a real shootout. Franz's entry: He busts up his 
son's engagement to a bimbo. Caruso's segment: He chokes up when Franz gets 
shot in the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 15, the day after the judging panels disbanded and eight days before 
he quit the show, Caruso announced he plans to skip the Emmys. It's just as 
well. He'll choke here in a close contest, giving Franz the gold. ACTRESS, 
DRAMA 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's winner, Kathy Baker ("Picket Fences"), will probably win for 
roaring at the world when her son gets shot at school. If there's an upset, 
it'll be by Sela Ward ("Sisters") for roaring when her daughter gets raped and 
assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, it'll be the 14th loss for the queen of prime time, Angela 
Lansbury ("Murder, She Wrote"), who will sadly reign with the queen of daytime, 
Susan Lucci ("All My Children"), as the biggest losers in Emmy history. It's 
now a soap opera in which Angela could be forgiven for plotting the perfect 
murder. COMEDY SERIES 
</P>
<P>
 Remember when "Seinfeld" beat "Cheers" last year, thereby souring the latter's 
chances of topping "The Mary Tyler Moore Show's" record for most Emmys ever? 
(Final score: "MTM": 29, "Cheers": 28) This year, for "Cheers" spinoff 
"Fraiser," revenge will be sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seinfeld's" submissions: TV's most lovable loser, George, saves a whale and 
wins a woman's heart; George tries to reverse his usual pathetic luck by doing 
the opposite of everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fraiser's" entries: the pilot show and Fraiser's wacky bout with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, it's close, but there's a good early omen: "Frasier," in an 
equally tight vote, was just picked best comedy show by the TV Critics Assn. 
ACTOR, COMEDY 
</P>
<P>
 "Fraiser's" Kelsey Grammer has every reason to be starry-eyed. When his 
cantankerous father, the plucky Eddie, the psychic housekeeper and the world's 
rattiest Lounge Boy move in with him in the pilot, this four-time Emmy loser 
gave the kind of apoplectic performance that will finally thrust him into the 
winner's circle. ACTRESS, COMEDY 
</P>
<P>
 Submitted by Roseanne (last year's champ): After spanking son B.J. during a 
tirade, she repents by recalling the physical abuse she suffered as a girl. Her 
tears seem terribly real. 
</P>
<P>
 Entered by three-time victor Candice Bergen "Murphy Brown": She beds down foe 
Scott Bakula and reveals a tough cookie's tender heart. Very close, but we know 
why Roseanne smirks like that. This year, Roseanne has the upper hand. TV MOVIE 
</P>
<P>
 Everything's coming up Emmys this year for "Gypsy," the musical that one 
prominent theater guru has called the greatest in Broadway history. MINISERIES 
</P>
<P>
 A tossup. "Prime Suspect 3" (last year's Part 2 won) vs. Stephen King's "The 
Stand" vs. PBS' "Tales of the City." In a perfect world, it would be heads up 
for "Tales," but, come the apocalypse, expect King to still be standing. ACTOR, 
TV MOVIE/MINISERIES 
</P>
<P>
 Hume Cronyn ("To Dance with the White Dog") vs. Michael Caine ("Stalin") vs. 
Matthew Modine ("And the Band Played On"). Eenie, meenie, minie ... Cronyn 
takes his third Emmy in a squeaker. ACTRESS, TV MOVIE/MINISERIES 
</P>
<P>
 Midler's "Gypsy" is such a sure Bette that the Divine One will open the 
Emmycast with a showstopper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 46th Annual Prime Time Emmy Awards" airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on ABC.

CRYING JACK BENNY TEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS O'NEIL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Most people cry when they win an Emmy," Jack Benny once said. "I cry when I 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Benny, it turned out, shed tears only twice -- in 1955 and again in 1956 -- 
before he finally picked up an Emmy Award for being voted TV's best comedian of 
1957. Not all of the small screen's biggest stars, however, have been so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Emmy winners are announced Sunday, one of the most popular performers 
in prime time may face the saddest fate of her TV career. Thirteen-time past 
loser Angela Lansbury is competing for best drama series actress for a 10th 
time for "Murder, She Wrote." If her latest bid fails, the star recently 
acclaimed the most loved person in television by one national magazine will 
officially become the one least loved by the voters of TV's highest honor. 
Lansbury, a four-time Tony champ, would then tie Susan Lucci of "All My 
Children" as the biggest loser in Emmy history. 
</P>
<P>
 The award's past is replete with such cruel ironies. Consider the fate of TV's 
"Great One," Jackie Gleason, who is also among the Emmy unannointed. His 
co-star, Art Carney, won five for "The Honeymooners", however, and, out of 
deference to his co-star's sore ego, kept them all in a closet during Gleason's 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, the same win-lose ratio applies to a similar comedic combo. Andy 
Griffith never won an Emmy, but supporting star Don Knotts took home five gold 
statuettes for "The Andy Griffith Show" -- and displayed them proudly in his 
den. 
</P>
<P>
 Variety show kingpin Ed Sullivan never won an Emmy either, which is especially 
surprising since he was once president of the TV academy, which bestows the 
award. Like Gleason, he did not suffer the slight well and was eventually 
placated by being given an honorary Trustees Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmys also have failed to go to such past TV titans as Desi Arnaz, Gracie 
Allen, Judy Garland and Dave Garroway. Other stars, by contrast, have been 
richly rewarded: Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner are tied for having the most 
Emmy Awards among actors: seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the Emmy is breeding a whole new contemporary crop of losers. 
"Roseanne's" John Goodman faces his sixth attempt at victory tonight. Eileen 
Heckart, up for a guest appearance on "Love & War," makes her seventh try. 
Faith Ford, who plays Corky Sherwood on "Murphy Brown," is up for a fifth time. 
</P>
<P>
 If all three stars lose again, they shouldn't shed too many Jack Benny tears, 
considering the undeserved insults leveled by other show-biz awards. The Oscars 
never gave any credit to Richard Burton, Cary Grant or Peter O'Toole. Diana 
Ross, the Rolling Stones and even Bing Crosby never grabbed a Grammy and some 
of Broadway's brightest stars, such as Lynn Fontanne, never took a bow on 
Tony's stage. THOMAS O'NEIL

 El Mariachi (Cinemax Thursday at 4:40 a.m.) is Robert Rodriguez's sly and 
hilarious 1992 comedy starring Carloes Gallardo in the title role. He is an 
itinerant musician who happens into a Mexican border town only to be mistaken 
for a hit man. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabeza de Vaca (KCET Saturday at 9 p.m.) is Nicolas Echeverria's stunning 
anti-imperialist telling of an ill-fated 16th-Century Spanish voyage of 
exploration to Mexico and part of the United States. Juan Diego stars in this 
1990 Mexican film. 
</P>
<P>
 The Exterminating Angel (El Angel Exterminador) (KCET Saturday at 11 p.m.) is 
one of Luis Bunuel's most inspired attacks on bourgeois morality; the guests at 
a swanky dinner party find themselves unable to leave -- ever. Silvia Pinal 
stars. Made in Mexico in 1962.

RUSH AND 'SHE' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We were appalled at the characterization of Rush Limbaugh on the new 
sketch-comedy program "She TV" (ABC). When the character said at the end of his 
segment, "I hate blacks, I hate blacks, I hate blacks," it sickened us. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh has never said that or even implied it in his political opinions.

 If "She TV" is supposed to be "about and for women," why are 11 of the 14 
writers listed male? Perhaps this is the reason so many of its sketches portray 
actresses in various stages of undress. Women viewers crave comedy from a 
female perspective; so far, "She TV" has fallen short. 
</P>
<P>
 Kate Nelson, Van Nuys

 Editor's Note: An ABC publicist for "She TV" reports that there are 13 writers 
on the show, 9 of whom are male.

 In terms of simle, flat-out fright, Steven Spielberg's 1982 Poltergeist (KTLA 
Sunday at 6 p.m.) gives full value. However, it's a case of a 
credibility-defying story weighed down by lavish special effects. Craig T. 
Nelson and JoBeth Williams are a likable couple who move into a nice tract 
house with their kids, only to be confronted with supernatural terrors. 
</P>
<P>
 On stage Robert Harling's Steel Magnolias (CBS Sunday at 8:30 p.m.) was a 
highly effective play about the lives of several women who are all customers of 
a small-town Louisiana beauty parlor. But when it reached the screen in 1989 it 
was crushed by too many stars, several of whom were miscast; however, it did 
manage to launch Julia Roberts' career as the fragile daughter of Sally Field. 
</P>
<P>
 So many movies portray business sharks as unregenerate killjoys that the 
freshest aspect of the 1991 Other People's Money (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is the 
zest with which Danny DeVito plays a Wall Street liquidator. DeVito's character 
zeros in on a feisty Gregory Peck's Rhode Island-based New England Wire & Cable 
Co. Unfortunately, this shark is too much of the '80s to work in the 
recession-ravaged '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Penelope Spheeris' satirical edge helped turn the 1992 Wayne's World 
(NBC Tuesday at 8 p.m.), an extended "Saturday Night Live" skit, into a 1992 
hit. As a couple of high school dudes who broadcast a public-access cable show 
from an Aurora, Ill., basement recreation room, Mike Myers and Dana Carvey are 
hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
 Internal Affairs (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) has an intriguing but unfortunately 
misfired premise: a young cop (Andy Garcia) becomes obsessed with the crooked 
officer (Richard Gere) he's intent on nailing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heist (KCOP Friday at 8 p.m.), a standard-issue 1989 cable movie in which 
ex-con Pierce Brosnan exacts revenge from a double-crossing ex-partner. 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery is just mediocre in Ray Alexander: A Taste for Justice (NBC Friday 
at 9 p.m.), which first aired last May. Louis Gossett Jr. proves a commanding 
reason to keep watching, cast as a hole-in-the-wall restaurateur who does some 
private investigating on the side. James Coburn plays a high-powered attorney 
who wants Gossett's Alexander to meet an unjustly accused client. 
</P>
<P>
 Roland Joffes 1986 The Mission (KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a ponderous, 
pretentious allegory about an 18th-Century Jesuit mission in the Brazilian 
jungle, menaced by greed and politics. Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons star. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen Wolf (ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.), a monstrously unfunny 1985 comedy of 
modern-day lycanthropy, stars Michael J. Fox.

By Rana Kabbani, Rana Kabbani is a writer on Middle East and Muslim affairs. 
Her most recent book is Europe's Myths of Orient: Devise and Rule (Indiana 
University Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Muslim stereotypes in the West grow out of a long historical tradition of 
anxiety about Islam. In the Middle Ages, anti-Islamic polemics were motivated 
not only by the fear that Islam's armies might advance into the heart of 
Europe, but by the concern that its far superior civilization would take over 
the continent. In the 19th Century, portrayals of the Muslims as barbarians 
were motivated by the need to justify Europe's colonial subjugation of their 
lands and exploitation of their resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, even as the Arab-Israeli peace process makes new strides, dirt is again 
being dumped on the Muslims. In both Jean Sasson's "Princesss Sultana's 
Daughters" and Jan Goodwin's "Price of Honor," Islam is portrayed as viscerally 
violent, misogynistic and fanatical. 
</P>
<P>
 Sasson's book is perhaps the most strident. Purporting to be the real life 
saga of a Saudi princess, a granddaughter of King Abd al-Aziz, the father of 
the modern kingdom of Saudi Arabia, it reads like a bad pulp novel, exploiting 
several devices of the genre. The bottom line is this: Sasson is a propagandist 
who makes sensationalist use of hearsay to tell a tale of unmitigated horror -- 
of incarceration, rape, child abuse and sexual mutilation -- in order to launch 
a racial attack on Arabs and smear Islam and Muslims. She speaks in her 
introduction of her "love for the Arab people," but it has a distinctly hollow 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same anti-Islamic tradition is Jan Goodwin's "Price of Honor," a work 
of pop sociology which, in a series of ghastly stories, reviews the condition 
of women in Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and other 
Muslim countries. Her opening tale of an 11-year-old Pakistani child married 
off to a man "so old he has lost all his teeth and shakes all the time" sets 
the tone for the whole work, as do the aphorisms which litter her chapters. One 
of them, billed as an Islamic proverb, runs: "A woman's heaven is under the 
feet of her husband." 
</P>
<P>
 Although apparently in a feminist tradition, books such as these are in effect 
anti-Arab and anti-Muslim political tracts. The device of discrediting Islam by 
discrediting its treatment of women is an old one. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Middle Ages, the argument was that Islam gave women financial 
independence and a say in marriage and divorce: in short, too much freedom -- 
all heresies to Church polemicists of the time who believed that women should 
be their husband's chattels. In the 19th Century, the argument was turned on 
its head: Muslim women were not free enough. Lord Cromer, British viceroy of 
Egypt, championed emancipation for Egyptian women while loathing suffragettes 
in Britain. He was not concerned to give rights to women anywhere, but rather 
to rule Egypt effectively. He thought that by liberating Egyptian women from 
their religious culture he could break the back of the Egyptian nationalist 
movement, which had strong Islamic overtones. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the "imperial torch" has passed to American feminists. They are the 
only ones talking the "imperial" language of advocating the rescue of Muslim 
women from Islam. They have assumed the white woman's burden. Their 
pronouncements are, for the most part, as crass and as politically motivated as 
Cromer's. 
</P>
<P>
 What is worrying about the growing literature by Western, and especially 
American, women about the "plight" of Muslim women -- writers with little 
understanding of the Muslim world or knowledge of Islamic history -- is that it 
builds on very dubious foundations; that Western women have it all, and Muslim 
women have nothing; that in order for Muslim women to become liberated, they 
must denature themselves by throwing off Islam. The same is not being asked of 
Jewish or Catholic women. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslim women have a long, uphill battle ahead of them to wrest Islam from 
those who would make it an anti-woman creed. Fortunately, a new genre of 
feminist writing by Muslim women themselves has emerged in recent years, 
counting among its brighter stars the Egyptian Leila Ahmed, the Moroccan Fatima 
Mernissi, the Turk Deniz Kandiyoti and the Iranian Afsaneh Najmabadi. 
</P>
<P>
 These writers have sought to paint a scholarly and historically sensitive 
picture of women in Islamic society. They have tended to focus on state policy 
toward women -- whether it be 10th-Century Baghdad under the Abbasid caliphs, 
the Shah's Iran or contemporary Egypt and Turkey, which both have a long 
history of modernization of state and society. 
</P>
<P>
 What emerges from these studies is that although these states all call 
themselves Muslim, their policies toward women are highly diverse. And it is 
these state policies, not Islam, that ultimately determine the degree of 
freedom these women enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Goodwin or Sasson, the Kuwaiti sociologist Haya al-Mughni takes on a 
subject she knows something about in "Women in Kuwait: The Politics of Gender." 
Writing from her own experience and from the extensive research she has 
conducted on the place of women in her country, she challenges the cliche, dear 
to Western feminists, that the Muslim male is a violent savage and that Muslim 
women are passive victims waiting to be rescued. The restrictions placed on 
women, she suggests, stem instead from the self-protectiveness of Muslim elites 
-- women as much as men -- who prefer to consolidate their own class interests 
and do little to encourage upward mobility by less favored individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The specters that terrorize Muslim women are not just religious obscurantism 
and traditional patriarchy. They are poverty, war and refugee status. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bosnia, Muslim women have been raped by the tens of thousands. They have 
watched their children starve; they have been besieged and tormented. If 
Western feminism had been able to see beyond its colonial legacy, it would have 
led the fight against such outrageous crimes against women. Instead, Western 
feminism, with few exceptions, has been shamefully silent on the plight of 
these Muslim victims, perhaps because there are no political dividends to be 
gained from such a cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Books on Muslim subjects, however, are not all sensationalism or propaganda. 
Ehsan Naraghi, an Iranian sociologist and author of "From Palace to Prison: 
Inside the Iranian Revolution," spent hours with the Shah in the last hundred 
days of his reign. He was called in because the Shah did not understand the 
revolutionary ferment in his country and no longer trusted his courtiers and 
secret policemen. He wanted independent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Naraghi's book recounts their fascinating conversations and then, with equal 
detachment and lucidity, describes the author's 33 months in Teheran's 
notorious Evin prison, to which he was confined by the Ayatollah's revolution. 
There can be no quarrel with such an authentic witness. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the historical forces that produced the present Islamic revival, 
there can be few better guides than Richard Bulliet's "Islam: The View From the 
Edge." A professor of history at Columbia University, he hasspent the past 25 
years researching non-traditional sources for Islamic history. In his pages, we 
see how Islam is actually lived by different communities, widely scattered 
geographically, speaking more than a dozen different languages, and steeped in 
very diverse cultural traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the usual history of Islam as seen from the center, and focusing on 
the rise and fall of imperial dynasties, Bulliet seeks to explore why Islam 
became so strongly rooted in the social structures of people living far from 
its political center. His "view from the edge" is a long-needed and 
invigorating corrective to fossilized Orientalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are living," Bulliet writes, "in a crucial period of Islamic history, 
arguably the most intellectually and spiritually vigorous of the last thousand 
years. Muslims around the world are looking to their illustrious past for 
solace and guidance in changing times, and non-Muslims are scrutinizing that 
same history for clues to the nature and fortune of contemporary Islamic 
movements. Both are incompletely served by the histories at hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Such an informed and humane inquiry is a vital antidote to today's popular 
works of hostile denigration, which feed on prejudice and, indeed, sustain it.

COMMENTARY; HOW TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE THE ONLY SIMPSONS YOU'LL SEE ARE BART 
AND LISA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If the summer preview of "The O.J. Simpson Show" sent you organizing your 
spice rack, there's plenty you can do ahead of time to prepare for avoidance of 
"The Sequel." 
</P>
<P>
 But you say you can't afford to fly to a remote, televisionless island in the 
South Pacific for the trial's duration? 
</P>
<P>
 Here are alternatives: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Start taping soap operas now. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so the Simpson trial promises to be the mother of all soaps, but Bay City, 
Genoa City, Port Charles and the rest of those realistic places with realistic 
people with realistic names like Bo and Margo and Roman will be scarce once Bob 
and Johnnie and Marcia get going. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tape the talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 What's that? You would never watch those? Don't get on your high horse too 
soon. After day after day after day after blasted day of talk of DNA testing, 
you'll be itching to watch "My Sister's Husband's Father Is From Jupiter." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't forget nighttime when taping. 
</P>
<P>
 Set the VCR on nonstop. Music videos on MTV. "Nature" on PBS. Heck, tape 
"Cops." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Learn how to knit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Join a monastery. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rent that pretrial classic, "Absence of Malice." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, not a classic in the classic sense if you ask movie critics and 
journalists. But it does have its great moments: When Paul Newman walks into 
the newsroom, when Paul Newman sails his boat, when Paul Newman speaks, when 
Paul Newman eats, when Paul Newman laughs, when Paul Newman picks up a piece of 
paper . . .  
</P>
<P>
 -- Rent that courtroom classic "The Verdict," starring Paul Newman. (What??? 
You were expecting that "Inherit" movie about that monkey trial or something?) 
</P>
<P>
 Another fave trial movie: "And Justice for All." That it stars Al Pacino is 
pure coincidence. It's recommended because you and your friends can sit around 
and shout with Al, " You're out of order! You're out of order! This whole trial 
is out of order!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rent anything by the Merchant-Ivory crew. One movie will suck up an entire 
morning court session. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rent "Ishtar." A good afternoon nap movie. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Check out "Perry Mason" and Della Street and Paul Drake. Sing along with 
the opening score. Dig that piano, man. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lament the loss of "L.A. Law" -- the Early, not to mention, Good Years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Go shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't much matter if it's Ralph's or Nordstrom. Just so long as there isn't 
a television or radio in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Schedule a pedicure and a manicure. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lunch at Mezzaluna. 
</P>
<P>
 Tacky, yes. But this is the same trial that has sent throngs of tourists 
traipsing through Brentwood and Bundy Drive in search of anything related to 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rent a Ford Bronco and take it for a spin on the 405. (See "Lunch at 
Mezzaluna.") 
</P>
<P>
 -- Call up a friend named Al and see if he'd like to join you. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Read "Jaws" by Peter Benchley -- if the lawyer connection isn't too much of 
a reminder of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Read "The Six-Finger Glove Mystery." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cry over the fact that white gloves are a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Used to be you could walk into any department store and pick up a pair for 
that afternoon tea or First Communion. You'd have better luck now finding a 
hoop skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finish straightening out that spice rack, remembering that oregano goes 
before paprika nd that cayenne pepper might look a little like paprika, but to 
confuse the two could be painful. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Go down to the beach and listen to the waves. They really are quite 
spectacular and they don't stop for a commercial break. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Go up to the mountains. Sometimes we get overbeached and forget that 
there's golden beauty up in them thar hills. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Watch "The Simpsons." You know, the original Simpsons with Homer, Marge, 
Lisa, Bart and Maggie.

THE TRIUMPH OF HARRY AND LOUISE; HOW THE MIGHTY INSURANCE LOBBY SKUNKED CLINTON 
AND DEMOLISHED HIS HEALTH-CARE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Ewing Duncan, David Ewing Duncan, who lives in Baltimore and writes 
for several national magazines, is at work on a book about health care for 
Scribner's, due late next year. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congratulations, Harry and Louise. As Congress huffs and puffs toward a 
health-care finale, you two earnest fortysomethings should have plenty of 
champagne on ice. Thanks to you and your backers, Congress is unlikely to 
dramatically reform the insurance industry, even as insurers mount a sweeping 
takeover of health care in America.  
</P>
<P>
 Talk about a turnaround. Just a year ago, reformers were still seriously 
discussing a Canadian-style medical plan that would have meant the end of 
private health insurance as we know it. Just a few weeks ago, Congress was 
still debating caps on insurance premiums and stringent restrictions on how 
insurers could write policies. But no more. Caving in to an onslaught by an 
army of insurance lobbyists spending tens of millions of dollars -- probably 
more than any other industry -- Congress has "run up a white flag to the 
insurance companies," says Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.), a strong proponent of 
a Canadian-style plan. "There's no question they have won." 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance lobbyists, however, are not yet ready to claim victory. "We are 
still in the thick of it," says Bill Gradison, president of the Health 
Insurance Association of America, which represents small and medium insurance 
companies, accounting for a quarter to a third of the health-insurance market. 
But when confronted with a list of HIAA's major positions, Gradison admits he'd 
prevailed in most major battles -- so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "First off, you've won single-payer," I say, talking recently to the lean, 
quietly intense former congressman, whose office is a mile from Capitol hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," he answers. And Clinton-style premium caps? "Yes, they're gone, 
too," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 And on we go, down a list that includes mandatory alliances, pure community 
ratings, "hard" triggers on price controls and more -- all of which the 
insurance industry, including HIAA, has defeated or weakened. (Other industry 
lobbyists, including the Group Health Association of America, representing 
health maintenance organizations, and the Alliance for Managed Competition, 
representing large insurers, have agendas that differ in some respects from 
HIAA's, but the basic aim is the same: less government regulation.) No bill at 
all would make them even happier. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance lobbyists still complain about provisions in certain bills, 
including expansion of Medicare benefits to cover the poor and taxes on 
high-priced premiums, but prospects for both are growing dim. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, few people outside the debate have any idea what a "hard" trigger 
is, or a mandatory alliance, or pure community rating. Which is part of the 
reason Americans are so confused about health care, telling pollsters that they 
would rather worry about the comparatively simple problems of crime and the 
economy. It's also why Harry and Louise, talking like lovable characters in a 
sitcom, have been so devastatingly effective. Take the following ad, called 
"Choices," which ran last fall: 
</P>
<P>
 Gentle music plays as the camera closes in on a couple sitting at their 
kitchen table, surrounded by stacks of bills, an adding machine and yellow 
pads. The words "Sometime in the Future" flash across the screen, presumably 
referring to a period after a Clinton-health-care bill is passed.  
</P>
<P>
 "But this was covered by our old plan," says Louise, looking at a bill.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah! That was a good one, wasn't it?" says Harry. Dressed as an everyman 
in a flannel shirt, he is trying to make sense of the paperwork spread out on 
the table. He punches numbers into the adding machine. He jots down figures and 
then crumples up the paper in frustration. A voice-over says: "Things are 
changing, and not all for the better. The government may force us to pick from 
a few health care plans designed by government bureaucrats."  
</P>
<P>
 "Having choices we don't like," says Louise, her brow knotted in concern, "is 
no choice at all."  
</P>
<P>
 "They choose," says Harry.  
</P>
<P>
 "We lose," says Louise.  
</P>
<P>
 Wow! Here was a couple looking like a '90s version of Ozzie and Harriet saying 
reform might leave us worse off than we already were, even as President Clinton 
promised his plan would make us feel better. And what was that they said about 
bureaucrats and choice? Could that be true?  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the original Clinton plan would have increased choice for many 
Americans by mandating that everyone have at least three plans to choose from 
-- including a fee-for-service option that would have allowed policyholders to 
see the doctor of their choice, but for more money. As for the bugaboo of 
government bureaucracies, the ads were largely correct; Clinton was opting for 
a much larger federal role in managing health care. Whatever the facts, the ads 
played brilliantly to viewers' fears. They worked even better, however, at 
terrorizing senators and representatives, the real targets of the ads, who saw 
them as an attack against something not even mentioned by Harry and Louise -- 
mandated alliances. This was a Clinton idea that would have required states to 
organize people not insured at the workplace into huge pools, a measure the 
HIAA bitterly opposed, fearing such alliances might reduce the power of 
insurers to dominate the market -- particularly the small and medium insurers 
represented by Gradison's association. Congressmen also saw the ads as a 
display of the insurance lobby's raw power; they understood that an industry 
capable of spending almost $15 million on Harry and Louise might unleash 
similar invective come election time against those who voted the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry and Louise also gave the HIAA added leverage over Congress when Gradison 
went to the Hill looking for deals. At one point this spring, he strong-armed 
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), then the 
President's point man on health care in the House. In a remarkable display of 
lobbying muscle, Gradison reportedly persuaded his former colleague to remove 
or dilute key Clinton provisions in exchange for yanking Harry and Louise off 
the air. The agreement later fell through when Rostenkowski resigned as 
chairman in the wake of his indictment for mishandling government funds, 
prompting Gradison to launch more Harry and Louise salvos.

 NOT FAR FROM CAPITOL HILL, BUT A WORLD AWAY, 37-YEAR-OLD Kim Brady cuddles two 
West Highland Terriers, O'Reilly and Macintosh, as she struggles to take a 
breath in her Columbia, Md., home. Brady would make a great fill-in for Louise 
-- amiable, believable and as anguished as the actress on television. Except 
that Brady's apprehensions are not only real, they also offer a glimpse into a 
brave new world of health care controlled not by government, but by private 
insurers, whose victory on the Hill is merely a part of their larger triumph 
outside Washington. In recent months, insurers have loosed a radical 
restructuring of American medicine, using as their blueprint something called 
"managed care." 
</P>
<P>
 Theoretically, this is a system where insurers set limits governing patient 
care and then closely monitor interactions among patients, doctors and 
hospitals to ensure compliance. The idea is to enhance quality and to cut costs 
by eliminating waste and unnecessary procedures. In practice, however, managed 
care is fast becoming synonymous with a no-frills, Wal-Mart style of care that 
not only limits a patient to a set list of cut-rate doctors, pharmacies and 
hospitals but also has become, in the eyes of some, more interested in cutting 
costs than in providing quality. This perception is particularly apropos right 
now, as insurers eagerly embrace managed care, signing up so many new enrollees 
in the past few months that one in three Americans is now in these plans. HMOs 
alone grew from 30 million enrollees in 1987 to 45 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several types of managed-care plans, including HMOs, which usually 
offer the most restricted services and doctor choices for a low prepaid premium 
that covers all allowed care. Other plans, which may also use a prepaid 
premium, usually offer more choices but still restrict policyholders to 
specific hospitals, doctors and procedures and either prohibit the use of 
outside providers or charge extra for such services.  
</P>
<P>
 New managed-care plans are sprouting up everywhere, as even the "Big Five" -- 
Aetna, Prudential, CIGNA, MetLife and Travelers -- begin to shift millions of 
customers from fee-for-service plans to managed care. Whether this switch is 
good for patient care, however, remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kim Brady, the verdict is already in. Born with a defective aortic valve 
and a hole in her septum, she had open-heart surgery in 1989 to insert an 
artificial valve. Soon after, she joined an HMO, only to find she could no 
longer visit the specialist monitoring her pacemaker. Told to see the HMO's own 
cardiologist as a cost-saving measure, Brady found herself growing so weak and 
breathless she had to stop working, becoming a virtual invalid. "The HMO 
cardiologist admitted he knew nothing about this pacemaker," she says. "He kept 
tinkering with it anyway, but nothing worked."  
</P>
<P>
 It was then that Brady contacted the pacemaker's manufacturer. They put her in 
touch with their specialist, who agreed to see her for free. "He told me the 
problem was that my pacemaker was not adjusted properly," she says. "He fixed 
it, and almost instantly, I could breathe. I could exercise. I could live 
again." Back with the HMO cardiologist, her health again declined and she now 
faces her third open-heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Brady's experience is perhaps extreme, though she's hardly alone. Indeed, 
in an ironic twist to Harry and Louise, Brady and others talk about problems 
with the system that sound remarkably similar to the ads -- the fears and 
frustrations of dealing with bureaucracies, the limitations on physician choice 
and so forth. Yet Kim Brady is talking about insurers, not the government. 
</P>
<P>
 So is William Webb, a retired Washington, D.C., schoolteacher who says he 
found out after double-bypass surgery that his cardiologist of 11 years was not 
on the approved list of his managed-care plan -- which meant he was stuck 
paying more than $1,000 in fees. Webb says he is paying out of pocket because 
he doesn't want to lose his doctor, though he may soon have to drop the 
cardiologist because he can't afford him.  
</P>
<P>
 And so is Steven Silas, a physician who resigned from an HMO in Albuquerque 
after being ordered to give elderly patients a cheap brand of antihistamine 
that made them sleepy, reserving the more expensive drugs that have no side 
effects for younger people who might sue if they became drowsy on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 And Kathy Kosciewicz, who works in Wilmington, Del., and lives in Baltimore, 
two hours away, because her husband works in Washington. Expecting her first 
baby this fall, Kosciewicz was told by her HMO that she must deliver in 
Delaware. "But what if I have trouble on the way?" she asked, noting that she 
lives within minutes of several Baltimore hospitals. "What if the baby comes 
too fast?" She's forced to stay with relatives in Delaware shortly before her 
due date.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, lawmakers have been receiving complaints about managed care in many 
states and in Washington, though comprehensive data remains elusive. "We have 
no formal system of collecting complaints," says an official at the Health Care 
Finance Administration, which oversees Medicare, though surveys taken by HCFA 
suggest dissatisfaction with managed care is increasing. At the top of the 
list, says this official (who asked not to be named), were patients who 
complain they weren't covered outside their own city, those who were denied 
access to doctors of their choice and those who have quality-of-care concerns. 
Agency officials are also investigating fraud cases in which insurance agents 
sign up members without properly explaining managed-care restrictions or costs. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Princeton economist Uwe Reinhardt, however, none of these 
complaints is likely to be as pervasive as the headache of coping with managed 
care. A supporter "in theory" of managed care, Reinhardt nonetheless says it's 
just a matter of time before we become overwhelmed with too many choices 
offered by competing plans and by employers who change insurers every few 
months to get a better deal. "The sheer dynamism of this thing is going to 
drive people bonkers," says Reinhardt, warning that abrupt shifts in plans, 
policies and doctors will get worse and that constant change is already 
replacing the stability most patients crave in health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Managed-care insurers dismiss such talk by pointing to surveys that report 
high rates of satisfaction. For instance, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation 
last year released a survey, jointly conducted with the New York-based 
Commonwealth Fund, that claimed 85% of the nation's 45 million HMO enrollees 
are either very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with their coverage. Critics 
dismiss these surveys as misleading because most HMO policyholders are young 
and healthy and seldom use their insurance except for routine care. They also 
note that managed-care programs are growing so quickly it is impossible to know 
how millions of new enrollees will feel in coming months.  
</P>
<P>
 For good or ill, everyone agrees that managed care is changing American 
medicine at a very fundamental level: We are shifting from health care as a 
private matter between patient and physician to a world in which insurance 
companies will be interfering in even the smallest details of a patient's 
treatment.  
</P>
<P>
 A bedrock shift is also underway for doctors and hospitals, who once dominated 
health care on a more or less equal footing with insurers. Health-care 
providers, in fact, are among the big losers in the reform wars, as insurance 
companies have outflanked them to become the ultimate arbiters of health care, 
with non-physician clerks and accountants increasingly second-guessing medical 
decisions and some doctors shut out of managed-care rosters. Hospitals, too, 
are finding their autonomy greatly impinged by managed care, as plans force 
deep discounts or pay flat fees for patients regardless of their condition or 
the complexity of their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of this cutting down to size is richly deserved by physicians and 
hospitals, who are as responsible as anyone for skyrocketing health-care costs. 
But as Reinhardt points out, "a health system run by fed-up doctors is not 
going to be a good health-care system." He also suggests there is a danger in 
treating physicians too shabbily, since they might be pushed into fighting back 
by unionizing and using their still considerable clout to stage boycotts and 
strikes against insurers. "You may end up with a world of bilateral 
monopolies," he says, "big, powerful health plans pitted against unionized 
doctors." 
</P>
<P>
 AMERICANS MIGHT BE WILLING TO SACRIFICE FREEDOM of choice, physician autonomy 
and even their beloved get-whatever-you-want style of medicine if they truly 
believe it will save them money. But is this happening? Are insurers really 
bringing down health-care expenditures? 
</P>
<P>
 On an individual level, many policyholders say yes. For instance, an editor in 
New York City -- he's healthy and in his early 40s -- says he can now go to a 
doctor virtually any time for only $15. "Before," he says, "I paid three or 
four times that out of pocket because I had a high deductible." Nationally, 
too, most health-care observers agree prices are dropping. Medical inflation 
fell last year to 5.4%, the lowest in several years, in part because managed 
care meant less was paid to hospitals and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 This modest drop hardly signals a steep decline. For not only was 5.4% still 
twice the rate of overall inflation, health-care spending in real dollars also 
increased last year by a whopping 10%, according to an estimate from the 
Congressional Budget Office. This means we paid almost $75 billion more for 
health care in 1993 than we did the year before, more than the federal 
government spent on transportation or fighting crime. It's an amount so 
prodigious it would rank in the Top 10 of the Fortune 500 if it were a company. 
And this is just the increase in spending. 
</P>
<P>
 But how can this be, if managed care is supposed to cut costs? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, in a word, is profits, which gobble up whatever savings are 
achieved by managed-care cutbacks. In a business where a profit margin of two 
cents on the dollar was once considered acceptable, several top HMOs tracked by 
the Sherlock Company, a Pennsylvania-based managed-care consulting firm, have 
earned profit margins averaging from six to eight cents on the dollar since 
1992, reaching almost nine cents so far this year. This comes at a time when 
many managed-care companies are seeing operating income spiral upward by as 
much as 150% a year as enrollments go up and payouts to providers go down. 
Overhead also remains a drag on overall health-care savings, siphoning off 10 
to 50 cents on the dollar.  
</P>
<P>
 Not all insurance companies are doing well. According to Larry Leisure, a 
managed-care analyst at Price Waterhouse, some plans are "going down fast" as 
competition heats up and strong regional companies begin to beat out locals 
unable to force deep cuts on doctors and hospitals. In some areas, says 
Leisure, huge managed-care companies are even reducing premiums, taking a 
short-term hit on profits in an effort to kill off the little guys, a strategy 
some economists warn will lead to regions of oligopolies where large insurers 
dominate major markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet premiums are hardly coming down across the board, as some managed-care 
proponents claim. HMO premiums, for instance, increased by nearly 9.6% last 
year -- considerably less than recent hikes as high as 16% though still far 
above 1987, when they rose by about 4%.  
</P>
<P>
 Thus we have an industry lowering premium increases a little, but not a lot, 
while slashing payments to providers by as much as 61%, an equation that will 
continue to equal big profits for companies that can pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
 The question remains: Can we afford to have insurers earning nine cents on the 
dollar at a time when health costs continue to soar? And what does such an 
intense focus on earnings mean for patient care? According to Reinhardt, 
companies earning high profits deserve them as a kind of fee, or "bounty" for 
cutting out fat in health care -- i.e., for forcing doctors and hospitals to 
close down extra beds and to eliminate wasteful spending practices. But we are 
talking tens of billions of dollars being handed over to an industry that 
doesn't exist in most countries, which may begin to explain why health care in 
the United States costs as much as three times that in other Western nations.  
</P>
<P>
 OF COURSE, THERE IS GREAT IRONY IN THE INSURANCE industry's gains. For it was 
President Clinton who originally championed private insurance as the vehicle 
for reform, ending any hope for enacting the system favored by Franklin D. 
Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman: national health insurance. Clinton also insisted 
on emphasizing managed care as a magic elixir to reduce spending, elevating 
what had been one idea among many to star status.  
</P>
<P>
 The insurance lobby, however, played Clinton and his health-care gurus for the 
naifs they seem to be. Not only because they refused to endorse the President's 
plan but also by betraying his faith in them when they unleashed the likes of 
Harry and Louise, a blitz the President made worse by attacking the ads, Bill 
Gradison's HIAA and other critics, giving them a gold mine of free exposure in 
the media. 
</P>
<P>
 The full extent of Harry and Louise's victory, however, remains to be seen. 
Congress may still pass a bill with some insurance reforms, such as a ban on 
insurers denying coverage for pre-existing conditions and a guarantee that 
policyholders will not lose coverage or be dropped when they move or change 
jobs. But unless Congress imposes meaningful cost controls, which seems 
unlikely, insurers will simply raise their rates to compensate for these added 
risks. This would launch another round of surging costs, something that's 
happened every time Congress has tried to brake health-care spending in the 
past.  
</P>
<P>
 This time will be different, however, as many of us find ourselves living in a 
nation where health care is as restricted, rationed and regulated as it is in 
Canada, Germany and other countries with socialized medicine, even as we pay 
hundreds of billions of dollars more to keep Harry and Louise's creators in 
business. Here, the rationers will be private insurers, not the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and by the way, the real Harry and Louise -- actors Harry Johnson and 
Louise Caire Clark, both of Los Angeles -- are "generously insured" through the 
Screen Actor's Guild, according to a People interview last spring. For their 
sakes, let's hope "generous" means that America's First Couple of insurance 
won't be dropped, lose their doctor or find out a future illness is not 
covered. As for those Americans with less generous plans, or no plan at all, 
inaction on Capitol Hill will mean fending for themselves. Meanwhile, the 
insurers are gearing up to take the battle to state legislatures if Congress 
fails to act.

THE HILLBILLY CAT; ELVIS PRESLEY ON THE BRINK OF STARDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Peter Guralnick, Peter Guralnick's previous books include Feel Like Going 
Home, Lost Highway and Sweet Soul Music. This article is adapted from Last 
Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley, the first volume of a two-volume 
biography, to be published by Little, Brown and Company this month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elvis Presley's first record ("That's All Right" and "Blue Moon of Kentucky") 
was recorded on July 5, 1954. It was released on the Sun label two weeks later. 
Elvis was 19 years old. He had never appeared anywhere professionally. In fact, 
he had only met the two members of his band, guitarist Scotty Moore and bass 
player Bill Black, the day before the initial session.  
</P>
<P>
 On July 30, Elvis made what amounted to his official debut on a country and 
western jamboree, headlined by Slim Whitman, at Memphis' Overton Park shell. 
Even in the midst of a seasoned professional cast and despite a pronounced case 
of stage fright, he was an immediate sensation. Over the next few weeks, his 
record proved to be a big hit in Memphis, and he made a number of club 
appearances. But Sun Records president Sam Phillips had bigger plans. Phillips, 
who had pioneered in the recording of blues men like B.B. King, Howlin' Wolf, 
Ike Turner and Little Junior Parker over the previous four years, saw an 
opportunity for Presley to make a national mark. To that end, Phillips 
approached Grand Ole Opry head Jim Denny, who was less than enthusiastic but 
agreed to think about it.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 IT WAS A 200-MILE RIDE FROM MEMPHIS TO NASHVILLE, BUT THE FOUR OF THEM WERE 
COMFORTABLE enough in Sam Phillips' four-door black 1951 Cadillac, with Bill's 
bass strapped to the roof. It was Saturday, Oct. 2. Elvis, Scotty and Bill had 
played their regular Friday-night gig at the Eagle's Nest; their record, "Blue 
Moon of Kentucky," was near the top of the charts in Memphis and just beginning 
to break in Nashville and New Orleans, and they had every reason to feel that 
they had reached the pinnacle of their musical career -- because tonight they 
were going to play the Opry. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Denny had finally succumbed to Sam's argument that there was no need to 
think about putting the boy on as a regular, he didn't have to think of this as 
a normal "tryout," just give the boy a chance . Denny, who had become manager 
of the Opry in 1947, seemed no more convinced than he had been in the first 
place -- perhaps he was just worn down by Sam's persistence -- but he agreed to 
give the young man a one-time spot on Hank Snow's segment of the show. He could 
perform a single song with his band, the country number "Blue Moon of 
Kentucky." If it was worth it to Sam and the boys to drive over just for that, 
well, then, Denny was willing to give them the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Sam had also heard from the Louisiana Hayride, the Opry's 
innovative rival in Shreveport, which actually wanted this new act. The 
Hayride, which Denny referred to derisively as the Opry's farm club because so 
many of its big acts eventually defected to Nashville, had discovered Hank 
Williams in 1948 and broken such stars as Slim Whitman, Webb Pierce, and, most 
recently, Jim Reeves and Faron Young. But Sam put them off because, he 
explained to Hayride booking agent Pappy Covington, he wanted to play the Opry 
first. As soon as the boys had fulfilled this prior commitment, he told Pappy, 
stretching the truth a little, Elvis could appear on the Hayride. There was no 
doubt in his mind, he said, that Elvis could make a hit with the Hayride 
audience, and they could set it up for just a week or two after the Opry 
appearance, but he had committed himself to Jim Denny. Sam was walking a thin 
line, he knew. He didn't for a minute want to lose the Hayride, but he wasn't 
going to give up the opportunity to see a new, untried artist get his national 
debut on the hallowed Grand Ole Opry. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryman Auditorium was like a tattered shrine to the three musicians, none of 
whom had ever even attended a show at the Opry before. They wandered around the 
dilapidated building, erected as a tabernacle in 1886 and still retaining the 
old wooden pews for seats, in something of a daze. They were both overwhelmed 
at the sense of history contained in the room -- the music they had been 
listening to all their lives emanated from this cramped little stage -- and 
somewhat disillusioned, too, that the Grand Ole Opry was not, well, grander. 
Backstage, the other musicians mingled freely, exchanging small talk and 
greetings, tuning up, donning makeup and costumes, without any of the formality 
or protocol you might have expected from stars but with all of the remoteness, 
whether real or perceived, of big leaguers sniffing at bushers just up from the 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one-year-old bass player Buddy Killen came up to the obviously 
out-of-place young singer and introduced himself. "(Elvis) said, 'They're going 
to hate me.' I said, 'They're not going to hate you. You're going to be fine.' 
He said, 'If they'd just let me leave, I'd go right now.' " Marty Robbins saw 
evidence of the same insecurity, but when Elvis spotted Chet Atkins backstage, 
he introduced himself and then, knowing Scotty's admiration for Atkins' guitar 
playing, pulled Scotty over, too, saying, "My guitar player wants to meet you." 
Atkins noted with asperity that the kid appeared to be wearing eye makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably of all the Opry legends, the one they were most leery of running into 
was Bill Monroe. Many in the country field continued to view the Sun version of 
"Blue Moon of Kentucky" as a desecration, and even Sam had heard that Monroe 
was going to take their head off for their untrammeled interpretation of his 
stately lament. But when they met Monroe, conservatively dressed in dark suit 
and tie and trademark white hat and at 43 already an elder statesman possessed 
of a dignity that permitted neither insincerity nor informality, he came right 
out and complimented them. As a matter of fact, he told them, he had cut a new 
version of the song for Decca, due out next week, that followed their pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two additional surprises. Sam Phillips' assistant, Marion Keisker, 
left behind in Memphis to keep the studio doors open, abandoned her post and 
caught a bus to Nashville, where she thought at first she would just stay out 
in the audience so as not to spook them but before long found her way 
backstage. Then Bill peeked out at the audience and, to his surprise, 
discovered his wife, Evelyn, and Scotty's wife, Bobbie, in the front row. "I 
think he was kind of glad to see us," said Bobbie, " 'cause they were wanting 
to come back to Memphis that night. But when Scotty saw me backstage, it was 
like he'd seen a ghost." 
</P>
<P>
 At 10:15 Grant Turner announced the Hank Snow segment of the show, sponsored 
by Royal Crown Cola, and Snow got lost in his introduction of a young man from 
Memphis who has just made a hit record, let's give him a nice round of 
applause, to the point that he forgot the young singer's name. Elvis bounced 
out the same way that he always did, as if he had just fallen off a fast-moving 
train, and did his one number. Scotty and Bill were more nervous than he was; 
to them, it seemed, there was nowhere to go but down from here, and they could 
sense from the polite, but tepid, reception that this was exactly where they 
were going. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward they were like a boxing management team trying to rationalize 
defeat. Everyone was nice to them as they gawked and huddled; they'd gotten a 
good reception, Bobbie and Evelyn insisted, and Bill introduced himself to 
everyone, laughing and cracking jokes, while Scotty stood off to one side a 
little stiffly, waiting to be introduced. Before leaving, Sam conferred briefly 
with Mr. Denny, who confirmed that Elvis Presley just did not fit the Opry 
mold, but, he told Sam, " 'This boy is not bad.' He didn't give me any great 
accolades, he just grabbed me by my skinny arm and said, 'This boy is not bad.' 
Well, people put down Jim Denny, nobody much liked Jim, he was a damn tough 
man, but he did me a favor ." 
</P>
<P>
 They left not long afterward and wandered down the hill to 417 Broadway, the 
location of the Ernest Tubb Record Shop, where they were scheduled to play the 
famous Midnight Jamboree (which went on the air live from the record store at 
the conclusion of the Opry broadcast). Someone introduced Elvis to Ernest Tubb, 
and Tubb, the most gracious and courteous of entertainers, listened patiently 
as the 19-year-old poured out his love for Tubb's music and told him that it 
was his real ambition to sing country music. "He said, 'They tell me if I'm 
going to make any money, though, I've got to sing (this other kind of music). 
What should I do?' I said, 'Elvis, you ever have any money?' He said, 'No, 
sir.' I said, 'Well, you just go ahead and do what they tell you to do. Make 
your money. Then you can do what you want to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Scotty and Bill headed back to Memphis with their wives after the broadcast. 
They felt simultaneously elated and depressed (they had made it to the big 
time, even if they were now in all likelihood on the road to oblivion), but for 
Sam Phillips the evening was an unmitigated triumph. To play the Opry -- and 
then to get approval, however grudging, from Jim Denny and Bill Monroe! Even 
the criticism would not hurt. It could be used, Sam was firmly convinced, to 
further the boy's appeal -- if he could just turn around some of this damn 
rejection he was getting, if he could just straighten out some of the 
wrongheaded thinking he was encountering, the blind could be made to see, the 
lame could be made to walk. "I needed the attention that I got from the people 
that hated what I was doing, that acted like: 'Here is somebody trying to 
thrust junk on us and classify it as our music.' Well, f- - - them, let them do 
the classifying . I just had to peak that damn pyramid, or else the damn son of 
a bitch would have fallen down." And with Elvis Presley, Sam Phillips was sure 
he had the means to peak the pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 ELVIS PRESLEY'S SECOND SUN SINGLE WAS RELEASED SIX DAYS BEFORE his Opry 
appearance. It was, if anything, an even bolder declaration of intent than 
"That's All Right," especially the strident blues number "Good Rockin' 
Tonight," which rocked more confidently than anything they could have imagined 
in those first, uncertain days in the studio. Maybe Sam still couldn't diagram 
the path, but, he felt, they were finally beginning to find their way to "that 
damn row that hadn't been plowed." 
</P>
<P>
 They had seized every opportunity they could to get into the studio all 
through August, but Sam was on the road so much, and the band was working so 
many weekends (while still holding down full-time jobs), that this was easier 
said than accomplished. On Aug. 19 they spent hours doing take after take of 
"Blue Moon," in an eerie, clippity-clop version that resembled a cross between 
Slim Whitman's "Indian Love Call" and some of the falsetto flights of the 
rhythm-and-blues "bird" groups (the Orioles, the Ravens, the Larks). After it 
was all over, Sam wasn't satisfied that they had anything worth releasing, but 
he never uttered a word of demurral for fear of discouraging the unfettered 
freshness and enthusiasm of the singer. "The sessions would go on and on," said 
Marion Keisker. "Each record was sweated out. Sam showed patience beyond belief 
-- in a personality that's not really given to patience." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem did not appear to have so much to do with time, in any case, as 
with confidence and direction. They had captured the ring once, seemingly by 
accident, but now no one appeared to have a clear vision of how to capture it 
again, and Sam was reluctant to impose his own. "I had a mental picture, as 
sure as God is on His throne, I had a mental picture of what I wanted to hear, 
certainly not note for note, but I knew the essence of what we were trying to 
do. But I also knew that the worst thing I could do was to be impatient, to try 
to force the issue -- sometimes you can make a suggestion just (to change) one 
bar and you kill the whole song. And sometimes you can be too cocky around 
people who are insecure and just intimidate them. I mean, as far as actually 
saying, 'Hey, man, don't be scared,' I've never told anybody in my life not to 
be scared of the microphone -- don't go calling attention to the thing you know 
they are already scared of. I was never a real forward person, because I didn't 
give a damn about jumping out in front to be seen, but I tried to envelop them 
in my feelings of security." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of the next few weeks they made several attempts at 
"Satisfied," Martha Carson's rousing spiritual hit from 1951, and "Tomorrow 
Night," the Lonnie Johnson blues ballad that Elvis had crooned so often to his 
girlfriend Dixie. They made any number of false starts on other tunes, all of 
them erased because tape was expensive, after all, and they just weren't going 
anywhere. The slow numbers, Sam said, "would hang you out to dry," but he was 
determined to give Elvis' creative imagination free play. He was equally 
determined, said Marion, not to release anything even a jot below the standard 
they had already set; he wanted to be sure he had done all that he could to 
make every record as good as it was "humanly possible to make it." From Sam's 
point of view: "I wanted simplicity, where we could look at what we were 
hearing mentally and say, 'Man, this guy has just got it.' But I wanted some 
biting bulls- - -, too. Everything had to be a stinger. To me every one of 
those sessions was like I was filming 'Gone With the Wind.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, starting on Sept. 10, they hit a streak -- once again it seemed 
almost as if they had stumbled onto it by accident, but when they did, it was, 
as Sam Phillips said, as if it had been waiting for them all along. They cut 
"Just Because," a rollicking, honky-tonk blues that the Shelton Brothers had 
originally recorded as the Lone Star Cowboys in 1933. The great good humor and 
burbling effervescence of the new trio version can be traced in equal parts to 
Elvis' confident exploitation of his gospel-learned technique (here for the 
first time we hear the characteristic Presley drop to a slurred lower 
register), Bill Black's almost comically thumping bass and Scotty's 
increasingly rhythm-driven guitar. "It was almost a total rhythm thing," Scotty 
said. "With only the three of us, we had to make every note count." Although 
Sam never released this cut or the next one either, a weepy version of Jimmy 
Wakely's 1941 "I'll Never Let You Go (Little Darlin')" with a tagged-on, 
double-time ending, both are characterized by the kind of playfulness and 
adventurousness of spirit that Sam was looking for, the fresh, almost 
"impudent" attitude that he was seeking to unlock. 
</P>
<P>
 With "I Don't Care If the Sun Don't Shine," an even more unlikely 
transformation took place. Originally written for the Disney animated feature 
"Cinderella" by Mack David (brother of the celebrated pop composer Hal David), 
the song didn't make the film score's final cut, but it was popularized in 1950 
by both Patti Page and Dean Martin. The rhythmic approach couldn't have been 
more different, but it was Martin's version on which Elvis' is clearly based; 
for all the energy that Elvis, Scotty and Bill impart to the song, and for all 
the high spirits of Elvis' vocalizing, it is Martin's lazily insouciant spirit 
that comes through. It's as if Dennis the Menace met the drawling English 
character actor George Sanders. "That's what he heard in Dean," said Sam, "that 
little bit of mischievousness that he had in his soul when he cut up a little 
bit -- (that's why) he loved Dean Martin's singing." 
</P>
<P>
 With the last song of the session, Wynonie Harris' R & B classic "Good Rockin' 
Tonight," everything finally fell into place. By this time, everyone may have 
been getting a little testy, and no one was really sure whether they had 
anything, but as Scotty said, "Sam had an uncanny knack for pulling stuff out 
of you. Once you got a direction, he'd work you so hard you'd work your butt 
off, he'd make you so mad you'd want to kill him, but he wouldn't let go until 
he got that little something extra sometimes you didn't even know you had." Sam 
would insist that they play nothing but rhythm, he would have them change keys 
just when they finally got used to the one they were in, and he called for 
tempos so slow sometimes that everyone was ready to scream. "A lot of times it 
was a tempo that I absolutely knew they weren't going to like, but we were in a 
situation where we just weren't getting anywhere, and when they came back (to 
the original tempo), it was like they'd hit a home run." 
</P>
<P>
 To Marion Keisker it was like a puzzle to which only Sam had the key. "I still 
remember the times when everyone would be so tired, and then some little funny 
thing would set us off -- I'd see Elvis literally rolling around on the floor, 
and Bill Black just stretched out with his old broken-down bass fiddle, just 
laughing and goofing off. It was a great spirit of -- I don't know, everyone 
was trying very hard, but everyone was trying to hang very loose through the 
whole thing. (Sometimes) if Elvis would do something absolutely extraordinary 
and somebody would hit a clinker or something would go wrong before the tape 
was completed, Sam would say, 'Well, let's go back, and you hold on to what you 
did there. I want that.' And Elvis would say, 'What did I do? What did I do?' 
Because it was all so instinctive that he simply didn't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam's one organizing principle was that it had to be fun. "I could tolerate 
anything, we could have tensions as long as I knew that we all had confidence 
in what we were trying to do, and I could get everybody relaxed to the point 
where they could hear and react to something without that threshold of 
apprehension where you almost get to a point where you can't do anything right. 
Every time we did a number, I wanted to make sure . . . that everybody enjoyed 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of this final number, that sense of enjoyment comes through from 
the very first note, as Elvis' voice takes on a burr of aggression that is 
missing from the previous recordings, the band for the first time becomes the 
fused rhythm instrument that Sam had been seeking all along, and there is a 
sense of driving, high-flying good times almost in defiance of societal norms. 
"Have you heard the news?" is the opening declaration, drawn out and dramatic. 
"There's good rocking tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The other dramatic element to declare itself was the quality that Sam thought 
he had sensed in Elvis from the start, that strange, unexpected impulse that 
had led the boy to launch himself into "That's All Right" in the first place -- 
it seemed to come out of nowhere, and yet, Sam felt, he heard something of the 
same feeling in the sentimental ballads, too. He equated the insecurity that 
came through so unmistakably in the boy's stance and demeanor with the sense of 
inferiority -- social, psychological, perceptual -- that was projected by the 
great Negro talents he had sought out and recorded. Sam couldn't be sure, he 
thought he sensed in Elvis a kindred spirit, someone who shared with him a 
secret, almost subversive attraction not just to black music but to black 
culture, to an inchoate striving, a belief in the equality of man. This was 
something that Sam felt could never be articulated; each man was doomed to 
stumble in his own darkness, if only because the stakes were so high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to keep my nose clean. They could have said, 'This goddamn rebel down 
here is gonna turn his back on us. Why should we give this nigger-loving son of 
a bitch a break?' It took some subtle thinking on my part -- I'm telling you 
(some) resolute facts here. But I had the ability to be patient. I was able to 
hold on almost with a religious fervor, but definitely subdued -- I wasn't 
looking for no tall stumps to preach from. And I sensed in him the same kind of 
empathy. I don't think he was aware of my motivation for doing what I was 
trying to do -- not consciously anyway -- but intuitively he felt it. I never 
discussed it -- I don't think it would have been very wise to talk about it, 
for me to say, 'Hey, man, we're going against . . .' Or, 'We're trying to put 
pop music down and bring in black . . .' The lack of prejudice on the part of 
Elvis had to be one of the biggest things that ever could have happened to us, 
though. It was almost subversive, sneaking around through the music -- but we 
hit things a little bit, don't you think? I went out into this no-man's land, 
and I knocked the s- - - out of the color line." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam knew that he had found a kindred spirit in other ways as well. Over the 
course of the next month, as he worked at trying to set up the Opry appearance, 
as he took around an acetate of the new single and encountered the same 
resistance in Nashville from old friends like WLAC deejay Gene Nobles and 
one-stop record distributors Randy Wood and Ernie Young, all strictly 
rhythm-and-blues men, he nevertheless knew that his instincts had not been 
wrong. Getting to know the boy a little better, getting him to open up a little 
more, having the chance to talk to him not just about music but about life and 
love and women, he sensed a potential that even he had not fully anticipated. 
"I was amazed. Here I am 12 years older than him, I'm 31 and he's 19, and I've 
been exposed to all kinds of music and lived through the damn Depression, and 
yet he had the most intuitive ability to hear songs without ever having to 
classify them, or himself , of anyone I've ever known outside of Jerry Lee 
Lewis and myself. It seemed like he had a photographic memory for every damn 
song he ever heard -- and he was one of the most introspective human beings 
that I've ever met. You see, Elvis Presley knew what it was like to be poor, 
but that damn sure didn't make him prejudiced. He didn't draw any lines. And 
like (Billboard editor) Paul Ackerman said, you have to be an awful smart 
person or dumb as hell (and you know he wasn't dumb) to put out that kind of 
thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 SAM CALLED PAPPY COVINGTON, THE TALENT BOOKER for The Hayride, on the Monday 
after the Opry appearance and settled on a date less than two weeks away. The 
Hayride was a little more than 6 years old. It had been predated by a similar 
program, the KWKH Saturday Night Roundup, before the war and was probably the 
second-most popular hillbilly program on the air, with a 50,000-watt 
clear-channel signal that rivaled the Opry's, reaching up to 28 states, and a 
CBS hookup that enabled it to reach 198 stations for an hour on the third 
Saturday of every month. 
</P>
<P>
 The hallmark of the Hayride was innovation, and it was as the Opry's brash 
younger cousin that the Hayride really made its mark. Hank Williams, Kitty 
Wells, Webb Pierce, Faron Young, the Carlisles, David Houston, Jim Reeves -- 
all debuted on the Hayride before eventually lighting out for Nashville, and 
under the leadership of Horace Logan, it continued to be a haven for new talent 
and fast-paced variety. The Hayride audiences in the 3,800-seat Municipal 
Auditorium showed the same kind of enthusiasm as the performers, and Logan 
placed microphones out among the crowd to register its reaction, whether to 
something that was going out over the air or to longtime announcer Ray Bartlett 
(who broadcast during the day as rhythm-and-blues deejay Groovey Boy) doing 
unrestrained somersaults and back flips onstage. Shreveport was a lively music 
town, just on the cusp of oil affluence and with the kind of unassuming racial 
mix (nothing like desegregation, of course, but with two populations living 
cheek by jowl, locked in an inescapable cultural alliance) that gave Memphis 
its own musical flavor. The Hayride had everything, in fact, except an 
aggressive booking agency to support its acts (Pappy Covington had the job only 
because he had a lease on the building) and record companies to sign them. This 
was the principal reason for the one-way migration to Nashville, but in the 
fall of 1954 it looked as if the supply of new talent might be inexhaustible, 
and the Hayride had grown accustomed to thumbing its nose at the Opry, which 
Horace Logan referred to frequently on the air as "the Tennessee branch of the 
Hayride." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam, Elvis, Scotty and Bill set out for Shreveport, a good seven- or 
eight-hour ride from Memphis, not long after the boys got off work at their 
regular Friday-night gig at the Eagle's Nest. They missed the turnoff at 
Greenville, Miss., because Bill had everybody laughing so hard at one of his 
jokes, and then Scotty almost hit a team of mules as they struggled to make up 
the time. When they finally got to Shreveport, they checked into the Captain 
Shreve Hotel downtown, but then they had to wait forever while Elvis combed his 
hair. Sam took the boys around to meet Pappy, who made them feel "like four 
hundred million dollars, just this kindly, fatherly old man who made you feel 
like you were the greatest thing that could ever walk into his office. I 
thought that was the best thing that could happen for these young men and even 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 From there, he and Elvis went and paid their respects to disc jockey T. Tommy 
Cutrer, who had broken "That's All Right" on KCIJ. Elvis was wearing a typical 
black and pink outfit and, according to T. Tommy, "his hair was long and greasy 
and he didn't look clean. My wife commented afterwards; she said, 'That boy 
needs to wash his neck.' " T. Tommy, a highly astute, charming and capable man 
who kept up a little band of his own at the time and went on to become a 
Tennessee state senator and a top Teamsters official, still had doubts about 
how far this boy was going to go, and Elvis scarcely opened his mouth the whole 
time. But Sam was such a believer, and T. Tommy was nothing if not a 
pragmatist, so he figured, Well, let's just see where it goes. 
</P>
<P>
 From there Sam made the rest of his rounds. He stopped by Stan's Record Shop 
at 728 Texas St., just around the corner from the auditorium, where they 
chatted with Stan Lewis, a prematurely white-haired 27-year-old veteran of the 
music business who had started out supplying five jukeboxes from the back of 
his parents' Italian grocery store. Stan had known Sam Phillips ever since Sam 
first went into the business. As the principal independent distributor in the 
area, he was without question interested in this new artist -- but not too 
interested, because not only was the artist unknown, the genre was untried. 
Still, Stan was always open to new talent, he told Sam; what was good for one 
was good for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Elvis meanwhile drifted over to the auditorium. It was bigger than the Opry, 
with spacious dressing rooms for the stars and a large common dressing room on 
the second floor. The folding chairs on the floor could be taken up for dances 
or basketball exhibitions, and the balcony curved around on either side of the 
stage, giving the room a natural echo. He walked out on the stage with his eyes 
fixed on the floor, looked up once briefly as if measuring the crowd, and then 
walked back to the hotel. The Negro shacks in the Bottoms, just a few blocks 
from the grand auditorium entrance, were not much different than the ramshackle 
structures of Shake Rag, the poor black neighborhood in Tupelo, or the 
primitive shotguns of South Memphis; Shreveport's bustling downtown just a 
couple of blocks away was busy and full of life, and when he ran into Scotty 
and Bill in the hotel coffee shop, Bill already had his eye on a pretty 
waitress . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When Elvis arrived back at the auditorium that night, it was completely 
different, transformed by the presence not just of an audience and musicians in 
colorful Western outfits but by the almost palpable anticipation that something 
was going to happen. He was wearing a pink jacket, white pants, a black shirt, 
a brightly colored clip-on bow tie and the kind of two-tone shoes that were 
known as co-respondent shoes, because they were the kind that a snappy salesman 
or a co-respondent in a divorce case might be expected to wear. Scotty and Bill 
were wearing matching Western shirts with decorative bibs and dark ties. Bill's 
battered bass looked as if it were held together with baling wire, Elvis 
cradled his child-size guitar, and only Scotty's handsome Gibson ES 295 lent a 
touch of professional class to the trio. But everyone was taken with the boy. 
Pappy Covington greeted Sam and the boys warmly, as if he hadn't seen them in 
months. Even Horace Logan, renowned not just for his impresario's instincts but 
for his frosty air of self-congratulation, seemed to take to the boy -- there 
was something about him that brought out almost a protective quality, even in 
seasoned professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam left to take his seat in the audience. Although he had put up a brave 
front all day, he really didn't know how it was going to come out, and he felt 
like he should do his best to at least try to cue up a sympathetic response 
from the crowd. He had to admit that he was worried; the boy looked as if he 
was scared to death, and even though you could rationalize that they were all 
experienced veterans by now -- all those nights at the Eagle's Nest, the 
original triumph at Overton Park and of course their Opry appearance -- in 
another way everyone knew that this could be the end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Horace Logan was out onstage. "Is there anyone from Mississippi? Anyone from 
Arkansas? Let's hear it from the folks from Oklahoma. Now who here's from 
Louisiana? Now how many of y'all are from the great state of Texas?" A mighty 
roar went up as the Western Union clock on the wall registered 8 o'clock 
precisely and the band struck up the familiar Hayride theme, based on the old 
Negro "minstrel" song, "Raise a Ruckus Tonight." "Come along, everybody come 
along," the audience all joined in, "while the moon is shining bright/We're 
going to have a wonderful time/At the Louisiana Hayride tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 A tall, skinny singer from Shreveport with a television show in Monroe sidled 
up to the new sensation -- he was barely 20 himself and had been knocked out by 
Elvis Presley ever since hearing the first record at Jiffy Fowler's Twin City 
Amusements, a jukebox operation in West Monroe. "I said, 'Hello, Elvis, my name 
is Merle Kilgore.' He turned around and said, 'Oh, you worked with Hank 
Williams.' I said, 'Yeah.' He said, 'You wrote "More and More" (a No. 1 hit for 
Webb Pierce in the fall of 1954).' I said, 'Yeah.' He said, 'I want to meet 
Tibby Edwards.' It was the first thing he said to me. Tibby recorded for 
Mercury, and he was a star. I said, 'He's my buddy, we room together here in 
Shreveport.' And I went and got Tibby and introduced him to Elvis. That's how 
we got to be friends." 
</P>
<P>
 "JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO,"intoned announcer Frank Page's impressively measured 
radio voice, "a young man from Memphis, Tenn., recorded a song on the Sun 
label, and in just a matter of a few weeks that record has skyrocketed right up 
the charts. It's really doing good all over the country. He's only 19 years 
old. He has a new, distinctive style. Elvis Presley. Let's give him a nice hand 
. . . Elvis, how are you this evening?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Just fine, how are you, sir?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You all geared up with your band -- " 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all geared up!" 
</P>
<P>
 "To let us hear your songs?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'd like to say how happy we are to be out here. It's a real honor for 
us to hav -- get a chance to appear on the Louisiana Hayride. And we're going 
to do a song for you. You got anything else to say, sir?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm ready." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gonna do a song for you we got on the Sun record, it goes something 
like this . . ." And with that, he launched into the first side of his first 
Sun single. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheers that went up from the audience were encouraged by Frank Page and 
Horace Logan as they stood to the side of the Lucky Strike backdrop. The 
microphones hanging out over the floor were turned up when Scotty took a 
somewhat uncertain solo, and the audience politely responded. Elvis was visibly 
nervous, his knees were practically knocking together, and the jackknife action 
of his legs was about all, Sam Phillips was convinced, that was preventing him 
from blowing his brains out. The reaction was not all that different from the 
one he had gotten on the Opry -- he was so ill at ease it was hard for the 
audience to really like him, even though it was clear to Sam that they might 
want to do just that, that they were ready, like Memphis audiences, to respond 
to the boy's charm . 
</P>
<P>
 In between shows Sam went backstage to talk to Elvis. Merle Kilgore noticed 
them off in a corner huddled together as Sam exhorted Elvis to just relax: The 
people were there to see him, just let them see what you got, put on your kind 
of show, if it didn't work, well, the hell with it, at least we can say we 
tried. Elvis, Merle noted, looked like he was scared stiff. Sam Phillips went 
to take his seat among the audience; after a little while the trio came out to 
do their two numbers, but this time it was entirely different. Much of the 
younger audience from the first show had stayed for the second, and now they 
were ready for what the new singer had to offer. For Sam it was a moment never 
to be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a college up in Texarkana where Elvis' records had gotten hot, and 
some of the young people from that college had turned up. Well, when he got 
through that first number, they were on their feet -- and not just them either. 
Some big fat lady -- I mean, it took an effort for her to get up, and she got 
up and didn't stop talking, right in the middle of the next number, she didn't 
know who I was, she just said, 'Man, have you ever heard anything that good?' 
And, honestly, the tonal impact couldn't have competed with the Maddox Brothers 
and Rose, or the Carlisles, who had been on the week before -- I mean, they 
were pros . But Elvis had this factor of communication, I think the audience 
saw in him the desire to please, he had that little innocence about him, and 
yet he had something about him that was almost impudent in a way, that was his 
crutch. He certainly didn't mean to be impudent, but he had enough of that 
along with what he could convey that was just beautiful and lovely -- and I'm 
not talking about his physical beauty, because he didn't look that pretty then 
or that good-looking, by conventional standards he should have been thrown off 
that stage. But I calculated that stuff in my mind: Are they going to resent 
him with his long sideburns -- that could be a plus or a minus. But when he 
came through like he did, it was neither. He stood on his own. " 
</P>
<P>
 He did the same two numbers that he had for the first show -- there were no 
encores, because Mr. Logan was very strict about encores, you didn't take one 
unless there was a genuine eruption of the sort that overwhelmed Hank Williams 
when he sang "Lovesick Blues" seven times in a row and could have kept going 
all night. For Elvis and Scotty and Bill it wasn't anything like that, but all 
three grew visibly more confident, and Elvis, for all the terror that had just 
engulfed him, responded warmly to the crowd's enthusiasm for him. Some of the 
Hayride veterans, like 27-year-old Jimmy "C" Newman, who had just had his first 
big hit with "Cry, Cry Darling," regarded the proceedings with a certain amount 
of suspicion. "I'd never seen anything like it before. Here comes this guy, I 
guess you could almost call him an amateur, rings of dirt on his neck, but he 
had it all right from the start. He didn't work into it, he just knew what he 
was going to do. We'd just stand in the wings and shake our heads. 'It can't 
be, it can't last, it's got to be a fad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he scared them a little (in the first show)," said Merle Kilgore. "He 
was really on the toes of his feet singing. I think they thought he was going 
to jump off the stage. But when he came back out, he destroyed them -- by now 
they knew he wasn't going to jump off the stage and beat them, and they 
absolutely exploded." 
</P>
<P>
 "What he did," said Jim- my "C" Newman, "was he changed it all around. After 
that we had to go to Texas to work, there wasn't any work anywhere else, 
because all they wanted was someone to imitate Elvis, to jump up and down on 
the stage and make a fool of themselves. It was embarrassing to me to see it -- 
Elvis could do it, but few others could."

 After several seasons of natural looks, makeup is back in town. With sexy, 
aggressive clothes all the rage, faces now call for strong, dramatic makeup. 
Last season's berry lip shades have given way to bolder colors, from blood red 
to hot fuchsia, which are best when finished with a touch of gloss.

PROFILE; THE SPIRITUAL SPIN; PEGGY WEHMEYER'S JOB AS THE ONLY RELIGION 
CORRESPONDENT IN NETWORK NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIA PRODIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peggy Wehmeyer was a just a fledgling TV reporter filing routine stories on 
Texas train wrecks and homicides when she established a reputation as a breed 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "They send me on spot news, I come back with God," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 13 years ago that she first reported a religious angle on a news story 
-- a mother's faith after her son's death, a plane crash survivor's questions 
of mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Wehmeyer, a devout Christian, is ABC's religion reporter, the only 
religion correspondent in network television. 
</P>
<P>
 Wehmeyer was selected by anchorman Peter Jennings, who wanted to add a new 
dimension to "World News Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 "The role religion plays in today's society needs to be fully explored," 
Jennings said when she was hired in January. He sent Wehmeyer out to "examine 
how faith, religion and spirituality interconnect with government and social 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 She came back with an interview with President Clinton -- one of her first 
stories at ABC -- who said he considered himself "a person who has sinned as a 
child of God, who has sought forgiveness, searched for redemption and is 
struggling to grow and struggling to find the guidance of God in this job." 
</P>
<P>
 She also has covered stories about anti-Semitism, prayer in school and a 
Baptist minister's tormented life. 
</P>
<P>
 Media watchers say religion coverage on the major networks is something that 
has too long been ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wonder why all the networks haven't done it," says Robert O. Wyatt, 
a journalism professor at Middle Tennessee State University and author of a 
study about the media's coverage of religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the general challenge is that all reporters recognize that religion 
is a potent force in American life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyatt's study, conducted last year for the Freedom Forum at Vanderbilt 
University, concluded that there is more ignorance about religion than bias in 
the average newsroom. It also concluded that the nation's newspapers and 
broadcasters largely refuse to take religion coverage seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 A study done by the Media Research Center, a conservative watchdog group that 
looks for liberalism in the media, found that only 211 of 18,000 network news 
stories in 1993 dealt specifically with religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peggy Wehmeyer is a positive step. But how many stories has she done so far? 
I would say less than 10," says Tim Graham, associate editor of the Media 
Research Center publication "Media Watch." 
</P>
<P>
 "You could argue that Wehmeyer's stories are better stories, but the number of 
stories are not going to increase greatly in 1994 vs. 1993," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Wehmeyer's boss, ABC producer Sally Holm, said fellow journalists at ABC 
struggled with the idea of hiring a "Southerner, a born-again Christian." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're not used to seeing these kinds of stories on the air. They 
have to get used to using Jesus in pieces," Holm says. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason it has taken so long for a network news program to get serious 
about religion coverage, she said, is that it's "tough television." 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, you can't take pictures of angels," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wehmeyer, 39, became a religion reporter at ABC affiliate WFAA-TV in Dallas in 
1981, convincing skeptical editors that religion stories were hot news. She was 
considered a pioneer then -- and remains so in her new job today. 
</P>
<P>
 A wholesome and energetic mother of two, she grew up without religion. Her 
parents separated when she was a child and her father took her and her siblings 
to live in Mexico and the West Indies. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until she was a student at the University of Texas at Austin that 
she found God when a Christian speaker on campus "turned on the light." A year 
later, she learned her mother was a German Jew -- a family secret -- and that 
many of her relatives had fled the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Shocked and confused, she went to Europe to visit relatives who survived 
concentration camps. Her Christian faith was unshaken, she says. To her mind, 
the only difference between a Christian and a Jew is that Christians believe 
the Messiah has come. 
</P>
<P>
 Wehmeyer has studied the Bible diligently for 20 years and attends a 
nondenominational evangelical church. She also studied at the Dallas 
Theological Seminary and worked there as its information director. 
</P>
<P>
 She considers herself a religious conservative, but does not align herself 
with the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 And she rebuffs a suggestion that her religious bent might make her biased. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the religion police. I'm a journalist," she responds. "I have no 
agenda or need to convince people that my view of the world is correct. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a good journalist -- whether you're an atheist, a born-again 
Christian, a Muslim or a Jew, you should be able to cover religion well. And I 
would say that someone who has faith has a good chance of doing it well."

ART NOTES; MURALIST REFURBISHES HIS GETTY CREATIONS 
</P>

 The murals on the J. Paul Getty Museum's garden walls have been seen by 
millions of visitors since the Malibu institution opened 20 years ago. But who 
knew that the artist who painted -- and is now restoring -- the realistic 
likenesses of columns, garlands and still-life arrangements is Garth Benton, a 
third cousin of Thomas Hart Benton? The 53-year-old artist never met his famous 
relative, an American regionalist painter who rejected modern abstraction and 
championed a muscular style of realism until his death in 1975. But the younger 
Benton was turned on to art at the age of 8 when he saw a book of his 
relative's paintings, and he occasionally corresponded with the late artist, 
who spent much of his life in his home state of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 Garth Benton, a Los Angeles native who moved to Carmel in 1981, studied art at 
UCLA and Art Center College of Design. He found his artistic niche when he saw 
an 18th-Century-style mural at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 22 at the time, and I knew that was what I wanted to do," he says. 
"I've always loved art history, so it was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than pursue a trademark look of his own, he learned to emulate art of 
many different periods. "My style is not to have my own style. Instead, I 
assimilate characteristics of the period I'm depicting," he says. "Here at the 
Getty, the murals are part of the ambience. Nobody is supposed to say they are 
better than the art in the museum." 
</P>
<P>
 The Getty murals are re-creations of paintings discovered in a country house 
near Pompeii and now in the collection of New York's Metropolitan Museum of 
Art. Norman Neuerberg, a scholar of Greek and Roman antiquities, researched the 
motifs, which Benton executed in acrylic paint on the plaster walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Water damage, concrete shrinkage and seismic movement have caused cracks and 
flaking in the murals over the past two decades. Returning to the Getty this 
past summer, Benton has filled fissures and repainted damaged areas of the most 
elaborately decorated garden wall. During the coming year he will refurbish 
remaining sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Repair work might seem to be a bit of a bore, but Benton is delighted with the 
project. "This is like going home," he says.

 NEW YORKERS IN PARIS: The new American Center in Paris, which opened in June 
with a show of work by young Los Angeles artists, will feature two New York 
veterans in its second major exhibition. "Leon Golub and Nancy Spero: War and 
Memory," scheduled for Sept. 30-Jan. 15, is a dual retrospective of works by a 
couple who have been artistic and marital partners for more than 40 years. 
Drawing and painting in a figurative, Expressionist mode, Golub and Spero have 
created separate, distinctively styled bodies of work. Their joint exhibition 
will feature pieces from the 1950s to 1994 that deal with issues of war and 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Katy Kline, director of the List Visual Arts Center at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, and List Center curator Helaine Posner have organized 
the show, which will be on view at the Cambridge institution from April 15 to 
June 25. 
</P>

<P>
 ON THE MOVE: Susan Mullin Vogel, founding director of the Museum of African 
Art in New York, has been named director of the Yale University Art Gallery in 
New Haven, Conn. She succeeds Mary Gardner Neill, who left Yale in May to 
direct the Seattle Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Noriko Gamblin, curator at the Long Beach Museum of Art since 1990, will 
become director of exhibitions at the Santa Monica Museum of Art, starting 
Sept. 19. Praising Gamblin's curatorial acumen, SMMA director Thomas Rhoads 
said her exhibition record is "one of the most distinguished in the region."

THE CHARTS: BIG IMPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some big surprises on this week's Times Southern California pop album chart. 
The biggest is the "3 Tenors in Concert," which entered at No. 2 -- and even 
more impressive, at No. 4 on the national pop chart. Classical music albums 
simply don't generate this kind of sales. But fans were eagerly awaiting this 
album, which was taped at the heavily-hyped Dodger Stadium show last July. Luis 
Miguel, another unlikely entrant in the pop Top 10, opened at a startling No. 5 
with his "Segundo Romance." It did well nationally too, debuting at No. 29. TOP

JAZZ SPOTLIGHT; GREAT TALENT RISES TO THE TOP

<P>
 CHARLES MINGUS 
</P>
<P>
 "The Complete Town Hall Concert" 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Note Records  
</P>
<P>
 * * * * 
</P>
<P>
 As with so much that was associated with Charles Mingus, this recording 
chronicles one of the most confused and erratic performances of his often 
confused and erratic career. Originally intended as a big band (30 players) 
album recorded live before an audience, it gradually deteriorated into a 
painful sequence of false starts, technical disarray and musical uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Then why the four stars? 
</P>
<P>
 Because despite the problems (many of which were carefully noted in the 
negative press reviews that appeared at the time) there are occasions when the 
playing explodes with the utterly unique creative energy that was 
characteristic of almost everything Mingus ever did. Equally important, and 
perhaps sadly so, the album -- with a roster of players that includes Eric 
Dolphy, Clark Terry, Charles McPherson, Charlie Mariano, Zoot Sims and Jerome 
Richardson -- is a powerful reminder of the remarkably varied currents that 
were coursing through jazz in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Very few pieces work well in their totality; the recording engineers made sure 
of that. And, except for some typically fascinating textures, there are better 
examples of Mingus' compositional skills elsewhere. But the choice individual 
moments are more than worth the price of admission: Mingus' eccentric brass 
scoring on "Please Don't Come Back From the Moon"; Jaki Byard's piano and Sims' 
tenor on the same piece; Mingus' virtuosic bass solo on "My Search"; gorgeous 
alto choruses by McPherson and Mariano, also on the same number; a mesmerizing 
alto saxophone-bass dialogue between Dolphy and Mingus on "Epitaph, Part I," a 
roaring collective improvisation by the orchestra on "Epitaph, Part II"; 
Mariano's passionate alto solo on "My Search." 
</P>
<P>
 And so on, to name only a few. It may not be Mingus at his best, but it's a 
superb illustration of how great talent can manage to prevail against all odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four (excellent).

NEW RELEASES; PALMIERI TAKES NEW ROUTE WITH HELP FROM FRIENDS

<P>
 "Palmas" 
</P>
<P>
 Elektra Nonesuch  
</P>
<P>
 * * 
</P>
<P>
 After five Grammys and over 25 recordings of salsa and jazz, pianist Eddie 
Palmieri has very little left to prove. Which is perhaps why this new album of 
original compositions and arrangements -- his first purely instrumental album 
-- while ensemble-perfect, is largely uninspiring. 
</P>
<P>
 In this octet format, Palmieri blends Latin percussion (with the piano acting 
almost entirely as the percussion instrument it is) with jazz winds and brass. 
And while each tune firmly establishes a feel-good Latin rhythm, there is 
little venturing out or variation, not only within each song but also in the 
record as a whole. The album starts off with a bang with its signature piece, 
but what follows are mainly variations on "Palmas."  
</P>
<P>
 At the piano, Palmieri sticks to keeping the Latin beat, and his solos, even 
"Bolero Dos," the only piece in which he is highlighted, are mostly chordal and 
lacking in melodic line. Palmieri himself said "Palmas" strives to combine two 
individual factions, Latin and jazz, with the jazz musicians soloing over the 
Latin rhythm section. While this formula is exciting, by never deviating from 
it the music's creativity is compromised and the excitement is eventually lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended), four stars (excellent).

CRITIC'S PICK: 'THE SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kenneth Turan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As evocative as its name, Tran Anh Hung's exquisite 1993 film recognizes that 
out of illusion can come reality. Although its re-creation of the streets and 
houses of prewar Vietnam was shot exclusively on a sound stage outside Paris, 
it is remarkably persuasive.And though there is no lack of incident or emotion 
in "Papaya," it is primarily a fable-like memory film in the unhurried pace of 
Vietnam past. This is symbolized by Mui, first glimpsed as a 10-year-old girl 
(Lu Man San, right) arriving in Saigon in 1951 to become a servant for a 
well-to-do family and who learns from older servant Thi (Nguyen Anh Hoa, left) 
what it means to perform ordinary tasks with delicacy and grace (Cinemax 
Wednesday at 8 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

 Whoopi Goldberg and Ted Danson's romance proved fleeting, but it gave a 
terrific charge to this lively and entertaining 1993 romantic comedy.Goldberg 
plays the successful owner of a Berkeley bookstore devoted to African culture 
and the single mother to a pretty 17-year-old (Nia Long). When Long discovers 
that she was conceived via a sperm bank donation, she becomes determined to 
find the unknown donor-father -- who turns out to be the San Francisco Bay 
Area's gaudiest, hardest-selling car dealer (Danson). Beeath a raucous surface, 
"Made in America" actually has much to reveal about the multicultural society 
in which we live (Cinemax Saturday at 6 p.m.). Kevin Thomas

 In an age of contrived sentimentality, director Wayne Wang and Amy Tan's 1993 
film from Tan's best-selling novel offers deeply felt, straight-from-the-heart 
emotions.A story of distance and how to bridge it, of painful gaps between 
immigrant mothers and U.S.-born children, it has the strength and clarity of 
its source. While their names are largely unfamiliar to general audiences, the 
eight actresses who play the film's four pairs of mothers and daughters are not 
only the pick of several generations of acting talent but also women who 
understand these characters from the inside out. Pictured here is France Nuyen 
comforting Lauren Tom (Showtime Saturday at 10:30 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; TEEN-AGE GIRL STANDS UP TO SEXUAL 
HARASSMENT IN 'BOYS WILL BE BOYS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You're a high school sophomore. You haven't even been on a date yet. But 
suddenly your classmates are looking at you funny. Sometimes they laugh, 
sometimes they say rude things. Then you hear that there's a stall in the boys' 
bathroom covered with graffiti, and it's all about you. You don't understand. 
You haven't done anything . And no one, not the school counselor or the 
principal, will help you. 
</P>
<P>
 For Minnesotan Katy Lyle, that scenario was all too real. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's "ABC Afterschool Special: Boys Will Be Boys" is loosely based on 
Lyle's story. In the special, Ali Cooper (Ami Dolenz) eventually fights back, 
brings an awareness of sexual harassment to her school and community and, like 
Katy, changes laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Boys Will Be Boys," Ali finally reaches a breaking point and confesses to 
her parents (Joan Van Ark and Larry Wilcox) what's been happening to her at 
school. When they try to take action, her parents find the school's 
administration as unhelpful as Ali does. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of situation depicted in the special has existed for a long time, 
says executive producer David J. Eagle ("Kids Killing Kids"), hence the title 
(and a counselor's comment in the show) of "Boys Will Be Boys." "No one really 
addressed it until some very brave teen-age girls actually came out," Eagle 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Several girls, three in California and two in Minnesota (one was Katy), spoke 
out about the harassment they had been facing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to show kids it's OK to fight back and just because you're a 
kid, it doesn't mean that you don't have any rights," says Dolenz, 25, from her 
San Fernando Valley home. "Most people think sexual harassment only happens in 
the office, but it happens in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolenz stresses that victims must let their parents know what's happening. 
Embarrassed, Ali at first tries to handle the situation herself: She not only 
talks to the administration, she also tries to clean the graffiti off, with her 
brother's help. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, through persistence and good advice from her parents and a 
therapist, she gets results. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's actually a very sad story turned into a triumphant one," Dolenz says. 
"Her life could have been destroyed. So much of her childhood was taken away, 
in those two years of harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a snowball effect," Eagle adds. "No one really knows how these things 
get started. Someone writes something on the wall, it starts to spill over with 
other kids saying 'Maybe, you never know . . . ' and then it becomes almost a 
mass hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
 For Eagle, the show has two very important points: "To show other teen-age 
girls that they don't have to take that kind of behavior from boys or anyone 
else. The second aspect is to show boys just how hurtful that 'fun, cool' 
behavior can be and that writing something nasty is just plain hurtful." 
</P>
<P>
 While Dolenz hopes that the show will open the eyes of teen-agers and their 
parents to prevalent, disturbing and unacceptable behavior, Eagle says, 
realistically, "This show isn't going to put a stop to sexual harassment, but 
it will let girls know that they did nothing to deserve it and that one girl 
who took action ultimately affected the lives of thousands of other boys and 
girls. Directly and indirectly her reaction helped many." 
</P>
<P>
 The cast not only includes Van Ark (who also directed) as Ali's mother but 
also Richard Karn ("Home Improvement") as a sympathetic teacher, Dorothy Lyman 
("Mama's Family") as the school counselor and singer Jeremy Jordan as one of 
the harassing boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "ABC Afterschool Special: Boys Will Be Boys" airs at 3 p.m. on ABC. For ages 9 
and up.

PRIVATE LIVES / KIDS BEAT; RAFFI IS BACK AND RELAXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lynne Heffley, Lynne Heffley is a Times staff writer.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After his unsuccessful venture to cross over into the adult music market a few 
years back, Raffi, the children's music superstar of the late 1970s and '80s, 
who was dubbed both "the Bruce Springsteen" and the "Elvis" of the preschool 
set, has recorded a new album, his first new children's music studio recording 
in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Bananaphone," an MCA Records release due Tuesday, isn't a return to the 
mellow-voiced Canadian's "Baby Beluga" days of crooning to the diaper brigade. 
</P>
<P>
 Eclectic, uneven, at times delightful, this is for those old enough to enjoy 
the wordplay in such comic kid-pleasers as the title track ("Operator, get me 
Beijing jing jing") and "Slow Day" ("It's a day dreamin' day o' dreamin' / 
Turtles out walkin' all 'round town / Slugs slidin' / No bunnies hoppin'. ") 
</P>
<P>
 Raffi's public concerns for global harmony and ecological preservation are 
represented in paeans to natural farming and the Earth's "First People," with 
only a hint of the humorless crusader heard on the edgy 1990 release 
"Evergreen, Everblue." 
</P>
<P>
 The album's relaxed touch, sophisticated instrumentation and fine-tuned lyrics 
make it adult-friendly too. So do the surprises: Who would have expected to 
find "The Schmenge Polka" on a Raffi album? It's the singer's instrumental 
tribute to a fellow Canadian, the late John Candy.

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; IF YOU'RE 'MAD' ABOUT HER NEW 'FRIENDS,' YOU'VE GOTTA 
LOVE LISA KUDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lisa Kudro's glad she's got "Friends." 
</P>
<P>
 And she's very thankful NBC has told her they're still "Mad About You." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting this week, viewers get a double dose of Kudro, who's in both NBC 
shows this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kudro, who plays hippy-dippy Phoebe on the new ensemble show, will continue to 
play ditzy waitress Ursula on the network's hit "Mad About You." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping to continue on 'Mad' and be on 'Friends,' " she says from her 
West Hollywood apartment. "It's great it worked out this way!" 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old Tarzana native may play airheaded blondes on both shows, but 
she's an Ivy League grad with a degree in biology who had every intention of 
going to medical school and follow in her father's footsteps. Her dad's a 
world-renowned headache specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretly, though, Kudro was always interested in comedy -- she performed 
through junior high. But by high school, she then "took school very seriously" 
and became devoted to studying. Was she a brain at local Taft High? She 
responds modestly: "I guess I was . . . a couple of people called me 
'Einstein.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Einstein? Certainly there couldn't be a nickname more incongruous for Phoebe 
or Ursula. 
</P>
<P>
 Kudro laughs and says there might be a little bit of Phoebe and Ursula lurking 
in her: "Sometimes when I'm really concentrating on something, I tune out 
everything else and that makes me seem airy, I guess. I studied all the time in 
high school and wanted to get into a good school. That was very important, so 
by the time I got to Vassar, I was happy and smiling all the time, so a lot of 
people thought I was stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 While at Vassar she was determined to become a researcher. She explains in a 
very un-Phoebe or un-Ursula way: "I've always been interested in evolutionary 
biology, specifically, I'm interested in looking at the evolutionary behavior, 
how it's biochemically translated. It's neuropsychological pharmacology." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this interest in heady things, she was finally sidetracked by 
encouragement from her older brother's best friend: comedian Jon Lovitz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known him since I was 3," she says. "And when I confessed I was 
interested in comedy, he suggested I go for it." 
</P>
<P>
 She became a member of the comedy troupe The Groundlings, which led to a 
recurring role on "Bob" and other television guest spots. 
</P>
<P>
 She may have caught the public's eye with her quirky role in "Mad About You," 
but "Friends" executive producers and creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane 
("Dream On") didn't recognize Kudro during her audition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly didn't connect the name with the face," Kauffman says in a phone 
call from the "Friends' " set. "Most actresses could 'get' Phoebe, but Lisa 
made her a real person, and made her funnier. She brings us wonderful jokes and 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Phoebe, Kauffman points out, addresses all of the "New Age" folks preoccupied 
with spirituality. But the character isn't without her pathos. "She brings the 
show humor from an odd place," the producer says. "The character has such a 
dark and strange background and continues to have a positive view of the world 
and just wants to help everyone. Lisa just embodies all that in the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all this good will and good luck, Kudro wishes she could feel just a 
bit more confident. "I have a weird superstitious side," she confides. "All 
these good things are happening, and it makes me think that something bad might 
happen. That probably sounds really annoying! But I really love both shows!" 
</P>
<P>
 She does however, feel confident enough to pursue even more. There may be a 
one-woman show in the works. And, like most newly popular actors, this windfall 
has brought her enough financial reward to consider a new house and maybe a new 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Those dreams may become reality if her new show takes off: "Friends" has the 
enviable "hammock" slot between "Mad" and "Seinfeld." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mad About You" and "Friends" air Thursdays on NBC at 8 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. , 
respectively.

THE KILLER ELITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am astonished that The Times would publish a letter as racist as Rosemary C. 
Watson's bizarre and slanted vision of white males as "natural born killers" 
(Sept. 4). To suppose that anyone is more or less prone to vicious behavior by 
nature of their race requires a "Forrest Gump"-like innocence, or self-imposed 
ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent massacres in Rwanda and Somalia clearly demonstrate that not all blacks 
live in harmony outside the influence of the American media. Similar acts of 
aggression in Asia, the Middle East, the former Yugoslavia and Northern Ireland 
suggest that all races are equally capable of horrific bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, individuals of all races decide for themselves whether to practice 
tolerance or violence. I, for one, will not surrender my individuality to any 
supposed influence of media or ancestry.

 Watson should be more concerned with young black males seeing Snoop Doggy Dogg 
and Tupac Shakur as heroes, rather than worrying that they are being 
brainwashed into believing Billy the Kid is a figure to be admired.

 I suggest that Watson look deep inside her emotions and examine the guilty 
pleasure she feels when she makes a generalized attack on a group she considers 
to be a convenient and easy target while maintaining a delicious sense of moral 
righteousness. If she does this, she will begin to understand the true nature 
of prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 If she harbors no such feelings, then I apologize to her for being wrong; but 
I am no more wrong than she is in carelessly and erroneously labeling me as a 
"natural born killer."

QUIZMASTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bronwen Hruska's article "They Conned America" (Aug. 28) gave us a 
comprehensive review of the TV quiz-show scandals of the late '50s, now being 
turned into a movie. But I'd like to add a personal note about one of the 
figures involved -- the late Dan Enright, co-creator of "Twenty-One" with Jack 
Berry. 
</P>
<P>
 I met Dan in later years, and we became good friends. Did you know that Dan 
helped start television in Israel? And let's not forget the Emmy Award he 
received only a few years ago for a top TV movie of the year, the beautiful 
Hallmark Hall of Fame special "Caroline." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan and his companion, Susan Stafford, sponsored Arab-Jewish workshops in 
conflict resolution. He proved to be one of the most generous, gentle and 
talented human beings I've ever met. 
</P>
<P>
 If we're going to mention Dan's legacy, I think we should mention this side of 
it as well.

<P>
 I know Bronwen Hruska was writing about the quiz-show scandal, not about the 
life of Charles Van Doren. But couldn't she have told your readers something 
more about Van Doren's post-quiz-show life? Couldn't she have at least 
acknowledged his monumental 1990 book "A History of Knowledge," called by the 
San Francisco Chronicle "no less than the summation of the human race from the 
bird's-eye view of a tremendous, encyclopedic intelligence"? 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Van Doren's intellectual contributions are part of the "great ideas" 
movement -- that the great ideas of world civilization should form the core of 
all education -- promulgated by Robert Maynard Hutchins, his father and uncle 
Mark and Carl Van Doren and his intellectual mentor Mortimer J. Adler. The 
importance of the great ideas traditions, and his contribution to it, will be 
recognized and appreciated long after an evanescent commotion about a TV quiz 
show has been forgotten.

 May I recommend a Pope in the eye with a sharp stick for permitting your 
correspondent to get away with last Sunday's Letters page misquotation of the 
18th Century's most particular wit. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the way it usually goes: 
</P>
<P>
 Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,  
</P>
<P>
 As, to be hated, needs but to be seen;  
</P>
<P>
 Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,  
</P>
<P>
 We first endure, then pity, then embrace.  
</P>
<P>
 Hair-splitting academic snit aside, I'm glad to see printed before the eyes of 
millions -- well, several tens of thousands -- even partially accurate words 
from a guy who understood what moral venom was all about. I wonder if Rush 
Limbaugh, just before he heats up the mike, reminds himself, "I am getting into 
the ring with Mr. Pope"?

ROBIN ABCARIAN: SWEET RELIEF AFTER DAYS OF SICKNESS AND DOUBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For two weeks, our 2-year-old was sick -- really sick. Sleepless-nights sick. 
High-fevers sick. Shrieks-of-pain-from-mouth-sores sick. 
</P>
<P>
 We administered Popsicles and pain relievers, tepid baths and tender caresses, 
antibiotics and animal picture books. Nothing worked on the intolerable virus. 
Even the passage of time, that most reliable curative, seemed to fail us. 
</P>
<P>
 The only true relief she found was in the antics of Larry, Moe and Curly. She 
requested "The Three Stooges" ad nauseam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you like to watch Barney?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, Mommy," she replied, sounding deeply disappointed in me. "Tooges." 
</P>
<P>
 I'd put them on, but she'd watch with glazed eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 We were worn down by an invisible force that turned our robust cherub into a 
skinny, sunken-eyed waif. We would do anything to make her feel better. Stooges 
marathon at midnight? Why soitenly! Pudding in bed? Of course. Soda pop for 
breakfast? You betcha. 
</P>
<P>
 My daughter's doctors have been baffled by the tenacity of the bug, concerned 
especially that it showed no signs of abating after the usual 10-day viral 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there something amiss with her immune system, they wonder, something that 
allows a virus free reign? 
</P>
<P>
 Or is the virus so strong that it simply overwhelmed her ability to fight it, 
effectively shutting down her bone marrow's production of infection-fighting 
blood cells? 
</P>
<P>
 Important questions. And, for the moment, ones without answers. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A sick baby can really test your faith in yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 You think you're a good parent, a concerned and loving parent, a hygienic 
parent. Yet you agonize over what you have done to cause your child this 
plague, and what you might have done to prevent it.  
</P>
<P>
 You become vulnerable to theories floated by people you barely know. Could 
your baby-sitter's sister-in-law be right -- that the dogs have been allowed to 
lick the child's face too freely? 
</P>
<P>
 A sick baby sears you with the brutal truth of what it means to act in a 
child's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 You go to the hospital once, twice, three times, and hold her as still as you 
can while a sympathetic man in a white lab coat sticks a long needle in the 
crook of her elbow and sucks out her ruby red blood. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a perfect angel every time, unaware of the betrayal about to take 
place, as he swabs her with disinfectant, tightens a rubber strap around her 
arm to bring the vein into relief.  
</P>
<P>
 And when the needle pierces her tender baby flesh, you want to scream with 
her, partly because you know how much it hurts, but mostly because you can't 
believe that you are the agent of this treachery. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of protecting her from pain and harm, here you are -- her mother, her 
father -- offering her up to the gods of hematology in exchange for information 
you hope will make her well. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a rotten trade-off. 
</P>
<P>
 In a busy life, where the one precious commodity you lack is time, you finally 
have it in abundance when your child is sick. Your days take on a repetitive, 
circular quality, very much like the first few months of her life, when all you 
did was feed her, change her and hold her. 
</P>
<P>
 For two weeks, we floated in a kind of fugue state, rising each morning 
certain that our daughter would feel better that day. And each night, we would 
turn off the lights, her febrile little body between us, downhearted but 
putting our trust in tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though time felt suddenly languid in our house, a ring of the telephone 
reminded us it was operating full speed elsewhere: One day, while our daughter 
was in the throes of her fever, my father called to say my grandmother, who 
turns 90 this week on the same day my daughter turns 2, had fallen and hurt her 
head at the old folk's home. She is confined to bed now and may have to be 
moved to a convalescent hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, my mother called with news of a sharp pain in her head, 
requiring a four-hour emergency room visit, until doctors ruled out anything 
serious and sent us away. 
</P>
<P>
 I brought my mother to our home for the night. It happened that my adult 
stepdaughter was visiting from out of town and was suffering her own physical 
ailments, including a painful, swollen ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 We joked about running a hospital, not a home. Our laughter sounded forced. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, my stepdaughter's ankle suddenly felt better. A much-anticipated 
workout machine, ordered over the phone, finally arrived on my mother's 
doorstep, and she was anxious to get home and set it up. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, after two long weeks, our little girl woke up famished. She 
inhaled her food and asked for more. We were cautiously optimistic. Later, 
though, she did something that signaled the definitive restoration of health. 
</P>
<P>
 She pretended to walk into the bedroom wall, then grabbed her nose in mock 
pain and uttered three incomparably magical words: 
</P>
<P>
 Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; THE GOOD FIGHT; WHEN HE WAS GROWING UP, JAMES WASHINGTON 
HAD A REPUTATION FOR TALKING WITH HIS FISTS. NOW THE FOOTBALL POWERHOUSE HELPS 
THOSE IN HIS OLD WATTS NEIGHBORHOOD FIND A BETTER WAY TO SURVIVE.

<P>
 James Washington of Watts, Whittier and the Dallas Cowboys, the fierce hitter 
who is known in pro football as "Drive By," acknowledges at least two other 
interests: making it as a businessman and helping people in the old 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends from UCLA still remember the night of the first Phi Beta Sigma dance 
of Washington's freshman year there. All evening, instead of dancing, he stood 
by the entrance to the frat-sponsored community fund-raiser. Around midnight, 
Sigma brother Vinson Boyce recalls finding him there. "I haven't seen you on 
the floor," Boyce scolded. "What are you doing?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Counting the house," Washington said. "Nobody's going to get in here free." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington had gotten into the habit of looking out for himself, even when 
there was no one to look after him. Before age 10, living alone at times, he 
would sometimes steal a few bucks to share with less resourceful friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on my own, more or less, since the day my father skipped town," he 
says. "He's out there some place, if he's still alive." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother liked to drink. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had two choices, and she chose alcohol over me," Washington says. "Those 
are all bad memories. Let's talk about something else." 
</P>
<P>
 He would have never survived, he says, without his maternal grandfather, his 
first football coach, two Jordan High classmates and his wife, Dana. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his high school friends, he says: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tragedy what happened (to my family), but when I knew them, no kid was 
ever luckier than me. Keith Solomon kept me going to class. Richard Green kept 
me off drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Green has since dropped out of sight, and Solomon is dead. As he emerged from 
a fast-food restaurant one day six years ago, a neighborhood bully senselessly 
shot him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mourning his boyhood friends, Washington says: 
</P>
<P>
 "So many are dead." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 James as a boy was on the bubble, as they say in sports. He could have gone 
either way: street chemist or football champion.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Dana Washington 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In each of the last two years, "Drive By" Washington, a defensive back who 
stands 6 feet, 1 inch tall and weighs 210 pounds, has helped bring the Super 
Bowl championship to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 But to get to the title game last year, the Cowboys first had to beat San 
Francisco. On one memorable play, the 49ers sent their best receiver -- 
record-setter Jerry Rice, 6-2, 200 pounds -- cruising into Washington's 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington smashed him flat. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Rice tried to get up, Drive By lifted an arm in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 In the locker room, a reporter asked Washington: "How did that feel?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt great," he replied. "I think I readjusted the guy's vertebrae." 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, Washington can be like that -- unsmiling, brutal. But he isn't 
always like that. In a more civilized setting, he can be sunny, merry, 
attentive. 
</P>
<P>
 One who knows nothing but Washington's softer side is Sweet Alice Harris, a 
living saint who founded the Parents of Watts. She operates nine shelters for 
homeless parolees, pregnant women, the mentally ill and others, and in the 
off-season Washington helps out, giving those who pass through someone to look 
up to. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Sweet Alice: "You can't imagine how wonderful it is having James around." 
</P>
<P>
 His opponents in pro football don't put it quite that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two biggest hitters of the '90s are (former) Bruins," says veteran NFL 
coach Sid Gillman, "Ronnie Lott (of the New York Jets) and James Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Hitting, Washington says, is a skill he has been perfecting since high school. 
While classmates Solomon and Green were struggling for his soul, Washington was 
getting into fights -- in hallways, alleys, anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to go down that avenue to solve all my problems," he says, "except 
I've never hit a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 His last fight in Watts came on what turned out to be his last day at Jordan. 
After completing his course work for graduation at midyear, he had been 
anticipating one last, easy semester. As he headed for the basketball floor one 
afternoon, a friend approached him, crying. She said she had been sexually 
abused by a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 As Washington tells it now, he went looking for the man, found him in an 
office and picked a fight, knocking him down and out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're suspended," the school authorities told Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't suspend me," he said airily. "I'm leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 That very week he enrolled at UCLA, returning to Jordan only once, on 
graduation day in June. 
</P>
<P>
 At 18, he fathered a child, a daughter named Shanel, whom he helps support. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's wonderful," he says. "She lives with her mother. I love my little 
daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how bright you are, you can't make it out of Watts without two 
things: role models and exposure. Somebody has to introduce you to the real 
world.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Anthony George, Washington's business partner 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't easy to get from where Washington was to where he is. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, rising above a boyhood in a tough neighborhood means, he says, 
"you've got to lose your friends -- leave them behind. If you don't, they'll 
eventually let you down. What you see and what they see are totally different." 
</P>
<P>
 The man who raised him, his late grandfather Eddie Alexander, pounded that in. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 10 or thereabouts, Washington recalls, he and his friends got caught 
shoplifting. They were arrested and taken to the police station, where 
Alexander came to pick up James. 
</P>
<P>
 Putting him in the passenger seat of the family truck, Alexander drove a few 
blocks, then reached out suddenly and smacked his grandson in the chest so hard 
that the boy flew out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he stopped the truck and picked me up, took me home, and whupped me with 
a handful of hangers," Washington says. "That made an impression." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington remembers that he sometimes got along with his grandparents, but 
not his uncles or mother. "One died of drugs, one died of AIDS, and I don't 
know what happened to Uncle Billy -- or my mother, either," he says. "Grandma 
was an invalid, but my grandfather worked hard and took good care of her and 
all four kids. And all four turned out to be bums." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Alexander also did what he thought was best for his willful 
grandson. Concluding that James was smart but too ornery to deal with, he built 
a little shack for the boy to live in behind the house. "I was a loner then," 
Washington agrees, "and a troublemaker." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was about to enter his teens, Washington's mother persuaded him to 
move in with her for a while. He remembers being left alone one day with no 
food in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 So at dinner time, "I went down to the (supermarket) and made myself a ham 
sandwich," he recalls. "They don't arrest you if you don't take the food out of 
the store. The best part was the soft white Weber's bread. All we (ever) had at 
my house was hard bread." 
</P>
<P>
 He walked around the store until he finished eating, then walked away. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, he is a soft-white-bread freak. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I knew his mom (as a child) . She was a lovely little girl in those days when 
she came in with her brothers.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Paul Brown, barber 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first time Washington saw the inside of the Continental Barber Shop, a 
Watts landmark, he was 5 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came with Eddie Alexander -- his grandfather," says Paul Brown, who, with 
partners Joe Sampy and Frank Simmons has been running the shop for 36 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "That chair over there, Eddie set him down right there," Brown says, pointing. 
"Then he turned to me and said, 'I've lost one boy, but I'm not going to lose 
this one.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He was right about that. I don't know what happened to Eddie's oldest boy, 
but this whole part of the city is still damn proud of Pookie." 
</P>
<P>
 That was Alexander's name for his grandson, and to the Continental regulars 
it's still his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "As in POOHkee," Brown says. 
</P>
<P>
 For as long as he can remember -- almost a quarter-century -- Washington has 
been coming to this barber shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Three photos of him hang on the barbershop wall -- along with those of many 
others. Hardly centerfold material, each pictures a celebrated homeboy -- 
rappers and such -- who made it out of Watts but returns to the Continental for 
haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
 When Washington slides into the open chair one summer afternoon, the customer 
to his left -- Hardy Obey, a food distributor -- tells his barber to hold it a 
minute and starts firing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know Jerry Rice is my favorite player," Obey says. "I've told you before. 
Next time, don't hit him so hard." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sorry," Washington says. "I forgot." 
</P>
<P>
 Another local walks in and takes a seat where others are waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was you," the young man tells Washington. "I was across the 
street when you came in here, but I recognized you from the Super Bowl game." 
</P>
<P>
 "Were you there?" Washington asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I was in jail," he answers. "They had some good instant replays of your 
touchdown. Congratulations. Where you off to (today)?" 
</P>
<P>
 Washington says he's en route to a building he owns at 46th and Western. He 
hopes to convert the structure into another shelter for Sweet Alice Harris and 
the Parents of Watts. He will call it Shelter 37, after his jersey number. 
</P>
<P>
 The young man shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't go there today," he warns, explaining that an off-and-on gang 
treaty is off in that neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are getting 'jacked there right now," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington thanks him for the tip, pays the barber, says goodby and hits the 
street. As he climbs into his black BMW, he rethinks his plan to drive up 
Western. His fresh fade cut and perennial headband wouldn't be much help. His 
aging shotgun rider wouldn't be any help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's go another day," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's very sad. In South - Central, a lot of intelligent brothers don't know 
any better than to screw up.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Kelvin Tolbert, Washington's business partner 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Year-round, a pro football player protects and pampers his one priceless 
asset. And so Washington lifts weights seven mornings a week in the off-season 
at an uptown Whittier health club. He also works out twice a week at Los 
Angeles Southwest College, focusing on his speed with Coach Henry Washington, 
his old Jordan High mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 During one recent session, a young passerby stops her bicycle and, addressing 
Henry but looking steadily at James, says: "I'll bet you're proud of your son." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry grins. Although no relation to James, he is also a well-built, 
commanding figure. "I'm proud," he says, "of all my sons." 
</P>
<P>
 His proteges, he means, women as well as men. Two are Olympic champions: 
sprinter Florence Griffith-Joyner and hurdler Kevin Young. 
</P>
<P>
 But Washington the coach didn't have much hope for Washington the player the 
first time they met. That day in the Jordan High locker room, James had gotten 
into a fight and was punching away on a bigger boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop that," Henry roared, and they did. But when the other kid ran off, James 
sneaked down the street after him. The fight was on again when Henry caught up. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Jordan High," he yelled, "every boy in my class does exactly what I say. 
The next time you don't, you're through." 
</P>
<P>
 James recalls that he was "considering a smart-ass" rejoinder when something 
in the coach's eyes made him pause. Although a high school junior, he had never 
played a day of football. He knew he was drifting. He yielded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, sir," he remembers saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington believes his life turned that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've listened to Coach Washington ever since," he says. "He is my friend. 
He's the father I always wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Later at UCLA, he would find the brothers he always wanted. Three of his Phi 
Beta Sigma fraternity pals became his Westside business partners: Anthony 
George, Kelvin Tolbert and Vinson Boyce. 
</P>
<P>
 Each had excelled at UCLA and had shown an aptitude for business, as well as a 
sense of personal responsibility for the community. Their frat set a UCLA 
record for most service projects: They painted rooms for the elderly, and 
collected food and clothing for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 That affinity for good deeds still figures in what they do today as equal 
partners in the Summation Financial Co., where Washington oversees community 
service projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical scenario, a man arrived at Summation headquarters, at La Brea and 
Stocker Street, not long ago and said: "I've had a job I like for three years. 
I don't have a lot of money, but we'd love to have a house of our own." 
</P>
<P>
 Tolbert, who handles such clients, said: "If you could put 3% down, maybe we 
could help." 
</P>
<P>
 Four months later, he could and they did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homeowners take better care of their homes and their neighborhood," Tolbert 
says. "We spend a lot of time pushing ownership." 
</P>
<P>
 They also spend money pushing other community improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we put $100,000 into Shelter 37," George says. "We had it about 
ready to open just before the great (Northridge) earthquake came along and 
ruined it. They've red-tagged the building -- and now things are back to square 
one. The $100,000 is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The structure would have been the centerpiece for expanded Parents of Watts 
programs, housing job-training classrooms and the accredited adult school that 
Sweet Alice Harris maintains. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake was a downer," Washington says. "We needed that building 
because we're not just out to help the homeless. We want to help those who want 
to help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy who just comes in to sit and be fed and clothed isn't growing. They 
should graduate to different levels. First read and write, next a training 
program, then a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Sweet Alice puts it: "We don't believe in just giving you a fish. We'll 
teach you how to fish. Then take you to the river." 
</P>
<P>
 She remains optimistic about acquiring the money to open Shelter 37. "I was 
raised by compassionate people in a Jewish family (who) gave me faith," she 
says. "I have faith that somehow we'll get that building yet." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I grew up mad at the world, but since then I've always thought of myself as a 
feisty, short-tempered person with a kind heart.  
</P>
<P>
 -- James Washington 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contemplating his boyhood, Washington, now 29, is convinced that his mother 
was changed by whatever led her husband, also named James, to run away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she would have been a great mom if my father had been there," he 
says. "The guy left her holding the bag. And left me hanging out in the 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
 No one has ever told Washington what happened, and he hasn't wasted any time 
trying to find out. Instead, he set about making sure things would be different 
for his own son. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, "a man should have a name of his own," Washington says. "And 
Richard Washington has it." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard, 3, lives with James and Dana in a cheerful two-story, four-bedroom 
Colonial built in 1938 on one of Whittier's big corner lots. A lattice-covered 
patio leads to a detached game room that doubles as James' office. 
</P>
<P>
 Other inhabitants include two dogs, a rabbit, countless fish of various 
descriptions, a peacock, a pet pig and it's hard to tell what else. "I started 
out to be a veterinarian," Dana explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, with a communications degree from UCLA, she went to work for CBS as a 
writer-producer in the promotions department. Now, she free-lances. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana brought James to Whittier when they were still UCLA students. They chose 
a condo first. Her parents live nearby. Her father, Charles, is an aeronautical 
engineer at Rockwell. Her mother, Beverly, is a midwife at Martin Luther King 
Jr.-Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana recalls the night in 1990 when, sitting around a fire, she and James 
plotted the arrival of their son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only care about three things," James told his wife. "Your health and his 
health -- and I want to be here when he's born." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, friend," she replied, "that will take some careful planning." 
</P>
<P>
 Because James is off playing football more than half the year, the couple had 
a target window of barely five months. "Just to be safe," she says, "we closed 
it to three months -- February, March and April." 
</P>
<P>
 On March 15, 1991, her husband the football player was dressed for the 
occasion, like an operating-room surgeon or nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 "James cut the umbilical cord," Dana says. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the game room, thinking back, he says: "I make my living hitting 
people, but she's tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Super Bowl XXVIII, James accounted for 17 of the Dallas Cowboys' first 27 
points. In Super Bowl XXVII, he made the first big play, the interception. He 
got them going both times.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Henry Washington, coach 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 One sports truism is that NFL players, to play well, must be willing to play 
in pain. They hurt all season long, from the first scrimmage in July to the 
final play in the dead of winter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pain that shot through Washington's left side after a three-man 
collision during a game in New Orleans was a little different, a little wilder. 
A teammate had hit him in the back just as he hit an opponent in front, and the 
blow dislocated a shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just popped out, and stuck," Washington says. "I tugged at it, but I 
couldn't push it in, and I couldn't pull it in, either. It wouldn't move." 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the sideline, he dropped to one knee and purposefully smashed the 
shoulder into a bench. That fixed it, and he was back on the field for the next 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the bravest things I've seen," a Dallas sportswriter who observed the 
incident said later. 
</P>
<P>
 In his four years in Texas, "Drive By" Washington has given Cowboy fans a lot 
to see. He's generally up there with club interception leaders, usually leads 
the defensive backfield in tackles and forced fumbles, and always delivers big 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
 His specialty, though, has to be big-game excellence. Playing for the Super 
Bowl championship in January, he scored on a fumble return, set up another 
touchdown with an interception, and forced a fumble that put his team in 
field-goal range. The Cowboys won the game that the Buffalo Bills led well into 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 He is, nonetheless, one among many good NFL players -- unless you count what 
he does after a big game. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, two days after the Super Bowl, Washington rented a truck, drove to 
Rams Park in Orange County and picked up a load of surplus football shoes, 
football pants, sweat shirts and the like. Then he distributed them to 
South-Central schools and playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Rams equipment man Todd Hewitt: "James phoned to remind us that he'd be 
here with a big truck as usual. He comes every year. Most players would be 
thinking about the Super Bowl. He was thinking about the Super Bowl and 
South-Central." 
</P>
<P>
 But he won't help just anyone, Washington says. He tries to help only those 
who try to help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here because I took advantage of the advantages I had," he says. "The 
guys I feel sorriest for are the ones who get a break and don't take 
advantage." James Washington

 The thing is, the desert is like a giant sandlot without boundaries and that's 
why people play in it. They have to.It beckons them, reawakens that childhood 
yearning, the one that knows joy is so very, very important. And the endless, 
gritty waves of the Imperial Sand Dunes practically beg for someone to romp 
through them. So they come by the thousands from all over the world to tiny 
Glamis, at the southeastern corner of California. They camp out, barbecue, but 
mostly, romp in buggies and ATVs. It's a place for families; a beach party 
without the water, so the sand doesn't stick. You can just dust yourself off, 
and get right back to riding the waves. ADRIENNE M. JOHNSON

JUMPING BEAN BOUNCES BACK; C'MON -- YOU REMEMBER THE FUN OF HOLDING ONE IN YOUR 
HAND. NOW THE LITTLE CURIOSITIES ARE HOT ONCE AGAIN.

 It's nothing they did, but Mexican jumping beans had been as scarce here as 
nickel candy bars. They are back in force, though, and merchants can't seem to 
keep them on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids are buying them. Adults are buying them. Sold three at a time in little 
plastic boxes (usually for 99 cents), jumping beans have leapt back into the 
hearts and minds and pockets of many Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt about it, it's a fad item and they came back in vogue this year," 
said Steve Choate, a buyer for American Drug Stores, Chicago-based parent of 
249 Sav-on drug stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Sav-ons in Southern California began selling the little ambulatory pods last 
month -- and at many locations, they sold out within a week. Before that, they 
were only available locally at half a dozen or so independent retailers and 
specialty chains, such as Kay-Bee Toys. The beans, a seasonal item harvested 
from small desert trees in Mexico, have been more widely available elsewhere in 
the country all along. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ship 3 to 5 million beans each year," said Joy Clement of Chaparral 
Novelties in Alamogordo, N.M., "and their popularity remains constant. We've 
had them out every year for the last 32 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Why haven't you seen much of them here? Simple, Clement said: She hasn't had a 
good distribution system in place in Southern California. Ron Miller, a novelty 
buyer with American Drug, said that as soon as the company hooked up with 
Clement (he calls her "the jumping bean lady"), he knew they had a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much you can buy at a retail store that can give you this kind of 
satisfaction for under a buck," Miller said. "It's one of the last of the 
low-end entertainments available in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody we talked to, whether they were in their 20s, 30s, 40s or 50s, had 
had beans in their life," Miller said. "Parents and older people were just as 
turned on as the kids. They remembered their own childhood, marveling at the 
movement in their hands and not understanding why. Though it's obvious 
something is going on in there, I never knew until dealing in jumping beans 
that there was some sort of life in them." 
</P>
<P>
 There's life in there? * 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. There's a quarter-inch caterpillar trapped inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Has the SPCA been notified?  
</P>
<P>
 The caterpillar wants to be in there. Make a hole in the pod and it'll patch 
it up within a couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
 How does it breathe?  
</P>
<P>
 The shell of the pod is porous. 
</P>
<P>
 What does it eat?  
</P>
<P>
 It eats the seed inside the pod. 
</P>
<P>
 What does it do for water?  
</P>
<P>
 The jumping motion produces metabolic water at the rate of 1% of its body 
weight each day, which is comparable to humans.  
</P>
<P>
 "We pee, they don't," said Mahlon Kriebel, professor of physiology at State 
University of New York at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a professor in New York got to do with Mexican jumping beans?  
</P>
<P>
 He's using the beans to teach chaos theory, a field that has revolutionized 
mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The life story of a jumping bean begins when an adult moth, Laspeyresia 
saltitans ( saltatory meaning "to jump"), lays an egg in the flower of the 
yerba de la flecha tree ( Sebastiana pavoniana ) . The shrub is native to the 
Sonoran desert, particularly near the Rio Mayo in the Mexican states of Sonora 
and Chihuahua. The center of harvesting operations is Alamos, several hundred 
miles south of the U.S. border. 
</P>
<P>
 As the shrub's flowers develop into seed pods, the moth eggs hatch and develop 
within the pods. The pod falls off with the developing larva imprisoned. The 
larva metamorphoses into a pupa, which remains dormant during the winter 
months. It emerges, through an escape hatch prepared by the larva, as a moth in 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The caterpillars have a very strong activity span of six to eight weeks that 
begins with their fall from the tree. The caterpillar moving is what makes the 
bean jump. And the jumping is what causes the clattering that is the bean's 
natural marketing ploy when it reaches shelves at checkout stands.  
</P>
<P>
 "We begin shipping in July and we continue to ship through the first two weeks 
of September," Clement said. "The rest of the year, people think (the beans) 
are dead because they're not jumping."  
</P>
<P>
 How do you know if you've got a real live jumping bean? Shake it. If it 
rattles, it's a dud. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kriebel has been studying the beans for years and has written several 
scientific papers (as yet unpublished) on the subject -- including "The Jump of 
the Mexican Jumping Bean," which is also the title of a video he is developing. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperature has a dramatic effect on how the bean jumps, and that makes it an 
excellent candidate for scientific study, Kriebel said. "Here is a motion that 
can be controlled by one parameter, drastically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Study the interval between jumps. When it's periodic, they're going 
tick-tick-tick. When they're cooler, it looks as if they're jumping randomly, 
but if you analyze the data, you see that it's not random at all. They develop 
a pattern, mathematically what we call 'chaos.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In chaos theory, past observations enable the observer to make short-term 
predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you're below this magic 62 degrees, the beans jump chaotically," 
Kriebel said. "If you know the pattern, you could amaze your friends by 
predicting the next movement." 
</P>
<P>
 That type of amazement is what he hopes will lead the beans to do no less than 
revolutionize the field of education. It is a field that he and a group of 
fellow New York scientists see as increasingly geared toward preparing students 
for the SATs and little else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I teach at a medical school, and over the last 25 years, I've seen a real 
fall-off in general-interest biology," Kriebel said. "Many students have not 
had hands-on experience with something alive. Instead, there is a fascination 
with computers, as if computers will ask and solve problems. All the teachers 
try to do now is teach for the SATs. There's a lack of real-world activities, 
and we're heading toward a monoculture." 
</P>
<P>
 Kriebel and his colleagues began to look for hands-on activities that would 
combine various disciplines such as math, biology and physics. Using piles of 
popcorn to monitor earthquake phenomenon was one. The jumping beans, which 
exhibit circadian rhythms and are sensitive to temperature and vibrations, were 
another, and results of experiments could be easily replicated. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories in Tonawanda, N.Y., the 
scientists hope to see their educational project introduced in high schools and 
colleges by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bean made its jump to the United States from Mexico with a big push from 
Clement, the primary importer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in the early '60s, my husband was a traveling candy wholesaler," Clement 
said. "One day he came home with jumping beans and said he wanted to start 
selling them. I told him he had rocks in his head. I'd grown up with them in 
the Texas Panhandle, and I didn't see people spending money for them. The next 
year we were in business. It's a very odd business, to say the least." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. Because the jumping bean is both animal and vegetable, it's fraught 
with a unique set of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an insect, so the population will fluctuate like any population. It's a 
crop, so it's weather dependent: If there's too little rain or if rain doesn't 
come at the proper time, the shrubs don't bloom -- and for Clement, that's crop 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jumping beans are always popular, but we've lost customers because we can't 
guarantee our ability to ship every year," she admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 The beans are harvested from the desert floor and shipped by Clement to the 
United States. They are also sold unpackaged as a curio along the border, but 
in Mexico itself, the jumping beans are less of a novelty. 
</P>
<P>
 Away from Mexico, even delivery of the beans can cause excitement. A United 
Parcel Service driver abandoned his truck when he decided he was carrying a 
rattlesnake; explosives experts were called in and a building evacuated when a 
shipment passing through O'Hare Airport was thought to be a ticking bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jumping beans don't bite or explode, but they have their share of other 
quirks.  
</P>
<P>
 Light makes the pod snap back and forth. Put it on a hot plate, it'll jump 
real fast. In nature, the pod's ability to jump may allow it to move off a hot 
rock or away from hot sand into the shade. "If the pod were to sit in direct 
sunlight, it could roast the larva inside," Kriebel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pod has one rounded surface and two flat surfaces, joined at a 120-degree 
knife-edge -- a common packaging angle found in nature. The larva crawls about 
inside the pod, weighting it asymmetrically. 
</P>
<P>
 Kriebel calls the "crochet hooks" on the caterpillar's legs the "original 
Velcro system." The larva can make the pod jump by jack-knifing its body and 
snapping it back and forth; it anchors its rear end with the hooks, stretches, 
bends over backward, contracts and releases. Not unlike a rubber band. 
</P>
<P>
 The larva is about a third lipid (a nice word for fat), a third water and a 
third protein. The lipid is converted into carbohydrate, the carbohydrate into 
an energy source. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the amount of lipid, we've calculated that the beans have the 
capability of doing about a million jumps," Kriebel said. "But they turn into 
moths before that happens." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the larva jumps about 500,000 times before it pupates into a 
chrysalis. In a cool room, the larva will jump from August to December. In a 
refrigerator it can remain in the larval stage until spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put them in a refrigerator, take them out in January and they'll still be 
jumping," Kriebel said. "You've slowed down their clock." 
</P>
<P>
 Before metamorphosis, the larva makes a one-millimeter escape hatch in the 
shell wall. After its transformation, the adult moth pushes through the hole, 
abdomen first, and flies away in hopes of beginning a new generation of jumping 
beans. Clement believes that only the strongest survive the process, while 
Kriebel believes that most of the larva turn into moths. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that they turn into moths is what keeps jumping beans out of the 
House of Humor in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get them in because there are bugs in them," said owner Sharon 
Newberg. "First, they have worms, then they become butterflies or moths. I got 
one in the mail, I put it on the shelf, and forgot I put it there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have costume rental. I don't know if they're born in there or put in there, 
but they eat their way out of the shell. They come out of the bean and they eat 
the clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 An almost universal misconception, Kriebel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larva eat clothes, moths don't. And this moth would never lay eggs in 
clothes." This far from its beloved yerba de la flecha tree, the moth won't 
reproduce; here or there, it dies within a few days of emerging from the bean 
shell.  
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the United States deems the beans safe for importation (they're 
considered nontoxic if swallowed, but please don't). 
</P>
<P>
 Some retailers, such as Puzzle Zoo in Santa Monica and Teachers Supply in Long 
Beach, have never been squeamish about the beans and carry them as often as 
supply allows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, Mexican jumping beans are an impulse item," Clement said. 
"People don't go to the store to buy them, but the clatter they make attracts 
your attention. If they're jumping, you're going to hear them. Making all that 
racket, they sell themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is amazing when you stop and think about their value -- which is 
simply the curiosity that they inspire, in adults as well as children. They're 
all fascinated by them." 
</P>
<P>
 That includes scientists, of course. As much as they can tell us about the 
bean, at its core there remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the beans jump to get out of the heat," Kriebel said. "Maybe they jump 
to generate metabolic water. . . . They may need to jump, but we don't know why 
they're jumping. That's why it's such a thrill."

 The fortuitous juxtaposition of Labor Day weekend and Rosh Hashanah meant that 
the Jewish year closed with a bang. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention that also closing out its season was Lollapalooza 4 at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills, which didn't spawn the expected traffic jams as much as 
it did some pretty hellacious parties -- namely Sunday and Monday night's 
rocker-filled fetes at the Chateau Marmont hosted by Lollapalooza performers 
Nick Cave and the Beastie Boys, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, just down the Strip at the Mondrian, "Twin Peaks" corpse Lara Flynn 
Boyle hosted the very-much-alive Summer '94 Pool Bingo Party on Sunday 
afternoon and evening, with a portion of the proceeds going to benefit Heal the 
Bay and AIDS Project Los Angeles. Among the models and actors who peopled the 
pool area was nearly due Rosanna Arquette, proudly dressed in a tight, 
pregnant-form-fitting Adidas suit, while the bands and deejay were chased 
indoors by noise-conscious neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But although TV- and movie-star sightings may get ho-hum during such a 
party-packed weekend, this was not the case at Charlie Sheen's birthday bash at 
Babylon on Sept. 3. While the expected crop of Sheens/Estevezes and other 
garden-variety personalities who showed up did generate a little head-turning, 
it was nothing compared to the hubbub that greeted the arrival of 
struggling-actor-turned-megastar-witness Brian (Kato) Kaelin. Just goes to show 
what being at the right place at the right crime can do. 
</P>

 Bong, Bong, Bong Went the Gallery: And who could resist attending the opening 
Saturday at 2000 B.C. for what owner Craig X Rubin calls "the first-ever bong 
art show"? Displayed in the gallery adjacent to this clothing and gift 
pro-hemporium are artist Ivan Gomez's fanciful and -- though none dared try -- 
functional, er, objets d'art. There wasn't much trouble, legal-wise. Like 
Magritte used to say, "Ceci ne pas une pipe." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 End for the Innocents: Finally, at the other end of Melrose Avenue -- if not 
the wholesomeness scale -- "The Brady Bunch" (the movie) held its wrap party at 
a Paramount sound stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The extremely Brady-like gathering drew more than 200 guests including 
director Betty Thomas, Shelley Long and much of the new Brady cast, as well as 
Susan Olsen and Christopher Knight -- the TV Cindy and Peter. 
</P>
<P>
 An all-ages alternative to bongs and Babylon, this squeaky-clean affair never 
descended to anything more decadent than roast turkey, mashed potatoes and 
green beans along with innocuous carnival games. 
</P>
<P>
 We're sure Alice would have approved.

A STORY THAT'S MUSIC TO HER EARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for the refreshing article on Dion Grant and his musical motivation 
program for students ("The Music Moves Him," Aug. 29). Finally, a voice is 
heard about the positive motivation of students through contemporary music. 
</P>
<P>
 I had the good fortune to observe Dion's program at Gardena High, Jordan High, 
Emerson Jr. High, Madison Jr. High and Wright Middle School, all in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District. The special emphasis on respect for teachers 
and cooperation with school rules are only a part of his success. Student 
morale improves when he presides over a program at a time when it is essential 
to improve their self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure of success in this program is Dion's unique ability to convince 
students we still look up to them, still expect them to achieve academically, 
still respect them and that school really isn't a "downer." Hopefully, the 
business world will support this old-fashioned idea, which ultimately inspires 
students to academic achievement.

NOT ALL DOCTORS ARE CREATED EQUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the feature "It's a Control Thing" (Aug. 30) contains some valuable 
information about talking to your doctor, the descriptions of different kinds 
of doctors are incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor of osteopathy (D.O.) is a fully licensed physician who prescribes 
drugs, performs surgery and has the same privileges and responsibilities as a 
medical doctor (M.D.).Osteopathic schools have curricula similar to medical 
schools but with more emphasis on the musculo-skeletal system and spinal 
manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 A chiropractic doctor, on the other hand, receives less training and 
consequently has a more limited license involving physical manipulation and 
adjustment of the spine. Most states do not allow chiropractors to prescribe 
drugs or perform surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 An allopath is not an alternative practitioner. Allopathy , in fact, is a 
broad term that means conventional medicine. A naturopath, however, is an 
alternative practitioner who believes disease is caused by the accumulation of 
toxins and waste products in the body. Naturopaths are not licensed in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the headline of the article is disturbing because it implies that 
doctors don't want their patients to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Not true! 
</P>
<P>
 Good medicine is based on mutual trust where both the doctor and the patient 
feel free to communicate about very personal matters. When this communication 
fails, the patient and the doctor both lose.

'LITE LOVERS' OFFER TRUE FRIENDSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a male fitting the description of a "lite lover" ("Platonic Plus," Aug. 29) 
-- i.e., straight, never married, no children, plenty of female friends -- I 
think your article missed a very salient point: 
</P>
<P>
 Some men do believe women when they say "no." If a man can admit that 
lovemaking does not always have to include sex, then he'll always have lots of 
female "friends" and not many female lovers.That is another sad story unto 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 A large part of this stems from the confusion faced by women when a man 
actually listens. 
</P>
<P>
 She: "Let's not, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 He: "OK." 
</P>
<P>
 She: "What do you mean, OK?"  
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from a strictly personal point of view, I want a woman to make love 
with me because she wants to, not because she feels she is succumbing to 
pressure, real or imagined. Maybe that's the crux of the whole issue -- sex 
isn't worth it unless there's tension involved? With a "lite lover," you don't 
get tension, you get a true friendship that extends beyond the physical realm.

DEATH AND TERRORISM ARE NEVER FUNNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Robin Abcarian's column on Carlos the Jackal ("Carlos Takes 
Tinseltown? He Could've Been a Terror," Aug. 24): Your article -- intended to 
be witty, I am sure -- was in terribly bad taste. Shocking.There can never be 
anything funny about people bleeding in airports after being machine-gunned or 
planes being blown up. 
</P>
<P>
 There must be a thousand ways to poke fun at Hollywood. Terrorism is 
definitely not one of them. On that day, your pen should have dried up.

JACK SMITH -- YOU GOTTA LOVE HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Smith's column over the years has been a shining ray of reason in a 
country where most people seem incapable of recognizing superstitious or 
supernatural baloney when they see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack should consider UFO lover John Norkin's letter, ("Jack Should Stick to 
Earthly Matters," Sept. 4) a badge of honor. I'm sure Jack will continue to 
show the UFO silliness for the garbage that it is -- just as he has done for 
several decades. That's why we love him.

SURVIVING THE CHILLS AND HOT FLASHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm tired of reading nothing but Little-Mary-Sunshine responses to your piece 
"Feminists Face Off in War Over Menopause" (Aug. 9). 
</P>
<P>
 I had chills, I had hot flashes, I was nuts and I went through the five years 
without taking estrogen. I have absolutely no regrets. I wasn't sick, just 
menopausal. 
</P>
<P>
 So I didn't luck out and have a smooth transition. So what? I'm 68 and I don't 
have to deal with any of the side effects (one friend who's on estrogen and is 
70 still has her periods -- I don't).

 TITLE HOPES: To the list of young athletes from Northridge who have bounced 
back in fine form after January's earthquake, add Meilen Tu's name. The 
tennis-playing Tu, 16, is one step away from winning a U.S. Open girls' 
division title. . . . Tu defeated Kim de Weille of the Netherlands, 7-5, 6-4, 
in a semifinal match Saturday at Flushing Meadow, N.Y., and will face Martina 
Hingis of Switzerland today.

 SOUL SEARCHING: Joseph (JoJo) Sanchez has a dream: establishing 10,000 
churches and 10,000 youth academies to win people to Christianity. . . . Right 
now, Sanchez has a celebrity of sorts at his youth camp in the Antelope Valley. 
Daniel Ramos, better known as the ubiquitous tagger Chaka, is at Sanchez's 
Youth Academy U.S.A. trying to learn to use his artistic skills for a higher 
calling (B1).

<P>
 CRICKET: Football isn't your fancy, and baseball's still on strike. What's a 
Valley sports fan to do? Watch cricket (above), of course. Each Saturday and 
Sunday, Woodley Park in Van Nuys is the site of matches between teams in the 
Southern California Cricket Assn. And it doesn't cost a bloody dime. . . . 
David Heaney, an Australian native, says, "The players are more involved than 
they would be in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 SCHWAB'S, THE SEQUEL: We all know about Schwab's, the famous drugstore where 
legend says actress Lana Turner was discovered. . . . That landmark closed its 
doors on Sunset Boulevard in 1983, but one of its original proprietors, Leon 
Schwab, has given his blessing to his grandsons to open a new Schwab's in 
Encino (B1).

 A DAD REMEMBERED: Lori Retig believes her father, Dennie Plese of Valencia, 
would be alive today if only he'd had a chance to speak to the gunman who 
ambushed him last week during his rounds as an armored car guard (B1). . . . 
"If this guy had said to my dad, 'Give me the money, man,' my dad would've 
said, 'Do you want my watch, too?' My dad easily would have done something 
quick-witted," says Retig.

VAIL TRIES TO BURY PLAN TO BUILD A CEMETERY, BUT IT JUST WON'T DIE; COLORADO: 
VOTERS REJECTED PROPOSAL LAST YEAR, BUT CITY SEEMS ON VERGE OF DOING IT ANYWAY. 
FOES SAY DEATH VIOLATES TOWN'S IMAGE. 
</P>

<P>
 As the aspens begin turning gold, the focus of political debate in America's 
top ski town is what to do with the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a nagging sense that real communities make room for those who lived 
and worked in them, even after they die. So the town government wants to build 
a cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 A plan to build one on the sloping hillside of Donovan Park on Vail's western 
edge has won the top award of the Colorado chapter of the American Planning 
Assn. To forestall complaints about the unsightliness of a cemetery, only 
boulders will be used as tombstones, and they may not exceed 24 inches in 
height. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, however, believe that if anything is buried here it should be noisy 
Interstate 70, which slices through the center of the narrow valley and can be 
heard throughout town and seen from some ski slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters last year rejected funding for a cemetery; a recent survey found that 
sentiment still prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 But the town council is leaning toward authorizing the cemetery, which would 
take up the park's 39 acres, without a new vote. The cemetery would provide 980 
memorial spaces over the next century -- 257 inground plots, 122 crypts and 601 
niches for urns. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Tom Steinberg, a councilman and cemetery supporter, says if the council 
hadn't pushed ahead years ago, against the expressed wish of the electorate, 
the town now would be wall-to-wall condos. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg also sees a cemetery as one way to block the building of more 
condos. 
</P>
<P>
 Ella Knox, a co-founder of the weekly Vail Trail newspaper, doesn't see it the 
same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "A cemetery in Vail is against what Vail is all about. People come here to 
have a good time and ski and enjoy the atmosphere. I think a cemetery for Vail 
is counterproductive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 83 and I know where I'm going to go. I don't believe in burials. I'm 
going to be cremated," said Knox, who lives across the street from the proposed 
cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredibly visible from the interstate, especially in the wintertime," 
said Diana Donovan. Donovan Park is named after her husband, John, in 
recognition of his effort to preserve open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Donovan says cemeteries waste good land in a town so short of it that some 
residents have proposed putting several miles of Interstate 70 underground to 
make more land available. 
</P>
<P>
 Vail was little more than a crossroads until the 1960s when housing was built 
in the valley beneath old sheep pastures. Many resort workers have commutes of 
30 to 40 miles. About 3,700 people live in Vail year-round. In winter, the 
population jumps to more than 40,000. The town draws more skiers than any other 
U.S. resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg, who became Vail's first resident doctor in 1965, said, "A cemetery 
is necessary. We don't have a lot of deaths. But people are dying, and some of 
them have spent the largest part of their lives here." 
</P>
<P>
 One Vail family, he said, already has buried 10 to 12 family members and two 
or three of their closest friends on private property within the town. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jan Strauch, who owns a travel agency, disputes the notion that the 
town needs a cemetery to be a real community. "We have crime, fraud, drugs, 
school problems -- everything everyone else has." 
</P>
<P>
 Strauch says those who want to stay in Vail after they die can have their 
ashes sprinkled on the mountain. He predicts that if a cemetery is built "the 
rich and famous" will buy up plots, as they have much of the rest of the town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to solve anything. Do we do it on a first-come, first-serve 
basis? Do you have to die within the town's boundaries?"

SAFE HOMES SOUGHT FOR PRAIRIE BIRDS IN PERIL; RESEARCH: OKLAHOMA CENTER HELPED 
SAVE HEROIC SPECIES FROM EXTINCTION. NOW IT SEEKS SCRATCH TO KEEP LESS 
GLAMOROUS VARIETIES ALIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Each day, in summer's smothering heat or winter chill, a small army of 
bird-watchers roams 800 acres of Oklahoma outback to check on the "barometers 
of our environment." 
</P>
<P>
 That is how Steve Sherrod describes Southwestern prairie birds, which are 
vanishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherrod is the director of the George Miksch Sutton Avian Research Center. The 
center won a measure of acclaim some years ago for its part in repopulating 
American bald eagles across the Southeast -- a project so successful that the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plans to remove the bald eagle from the 
endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the nonprofit Sutton center, named for a prominent ornithologist and bird 
artist who died in 1982, describes itself as endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, we need money," a desperate Sherrod said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his current five-year project of tracking prairie birds is more 
important, he says, it lacks the glamour of the eagle project. That cause -- 
saving the national symbol -- stirred patriotic juices and opened the 
pocketbooks of contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaming a decline in private and federal funding, Sherrod earlier warned that 
unless the Sutton center raised $250,000 quickly it could shut down. But in 
mid-August, Sherrod said the $250,000 had been raised and would keep the center 
open another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherrod credited Bartlesville rancher and businessman Kenneth Adams, saying 
Adams "made a substantial challenge grant and started the ball rolling." 
</P>
<P>
 He said "Eagles" singer Don Henley, who has been involved in environmental 
work for two decades, also helped the center reach its goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best I can tell you, we are exploring every opportunity possible. Every 
nickel counts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's researchers, in the late 1980s, were among the first to 
successfully fool wild eagles to "double-clutch," or lay a second set of eggs, 
by climbing to the massive nests and stealing the first eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fist-sized eggs were returned to Sutton to hatch in incubators, where 
handlers turned them every three hours to keep embryos from sticking to the 
shells. A week after the eaglets emerged, workers used a hand puppet for 
feeding behind one-way glass. In all, 275 fledglings were released in Florida, 
Mississippi and other Southeastern states. 
</P>
<P>
 The work of tracking prairie birds is a bit more gritty. 
</P>
<P>
 It entails fending off chiggers and fiddleback spiders and ticks that 
sometimes infect researchers with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. It also 
requires competing with other environmental groups -- and other causes -- for 
the elusive dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Major contributors and environmentalists who worked closely with Sutton were 
shocked when the center announced its crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 John West of the Phillips Petroleum Foundation, which gave the center $25,000 
in March, heard about Sutton's money problems from reporters. So did Steve 
Torbit, senior scientist with the National Wildlife Federation in Boulder, 
Colo., who describes Sutton's eagle work as "marvelous." 
</P>
<P>
 Erich Langer, public outreach coordinator in Oklahoma for the Fish and 
Wildlife Service, unequivocally praises Sutton's biologists. But asked about 
its accounting and finances, he said bluntly: "That's a different story." 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton asked for $65,000 this year from Fish and Wildlife but received only 
$4,400. Most of Sutton's money comes from the National Fish and Wildlife 
Foundation in Washington and the nonprofit Sarkey's Foundation in Norman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of floored us. None of us expected any of that to happen," Langer 
said. "We know it's difficult running a place like that. I just wish we would 
have known something a little earlier. It's like, geez, if you don't get the 
money in a month and a half. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The semipublic Fish and Wildlife Foundation gave the center $275,000 in 
matching money this year to study prairie birds, according to foundation 
director Amos S. Eno. Tax records show it gave $294,405 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarkey's gave the center $200,000 this year and more than $1.2 million since 
1983, executive director Cheryl Cartwright said. But Sutton can spend only the 
interest earned on that endowment. 
</P>
<P>
 Eno says federal funding for Sutton dwindled as the eagle project ended. But, 
he asks, why isn't Sutton targeting groups for money outside Oklahoma? Sutton 
recently was approved as one of only four California condor breeding centers, 
and the prairie bird project affects Plains states from Texas to North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Sutton executives insist the center has looked away from its traditional 
contributors in Oklahoma, but without much luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've targeted some chemical companies in the Midwest. So far, other than an 
initial reaction, we haven't been able to get very far," said John Barker, a 
Tulsa attorney who is on Sutton's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more companies are shifting toward human problems -- homelessness 
and hunger," he said. "In some respects, we're chasing similar dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Said board member John Brock, an independent Tulsa oilman: "Foundations are 
short of money these days. We're having a tough time finding anybody who's 
interested." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherrod says lack of money could mean abandoning studies that already are 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to complete the third year of a five-year study," Sherrod said. 
"If you cut them off in the middle, it's like cutting the guy open and 
operating, then saying, 'Oh, we've run out of money. We can't sew you back up.'

SWEETBREADS OFF MENU IN MAD COW FEARS; BRITAIN: AUTHORITIES BAN THE DELICACY 
BECAUSE A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS THAT IT COULD BE INFECTED WITH THE AILMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There's plenty of beef but no more sweetbreads on the menu at Le Gavroche, a 
chic French restaurant here. 
</P>
<P>
 No use going elsewhere. You won't find home-grown sweetbreads, made from 
calves' thymus, on any menu in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has banned foods containing intestine or thymus from calves 
because a new scientific study suggested that they might be contaminated with 
the infectious agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly called "mad 
cow disease." 
</P>
<P>
 The sweetbread alert, in addition to recent threats by Germany to stop British 
beef imports, has focused new attention on the fatal brain ailment that has 
killed 131,050 cattle in the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 The government insists that beef is safe, particularly because all infected 
cows are killed and not used for food. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a similarly cautious approach, the European Union's agriculture 
commissioner, Rene Steichen, recently proposed banning exports of carcasses 
from British herds that had not been disease-free for at least six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Steichen's spokesman, Gerry Kiely, said there was no evidence that mad cow 
disease threatened humans. "We're taking measures to exclude a risk which is 
not there by all evidence," he said in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 British government investigators who did the recent study said it sheds light 
on the basic biology of the illness -- showing how the agent travels through 
the cow's body -- but does not prove that the thymus or intestine are dangerous 
to eat. The ban was taken as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no evidence that even if you ate infected brains you'd get BSE (mad 
cow disease), but the government has to be cautious," said Kevin Taylor, 
assistant chief veterinary officer of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries 
and Food. 
</P>
<P>
 The epidemic has spurred scientific studies exploring the basic biology of 
both the human and animal forms of this puzzling ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a red-hot area of science," said Dr. Gareth Roberts, a neuroscientist at 
Harrow Hospital. "We've learned a lot more about the molecular biology of the 
disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Spongiform encephalopathy is a fatal brain disease striking animals and 
humans, causing sponge-like holes in the brain. Cattle with the disease stagger 
and drool, symptoms giving the disease its popular name. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows what causes the ailment, which can linger for 30 years in humans 
or five years in cows before symptoms strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Cows are thought to have caught the disease by eating offal from infected 
sheep, which has since been removed from their food supply. 
</P>
<P>
 The human forms of the disease, all extremely rare, are called kuru, 
Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (CJD), and German-Straussler Scheinker Syndrome (GSS). 
It strikes less than one in a million people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 People in Papua New Guinea got kuru from eating infected human brains. 
</P>
<P>
 About seven American children and a few in Britain, France and Australia got 
CJD when they were treated with human growth hormone derived from brain tissue 
between 1963 and 1985. Shortly after the link was identified in 1985, most 
countries banned the use of brain-derived human growth hormone and switched to 
genetically synthesized hormone. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people get it from inheriting a faulty brain protein. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no evidence that anyone has ever gotten the disease from eating beef 
from an infected cow. In fact, the human and animal forms may be triggered by 
different agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a slew of studies, no one knows the specific agent that provokes the 
brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The mysterious agent alters the shape of a crucial brain protein, 
progressively destroying the brain, said Professor John Bourne, director of the 
Institute for Animal Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists suspect the agent is a virus-like substance; others say it is 
an infectious protein. 
</P>
<P>
 The new British study offers a glimpse into the basic biology of the illness 
by showing that it somehow travels through the intestine before getting to the 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Government scientists infected 4-month-old calves with BSE by feeding them 
brain stems from sick cows. The calves were then killed two months, six months 
or 10 months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists injected a variety of cow parts into the brains of mice. Those that 
were injected with pieces of small intestine contracted spongiform 
encephalopathy, suggesting the infectious agent lurks in the gut. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the study did not provide evidence that the disease is in the thymus, 
the government officials banned its use for sweetbreads as a precaution.

MOZAMBIQUE SOLDIERS DISARM, FIGHT FOR DISCHARGE; AFRICA: AS PART OF A 
U.N.-SPONSORED PLAN FOR MULTI-PARTY ELECTIONS, TROOPS OF THE FORMERLY MARXIST 
GOVERNMENT AND THE RENAMO GUERRILLA MOVEMENT SLOWLY ARE BEING MUSTERED OUT.

<P>
 After 15 years of civil war, the soldiers at Catemba are fighting again -- for 
faster processing of their discharge papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Government soldiers, like the rebels they battled, are going home. At last, 
their leaders have acknowledged there can be no winner in one of Africa's 
longest wars. 
</P>
<P>
 About 600,000 people died and 1 million fled the former Portuguese colony 
during the war, which ended in 1992 with a peace agreement signed by President 
Joaquim Chissano and rebel leader Afonso Dhlakama. The cease fire has held and 
refugees are returning. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a U.N.-sponsored plan for the first multi-party elections, 
scheduled for Oct. 27-28, troops of the formerly Marxist government and the 
Renamo guerrilla movement slowly are being mustered out. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks after waving machetes and iron rods to emphasize their desire to go 
home, 337 of the soldiers at Catemba did just that in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy because I'm going to restart my life," said Assubihi Sovia. He 
spent three months at Catemba waiting to get out, with little to do but play 
cards and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. rules require that all soldiers and rebel fighters gather at 49 transit 
camps, turn in their weapons and go back to civilian life before the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial and logistic problems have slowed the process -- elections were 
originally scheduled last October. Impatience among the men has led to protests 
like the one at Catemba, a dilapidated former army training base on the Indian 
Ocean coast a ferry ride from Maputo, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the former soldiers have been able to leave Catemba, but more than 100 
still do not know when they will either be demobilized or sent to be trained 
for a new 30,000-man national army of former soldiers and rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of those left behind gathered to see off the lucky ones, but most wait 
listlessly on cots in a warehouse-like barracks with a concrete floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Mozambique or in Africa in general they take their time," said Tom Pardon, 
the Dutch administrator of the U.N. demobilization staff. "But my feeling about 
the whole process is quite positive. We have had no major confrontations since 
the peace treaty was signed." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the estimated 15,000 rebel fighters have shown up at the 20 transit 
camps assigned to them, but only 35,000 of the 50,000 government soldiers to be 
demobilized have checked in at their 29 sites. 
</P>
<P>
 By June, only about 2,000 members of the new army had been trained. Behrooz 
Sadry, second in command for the U.N. operation, predicted that no more than 
11,000 would be ready by the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain, France, Portugal and Zimbabwe have contributed trainers, and Italy 
also might help. Aldo Ajello, chief of the 6,000-member U.N. mission, said the 
help would continue until the new army is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the soldiers and guerrillas, 155,000 members of government 
militias were told to hand in their uniforms and weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajello insists that all fighting forces be disarmed before the election in 
order to avoid a repeat of Angola, where Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebels rejected 
their election loss in 1992 and resumed fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 He also feels, however, that Mozambique is different because the rank and file 
on both sides are tired of fighting. "The first one to go to tell the troops 
they must start fighting again, they will start fighting him," Ajello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulo Fopenze Zingue, a soldier at Catemba, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell Dhlakama and Chissano that I don't want any more war -- that's why I'm 
going home," he said, crouching in the sand to examine the clothing and food he 
had received from the United Nations and other agencies to help him make a 
start in civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
 Zingue, 47, fought for 21 years -- first against Portuguese colonialists until 
independence in 1975, then against Renamo. 
</P>
<P>
 He and each of the others going home was given a bucket of seeds and a set of 
farming tools when they boarded buses for home. 
</P>
<P>
 They also got the equivalent of three months' pay in cash, a voucher for 
another three months redeemable in their home provinces, and a "checkbook" for 
18 additional monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly allowances generally match their pay, which ranged from the 
equivalent of $150 a month for the bottom ranks to $2,000 for commanders. The 
government pays the first six months, the United Nations the remaining 18.

'BLACK MILITIA' VOWS A WAR ON PROPERTY; MILWAUKEE: RADIO TALK SHOW HOST CALLS 
FOR 'AGGRESSIVE NONVIOLENCE' UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT CREATES JOBS, IMPROVES 
EDUCATION AND HOUSING, AND TAKES OTHER STEPS AGAINST URBAN POVERTY.

 An outspoken radio talk show host and former city alderman who wants to 
improve conditions for blacks is talking about a revolution -- by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael McGee says he'll recruit blacks around the country to cut phone lines, 
burn tires on freeways and attack other institutions unless the government 
creates jobs, improves education and housing and takes other steps against 
urban poverty by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee calls himself the leader of the "Black Panther Militia." He says his 
revolution would be a war on property, not people, because wealth is what 
whites in power value most. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Americans are so easy to inconvenience, you just block the line at 
McDonald's and they would be upset," McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's aggressive nonviolence," he said. "It's not aimed at people, but it's 
aggressive because you're hitting the people that really matter, like say in 
New York, you put Wall Street out of business for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can murder 100,000 people and it wouldn't have the impact that 
inconveniencing a certain group of Americans would have," said McGee, who has a 
call-in show on WNOV in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests McGee envisions would owe more to the militant Black Panthers of 
the 1960s and 1970s than to the mainstream civil rights organizations that took 
up Martin Luther King Jr.'s methods of nonviolent protest. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee, 44, hasn't reached out to former Black Panthers such as Bobby Seale, 
Elaine Brown or David Hilliard, who continue their activism today using less 
radical means. 
</P>
<P>
 He has no affiliation with the Black Panthers organization, which dwindled 
from 5,000 members to a few hundred in the mid-'70s after arrests, violent 
deaths and manipulation by police and FBI agents. The group still operates as a 
social service organization in Oakland, Calif., where it was founded in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Now McGee says it's time to take up the Panthers' militant legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are dying. In terms of priorities, America is so messed up," said 
McGee, who plans a "call to arms" meeting in New York in February. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, McGee has disrupted a live broadcast of ABC's "Good Morning 
America," started a sausage scare by telling a company that militant blacks had 
spiked its products with rat poison and disrupted speeches by blowing whistles. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee has appeared with about two dozen uniformed members at demonstrations in 
Milwaukee. But he claims to have 1,200 supporters in the city, and similar 
militias in Indianapolis, Dallas, New York, Detroit, Chicago, Atlanta, 
Washington, Los Angeles, Jacksonville, Fla., and Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee police can't tell whether McGee's militia is as large or as 
organized as he claims, but they aren't dismissing his threats, said spokesman 
Lt. Vincent Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee installed a "militia commander," Mmoja Ajabu, in Indianapolis in 1991. 
Ajabu says his followers -- he has never said how many -- will arm themselves 
and "go on the offensive" on Jan. 1 unless the government becomes more 
responsive to blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajabu's group tried to boycott the Indianapolis schools in late August to 
protest allegedly poor treatment of black students, but the protest fizzled 
after drawing little support. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajabu also organized a chapter of the Black Panther Militia in Wedowee, Ala., 
where the high school was destroyed by arson after the principal threatened to 
cancel the senior prom to prevent interracial dating. 
</P>
<P>
 The school burned hours after Ajabu addressed his recruits. He said he didn't 
know who burned the school.

GROUP OFFERS HELP TO AGING SURVIVORS OF NAZI TERROR; NEW YORK: SELFHELP 
COMMUNITY SERVICES TRIES TO HELP THOSE WHO HAVE LIVED THROUGH THE HOLOCAUST AND 
FIND FEELINGS OF LOSS INTENSIFYING AS THEY GROW OLDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly five decades after the end of World War II, even the youngest survivors 
of Nazi persecution are approaching retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
 For these people, who lived through one of the most horrific periods in 
history, aging can be especially difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is important to remember is that as people get older and experience 
loss, it sort of reawakens the losses they've had. For the Nazi victims, it 
brings back all the loss they've had: of a country, a family, a home," said 
Harriette Friedlander, an executive director at Selfhelp Community Services. 
</P>
<P>
 At Selfhelp, where victims of the Nazis have been going for aid since it was 
founded in the mid-1930s to help Jewish refugees, the aging of survivors has 
meant that issues affecting the elderly have become some of the leading 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Selfhelp is now a large not-for-profit social service agency with a 
$51-million annual budget and programs ranging from senior centers to AIDS 
services, providing help to survivors is still a prime focus. Nearly 40 staff 
members are assigned to the agency's Nazi Victim Program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program serves people, the vast majority of them Jewish, who suffered 
under Nazism, whether they fled, survived death camps or hid in Nazi-controlled 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Selfhelp remains one of only a handful of agencies around the country with a 
wide range of programs for elderly survivors, despite the difficulties these 
people can face. 
</P>
<P>
 While many survivors don't continue to suffer as a result of their wartime 
experiences, some elderly survivors find themselves alone in the wake of a 
cataclysm that wiped out entire families and villages. Others struggle with 
depression, anxiety or other emotional troubles because of the atrocities they 
endured. 
</P>
<P>
 For about 2,000 of the metropolitan area's survivors, the agency provides such 
services as counseling, home care, financial assistance, housekeeping, outreach 
services and help with the mundane troubles of daily life. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of their clients are the people who couldn't be helped by other social 
service groups, "the people who were living without a phone in an unheated room 
above a garage who thought the Nazis were after them," Friedlander said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through counseling, the agency's social workers try to help survivors come to 
terms with their experiences under Nazism -- and other issues that concern the 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease this process, most of Selfhelp's Nazi Victim Program social workers 
can speak at least one of the many languages the survivors brought with them to 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 This can be especially important as some survivors will slip into their native 
languages when discussing the horrors they lived through. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more comforting," said Eva Knoller, a social worker and the director of 
the Selfhelp office in the upper Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Knoller sat with one survivor in the woman's Washington 
Heights apartment. The survivor allowed a reporter to sit in on the discussion 
on the condition that her name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who fled Vienna and the emerging horrors of the Holocaust in the 
late 1930s, helped support her family for years after she came to America by 
caring for elderly people too frail to care for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But that afternoon, 76 years old and a widow, she sat at a table in the small 
apartment where she and her husband reared two children, her many prescription 
bottles arrayed in front of her, and talked with Knoller about her own need for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to do this for other people," she said sadly in her soft German 
accent, vaguely gesturing around the apartment. "Now, someone has to do this 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Knoller, who was especially worried because one of the woman's friends was 
moving out of their apartment building, gently prodded her to volunteer at a 
senior citizen's center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be good for you," said Knoller. "I think you'd find you have 
something to contribute." 
</P>
<P>
 While the two women came to no conclusion about volunteering, Knoller did get 
her to say she'd come on the agency's next outing for elderly survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond mental health issues, the isolation that some elderly Nazi victims face 
is one of Selfhelp's biggest concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these people don't socialize anywhere and they keep coming, month 
after month. Some have Alzheimer's, some are profoundly, profoundly depressed," 
said Tova Klein, who heads the agency's newly opened Brooklyn office. 
</P>
<P>
 She attributes the success of the get-togethers to the fact that they are 
"dignified and not condescending . . . everyone is a survivor and they don't 
have to explain themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter what help is offered, from coffee houses to counseling, it's not 
always enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Some survivors are never found. Some reject help. Some are never to come to 
terms with their experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see death as a coping mechanism," said Klein. "If they need to die because 
it's too much, then they need to die. That's what makes it hard to look on. 
It's not about what I think is the right thing; it's about helping."

HOSPITAL HOT BOX OF STALE AIR, FOUL MOODS; GOVERNMENT: A DEDICATION CEREMONY 
WAS HELD FOR A NEW VETERANS' FACILITY IN A PITTSBURGH SUBURB 11 MONTHS AGO. 
HOWEVER, PATIENTS IN THE OLD BUILDING HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO MOVE IN BECAUSE OF 
DELAYS IN AWARDING A TELEPHONE CONTRACT.

 Darlene Castelluci has seen the problems of an old, understaffed veterans' 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 She has felt the heat of rooms without air conditioning and watched men eat 
meals with bottles of their urine sitting nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nurses can't take care of patients the way they want to. They don't have 
time," said Castelluci, whose 48-year-old husband, Tony, has been hospitalized 
with multiple sclerosis for 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 All the more reason, she said, to hurry up and open an already-built hospital 
right next to the nearly 70-year-old building in suburban Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The new U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs hospital has central air 
conditioning and will employ about 500 people, an increase of 100 or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a dedication ceremony was held 11 months ago, patients in the old 
building have been unable to move in because of delays in awarding a telephone 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you dedicate something, you assume you'll be in it after a month, not a 
year," Castelluci said. "It's not that I want to complain, but I'm not happy 
coming here and seeing what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither are others who have watched the 400-bed, $72-million building remain 
empty since last October. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ridiculous," said Augustine Scarpelli, a patient and 71-year-old World 
War II veteran. "They've put all those buildings up in less time than it's 
taken to install phones." 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly. Construction of the building began in 1990 and was completed, 
except for the phones, in October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the same month the Department of Veterans Affairs began soliciting bids 
from minority-owned companies to install telephone, paging and computer 
systems, said Michael Stamler, a spokesman for the U.S. Small Business 
Administration. The SBA's role was to certify that the VA hired a minority 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidding closed a month later. But the VA didn't begin negotiating with 
minority businesses until April, and the $2.3-million contract with Ray 
Communications of Bala Cynwyd wasn't signed until June 3, Stamler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an unfortunate situation that should not have happened," hospital 
director Thomas Cappello said. Terry Jemison, a VA spokesman in Washington, 
said he couldn't say immediately what caused the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), who urged the VA to speed up the process, 
said he suspects the contract was sitting on the desk of an administrator who 
didn't act on it for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone was too busy doing other things, or didn't realize the effects it was 
going to have," said Santorum. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone lines are being snaked through the new building, and now it is expected 
to open Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients are glad to hear that. The older hospital's electrical system can 
support window units for only about half the 400 patients. Most rooms are 
shared by four people. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides air conditioning, the new hospital offers private rooms for nursing 
home patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Cappello said VA procedures are being changed to make sure a similar delay 
isn't repeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, "You're a lot better off in a 1993 building than in a 1925 
building," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital cares for elderly and chronically ill veterans from the 
Pittsburgh area and parts of West Virginia and Ohio. Pennsylvania has eight 
other VA hospitals.

COLLEGE STUDENTS GO CREATIVE IN FISHING FOR JOBS; EMPLOYMENT: ONE PERSON SENT 
OUT ANIMATED VIDEOS AS RESUMES -- AND LANDED A JOB. ANOTHER PASSED OUT THE 
PLAIN-PAPER VARIETY AT A CONFERENCE.

 They're graduating seniors, but the students in this Simmons College seminar 
look as apprehensive as freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject: How to get a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten three rejection letters already," said Sabrina Greenberg, who is 
boning up on how to network, dress for interviews and write a cover letter. 
"Looking in the Sunday paper for a job, you're one in a million." 
</P>
<P>
 College and university students like Greenberg, an education major, have been 
looking for creative ways to draw attention to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in an international business program at the Monterey Institute in 
California mail their credentials both in English and Chinese to prospective 
employers. Seniors in an environmental studies program at St. Lawrence 
University in Canton, N.Y., wrote their cover letters on one side of a sheet of 
recycled paper and their resumes on the other, then sent it as a self-mailer to 
environmentally conscious employers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will almost send you a bushel basket worth of fruit and make it look 
like a resume," said Roy Chapman, head of college recruiting for J.C. Penney. 
</P>
<P>
 Why be creative? "They have to. They don't have a choice," said Dawn Oberman, 
a statistician for the College Placement Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight out of 10 graduates take from one to six months to find a job, according 
to the placement council. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says 20% of college 
graduates are toiling in positions that require no college education. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole business of getting a job out of college is a lot tougher than it 
used to be," Oberman said. 
</P>
<P>
 And things aren't likely to get better soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might get a little more competitive, if anything," said Dan Hecker, an 
economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "There will continue to be people 
with college degrees doing word processing or driving vehicles or working in 
retail stores." 
</P>
<P>
 So this year's graduates are striving for new ways to get their resumes to the 
top of the pile. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to find a job, you can find something," said Chris MacGill, 
director of career development at Lycoming College in Williamsport, Pa. 
"Sometimes it means being a little creative." 
</P>
<P>
 Lycoming offers a seminar called "Wine, Dine and Act Fine" to teach students 
how to dress and even how to eat in front of a recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may assume that everybody just obviously knows this," said MacGill. "But 
some of the real basic things are what nobody has told them about, all the way 
down to which fork you pick up first at the interview luncheon." 
</P>
<P>
 The "final exam" in the non-credit course is a formal dinner with Lycoming's 
president and deans playing the parts of company recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Costic, a student at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., sent 
out an animation video resume titled "Don't Make Lee Costic Move Back Home With 
His Parents." A sequel, "Don't Make Lee Costic Work in a Department Store," 
landed him a video graphics job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured it would be a unique way to get some people's attention," Costic 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Lukasik, who graduated last year from the Kent State University 
College of Business, walked into a business seminar in Cleveland and handed out 
300 copies of her resume. The speaker was so impressed that he read her resume 
aloud. Lukasik got five job offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I should be grouped in with the rest of the masses sending out 
resumes, so I wanted to do something innovative," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some placement officials tell students who want to get a foot in the door to 
consider working for a temporary agency or nonprofit organization. They also 
suggest volunteering or telling potential employers they are willing to cover 
the cost of traveling to the employer's office for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But students, who have to repay college loans and are concerned about health 
benefits, resist the idea of working free. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing that too much already," said Janel Clague, a Simmons senior 
who has held four internships. "I want a job that pays." 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of them were ranking certain things as appropriate that we 
thought were not," said Margie Bogenschutz, director of undergraduate career 
services at Ohio State University's College of Business.

RADIALS GO RADICAL IN THEIR 2ND LIFE; ENVIRONMENT: ONE TIRE IS TOSSED EACH YEAR 
FOR EVERY MAN, WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE COUNTRY, MORE THAN 250 MILLION 
NATIONWIDE. BY THE END OF THE CENTURY, THEY ALL MAY BE PUT TO USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This country throws out enough tires each year to more than girdle the globe. 
That's if they were set side by side upright. End to end, lying down, they'd be 
four deep around the Equator. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the century, they all may be put to use, the tire industry says. 
The Environmental Protection Agency agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's an if.  
</P>
<P>
 While states try to clear away anywhere from 1.5 billion to 3 billion tires 
already piled on roadsides, dumps and vacant lots, about 175 million a year are 
added to the heaps. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA estimates that one tire is tossed each year for every man, woman and 
child in the country, more than 250 million nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 There are markets for 75 million to 80 million. The rest are piled up, 
shredded and stockpiled, or -- where it's allowed -- put into landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Most states no longer let landfills take whole tires, because they can capture 
gas and squeeze up through the other garbage, even breaking through the heavy 
layer of clay used to cap the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 A few states ban tires entirely. The rest require them to be cut or shredded. 
That saves space, since tires are large pockets of air encased in rubber. It 
also keeps water from pooling in the tires and creating a breeding place for 
mosquitoes, algae, germs and other undesirables. 
</P>
<P>
 Uses for recycled tires are as varied as imagination. Strips of rubber are cut 
into shoe soles or welded into mats for erosion control or temporary roads. 
Bales of compressed tires support a golf course and create its drainage system. 
Crumbled rubber becomes part of hockey pucks, roads, horse racing tracks, NCAA 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most go up in smoke, creating power for cement plants, paper factories and 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who's ever been downwind of burning rubber will doubt the pollution 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're talking about a tire fire, there are an awful lot of pollutants 
that get released," said Hope Pillsbury of the recycling section in the EPA's 
office of solid waste in Washington. "But high-temperature incineration is a 
different story. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tires burn in the same ballpark as coal. If you've got high-sulfur coal, it 
probably burns dirtier than tires. Plus you've got a lot of pollution-control 
equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 The prediction that all scrap tires could be recycled by the end of 1998 comes 
from John Serumgard, chairman of the Scrap Tire Management Council and vice 
president of its parent organization, the Rubber Manufacturing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But his equation depends on the federal law requiring states to use rubber 
mixed with asphalt on their roads. 
</P>
<P>
 If the law is enforced, up to 70 million tires a year could go into highways. 
But there's no enforcement money in this year's budget, and no telling when 
there will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, not everyone agrees that the rubber-asphalt mix is a good 
thing. Asphalt can be recycled. Rubber-asphalt, or RUMAC, cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Serumgard said, rubber recycling has come an incredible way in less 
than a decade, especially in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1985, the EPA estimated that less than 6% of all scrap tires were used in 
any positive way," he said. "By 1990, it was 10.7%." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, about one-third of all tires are recycled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would estimate that probably 5 million are going into ground-rubber 
applications, probably another 5 million are going into civil-engineering 
applications," Serumgard said. "The balance, about 70 million, are going into 
fuel uses." 
</P>
<P>
 The growth of the industry can be tracked in the pages of Scrap Tire News, 
which Mary Sikora and her family first published eight years ago. The inaugural 
issue was four pages. It now runs 20 pages a month. January's special issue 
comparing the laws of all 50 states took 36 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scrap Tire Users Directory, also published by the Sikoras, has grown from 
1,200 listings to 2,000 over three editions. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that tire recycling is a fail-safe business. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Stewart added $175,000 worth of shredders and conveyor belts to his 
Riverside Recycling plant after Louisiana decreed that every tire sale must 
include a $2 fee to pay for clearing away old tires. 
</P>
<P>
 He sold the business 15 months later. "We couldn't compete with someone who is 
working out of the back of a pickup truck and throwing them out into a back 
alley or abandoned lot," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 About six months later, the woman who bought Stewart's tire equipment called 
to tell him she was selling out too. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana has recycling rules but just proposed a new set in February because 
the current ones, approved in 1992, don't work. 
</P>
<P>
 When new tires are sold, the seller takes in an extra $2. Half goes to the 
state Department of Environmental Quality to enforce the law. The other half is 
supposed to cover the cost of proper disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Tire dealers take the lowest bid -- often under $1 -- and the lowest bidder 
sometimes dumps tires, said Michael Vince, program manager for recycling in the 
DEQ's solid waste division. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other states have similar laws, but none has been able to stop "tire 
jockeys" from dumping tires on vacant lots or roadsides. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know, in the state of Connecticut, we are the only ones with a 
permit, yet there are beaucoup tire jockeys in Connecticut," said Bruce Hayn, 
general manager at Oxford Tire Supply in Plainfield. 
</P>
<P>
 His company collects 100,000 tons of tires a year -- about 13.75 million -- 
from Connecticut and 11 surrounding states. About 20% are in good enough shape 
to sell for reuse or re-treading. The remaining 11 million are fuel for 
Oxford's sister company, Exeter Energy Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's 300 tons a day -- approximately 30,000 tires a day, seven days a 
week," Hayn said. "It works out to approximately enough electricity for 30,000 
homes, or about one tire per day per home." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxford Tire is paid about $1 for every car tire it collects, although large 
tires from front-end loaders and other heavy equipment fetch as much as $200. 
</P>
<P>
 Exeter's plant produces 30 megawatts a day. It uses about 1.5 megawatts 
itself, and sells the rest to Northeast Utilities for 6 to 8 cents a kilowatt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facility in Connecticut can utilize 10 million tires a year," Serumgard 
said. "You say 10 million isn't much compared to 250 million scrap tires. Let 
me tell you, 10 million is an awful lot of tires if you have to bring them to 
one particular spot."

GUN DESIGNER DEFENDS 'AMERICAN TRADITION'; WEAPONS: WILLIAM RUGER HAS SPENT 
MOST OF HIS LIFE DESIGNING, REFINING AND MANUFACTURING GUNS. THEY ARE KNOWN FOR 
THEIR CLEAN, EFFICIENT DESIGN AND PRECISE WORKMANSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 He insists it is not his fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, William B. Ruger designed the P-89 semiautomatic pistol. And yes, when 
Colin Ferguson strafed a Long Island commuter train last December, killing six 
and wounding 17, his weapon was a P-89 semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 But no, Ruger maintains, he is not to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world knows it's not our fault," said the 78-year-old founder of Sturm, 
Ruger & Co., one of the country's largest firearms makers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People use all sorts of tools to display antisocial or criminal behavior and 
it doesn't necessarily say anything about the morality of the manufacturer -- 
despite the misrepresentation of some false-thinking people." 
</P>
<P>
 These "false-thinking people" -- people who press for gun control, who blame 
the gun industry for the carnage on American streets -- vilify him. These days 
it is not easy to be a gun magnate or a tobacco executive. 
</P>
<P>
 But for William Ruger, guns have been a lifelong passion. And he's not going 
to let that passion die. 
</P>
<P>
 He has spent most of his life designing, refining and manufacturing firearms. 
His handguns, shotguns and rifles are known for their clean, efficient design 
and precise workmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 His first gun, a Remington .22 pump-action rifle, was a gift from his 
grandfather. Ruger was 12, and was recovering from scarlet fever. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the mechanism that intrigued me," he said. "A beautiful, coordinated 
piece of machinery." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruger first designed and built a gun in a neighborhood machine shop when he 
was still in high school. He dropped out of the University of North Carolina 
after two years to work on a design for a light machine gun; he went on to 
design light weapons for the Army during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Ruger met fellow gun enthusiast Alexander Sturm and, with 
$50,000 of Sturm's money, opened Sturm, Ruger & Co. in a rented barn in 
Southport, Conn. Their first product was a .22-caliber automatic pistol that 
looks much like the famous German Luger -- an instant and continuing success. 
</P>
<P>
 His partner died in 1951, but Ruger pressed on, building a business that now 
sells more than $150 million worth of guns annually, producing them in Newport, 
Southport and in Prescott, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never really been completely absorbed with any technical progress just 
for the sake of change," Ruger said. "We like to build a handsome, accurate, 
practical firearm for the man who likes to shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 The man like . . . Ruger. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruger sits comfortably behind a long table he uses for a desk at the Newport 
plant, where he spends most of his time. His large hands, crippled with 
arthritis, still deftly handle the early model Remington, Winchester, Savage 
and Stevens rifles he pulls from a collection lining the wall behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 A gleaming "Single-Six" revolver -- a gun similar to the famous Colt 
"Peacemaker" of 1873 -- sits on the table among a loose assortment of drawings, 
gun parts and .22-caliber cartridges. 
</P>
<P>
 To Ruger, it seems, guns are a benevolent force. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deterrent effect of an armed household in this country has got to be a 
hell of an important beneficial effect. The fact that half the households have 
means to protect themselves has got to turn off a lot of would-be burglars and 
rapists and robbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruger blames Hollywood violence for twisting America's conception of firearms. 
"Movies and TV these days have sold the idea of the shootout as though that 
were the purpose of firearms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "TV is an enemy of civilization. You take the program violence away and all 
these immature, slightly crazy mentalities watching that would no longer be 
stimulated by what they see on television." 
</P>
<P>
 He believes the problem of guns in school has been "greatly exaggerated." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to wonder how many schoolchildren go to school and worry about 
getting shot. If there are some rotten kids who are carrying a gun, that can't 
happen very often. But it gets a lot of play with the press," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The real danger to American society, he says, is not firearms makers but gun 
control advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Americans were deprived of firearms or if they were somehow made 
inaccessible, you would be downgrading the whole concept of American 
citizenship," he said, his swollen hands clutching the arms of his chair. 
</P>
<P>
 He scorns the "group of people out there who just don't like guns and . . . 
don't want anybody to have them. It's a characteristic of the times and it's a 
very adversarial mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he is worried. He is certain that those people are not in the 
majority; he is certain that fewer guns would not mean less violence. He is 
certain that he is not to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't the existence of guns that causes crime," he said, "and there is no 
way of preventing crime by eliminating guns."

AFRICANS TRY TO BREAK SILENCE ON AIDS EVEN AS AILMENT CONSUMES THEIR CONTINENT 
</P>

 When Juliana Gbami's husband died three years ago, doctors told her the cause 
was kidney failure. Just kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, when she developed recurring fevers, diarrhea and chronic 
fatigue, they said it had really been AIDS, and that she had it too. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I collapsed and really fell ill," said Gbami, a retired social 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as AIDS consumes their continent, many Africans can't bring themselves to 
even mention it. Experts say that's one reason the disease is spreading. 
</P>
<P>
 Africa accounts for 10 million of the world's 16 million cases of infection 
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, according to the World Health 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Gbami belongs to something almost unheard of in Africa: an AIDS support group 
dedicated to breaking the fatal taboo of silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started very, very tentatively," said Dr. Marc Aguirre, an American 
working at the Medical and Social Assistance Center, financed by the Church of 
Christ. "A lot of these people are very reticent. But we basically had a party 
and got people talking about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say cultural modesty and a deep reluctance to be the bearer of bad 
news are powerful social forces in Africa, even among some doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Africans with AIDS do not go and see their doctors because of our traditional 
sense of modesty and shame," said Yaya Diallo, a Senegalese sociologist at the 
University of Dakar. 
</P>
<P>
 "They prefer to 'leave it to God' to decide their fate, and try traditional 
medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Gbami said her doctor, an old friend of her husband, was reluctant to admit 
her spouse died of AIDS, and could not face her with the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he sent two other doctors to tell her. 
</P>
<P>
 The support group called "The Friends Club," which began meeting weekly in 
July, represents a quiet revolution that has even led some people to become 
crusaders for community awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to tell people that, with HIV, you can still live," said Etienne 
Tapie, 28, who was diagnosed in March as HIV positive. "It is not the end of 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you mention AIDS, everyone is afraid. No one even wants to touch you. I 
have friends like me who have been chased out of their houses, who are all 
alone," added Tapie. 
</P>
<P>
 Not at The Friends Club, which Tapie helped organize. 
</P>
<P>
 Club meetings, which draw 35 to 40 people, are lively, positive and animated. 
</P>
<P>
 They include a pretty teen-age girl, the soft-spoken Gbami, a lanky father of 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 A stereo belts out pop hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The frank, intimate talk ranges over health, politics and the devastating 
emotional toll taken by the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such a need for people to open up and talk to someone," said Aguirre. 
"That is all we aim to provide, really." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivory Coast, with 18,670 documented AIDS cases in a population of 13 million, 
is West Africa's most affected country. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS is the leading cause of death of adult men and the second-leading cause, 
after childbirth, of death among women.

DELAYS ON CLEAN CARS ASSAILED; ELECTRIC VEHICLES: THE FIGHT IS OVER HOW BEST TO 
REDUCE EMISSIONS AND CUT DENSE SMOG THAT HAS HOVERED OVER THE NORTHEAST FOR 
YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Eleven months after President Clinton unveiled a partnership with auto makers 
to develop a cleaner car, the Administration is being accused of undercutting 
promotion of electric vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy stems from a bitter dispute between the car manufacturers and 
state environmental officials from Virginia to Maine. The fight is over the 
issue of how best to reduce vehicle emissions and cut smog that hovered over 
the Northeast for years. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Environmental Protection Agency insists it is merely trying to 
fashion a plan acceptable to all sides, some state regulators and 
environmentalists accuse it of catering to the auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sharply written letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner, the top 
environmental official in California recently accused the agency of working to 
reverse state-level development of clean-air programs like California's. 
</P>
<P>
 "EPA should stick to the adoption of the best air pollution prevention 
measures, not convene clandestine negotiations to broker weaker ones," wrote 
James Strock, California's secretary for environmental protection. This 
happened after reports surfaced that EPA officials had been trying to broker a 
clean air deal for the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen Northeast states and the District of Columbia want to emulate the 
California plan. That plan would require the manufacture and sale of thousands 
of electric vehicles as well as "ultra-low" emission cars that run on natural 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
 This has raised the ire of the automobile industry, which has proposed its own 
plan to meet clean air requirements in the Northeast. It claims that emission 
reductions from vehicles can be met without having to sell electric cars in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 The manufacturers have sought out the White House and EPA to try to persuade 
the Northeastern states to go along with their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to Southern California, the Northeast has some of the worst smog problems 
in America. Under provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act, state officials must 
craft a blueprint for meeting air quality health standards early in the next 
decade. That requires car emissions to be cut roughly in half. 
</P>
<P>
 Two states, Massachusetts and New York, already have passed laws fashioned on 
the California standard. Like California, Massachusetts and New York require 
that 2% of all new car sales by model year 1999 be electric vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a coalition called the Ozone Transport Commission, all the Northeast 
states have proposed a solution similar to the one in California and are 
awaiting EPA approval. It includes a requirement for electric cars, although 
actual sales mandates would be up to each state. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto makers strongly oppose any requirement to sell electric cars and have 
filed lawsuits in New York and Massachusetts against the state mandates. They 
argue that an acceptable electric car with the range and size demanded by the 
public won't be possible for some time at competitive prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mandating the sale of cars that don't get bought or, if bought, don't get 
driven very much, does nothing for air quality. That's the real world," argued 
Helen Petrauskas, vice president for environmental and safety engineering at 
Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, said Andrew Card, president of the American Automobile Manufacturers 
Assn., which has spearheaded the Washington lobbying effort against the 
Northeast states, the EPA should adopt "a 49-state approach" to deal with air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the auto makers are prepared to produce and sell a cleaner 
gasoline-powered car for all states. The theory is that by selling 
cleaner-burning cars across the country, the smog-bound Northeast also would 
benefit because 10% to 15% of the driving in the Northeast is done in cars from 
outside the region. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, auto makers would not have to produce electric or "ultra-clean" 
natural gas powered vehicles for areas outside of California. 
</P>
<P>
 But state officials who have crafted the Northeast pollution control plan say 
the auto makers' proposal won't allow them to meet the pollution reduction 
requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act and only forces them to impose tougher 
pollution controls elsewhere -- on businesses, factories or even lawn mowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get the same emission reductions (from the auto industry proposal). 
. . . It's not sufficient, period," said Bruce Carhart, executive director of 
the Ozone Transport Commission, the regional agency created to develop the 
pollution control plan for the states from Virginia to Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional plan envisioned cutting auto emissions in half by 2003. These 
include nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds, both of which contribute 
to smog. 
</P>
<P>
 Carhart said the auto industry plan would fall 15% to 30% short of that. And, 
he argued in an interview, there's no assurance anyone could enforce a 
"49-state" clean car requirement since the federal air pollution control laws 
are less stringent than what the auto makers are offering. Congress intended 
for states, with federal approval, to impose more stringent requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to President Clinton, the governors of Vermont, New York and 
Massachusetts recently urged the President to ask the EPA to stop negotiating 
with the auto makers and to adopt the Northeast states' proposals. The 
governors reminded Clinton of his initiative last September in which the auto 
makers promised at a White House ceremony a new long-range partnership for 
developing a cleaner car. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials deny charges they are undercutting electric car development, but 
say they are only trying to find ways to get the auto makers and Northeast 
states to agree on a program that will put cleaner cars on the road sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 Browner's assistant for air pollution programs, Mary Nichols, said the 
agency's involvement has been misunderstood by some state regulators and that 
the agency has no intention of retreating on any air quality goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would not entertain a compromise that would achieve less environmental 
benefits than what (the Northeast states) asked us for," Nichols said. "The 
emission reductions . . . are not negotiable. The only issue is, are there 
alternative ways to get there?" 
</P>
<P>
 While saying that electric vehicles "are part of our future," Nichols also has 
urged the disagreeing parties to discuss other approaches including the auto 
industry's 49-state clean car proposal.

DEATH ROW ISN'T A HIGH-INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD, NATION'S LEGAL EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It is a pretty good bet that if Erik and Lyle Menendez are convicted, they 
will not wind up on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not a place for the rich. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, every one of the 384 men and four women awaiting execution as 
of July 1 was poor enough to qualify for a lawyer at state expense, said Lynn 
Holton, spokeswoman for the state Judicial Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, no one seems to have made a systematic study of the finances of 
the executed, or of the 2,700 condemned prisoners. But veteran practitioners 
and scholars agreed they'd never heard of a wealthy person on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any affluent people who have been sentenced to death," said 
Walter Berns, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in 
Washington and author of the 1978 book "For Capital Punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 "The death penalty is for poor people," said Stephen Bright, director of the 
Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta and a defense lawyer in capital 
cases for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wealthy people have faced capital charges: 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold, young sons of wealthy families and the 
"thrill killers" convicted of murdering a young boy, were spared the death 
penalty in 1924 after an epic defense by Clarence Darrow that focused on their 
mental states. 
</P>
<P>
 * Texas oilman T. Cullen Davis, charged with seriously wounding his estranged 
wife, Priscilla, and murdering her lover and her 12-year-old daughter in 1976. 
Although his wife and two other eyewitnesses identified Davis as the gunman, he 
was acquitted after a defense by prominent lawyer Richard (Racehorse) Haynes, 
who attacked Mrs. Davis for her drug use and extramarital affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joe Hunt, leader of a group of wealthy youths called the Billionaire Boys 
Club, convicted in 1987 of murdering a Beverly Hills con man whose body has 
never been found. A jury rejected a death sentence and chose life without 
parole for Hunt, who is seeking a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Menendez brothers, those defendants could afford to hire good 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have money and can afford adequate counsel, you don't end up on Death 
Row," said Kica Matos, capital punishment research director for the NAACP Legal 
Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trying capital cases is the legal equivalent of brain surgery," Bright said. 
In the South, he said, court-appointed death penalty lawyers are paid barely 
enough to cover costs, are usually inexperienced, and often don't put up much 
of a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see cases tried with no experts for the defense, no investigator at all, 
and seldom one who knows how to investigate the life and background of the 
defendant," Bright said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Georgia case he described in a Yale Law Journal article. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary X. Nelson, sentenced to death in the 1978 rape and murder of a 6-year-old 
girl, was represented by a lawyer who had never tried a capital case, was paid 
$15 to $20 an hour and had no investigator or experts. His closing argument was 
255 words long. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, new lawyers, working at their own expense, found that crucial 
prosecution evidence, a hair on the victim's body, could not be validly 
compared to Nelson's hair -- a fact mentioned in an FBI report that had never 
been disclosed. Nelson was freed after 11 years on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 But in California, for example, defense lawyers exaggerate the extent of 
ineffective representation in death cases, said state Deputy Atty. Gen. Dane 
Gillette, death-penalty coordinator in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the chief reason rich people aren't sentenced to die, Gillette said, 
is that "they, for the most part, don't commit these kinds of violent crimes."

 Some escaped to a swamp, and they suffocated. But others survived, boarding 
trains to outrace the flames or wading into water to avoid their reach. 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred years ago, on Sept. 1, 1894, a firestorm swept over 480 square 
miles of northeastern Minnesota's white pine forest. In just four hours, six 
towns were reduced to rubble and the forest to a wasteland of charred stumps. 
</P>
<P>
 And in that time, at least 418 people died. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, it probably was more like 600. They didn't count any of the Indians 
or any of the people who died later," said Jeanne Coffey, director of the 
Hinckley Fire Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one forest fire on record was more deadly, according to the World 
Almanac. The fire that hit the Peshtigo, Wis., area on Oct. 8, 1871, killed 
1,182. The deadliest fire in history hit a theater in Canton, China, in 1845, 
killing 1,670 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minnesota fire "was the talk of the world," Coffey said. The London Times 
reported on the "Great Forest Fires in America." The New York World sent 
journalist Nellie Bly, who telegraphed a 5,000-word report five days after the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 A front-page sketch in The Chicago World showed bodies scattered over charred 
terrain and piled on a wagon: "A cyclone of fire sweeps through Minnesota -- 
leaving in its wake an awful record of charred corpses, unutterable desolation 
and awful destitution." 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the dead were from Hinckley, a town of more than 1,200. 
Brook Park, Mission Creek, Sandstone, Miller and Partridge also were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the dead are memorialized with a granite obelisk and with the fire 
museum, housed in a train depot rebuilt after the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the exhibits is a purse, found beneath the charred body of Mrs. John 
McNamara. It contained the $3,500 she had saved to send her two sons to 
college. She and the boys died after getting off a train that carried fleeing 
residents to Skunk Lake, a shallow swamp 6 miles north of Hinckley. 
</P>
<P>
 The McNamaras ran down the railroad tracks in fright rather than wading into 
the 18 inches of mud and slimy water. Most of those who made it into the water 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
 The Skunk Lake survivors owed their lives to Jim Root, engineer of a 
southbound St. Paul and Duluth Co. train that was met by fleeing residents 
about a mile north of Hinckley. About 150 refugees piled aboard the train 
before Root put the train in reverse and opened the throttle. 
</P>
<P>
 The train was on fire as it backed away from Hinckley and Root was knocked 
into a daze when the cab window was shattered by an explosion. Fireman John 
McGowan revived the engineer by dousing him with water and the train reached 
the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The 127 people who took refuge in a swamp at the north edge of Hinckley were 
not so lucky. Their charred bodies were found after the fire. All apparently 
died of suffocation. Others suffocated after trying to escape the fire in wells 
and root cellars. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the survivors were about 100 people who fled into 3-foot-deep water in 
the middle of a gravel pit on the east side of Hinckley. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest group of survivors, nearly 500, were aboard the last train that 
made it to Duluth from Hinckley. 
</P>
<P>
 People on the heavily loaded Eastern Railway of Minnesota train could only 
watch as fire engulfed neighbors who missed their last chance to escape. The 
train crossed the narrow trestle bridge 150 feet above the Kettle River just 
minutes before the burning bridge collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, all that remained of Hinckley, the largest town between the 
Twin Cities and Duluth, was the Eastern Railway's roundhouse and water tank. 
Gone were the town's 250 homes, the school and more than 70 businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the dead were not identified before burial. Names of 101 of the bodies 
in the coroner's tally made two days after the fire were listed as "unknown." 
The blanket-wrapped bodies of 248 victims were laid to rest in long mounded 
trenches now covered by grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors carried the scars for the rest of their lives. Edna Shober's 
grandparents and three of their children survived the firestorm huddled next to 
the well on their farm near Hinckley. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wet quilts in the well and covered themselves. My grandmother's shoes 
were burned off, her eyelashes and hair were singed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In grandmother's older years, she was always afraid of fire. She'd get very 
nervous and upset."

AS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, BOB KERREY HAD IDEAS ON HEALTH -- NOW TUNE IS 
CHANGED; REFORM: THE NEBRASKA DEMOCRAT IS A PILLAR OF THE SELF-DESCRIBED 
'MAINSTREAM' SENATE GROUP THAT'S PROMOTING A MODEST, MARKET-BASED PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LAWRENCE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in 1992, when he was running for President, Bob Kerrey wanted to scrap 
private health insurance, raise taxes by $230 billion and set up a 
government-financed health system. He called it "the only real solution." 
</P>
<P>
 But times have changed and so has Kerrey. Now the Nebraska Democrat is a 
pillar of the self-described "mainstream" Senate group that's promoting a 
modest, market-based reform plan derided as minimalist by his old allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversion has put Kerrey at the center of whatever action is left this 
year on health reform. It also has prolonged and exacerbated his prickly 
relationship with the man who beat him out for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a leftover "Kerrey for President" poster on the wall of Kerrey's 
Senate campaign headquarters this year as he runs for reelection. It's a joke, 
but also perhaps an omen for 1996. Kerrey bowed out of the 1992 race saying he 
wouldn't mind trying again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton-Kerrey dynamic has been laced with unusual tension from the start. 
Clinton avoided the Vietnam draft; Kerrey served, lost half a leg and won the 
Medal of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, in a contretemps in Nebraska, Kerrey found himself defending remarks 
he'd made about Clinton in 1992. "I said he was going to be opened up like a 
soft-shell peanut" by the opposition, he recalled. "I never said Bill Clinton 
was a draft-dodger. I never said terrible things about his intentions, his 
desires." 
</P>
<P>
 Relations seemed to hit rock bottom when Clinton had to plead with Kerrey for 
the final vote needed to pass his massive economic plan last year. Their 
conversations were punctuated with obscenities and phone slamming. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kerrey finally came through, it was grudgingly. He said he was doing it 
because Clinton said it would save his presidency. Behind the scenes, he 
bargained to become head of a commission on how to cut federal spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrey started this year blasting Clinton's health care plan, which aimed for 
universal coverage through the private insurance market. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he turned on the Democratic National Committee, which ran White 
House-approved ads in his state this summer to try to win him over to the 
Clinton cause. "It's a waste of money, it's counterproductive, it's irritating 
and it doesn't influence me at all," Kerrey said angrily. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the party should run ads urging Clinton to drop his insistence on 
making employers pay for worker health care. Earlier, he'd become one of only 
two Democrats to co-sponsor a Republican bill requiring individuals rather than 
employers to buy insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrey gives several explanations for his health care odyssey. No. 1, he says, 
"there's been an unprecedented change in the market, in its capacity to control 
costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Nos. 2 and 3 are his discoveries that wealthy people receive health care tax 
subsidies and direct payments "at the expense of people who don't have much 
income," and that soaring entitlement spending -- the subject of his commission 
-- is a "terrifying problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts would dispute his first point, and the second two points were 
true when he ran for President. There may be another facet to Kerrey's 
transformation: the reality check provided by his brief presidential fling. "We 
have to have the consent of the people," he says now.

U.S. AIR FORCE TURNS B-52 BOMBERS INTO SCRAP METAL; ARIZONA: TO CARRY OUT AN 
INTERNATIONAL ARMS TREATY, AMERICA IS DISMANTLING THE PLANES THAT WERE ONCE THE 
BACKBONE OF ITS NUCLEAR ARSENAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You've probably seen the Veg-O-Matic vegetable chopper advertised for years, 
and maybe the Ginsu miracle knife. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's nothing like the Air Force "scrapomatic." 
</P>
<P>
 It turns a B-52 bomber into 100,000 pounds of scrap metal with the drop of a 
blade. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a 13,000-pound guillotine blade hoisted by a crane, and it carries out 
the dictates of an international arms treaty requiring the United States to 
destroy some of its systems for attacking with nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 30 years, the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress was the backbone of 
America's nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-engine, long-range bomber was capable of flying thousands of miles, 
refueling in midair, to drop nuclear warheads or conventional bombs. It played 
a key role in the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the aircraft, built between 1955 and 1962, were brought to the desert 
here years ago, obsolete and destined for the scrap heap anyway. Some models, 
modified to carry air-launched cruise missiles, remain in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But 365 of the jets are doomed under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with 
Russia and other successor states of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes about 300 hours to prepare a plane for destruction, logistics 
management specialist Carl Mlodzik explained before a recent session. The B-52s 
are stripped of their engines and other reusable parts, and radiation and 
hazardous fluids are removed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a 120-foot tall crane brings over the guillotine, attached by cables, to 
drop the blade about 80 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen airmen watched as the blade went to work on one day's task: 
Destruction of two B-52Ds, Nos. 50073 and 50070. 
</P>
<P>
 The first slice cut across the tail section of 50073, severing the fuselage. 
The treaty allows 60 days from the first chop to finish the job, but the crew 
does the chore in a day. 
</P>
<P>
 It took seven drops of the guillotine to cut the fuselage of 50070 into three 
pieces and sever both wings. The nose almost rolled over at the last cut, but 
stayed upright. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty impressive. You don't get to see an airplane destroyed very 
often," said Tech. Sgt. Richard Foster, a sheet-metal worker for 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "History," said Tech. Sgt. Ken F. Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Since August 1993, 177 B-52s have been turned into junk metal. The other 188 
are lined up on the desert at this base in Tucson, at the Aerospace and 
Maintenance Regeneration Center. They're to be destroyed over the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The planes are being destroyed at the rate of three a week. More than 100 lie 
chopped up in heaps on the desert floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the treaty, which Ukraine hasn't ratified yet, the hulks must stay in 
place for 90 days to allow satellite verification. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they can be hauled off for scrap, said Master Sgt. Sam Haney, a base 
spokesman. At 20 cents a pound, each scrapped B-52 earns the Air Force about 
$20,000.

FARMER BETS THE RANCH ON BOARD GAME AND NOW HE'S REAPING RICHES; AGRICULTURE: 
GEORGE ROHRBACHER GAMBLED THAT HIS BOARD GAME WOULD SELL, AND SELL IT HAS. EVEN 
THE RUSSIANS WILL BE PLAYING SOON. IT'S DESIGNED TO ENTERTAIN AND TO TEACH 
BASIC FARMING ECONOMICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Just one roll of the die can take players from a bountiful wheat harvest to a 
deadly infestation of moths that damages their apple crops. 
</P>
<P>
 But The Farming Game is more than a board game. George Rohrbacher designed it 
to teach the basic economics needed to keep a farm afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an economic model," said Rohrbacher, a farmer himself. "This is what the 
family farm looks like at ground zero. And it's done with enough humor and 
whatnot that we've sold hundreds of thousands of them just for fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Russians will be playing the game in a matter of months, as part of a 
project sponsored by an arm of the World Bank to help teach Russian farmers the 
ins and outs of capitalistic farming. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 350,000 copies of the game have been sold since Rohrbacher first 
followed through on a friend's idea in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 The game is divided into squares like "Monopoly," with each square 
representing one week. The corner squares are Christmas vacation ($5,000 salary 
every time you pass, $1,000 bonus if you land on it), spring planting (double 
corn yield that season if you land there), Independence Day bash, and harvest 
moon (collect $500 if you land on it). 
</P>
<P>
 The center of the board is divided into six farms, borrowing names from 
Washington's lower Yakima Valley, a fertile farmland area. 
</P>
<P>
 Players start out by inheriting 10 acres each of grain and hay, $5,000 in 
promissory notes from the bank and two option-to-buy cards, which can be 
exercised only in the 13 weeks between Christmas vacation and spring planting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Option-to-buy cards are like real estate listings," Rohrbacher said. 
"(Operating expense cards) are the bills: Every time you get income, you pay 
your bills. And farmers' fate cards are those little things that happen along 
the way." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are things that I thought the 98% of America that doesn't farm should 
know about how essential this is to the health of the country," he said. 
"Farmers tend to be taken for granted. It's like air. Food is here, right? 
Well, it depends on where you are in the world whether food is taken for 
granted or not." 
</P>
<P>
 When the idea for the game arose, Rohrbacher was struggling to keep his new 
farm afloat. His first year, 1977, was notable for a bad drought. The next 
year, there was a flood. In 1979, there was drought again, and Rohrbacher's 
wife, Ann, who was pregnant with their third child, had just announced she was 
quitting her job to stay home with the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me if I couldn't figure out how to make this damn farm pay, we were 
just going to sell it and we were out of it," he said. "She had given every 
ounce of blood she was going to give." 
</P>
<P>
 So the couple borrowed $90,000 to see if the game would sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew, OK, we're in trouble. We're going down the tubes. One or more years 
like this and we've lost it anyway. So what do we do? We do something 
desperate. We borrow every cent literally that we could gin up and produce 
10,000 copies," he said. "We literally bet every penny of real estate equity we 
had left. We bet the ranch." 
</P>
<P>
 The first copy of the game came off the production line four months later, 
just in time for Christmas sales. Six weeks later, nearly 8,000 copies had 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first 150,000 we had to work to sell. The rest have sold by word of 
mouth," Rohrbacher said. "Literally, all the new accounts we have opened since 
1985 have been some customer went to some store and said, 'You have to get that 
for me.' And somehow they found out about us, like someone saw our name on the 
side of the box or something." 
</P>
<P>
 The game, which retails in stores nationwide for about $30, is used in 3,000 
schools from Portland State University economics classes to fourth-grade social 
studies classrooms, Rohrbacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, American AgriWomen gave a copy of the game to every member of 
Congress. The Mental Health Assn. of North Dakota used it as part of a farm 
stress abatement program. And Aviation Mission Fellowship, which has missionary 
posts around the world, began distributing hundreds of copies to its distant 
outposts after the group's president played it during a visit to Borneo in the 
early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The game is even a hit in Amish country in Pennsylvania and Ohio, which 
Rohrbacher said includes his largest concentration of retail outlets outside of 
the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a call on our 800 number the other day," Rohrbacher said. "Most of 
these stores are called so-and-so dry goods store. This one called and ordered 
12 games and said, 'Now you remember, you can't call us back. We don't have a 
telephone.' "

WHAT'S FOR DINNER? PERSONAL CHEF HAS A GOURMET ANSWER; LIFESTYLE: HARRIED BABY 
BOOMERS HIRE PROFESSIONALS TO DO THE MARKETING, COOK A COUPLE WEEKS' WORTH OF 
GOURMET MEALS, AND LEAVE THEM IN THE FREEZER. THE SERVICE ISN'T CHEAP, BUT IT'S 
GROWING IN POPULARITY.

<P>
 The latest trend for baby boomers struggling to squeeze more quality out of 
their quality time? 
</P>
<P>
 Personal chefs -- they'll do the shopping, cook a couple weeks' worth of 
gourmet, low-fat meals and leave the food in the freezer to be consumed at 
will. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a business whose time has come. I don't think this would have worked 10 
years ago," said David Mac Kay, executive director of the U.S. Personal Chef 
Assn., which in less than two years has grown to more than 300 members serving 
clients in 46 states. 
</P>
<P>
 In Spokane, Finnigan's Feast personal chef service got started earlier this 
summer and is growing as fast as owners-operators Sara and Bob Finnigan can 
handle it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who's tried it so far has become a long-term client," Sara Finnigan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finnigan's Feast offers clients an extensive menu, including entrees as 
highbrow as minted lamb ragout and cranberry glazed pork, and as down-home 
hearty as chili con carne and turkey pot pie. 
</P>
<P>
 The service has a supply of recipes large enough to avoid repeating any for 
six months, "unless a client requests it," Sara Finnigan said. "It's a very 
personalized business." 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't come cheap. A normal Finnigan's Feast service of nine to 10 dinners 
costs $250, including groceries and preparation. To attract new customers, the 
service offered a $200 special in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Recipes and operational and marketing tips for Finnigan's Feast and other such 
services come from the national association, based in Albuquerque, N.M. That's 
where Mac Kay and his wife, Sue, relocated after several years of running the 
prototype service in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Mac Kay, whose background is in electrical engineering and marketing, said it 
didn't take long to realize they had hit on a marketable idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized that this was a real niche, and found there was nobody around the 
country really doing anything like this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple spent 1990 and 1991 writing recipes for dishes that would freeze 
well, training manuals and software packages for personal chefs. After about 
eight months of testing the concept in 1992, "we were ecstatic with the results 
and decided we would go national with this," Mac Kay said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The range of people involved goes all the way from the homemaker in Kenner, 
La., to the (former) executive chef," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential service operators pay $99 to join the association, then buy one of 
three recipe and training packages, costing from $500 to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mac Kay said most personal chefs can count on an income between $30,000 and 
$50,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finnigans, who are able to complete more services by working as a team, 
figure to make between $48,000 and $68,000, Bob Finnigan said. After two months 
in business, they served about 12 clients, and hope to bump that up to 20 or 
even 25, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Client Beth Crafton said having a personal chef has eased stress on her and 
her husband, Doug, both of whom sell medical equipment. "We were spending a lot 
of money eating out. We'd get home from work, we'd both stare into the 
refrigerator and say, 'Why don't we just go out?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you figure you blow $20 easily on something generic that really isn't 
that healthy for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Crafton said she appreciates the personal attention. "She comes into your home 
and she surveys you -- 'Do you like a lot of meat? Do you prefer low fat? Do 
you have any allergies?' -- It's quite a lengthy survey." 
</P>
<P>
 Crafton said she also likes the heat-and-eat convenience, and the ability to 
store the meals until they're ready to use.

 In 21 years of caring for sick and injured birds, Dave Siddon had never seen 
anything like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two months, eight birds have been brought into the Wildlife 
Images rehabilitation center from around the Rogue River Valley with crossed 
bills, missing eyes or both. They include two red-tailed hawks, an osprey, 
three kestrels, a Brewer's blackbird and a robin. 
</P>
<P>
 "About three years ago we had a red-tailed hawk come in with a crossed bill," 
said Siddon. "But this is the first time we've ever had this number of birds 
come in with such obvious physical anomalies." 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is a red-tailed hawk with a crossed bill and missing one eye, 
including the orbital bone around the eye. It has been kept alive through force 
feeding. Tissue and blood samples from this bird could provide the best clues 
to solving the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is likely complex. Red-tailed hawks eat small mammals, osprey prey 
on fish and robin eat worms and fruit, suggesting that if some contaminant is 
causing the deformities it is not limited to one place. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are finding a wide range of animals feeding on a number of different 
things, that is pretty unusual and certainly of concern," said Don Steffeck, 
chief of the environmental contaminants division at U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service in Portland. "Unfortunately, there is not any one element of 
contamination that can cause these." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of some kind of pollution worries Arnie Abrams, who found the 
red-tailed hawk with the crossed bill and missing eye in his back yard in 
Ashland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would sit out here on the deck in my back yard and look up with my 
binoculars at the nest and think about how good life is in southern Oregon," 
Abrams said. "Maybe now it makes you think about how bad things can be." 
</P>
<P>
 The deformities bring to mind two well-known cases of birth defects among 
birds: double-crested cormorants with crossed bills that started appearing in 
great numbers around the Great Lakes in the 1970s and the variety of deformed 
waterfowl on the Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge in central California in 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Siddon's birds don't appear to match those from Kesterson, said Joe Skorupa, 
senior biologist in the environmental contaminants division for the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service in Sacramento, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 The deformities among the Kesterson birds were traced to the naturally 
occurring metal selenium, which was concentrated in irrigation water running 
off farms into ponds at the wildlife refuge. When female birds were exposed to 
high concentrations of selenium a week before laying their eggs, their young 
hatched with no eyes, missing lower bills, deformed upper bills or deformed 
legs and feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be looking for some kind of organochlorine," said Skorupa. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the deadly family of chemicals that includes polychlorinated biphenyls, 
or PCBs, as well as dioxin and DDT. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Schuler, supervising biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's 
environmental contaminants division in Portland, plans to concentrate on those 
chemicals in her search. 
</P>
<P>
 She is arranging for contract laboratories to scan blood and tissue samples 
from the birds for metals and estrogen levels, too. The National Wildlife 
Health Laboratory in Madison, Wis., will do necropsies, the equivalent of 
autopsies on humans, to look for more insidious problems, such as deformities 
in reproductive organs. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the tests should be available in several months. 
</P>
<P>
 PCBs were once commonly put in oil in electrical transformers to prevent 
fires. Dioxin, a byproduct of making paper, can cause problems in minute 
amounts. DDT, a pesticide, caused the swift decline in bald eagle and peregrine 
falcon populations by producing eggshells too thin to survive incubation. The 
chemicals have been outlawed for their toxicity. But spills and dumping have 
left them widespread around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 When they get in the body, organochlorines can mimic the female hormone 
estrogen. That can cause deformities, as well as make males act like females. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Palmer, an assistant professor of microanatomy at Ohio University, has 
been working with double-crested cormorants exposed to PCBs around Green Bay, 
Wis. Many of the birds have crossed bills and other anomalies related to 
estrogen mimicking. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get the crossed bills and missing eyes, if it is a pollution-induced 
effect, there had to be a lot of pollution," involved with the Oregon birds, 
Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes this stuff so insidious is that when you see these gross changes 
in animals' appearance, that may be just the tip of the iceberg," he added. "We 
have other populations of animals like alligators in Florida, where the adults 
grow up normally, but their reproduction is impaired. The habitat looks 
wonderful, the adults look fine, but they cannot sustain their population, so 
you have the potential for a true environmental tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the contaminant that caused the deformities still leaves the question 
of its origin, Steffeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 There might even be some natural condition, such as malnutrition, to explain 
the deformities, said Skorupa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like the canaries trying to tell us something in the mine shaft," 
said Skorupa. "Maybe we ought to start opening our eyes a little wider, 
sniffing under stones and trying to figure out what the canaries are trying to 
tell us. They are our early warning system."

<P>
 A Death Row inmate awaiting retrial was freed Thursday, two months after the 
main witnesses against him recanted their testimony and one confessed to the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Burrows, who was sentenced to death five years ago, was released on a 
recognizance bond and given a send-off by his fellow inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrows, 41, was one of three people convicted of killing William Dulin in 
1988. The two others -- Gayle Potter and Ralph Frye -- received lighter 
sentences in exchange for their testimony. But Potter and Frye recanted their 
testimony during a July hearing. Potter said she alone killed Dulin.

WESTSIDE WATCH: L.A.'S DOLPHINS PROVE YOU CAN COME HOME AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of people have been asking Los Angeles County lifeguards about the many 
dorsal fins recently sighted off Westside beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But relax, swimmers, surfers and kayakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fins don't belong to famished Great Whites, but large schools of 
dolphins returning to Santa Monica Bay after an absence of many years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing many dolphins out here, 15 to 20 at a time," said lifeguard Lt. 
Ira Gruber. "They're coming back because the water is cleaner. We're seeing 
them cruising back and forth, and when the surf's up, you can see them riding 
the waves." 
</P>
<P>
 Water quality has improved with the diversion of storm drain runoff to the 
Hyperion sewage treatment plant in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 But the return of Flipper has startled a few beach-goers. Some lifeguards say 
they have received reports of a few gung-ho motorboaters taking potshots at the 
friendly creatures, mistaking them for sharks. (A key distinction: Dolphins 
propel themselves through the water with an up-and-down motion so their fins 
bob along the surface; sharks swim more steadily so their fins remain above 
water.) 
</P>
<P>
 "These dolphins are doing no harm and it's important to give them some space 
-- it's their ocean," Gruber said. 
</P>

 IF THE SUIT FITS . . .: Two years after the Santa Monica City Council fired 
City Atty. Bob Myers for defying council orders to draft tougher homeless 
policies, he was back last week on the City Hall lawn talking to homeless 
people about possible legal action against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 When he left the job, Myers said he wouldn't sue the city over the homeless 
policies that cost him his job. But that was two years ago, he said Thursday, 
and there's nothing wrong with giving legal advice about ordinances passed 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers and other members of the National Lawyers Guild talked to about 40 
homeless people who complained they would have no place to sleep when the city 
closes the parks at night this month. The new city shelter doesn't have enough 
room and has too many rules, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Lafferty, executive director of the guild's Los Angeles chapter, asked 
what they would do for a place to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go to L.A.," one man said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You going to let them run you out of town?" Lafferty challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers discussed legal options after meeting with the homeless people, 
but Myers declined to comment on any plans.

 NOT THE USUAL SUSPECT: Santa Monica police last week collared a man suspected 
of burglarizing a jewelry store. 
</P>
<P>
 His age? 71. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Police Lt. Gregory Slaughter said Rudolph Ponce was booked on 
suspicion of burglary Thursday after officers and security guards responded to 
a silent alarm at Bubar's Jewelers and found him in the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in the process of rifling through things," Slaughter said, adding that 
the front door had been pried open. Ponce, Slaughter said, "had a crowbar and a 
hammer." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is unusual to have a man in his 70s facing burglary charges, it 
isn't unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the times," said Sgt. Frank Fabrega. "We encounter all ages."

HOMELESS PLAN OK IS CALLED 'POLITICAL MOVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BUZBEE, TIMES STAFF WRTIER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council approved more get-tough homeless policies last 
week, but supporters of the petition drive that prompted the new measures say 
the issues of crime and homelessness won't go away in the fall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "My colleagues are scared to death they're going to lose their seats, and the 
voters are smart enough to see it," said Councilman Robert Holbrook, a strong 
supporter of homeless restrictions who is up for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 But members of the powerful political group Santa Monicans for Renters' 
Rights, who Holbrook criticizes for being too permissive on homeless issues, 
say the petition was only a political tool to drum up fears of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walk around town, I think things are OK," said Nancy Greenstein, 
co-chairwoman of the renters' group. The petition, she said, "seems like a 
black-and-white thing for people to run on and take their competitors out." 
</P>
<P>
 Petition supporters had planned to launch a new signature drive for tougher 
homeless measures after the City Council delayed a decision on their original 
petition, keeping it off the November ballot. But the council on Wednesday 
adopted all the measures the petition called for, removing the need for the new 
petition effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had already approved many steps called for in the petition, such 
as restricting panhandling and closing the parks at night. Still, petition 
organizers question the sincerity of these and other demonstrations of support 
for homeless restrictions by the council majority backed by the renters' group. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night's action, they said, was a "blatant political move designed to 
diffuse the impetus behind the initiative," said Councilwoman Asha Greenberg, 
spokeswoman for the group Coalition for a Safe Santa Monica, which is backing 
Holbrook and two other candidates for the three council seats up for grabs on 
Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Tony Vazquez, the only incumbent backed by the renters' group in 
the election, cast the lone vote against the petition, which was approved 5-1. 
(Mayor Judy Abdo was out of town.) Vazquez said the petition is only a 
political strategy of his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel we needed to go through the motions to approve it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The package of measures approved Wednesday would, among other things, ban 
panhandling of more than five people waiting in movie lines and require that 
people be given a three-foot zone of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few cases, the new measures would actually ease current restrictions. 
This summer the council voted to close city parks from 10:30 p.m. to 6 a.m., 
but the new steps will roll the closing time back to 11 p.m. They also allow 
Palisades Park to stay open until midnight and slightly ease the prohibition on 
panhandling near ATMs. Panhandling was prohibited within 80 feet of an ATM, but 
the new steps draw the line at 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 That restriction is one of several that might be found unconstitutional if 
challenged in court, according to a report from the city attorney's office. The 
courts consider panhandling a form of free speech protected by the First 
Amendment, and cities have little authority to regulate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the council was gathering for the meeting Wednesday, former City 
Attorney Robert Myers and other members of the National Lawyers Guild were on 
the City Hall lawn talking to homeless people in preparation for possible legal 
action against the city.

PLUNGING INTO LANGUAGES; CULVER CITY SCHOOL IS FIRST IN STATE DEVOTED TOTALLY 
TO SPANISH, JAPANESE IMMERSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Culver City's newest school has a fresh coat of paint, a red-and-blue 
playground set -- and a new mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Monday, elementary school students in Culver City's Japanese and 
Spanish language immersion programs will study together at the El Marino 
Language School. School officials say the pairing of the two K-5 programs, 
taught at separate locations last year, marks the first time a public school in 
California has been devoted entirely to multi-language immersion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are breaking new ground with this school," said Principal Steve Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was formerly principal of Farragut Elementary, where he oversaw the 
launch of the Japanese immersion program three years ago. He said parents from 
the Westside, South Bay and San Fernando Valley have inquired about enrolling 
their children at the revamped El Marino, which closed in 1981 because of low 
enrollment and was later leased to private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are taking dramatic new steps, creating a new program the whole country 
can take a look at in terms of challenging students," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, the Culver City school district created a Spanish language track for 
elementary school students, the first district in the United States to do so. 
Until this year, the Spanish immersion program was taught at El Rincon 
Elementary. The 400 immersion students shared the campus with 200 non-immersion 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of overcrowding at the school, district officials decided to reopen El 
Marino and move the Spanish immersion program there, designating the school as 
a foreign language magnet. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer, parents and community members have helped refurbish the 
school. The district set aside $700,000 to upgrade the campus, said James 
Crawford, assistant superintendent of business services. 
</P>
<P>
 About 420 students will be enrolled in El Marino's Spanish immersion program, 
75 in the Japanese language program. The core curriculum, Martinez said, will 
be taught in Japanese and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Culver City district, immersion students receive all their instruction 
in the foreign language. In kindergarten and first grade, only 10% of the 
instruction is in English. In second grade, the students spend an hour on 
English language arts, and English instruction increases gradually each year. 
By fifth grade, nearly half their school day is spent reading and writing in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 The immersion track extends to the middle school and high school level. This 
year, for the first time, about 100 immersion students at Culver City Middle 
School will learn science in Spanish. Before, students who continued with the 
Spanish immersion studied only social science and literature in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 For its new combined K-5 immersion site at El Marino, the school district 
hired three Spanish teachers and one Japanese teacher, for a total of 11 
Spanish teachers and three Japanese teachers. In the Spanish program, there 
will be three kindergarten classes, two first- and second-grade classes, a 
third- and fourth-grade combination, and single third-, fourth- and fifth-grade 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese program, which has been federally funded since it was started in 
1991, will include a kindergarten class, a first-grade class, and a combined 
second- and third-grade class. 
</P>
<P>
 The two programs will remain essentially the same, said Martinez, but will 
benefit by being in the same building. "The teachers can share methodologies 
and language acquisition techniques," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was announced last year, the move to El Marino drew criticism from 
parents. The critics feared that some parents, who wanted to keep their 
children at Farragut because it was their neighborhood school, would withdraw 
their children from the Japanese track, weakening the program. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say that so far one family has done so, withdrawing two 
Japanese-track students. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez said the school district is committed to supporting the Japanese 
program once the federal funding runs out. If finances dwindle, however, school 
officials say they will take cost-saving steps, such as further combining 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such worries, many parents express support for the new school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a wonderful idea, to pull all the resources together," said 
Shelly Shapiro, a parent of a fifth-grade Spanish immersion student. "I'm happy 
my daughter is bilingual; I've seen how useful it is. She does the interpreting 
for us."

BEVERLY HILLS' SMOKING BAN WOULD OUTDO OTHER CITIES'; LAW: THE PROPOSAL, TO BE 
CONSIDERED TUESDAY BY THE CITY COUNCIL, LIMITS EXEMPTIONS FOR BARS AND OUTDOOR 
DINING AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Beverly Hills has unveiled its tough new anti-smoking proposal, but the 
measure is expected to draw fire from businesses when the City Council begins 
considering it Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed Beverly Hills ban, stricter than smoking restrictions enacted by 
other cities in the Los Angeles area, would apply to bars, restaurants, hotel 
lobbies, public parks and other locations. The measure is just what no-smoking 
advocates had hoped for -- and what some business owners had feared. 
</P>
<P>
 "To make the ordinance stricter than those in the cities around Beverly Hills 
is ridiculous," said Rudy Cole, a public affairs consultant for a number of 
Beverly Hills restaurants. "Smokers will eat at home more often." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Beverly Hills enacted an aggressive ban, but opponents -- led by 
restaurateurs -- persuaded City Council members to reverse the ordinance. Under 
the new proposal, which was made public last week, the city would prohibit 
smoking in bars and cocktail lounges, hotel lobbies and function rooms, on 
government property and in businesses with two to five employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking also would be outlawed in public parks and restaurants -- in both 
inside and outdoor dining areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance exempts tobacco shops, smokers' lounges and theatrical 
productions -- if smoking is an integral part of the story being told. Also 
exempted are medical sites where research on smoking is being conducted, as 
well as smoking areas for patients in long-term health care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed penalties, which could apply either to the smoker or the 
owner of the business that allows illegal smoking, repeat violators could be 
fined up to $250. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the measure say the need for a strong smoking ban is a simple 
matter of public health. Esther Schiller, co-director of Smokefree Air for 
Everyone, a California anti-smoking group, says an aggressive ban would help 
businesses by reducing the likelihood of lawsuits from victims of secondhand 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ban is designed to protect businesses from liabilities," Schiller said. 
"(Businesses) just don't seem to understand." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there is no organized opposition to the proposed ban. But some hotel 
and restaurant operators are already expressing concern that it goes beyond 
other local smoking bans, which generally offer more exemptions -- for bars and 
outdoor dining areas, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 This, critics say, could put businesses in Beverly Hills at an economic 
disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a smoker, I'd go to another hotel," said Heinrich Morio, executive 
assistant manager of the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel. "Don't give us 
something that's more stringent than Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 About 25% of the hotel's guests are foreign travelers, many of whom are heavy 
smokers, Morio said. Yet, the Peninsula's bar, not its room rentals, will take 
the blow the hardest, Morio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certain things go hand in hand, like having a drink and smoking," he said. 
"Lobbies don't matter, but if you're going to take away the smoking from a bar, 
you might as well take away the drink."

COMEDY; ATTACKING RACISM, HOMOPHOBIA -- PLAYFULLY

 She calls herself the "Latin Lezbo Comic," but at least one critic has dubbed 
her a latter-day Lenny Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Palacios, a Mexican American lesbian who lives in Venice, is making a 
distinctive mark as a writer, comic and performer who deals with taboo subjects 
and hurls social barbs. Her latest work, a piece of performance art called 
"Confessions -- a Sexplosion of Tantalizing Tales," premieres Thursday (Mexican 
Independence Day) at Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes her unique is a combination of her Latina culture, her lesbianism 
and the way she conveys it to a general audience in an accessible way," said 
Tosh Berman, executive and artistic director of Beyond Baroque, a Venice 
literary and arts center where Palacios has performed several times. 
</P>
<P>
 In her performances, Palacios, 35, addresses racism and homophobia head-on. Of 
her "Latin Lezbo Comic" solo act, Los Angeles Times reviewer Ray Loynd 
commented: "Triply oppressed as a female Mexican American lesbian, she revels 
in the comic possibilities of the outsider. . . . It's Lenny Bruce's liberating 
technique all over again. Only the taboo is different." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Palacios also deals with themes that have broad appeal, such as love and 
family. Even her newest work, the "Confessions" performance art piece, is 
frequently more playful than explicit. 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios grew up in San Jose, one of six children, in what she calls a 
"double-dyke familia" (older sister Eleanor is also a lesbian) that she 
describes as stable and happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to an all-girls' Catholic school, which was great preparation for 
lesbianism and the theater," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until college that she started to question her sexuality, she said, 
adding that she first kissed a woman when she was 19. "I remember thinking, 
'This is what a kiss should be . . . the butterflies in the stomach.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, she received a degree in film studies from San Francisco State 
University and started out on the Bay Area's comedy circuit. There, she 
performed in mainstream as well as alternative houses. But after appearing at 
gay clubs, she found some mainstream venues didn't want her back. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was first doing stand-up for straight Latino audiences, I didn't do 
the queer stuff," she said. "There's homophobia in every community, but it's a 
little more touchy in the Latino community because of Catholicism and the 
emphasis on family." Gaining her parents' acceptance of her sexual orientation, 
she says, "was a slow process." 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios recalls the time she performed for a Latino audience at a college 
Cinco de Mayo celebration and was preceded by several mainstream male comedians 
who made jokes about gays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came on and I did 10 minutes of mainstream, and then did the queer stuff," 
she says. "People got kind of quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience warmed up a little, she said, "when I got into coming out to my 
family and bringing my wife home." Still, she says, "it was a situation where I 
wanted to say, 'Hey man, we both eat tacos.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios has performed extensively on the Westside in venues including the 
Celebration Theater in West Hollywood, Powerhouse Theater in Santa Monica and 
Odyssey Theater in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember doing about seven minutes of stand-up at an installation at the 
Santa Monica Museum of Art, and these young little girls -- about 10, all 
looking like Barbies -- came up to me and said, 'You're really funny. We like 
you,' " Palacios said. "At the same show, some older Latino men came up and 
said, 'Thanks for representing us.' It's been mostly a welcome reception from 
audiences on the Westside." 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Alfaro, an award-winning gay Latino writer, poet and performer, said 
Palacios is considered political in the Chicano community because her material 
deals with homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been able to push the boundaries, not only in form but in content," 
said Alfaro, who is a co-director with Palacios of VIVA, a national 
organization of lesbian and gay Latino artists. "(Her material) challenges our 
notions of customs and traditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, he said, she also does "quiet love pieces," and her references to growing 
up with Westerns and "The Brady Bunch" make her seem more assimilated than some 
other Latino artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios came to Los Angeles in 1987. Here, she said, racism is "constantly in 
my face." Not only does Hollywood overlook Latinos, she said, so does the 
nation's gay community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confessions -- a Sexplosion of Tantalizing Tales" plays Thursday through 
Sept. 25 at Highways Performance Space, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica. 
Performances are at 8 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays and 7:30 p.m. Sundays.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST HOLLYWOOD; NEIGHBORS TURN TO CITY FOR HELP WITH BLIGHTED 
HOME

 Residents have asked city officials to take action against a dilapidated La 
Jolla Avenue house that they say has become a haven for transients and public 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least a year, the three-bedroom, Spanish-style cottage at 902 N. La 
Jolla Ave. has been abandoned for long periods, residents say, frustrating 
efforts to clean up the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 According to county property records, the house belongs to 68-year-old Paul 
Mathison, who neighbors said has lived at the address off and on. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they recently cited Mathison for violating property 
maintenance standards. But it remains unclear whether he will be able to comply 
with the citation. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sheriff's Department spokesman says that Mathison has been hospitalized 
since early last month, when he was allegedly attacked and robbed by a 
transient he had hired as a handyman. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reach Mathison were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Kemper, a resident who has asked the City Council to investigate the 
property, said she and other neighbors harbor no ill will toward Mathison, who 
city officials say is disabled. Residents just want the property cleaned up and 
made safer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some respects, (Mathison) hasn't gotten the help he needs," Kemper said. 
"He's fallen through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Mahar, who lives nearby, said the house has dragged down the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent evening, the front yard was littered with trash and sawhorses and 
the house was dark and appeared unoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahar and other neighbors questioned a city official's contention that the 
property is being maintained by a caretaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was a caretaker, he certainly wasn't doing a very good job," Mahar 
said. SCOTT COLLINS

COVER STORY; HE'S SWELL ON WHEELS!; GERARD MORENO AND OTHER DISABLED ATHLETES 
BENEFIT FROM INNOVATIVE WHEELCHAIR DESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Off-road wheelchair racer Gerard Moreno launches himself off the starting ramp 
like a man possessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Within seconds the West Los Angeles man is bouncing along the hard-pack 
mountain trail, careering around turns and plunging down a two-mile obstacle 
course of blind curves, cliffs, rocks, foot-deep ruts, switchbacks and loose 
dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly six minutes later, at an altitude 1,200 feet lower, he hurtles across 
the finish line, thrilled by another successful practice run and an improved 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old Moreno, who was paralyzed below the rib cage in a 1981 gunshot 
incident, recently put such practice to use, finishing second in the National 
Off-Road Bicycling Assn.'s wheelchair division championship. The event was held 
Aug. 2-28 at the Snow Summit Ski Area in the San Bernardino Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 For Moreno, the sport rivals no other. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost surrealistic, like you're in a dream world," he said. "You're 
rattling around, flying out of your seat, trying to steer and your hands are 
numb from holding on. The wind is whistling through your helmet and your heart 
is pounding. It can get hairy when you're heading for a turn, and your brakes 
lock up when you hit some loose terrain. Sometimes I don't know if my butt is 
sliding because I can't feel the seat." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno is part of a new breed of wheelchair athletes -- multi-sport 
competitors who have been liberated by innovative wheelchair designs. 
Wheelchair riders once encumbered by unwieldy, heavy equipment now use lighter, 
more versatile contraptions to master such sports as skiing, tennis, 
basketball, fencing, karate, rugby -- and off-road racing. 
</P>
<P>
 The new equipment has allowed Moreno to recapture some of the thrills he knew 
in his other life -- the life he had before Oct. 24, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 On that night, while he was in the rear of his parents' Rancho Park home with 
his girlfriend, two men came to the back door saying they were police officers. 
Upon entry, one man stuck a gun in Moreno's face, while the other ransacked the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 As the gunman tried to rip the jewelry off his girlfriend's neck, the family 
dog charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the gunman was strangling my girlfriend and that he was about to 
shoot the dog," Moreno said. "It just set me off." 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman's weapon jammed and both assailants fled. As Moreno chased them 
from the house, the man with the gun turned and fired. A .22-caliber bullet 
entered the left side of Moreno's torso, shattering a vertebra and blowing away 
half his left lung. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno immediately lost feeling in his legs and subsequently passed out. He 
awoke in the hospital the next day, with tubes in his mouth, nose and beneath 
his rib cage. Intravenous tubes dangled from his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Three operations later, Moreno hit bottom. Efforts to repair nerve damage to 
his spinal cord were unsuccessful. He was paralyzed from the rib cage down. 
</P>
<P>
 Months of numbing rehabilitative therapy followed, during which Moreno had to 
rely on others to teach him the basics: dressing, cooking, bathing and going to 
the bathroom. He was fitted with a colostomy bag for excretions and a catheter 
to drain urine into another bag. 
</P>
<P>
 It was quite a comedown for Moreno, who, before his injury, had played on the 
Beverly Hills High School football team and competed as a pole-vaulter at Cal 
State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was overwhelmed with a feeling of helplessness -- especially being with 
other people who knew me as an athlete and an independent person," he said. 
"But when I saw some of the quadriplegics down the hall, I realized how blessed 
I was -- I still had my mind and arms. I was determined to become 
self-sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Many psychologists say the pace of recovery for patients with traumatic spinal 
injuries can rely on such variables as personality, health insurance coverage, 
and a loyal support network of friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 "The psychological impact is tremendous -- one's life is in ruins," said Dr. 
Olga Stehlik, a rehabilitative specialist who treated Moreno while he was at 
the Northridge Hospital Medical Center. "You need guts and strength to convince 
yourself that you can have a life without walking. Gerard was a fighter who 
never gave up. He was always cooperative and enthusiastic about learning how to 
move around." 
</P>
<P>
 Those paralyzed with spinal injuries must cope with cramping, muscle spasms, 
bed sores, loss of bowel control and chronic urinary tract and rectal 
infections for months, if not years. Friends sometimes disappear. Families can 
split apart over trying to provide round-the-clock care. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the most difficult moment comes when they leave the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many go through a major identity crisis over who they are," said Dr. Sandra 
Rudnick, a rehabilitative psychologist who runs a weekly support group for 
quadriplegics and paraplegics at the Northridge Hospital Medical Center. 
"First, they are in this rehabilitative womb-like environment for months and 
then are thrust back into the world where they had previously been ambulatory." 
</P>
<P>
 The disabled must then cope with sundry tasks of daily life that others 
perform effortlessly: grocery shopping, taking a shower, traveling to 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudnick said most patients go through a major depression, the result of 
grieving over the loss of what they consider to be their former selves. Many 
have long bouts of anger. But eventually, as their pain decreases and they 
regain their ability to function, many patients finally accept their situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologists marvel at those who can return to and excel in their previous 
environments, much less take up off-road wheelchair racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are remarkable people with exceptional drive and tenacity who are at 
the very top of our population," Rudnick said. "They are almost like Olympic 
athletes as compared to the rest of us. They are people who take risks and see 
in their injuries a challenge that will not defeat them." 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, Moreno, whose youthful looks and energy belie his 37 years, 
has rebuilt his life. 
</P>
<P>
 He lives in a comfortable two-bedroom house in West Los Angeles with all the 
trappings of the good life: a Jacuzzi, a motorboat in the back (yes, he goes 
boating too), three cats and a dog. The only notable signs of his disability 
are the ramps affixed to the front and back steps and the special handles in 
the shower and bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no keeping Moreno away from his 20th-year Beverly Hills High 
School class reunion, scheduled for this Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago Moreno founded his own computer consultant company, Intelligent 
Software Systems, which advises businesses about accounting programs. A client, 
Bill Barlow, owner of Cycle Products West, a West Los Angeles motorcycle parts 
and accessory store, said Moreno has become an indispensable part of his 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paperwork is my weak area and he came in and computerized my accounting 
system, which leaves me free to do my other work," Barlow said. "He's really a 
computer whiz and I wouldn't be in business without him. I would have run 
screaming from my building if I had to deal with (government paperwork)." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno's girlfriend of four years and current live-in, Carol, said that when 
she first met Moreno, she was never conscious of the wheelchair -- and still 
isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many people who are not physically disabled but have lots of 
emotional problems," she said. "Gerard is incredibly balanced and is not really 
handicapped. We'll go out and I'll often forget until we come to some stairs or 
an escalator. Those are his only obstacles." 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer, Moreno spends much of his time traveling to various locales to 
compete against his fellow wheelchair racers and other mountain bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 His vehicle is the Enduro All Terrain Chair (ATC), and he is a member of the 
racing team sponsored by the chair's manufacturer -- Connecticut-based Wheel 
Ring Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The chair resembles a contraption NASA might have created for lunar 
exploration. Its titanium frame rests on four heavy-tread tires similar to 
those used on mountain bikes. Like a regular wheelchair, there are two large 
wheels in the back and two smaller ones in the front. But the 52-pound vehicle 
also features dual front suspension forks, alloy headsets, an adjustable seat 
and back, and independent rear drum brakes. It also comes with a special 
steering mechanism and a multi-position rear axle plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last year, Wheel Ring has sponsored Moreno and the ATC Enduro racing 
team's five other members in 10 downhill races, held in Lake Tahoe and in 
Colorado, Utah and as far away as Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the disabled competitors also compete in slalom and cross-country 
races, but the downhill remains their favorite event. Gravity provides the 
speed, and heading downhill avoids the need for the constant pushing required 
in cross-country events and the repetitive sharp turns of the slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno and his fellow competitors are tanned, with muscular chests and Popeye 
forearms. On a recent day, during a series of practice runs, a group of them 
took a breather in the Snow Summit parking area before heading back up the 
chairlifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Feeney, 31, Moreno's chief competitor and the only one in the group who 
is a fellow Enduro team member, is a world-class disabled ski racer. He was 
paralyzed in a 1988 cliff-diving accident when a vertebra snapped as he hit the 
water. The others gathered in the parking lot were Tom Ell, 45, a Long Beach 
resident who became a paraplegic 15 years ago while racing in a Motocross 
competition, and Juan Desales, 29, who contracted a blood disease as a 
teen-ager and lost both legs beneath the knee to gangrene. Desales, a newcomer 
to the sport, was contemplating a first run down the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an easy camaraderie as the wheelchair athletes traded stories and 
quips. At one point Feeney suggested that the best way to stop the 
fast-improving Moreno was to let the air out of his tires. 
</P>
<P>
 They tell of taking breathtaking tumbles, or "turtling," and not knowing if 
they had suffered any injuries. One time, Moreno did an "endo" -- a head over 
heels flip off a hay-bale jump. Race officials ran up and gave him a quick 
look, propped him in his chair and sent him on his way. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone had (said) four or five years ago that we would be going down 
these courses this fast, no one would have believed it," said Moreno, who has 
hit speeds of nearly 50 m.p.h. on his special rig. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as with any competitive spirit, Moreno still has his frustrations. 
Despite the success of his recent second-place finish at the Snow Summit 
downhill races, he was upset at the scheduling of his wheelchair division. 
</P>
<P>
 Their race was the last of the competition at the end of the day. The audience 
had drifted away and the trail was riven with deep ruts from the hundreds of 
previous bicycle runs. An added insult was that Moreno caught up with a 
bicyclist from a previous race and was unable to pass because of the narrow 
trail, which slowed his time. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Stickle, director of competition at NORBA, said his organization meant 
no harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scheduling was a lack of knowledge on our part," he said. "We didn't 
realize how fast (the wheelchair racers) were going. Hopefully, we can run them 
in the middle of the day in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 A more serious disappointment came a month ago. Wheel Ring had custom-made two 
enhanced ATC prototypes worth $5,000 each for Moreno and a friend. The two 
prized chairs were stolen while chained to the back of a pickup parked at the 
friend's house in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the recent setbacks, Moreno is always planning for the future. He 
hopes to go soon on a kayaking, water-skiing and para-sailing trip. And there 
are always new mountains to traverse in his off-road racing career. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to run neck and neck with the expert downhill bikers," he said. 
"We could also use more disabled people out here. . . . They're missing out on 
the thrill of their lives."

WHEELCHAIR MANUFACTURERS TAILORING PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS' LIFESTYLES

<P>
 The number of disabled people who use recreational areas has increased 
significantly, said Joy Aroff, founder of Project Support, a national 
organization based in Brentwood that assists people with spinal cord injuries. 
The trend, experts say, is due in part to the Americans with Disabilities Act 
of 1990, which mandated equal access to jobs, transportation and public 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Many who work with the physically disabled say wheelchair-makers are altering 
their approach to meet the demand for more versatile equipment from the 
country's estimated 1.5 million wheelchair users. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is more equipment available that is lighter and more mobile," said 
Ingrid Cleffi, a recreational therapist and founder of Adaptive Sports and 
Recreation in Simi Valley. "They are building chairs around the person and not 
trying to shove the person into the chair." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheel Ring, a Connecticut wheelchair manufacturer, created the All Terrain 
Chair about two years ago after witnessing explosive sales in the mountain bike 
industry, said company founder Patrick Summers. The company, made up of a group 
of engineers, has been focusing on specialty wheelchairs since 1984. 
</P>

 "We noticed that there was no real wheelchair that could be used outside -- 
especially in the Northeast, where many disabled (people) can't go out in the 
snow or even to the beach," Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said about 300 chairs have been sold since 1992, most of them in the $2,500 
to $2,999 range. Wheel Ring has also used camouflage upholstery for its many 
clients who like to hunt and fish. And last year the company shipped a dozen 
neon pink and yellow chairs to a Japanese medical equipment importer. ADRIAN

FOR SENIORS; DETECTIVES ARE PROS AT STOPPING CONS 
</P>

<P>
 It's been called the crime of the '90s. The victims are trusting, isolated and 
fearful of losing independence. The criminal takes advantage of their trust and 
tries to cash out the assets the victims worked for all their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department has responded to the proliferation of scams 
involving senior citizen victims by forming the Elder Persons Estate Unit -- a 
division of the bunco-forgery operation. It's not just a "cops rescue poor 
victims, throw sleazy con artists in jail" story -- the crime of the '90s is 
being fought with the police work of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Chayo Reyes is a 20-year veteran of the LAPD. In 1987, he was 
assigned to investigate the kidnaping of a wealthy woman in her 80s. As a 
result of the case, Reyes learned about the state penal code section covering 
elders and dependent adults who are swindled by people entrusted to care for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes had been coping with one of the frustrations of police work -- a sense 
of futility -- when he suggested that a separate unit be dedicated to 
investigate the abuse of elders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like all policemen -- I wanted to make a difference, and you find out quickly 
that you can't. In fact, you're not even making a dent." 
</P>
<P>
 The Elder Persons Estate Unit was a turning point for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this assignment, you are making a difference by protecting the home and 
life savings of an elder, and I'm proud to say that the LAPD, in spite of all 
the cutbacks, recognizes the importance of the problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit, in operation for seven years now and consisting of Reyes and 
Detective Dave Harnid, gets 25 calls a day. It has recovered $27 million in 
cash and property. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are frustrations, the officers say. Offenders frequently serve 
short sentences. Of the hundreds successfully prosecuted as a result of the 
work of Reyes and Harnid, only three remain in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Their successes are gratifying, however, in part because of a close working 
relationship with their counterparts in the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a team," Reyes explained. "There are two of us, two people in the 
district attorney's office." 
</P>
<P>
 The unit is also assisted by FAST -- the Fiduciary Abuse Specialist Team, a 
project funded by a Santa Monica-based group called Westside Independent 
Services to the Elderly. One member of FAST, Westside attorney Marc Hankin, is 
the author of a groundbreaking California law that allows victims to collect 
damages for pain and suffering as well as attorney fees. These sums can be 
collected by heirs even after victims die. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also work closely with adult protective services and the public guardian's 
office," Reyes said. "There's no way we could do it from our office alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Susan Aziz, the coordinator of the 18-month-old FAST: "Chayo Reyes is the 
true collaborator and an innovative visionary who is extremely tenacious and 
ethical and still gets around bureaucracies." 
</P>
<P>
 Aziz said Reyes' unit is the only one of its kind in the country. Reyes has 
participated in the training of 6,000 investigators throughout California, 
including prosecutors and, recently, bank employees. At the bank session, Reyes 
brought along his partner Harnid and Ardith Javan, the lawyer in charge of the 
district attorney's elder abuse section, to talk about elder abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Harnid described con artists who prey on the elderly, saying, "They're good 
judges of character. They might follow a man home from church, for instance, 
and engage him in conversation all the while, filling the void of family 
members not paying attention (to the victim). 
</P>
<P>
 "The criminal says he's there for him. They feed on an elder's fear of being 
put in a home or taken advantage of by government," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the family of the victim may be relieved at first that Mom or Dad has 
a friend, the criminal may alienate family members by taking over such things 
as answering the phone or by intercepting mail, maybe cashing small checks of 
$100 or $200, Harnid said. 
</P>
<P>
 Javan added that the criminal sometimes has a partner or, in some cases, whole 
families who appeal to the elder person's sympathies by saying that money is 
needed to care for children. 
</P>
<P>
 In another instance, Harnid recalled, a con artist said he was the son of the 
victim's deceased tax preparer, then obtained power of attorney under the guise 
of consolidating the elder's many bank accounts. In reality, the criminal 
closed out the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim eventually moved in with the perpetrator and the victim's mail was 
routed to the criminal's address. Property was taken from the victim's house, 
stocks were sold and the criminal pocketed the assets -- close to $500,000 -- 
before anyone figured out what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 1 scam involving older people, Harnid said, is a telemarketing fraud 
in which a criminal obtains information about an elderly person's investments 
with a bank, then calls asking for money to cover fees related to a purported 
class-action suit against the bank designed to "protect" investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Such con artists typically request that money not be mailed, thus getting 
around federal mail fraud laws if they get caught. "Beware of someone who 
avoids using U.S. mail and requests alternate means of sending money," Harnid 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering such tips and arresting con artists are not the only reasons the 
detectives clearly enjoy their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We mark success by making the victim secure again," Reyes said.

SALAD DAYS; THE HEAD AND LEAF VARIETIES THAT MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE MARKET ARE 
JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG FOR SOUTHLAND LETTUCE GARDENERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Let us discuss lettuce, although some might call this a non-story because they 
find lettuce so effortless to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 With the possible exception of the rabbit-quick radishes, there really is 
nothing faster or easier than lettuce, and you can start it year around, in a 
container or in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy, a happy plant in the garden," said Janie Malloy, who runs Home 
Grown, Edible Landscaping, in Pasadena, and has planted many a lettuce patch 
for others. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Naniche, who has been growing lettuce in her Mar Vista community garden 
plot for the last 10 years, agrees, and in this mild coastal garden she has 
never been without. "My husband and I eat a lot of salads," she said. 
"Practically every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The only trick to growing lettuce is preventing "bolting" during hot weather 
-- the premature production of seed stalks. But there are new varieties that 
resist bolting (though nearly every catalogue description claims that their 
varieties "resist heat"). 
</P>
<P>
 Lettuce is a cool-season crop, preferring to grow during the cooler months of 
the year. It grows right through our excuse for a winter, growing fastest in 
fall and spring. 
</P>
<P>
 When the weather gets too hot in summer, it might bolt if left in the ground 
too long or when grown in hot inland areas, diverting all its energy into seed 
stalk production. At that point, old leaves shrivel and new leaves become 
bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of our long, cool growing season, California became famous for its 
lettuce early on, especially after Los Angeles seedsman H. L. Musser introduced 
a head type from France, around 1902, that later became known as "iceberg" 
lettuce, though it was first called Los Angeles Market. (The true Iceberg, 
introduced in 1894, is still sold by Burpee seed.) 
</P>
<P>
 Because it grew as a compact, cabbage-like ball, it was easy to ship east in 
refrigerated railroad cars, and, since we could grow it in almost any season, 
it soon dominated Eastern as well as Western markets. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, iceberg-type lettuces were just about the only lettuce you could 
buy, though in the last few years, other lettuces have begun to compete with it 
at stores (it still commands 80% of the market), and eclipse it in the garden. 
Lettuce hybridizer William Waycott, formerly with the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture and now Petoseed, said you can broadly divide lettuces into six 
categories -- the leaf lettuces, romaine lettuces, the butterheads, the 
crispheads, Latin lettuces and the stem lettuces. 
</P>
<P>
 Stem lettuce (also called celtuce) is an Asian kind where the leaf is 
discarded and the stem eaten ("Lettuce leaves are for geese," said a Chinese 
friend of Waycott's). Latin lettuces (one variety is named Gallega) are for 
Mediterranean and South American climates that are warmer even than ours in 
winter. Both may be difficult to find seed for. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so the other four. Countless varieties exist and according to a few 
gardeners, the fun is trying as many as you can. 
</P>
<P>
 Some gardeners delight in mixing red-tinged lettuces with yellow-green, making 
red-green patterns in the vegetable garden. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the most popular in home gardens are the leaf lettuces because they are 
the easiest to grow, though they are also the most prone to bolt. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the oldest varieties is Black-Seeded Simpson, introduced in 1879. It's 
still the most common in seed racks. Joan Naniche ranks this heirloom lettuce 
with the crinkled leaves one of her favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 Salad Bowl (an All-America Selection), Red Salad Bowl, Prizehead and Red Sails 
are common loose-leaf types. Oakleaf is a lettuce with the deeply lobed leaves 
and it is one of the most heat resistant, a good choice for late summer 
harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Naniche likes all of these, but especially the red varieties -- Red Sails, Red 
Oakleaf and Red Salad Bowl. "I went crazy over red lettuces," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaf lettuces are also called "cutting lettuces" because you don't wait for 
them to mature, but cut the leaves as you need them. For this reason alone, you 
should always have some coming along. Most are full grown in less than 50 days 
and will then produce seed stalks, so you should plant a little (say a two-foot 
row) every few weeks throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Janie Malloy broadcasts the seed on compost-enriched beds, waters them by hand 
with a gentle spray until they germinate, then begins eating the thinnings two 
weeks later so the plants end up 4 to 6 inches apart. She keeps cutting leaves 
until the plants begin to bolt. This way, she has lettuce for a good two months 
from each sowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lettuce can be as easily grown in a large container as it is in the ground. If 
there is any secret, it is watering frequently, but not fertilizing much, if at 
all (to avoid nitrate buildup in the leaves). 
</P>
<P>
 Invest any time and money in preparing the soil, which should be loose and 
fluffy with organic amendments. Those lucky few who garden on a sandy or silty 
soil will find growing lettuce ridiculously easy. Those that don't can get 
similar results by growing in mounded or raised beds, as Malloy does. 
</P>
<P>
 She plants in all seasons, although she said that the seed germinates poorly 
in August and September. The way around this is to save those little six-packs 
flowers come in, refill with potting soil and sow seed in them so they can be 
kept in partial shade while they sprout, then transplant several weeks later 
into the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 There's little point in buying nursery packs already planted to lettuce. The 
seed germinates very surely in a few days and barely needs to be covered with 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Some gardeners in hot, inland areas, always grow their lettuce in partial, 
midday shade in late summer. One client of Malloy's has a thriving summer bed 
in Glendale that only gets six hours of sun each day. You can achieve this in 
the partial shade of a tree or make a small shade structure to grow the lettuce 
under, which is what some gardeners do where it gets really hot (over 100 
degrees). But, at this time of the year, you needn't bother. Days will be cool 
by the time the lettuce is maturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although leaf lettuces are easy to grow, Waycott said there are much tastier 
lettuces, starting with the Butterheads and Bibbs (or Limestones, as they're 
sometimes called back East). These form loose heads, very loose and 
creamy-colored in the case of the Bibb types. 
</P>
<P>
 Bibb and Buttercrunch are the standard Butterhead varieties, but a favorite of 
Malloy's customers, and many other gardeners (including me), is the French 
Bibb-type named Merveille des Quatre-Saisons or just Four Seasons lettuce. It's 
tasty and very pretty, a maroon-blushed lettuce that can be harvested like a 
loose-leaf or left to sit and form a small buttery soft head that melts in your 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Romaine is the lettuce of ancients. Sometimes called Cos, which is an island 
off the coast of Turkey, it was grown by the Egyptians, Waycott said. It is, of 
course, the lettuce with the stiff, crunchy leaves, longer than they are wide, 
that are used to make Caesar salads. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a bronze version, not as crinkled or crunchy, named Rouge 
D'Hiver or Red Winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Romaines are usually harvested when mature, which takes about 75 days, when 
they make a loose, tall head. 
</P>
<P>
 True tolerance to bolting is found in the crisphead types of lettuce. Burpee's 
Iceberg and Great Lakes are traditional strains of this crunchy, head-forming 
lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisphead lettuces we gardeners can get seed for tend to be those with the 
most tolerance of extremes. Three that should do well in Southern California 
and that can be grown at almost any time, are Summertime, Mission and a new in 
'95 miniature called Mini-Green, that makes baseball-sized heads. All resist 
bolting but take time to mature (75 or more days). 
</P>
<P>
 Waycott says that the last three weeks are the crucial time for crispheads. 
Most of the head is formed then and daytime temperatures should be around 70-75 
degrees at that time, though Summertime, Mission and Mini-Green can stand more 
heat (85-90 degrees in the case of Mini-Green). 
</P>
<P>
 Near the coast, this means you can grow crispheads year round; inland where 
summers are really hot and winters colder, the traditional planting months are 
late July through September, and then again in late February and March. 
Seedlings can stand the heat and 60-90 days later, when heads form, the 
temperature should be right. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't grown lettuce in a while, or at all, this is the season to 
start because plants will grow rapidly in the warm (even hot) fall weather and 
mature slowly during cooler days. Just be sure to plant a little at a time, and 
then keep doing so throughout the year -- so you don't get too much in one week 
or run out later in the year, just as the tomatoes ripen. In Southern 
California, you need never be without. Seed Sources

HOT PROPERTY: STAR PAYS $2M FOR HIS PRIVACY

 ROBERT REDFORD, who just finished directing the movie "Quiz Show"(opening 
Friday) about the TV scandals of the 1950s -- and will begin work in November 
as the lead in Rob Reiner's romantic comedy "American President," has purchased 
a beachfront lot in Malibu from playwright and screenwriter NEIL SIMON for 
about $2 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Redford bought the 40-by-330-foot lot, which is between his beachfront house 
and Simon's, so nobody would buy and build next door to him, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quiz Show," Redford's fourth film as a director (he won an Oscar for his 
first efforts as a director in the 1980 movie "Ordinary People"), is due to be 
released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Redford, 57, was nominated for an acting Oscar only once but has been 
described as "a cinematic icon" due to his roles in such films as "The Way We 
Were" and "The Sting." He most recently played the billionaire who seduces Demi 
Moore in "Indecent Proposal" (1993). 
</P>
<P>
 Pulitzer Prize- and Tony-winning Simon, whose numerous plays and movies 
include "The Odd Couple," "The Sunshine Boys" and "Lost in Yonkers," took back 
a loan of $1.3 million on the sale of his lot to Redford, according to public 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Redford has owned his Malibu home, with its five bedrooms in 5,000 square feet 
and a pool, since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 He was recently divorced from his wife, Lola, whom he married in 1958. The 
couple have three children and three grandchildren. They apparently separated 
while he was working to raise money for his nonprofit Sundance Institute, the 
independent filmmakers workshop in Park City, Utah, that gave birth to the 
popular Sundance Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Redford has been reported as saying, "Starting Sundance made me very happy. 
But my marriage ended, which was very sad. I spent so much time behind the 
scenes raising money." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon has owned his beachfront home, with five bedrooms in just under 5,000 
square feet, since 1987, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 TOM ARNOLD, who appears in the Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis film 
"True Lies," has leased a Mediterranean villa in Beverly Hills for a year at 
$20,000 a month, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold, 35, has been separated from TV comedy queen Roseanne since she filed 
for divorce in April, changed her mind three days later, and filed again. He 
created and starred in the TV series "Tom," which was canceled in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The home he leased has five bedrooms and a guest house in about 9,000 square 
feet, behind walls and gates. The estate is on a knoll, about an acre in size 
with a panoramic view of the Los Angeles Basin. Lionel Richie and Elton John 
are among the former lessees. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Bekeris of John Bruce Nelson & Associates represented Arnold in the 
lease. 
</P>
<P>
 LOUIS J. HORVITZ, who will direct the Primetime Emmy Awards telecast on ABC 
today, has purchased a house in the Hollywood Hills for nearly $1.2 million, 
sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Horvitz is a veteran director of scores of major live awards and special event 
TV programs including the Primetime Emmys last year and the American Film 
Institute Salute to Jack Nicholson on CBS last March. 
</P>
<P>
 He bought a four-bedroom, 6,300-square-foot house with city views and leased 
out his former home, which is nearby. His new home was originally listed at 
$2.2 million but was most recently on the market at just under $1.3 million, 
sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Genis of 1st London Realtors, Beverly Hills, represented Horvitz in his 
purchase, and Ron Abrams of Fred Sands Estates, Directors Office, had the 
listing. 
</P>
<P>
 INGO PREMINGER, late producer-director Otto Preminger's brother and a producer 
himself of the 1970 movie "MASH," and his wife, KATE, have bought a house in 
Pacific Palisades and put their Wilshire condo on the market at $429,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lived there for 16 years and loved it, but all of a sudden we had the urge 
to have a house, probably because we sold our home in Europe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They had a house in Austria, near Salzburg, "but it was too much for us to 
keep up, having an apartment in New York and the one here." He sighed. "After 
all, we are getting old." 
</P>
<P>
 The Premingers, who celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary in August, are 
both 83. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, once they moved to their house in the Palisades, they missed the pool 
and gym at their condo building on Wilshire. "So we are going to build a pool," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their condo has three bedrooms, a remodeled kitchen and a view of the Los 
Angeles Country Club and mountains. The condo is listed with Adam Blumenstein 
of Jon Douglas Co., Santa Monica.

WHAT TO DO IF YOU CAN'T PAY MORTGAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 QUESTION: We never believed this would happen to us. We have owned our house 
for many years and currently owe several months of mortgage payments. The 
equity in our house is somewhere in the neighborhood of $60,000-$70,000, but 
since I lost my job recently, I can neither make the mortgage payments nor do I 
want to move somewhere else. I have heard about a deed in lieu of foreclosure, 
but do not understand how it works. Can you explain? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: None of us can anticipate what the future will bring. Once in a while, 
calamity strikes, and then we have to face these very hard questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Before addressing the deed in lieu of foreclosure issue, let me outline for 
you a number of steps when dealing with your mortgage lender. 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset it must be pointed out that if you want the lender to cooperate 
with you, there has to be an equal level of cooperation on your side. Indeed, 
according to the Freddie Mac guidelines on alternatives to foreclosure, the 
secondary mortgage market gives a mortgage lender broad discretion to extend 
relief "to a borrower who encounters hardship, is cooperative and has proper 
regard for fulfilling obligations. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The first possible relief is referred to as "temporary indulgence." Here, the 
lender, on request, may grant the borrower a short period of time -- usually 
not more than three months -- to cure any delinquency. However, this is merely 
temporary relief, and by the end of the short period of time, the borrower must 
be completely current. 
</P>
<P>
 Another approach is a repayment plan. Here, the borrower is given a fixed 
period of time -- usually not to exceed one year -- in which to bring the 
mortgage current by immediately making and continuing to make payments in 
excess of the monthly mortgage payment. It is advisable to set down this 
repayment plan in a written document, signed by both the lender and the 
borrower. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders also can enter into what is known as a "special forbearance relief 
agreement," in which the regular monthly mortgage payments are suspended or 
reduced for a period of up to 18 months from the due date of the first unpaid 
monthly installment. At the conclusion of this relief period, the regular 
payments must be resumed, and more important, a comprehensive plan must be 
agreed upon so as to repay the amount that has been suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the lender must satisfy itself that the default is curable, and 
based on the current financial and appraisal data, the lender must be satisfied 
that there is a likelihood that the borrower will be able to comply with the 
repayment plan. Clearly, the burden is on the borrower to document and justify 
the plan, so as to satisfy the lender's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are in the military, the Soldier's and Sailor's Relief Act provides 
various forms of relief, but you should check with your military or civilian 
lawyer to determine your eligibility under that Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The deed in lieu of foreclosure is another remedy that may be available to 
you. Under this arrangement, you deed your property to the lender (or to 
whomever the lender designates) and this is in lieu of (instead of) foreclosure 
proceedings. This arrangement is an acceptable and customary procedure when, 
for example, the borrower is deceased and the estate is willing and able to 
transfer the property, or the borrower has filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and the 
trustee has abandoned interest in the property. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of requirements to accomplish a deed in lieu, and each 
lender will have their own set of guidelines. Generally speaking, however, the 
following requirements are usually imposed by a lender that is willing to 
accept the deed in lieu: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- The borrower has a valid and documented reason for default that is beyond 
the borrower's control. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- The borrower has demonstrated that he or she has made and can make 
prudent financial decisions since the default. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- The borrower has been cooperative and has provided any and all necessary 
documentation to the lender. Additionally, the borrower must permit the lender 
to have reasonable access to inspect the inside of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- The borrower must be willing to make a financial contribution, if this is 
at all possible. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- If the lender has escrowed money for the payment of future taxes and 
insurance, the borrower must be willing to forgo reimbursement of these 
escrowed funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the lender will not even consider taking the property as a deed 
in lieu unless the property has been listed for sale at market value, and all 
attempts to sell the property have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there can be no outstanding liens or other encumbrances on the 
property, since the lender wants to be able to take the property free and clear 
of any other claims against it. 
</P>
<P>
 When a lender takes property as a deed in lieu, presumably the borrower's 
credit history has already been tarnished; after all, the borrower has probably 
not been making mortgage payments for several months. However, it is my 
understanding that a deed in lieu does not get reported as a foreclosure 
proceeding on your credit history, and thus if the lender is willing to accept 
the deed in lieu of foreclosure, at least you may be able to avoid even further 
negative credit history. 
</P>
<P>
 I strongly suggest that you contact your lender immediately, and have a 
face-to-face discussion with them. If your lender is no longer in your 
hometown, send them a letter and then call and make arrangements to talk to the 
most senior official at that mortgage lending company. 
</P>
<P>
 The final option, of course -- which should be used only as a last resort -- 
is for you to file bankruptcy. When someone files for bankruptcy, there are 
many protections that automatically apply from the day the bankruptcy petition 
is filed with the Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important protection under the bankruptcy law is what is known as 
"the automatic stay." If you are in bankruptcy, no legal action can be taken 
against your house unless the lender requests the court for permission to "lift 
the stay." This means that the lender goes before the bankruptcy judge, in open 
hearing, and petitions the court to permit the foreclosure to take place. 
Depending on the circumstances, including the amount of equity you have in your 
house and the possibility of getting back on your feet financially, the 
Bankruptcy Court may or may not lift that stay.

AT HOME: WHERE BOOM TOWN MEETS COUNTRY LIVING; CANYON COUNTRY: IN THE LATE 
'80S, GROWING FAMILIES, RETIREES AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS FLED L.A. TO COME

 Mike Grandriff knew exactly what he wanted for his first house. He had grown 
up in the foothills of La Crescenta, surrounded by canyons and open space, and 
he hoped to buy in an area with similar geography. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandriff, 26 and recently married, also sought quality schools, affordable 
prices and a relatively new house in move-in condition. 
</P>
<P>
 When his hometown proved too expensive, Brandriff figured he would have to 
make concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 But then a realtor showed Brandriff a three-bedroom, two-bath home in Canyon 
Country, off Highway 14 in Santa Clarita Valley -- miles from where he had 
hoped to buy. Suddenly, Brandriff's dream of mountain views and spacious floor 
plans seemed attainable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to pay the association fees on a brand-new house, and the ones 
built in the 1930s that I looked at in La Crescenta were too small," said 
Brandriff, who happily bought something in between -- a 1,400 square-foot, 
$174,000 Pinetree tract home that he moved into with his wife, Cara, in 
September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brandriffs aren't the first home buyers to find happiness in Canyon 
Country. In the late 1980s, growing families, retirees and young professionals 
anxious to escape Los Angeles' crime, smog and violence-plagued schools flocked 
to Canyon Country, swelling its population to more than 38,000. In 1987, the 
needs of these new residents and those of fast-growing Valencia, Newhall and 
Saugus compelled the four communities to incorporate as the City of Santa 
Clarita, with a population of more than 135,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Country -- bounded roughly by Bouquet Canyon Road on the west, the 
ridge line between Plum Canyon and Soledad Canyon on the north, Shadow Pines 
Boulevard on the east and the Antelope Valley Freeway 14 on the south -- 
comprises about one-third of the city's total area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake hit hard in Canyon Country. Many dwellings sustained 
damage, but homeowners describe it as primarily cosmetic, rather than 
structural. The area's freeway system did not fare so well. Both of the main 
arteries out of the Santa Clarita Valley, the Highway 14 and Interstate 5, 
ruptured, leaving residents without a sufficient road south into Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, commuters were forced onto clogged two-lane roads or overtaxed 
Metrolink trains. Now that most of the key freeway connections have been 
restored contractors are busy making home repairs, residents say Canyon Country 
is pretty much back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 30% of today's Canyon Country home buyers are, like the Brandriffs, 
first-timers, according to Remax Realty's Harlan Hice. They come to Canyon 
Country, he says, for much the same reasons as their counterparts a decade 
earlier, but with an added bonus: bargain housing prices brought on by the 
sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Current prices meet almost any budget -- $65,000 for a small condominium; 
$140,000 for a three-bedroom, two-bath starter home; $3.5 million for an 
English Tudor mansion in the exclusive Sand Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 FBI crime ranking, which placed Santa Clarita the fourth safest among 
U.S. cities with more than 100,000 residents, has also boosted home sales. "I 
like the fact that I can leave my garage door open if I want to," Brandriff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jennifer and Phil Sykes, who welcomed their first child in March, Canyon 
Country's reputation for good schools was a significant draw. The young couple, 
who were relieved that their earthquake damage amounted to only $200 for 
drywall patching and repainting, paid $138,000 for their 1,050-square-foot, 
two-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath townhouse in the Tres Robles complex in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the same money in the San Fernando Valley, we could have bought only in 
an unsafe neighborhood," said Phil Sykes, a 32-year-old manufacturer's sales 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Sykes, 30, a special-education teacher at Aragon Avenue Elementary 
School in Los Angeles' Cypress Park neighborhood, heard through her colleagues 
about Canyon Country schools' sound reputation. "As a teacher, that was very 
important to me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, 82% of Canyon High School's graduates went on to college, said Dr. 
Gary Wexler, director of curriculum for Santa Clarita's William S. Hart Union 
High School District. Students at Sierra Vista Junior High ranked in the 85th 
percentile in math and in the 82nd percentile in science in 1992, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa McCarter, 28, who grew up in Canyon Country and also recently had her 
first child, worries whether students at the neighborhood campuses will be able 
to maintain those test scores as the population booms. "We need more schools 
here," she insists. "My little sister needed extra tutoring because her class 
was too full." 
</P>
<P>
 A new junior high school in the Rainbow Glen area is opening to help alleviate 
the significant overcrowding problem, Wexler said. District officials are also 
discussing redrawing boundaries to shift students to less crowded schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Wheeler, who bought her 1,300-square-foot, three-bedroom townhouse for 
$127,000 in 1988, knows about crowds in Canyon Country, but hers are found on 
the Metrolink platform, not the playground. Long before thousands of 
earthquake-weary commuters discovered the rail line, Wheeler would leave her 
house at 6:15 a.m. to catch the 6:35 train at the Saugus stop. (A closer 
station to her house has since opened.) 
</P>
<P>
 An hour or so later, the 37-year-old tax manager at a Big Six accounting firm 
would reach her office. Even with the recent fight for seats, she's still a 
dedicated Metrolink fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic may be slower right now on area highways, but Santa Clarita City 
Councilwoman Jan Heidt contends congestion has actually eased on city streets 
in the last three years, thanks largely to street widening and bridge 
refurbishing. "Now that housing development has slowed down since the 1980s, 
the city has a chance to catch up on infrastructure problems," she noted. 
</P>
<P>
 One such civic matter is a proposed 190-million-ton landfill to be built in 
Elsmere Canyon, 1.5 miles east of the city. An environmental-impact report on 
the landfill is three years overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Elsmere Canyon project is just one example of development out of control 
in Santa Clarita, contend some longtime Canyon Country homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left the San Fernando Valley to escape all this expansion," said Joline 
Edmiston, who was forced to call on her son-in-law, a pilot, to fly her to her 
Encino office in the days after the quake. She's lived in Canyon Country since 
1973, when she paid $60,000 for a 2,000-square-foot, four-bedroom, three-bath 
home in the Mountain Shadows tract. Back then, she remembers, the area was a 
rustic, rural outpost with a pioneer flavor. "There was only one stoplight. Now 
we've really become a city," she bemoaned. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Heidt counters that Canyon Country's metamorphosis into an 
incorporated city has helped, not hurt, the community. "There was no way for 
residents to have input into the development of Canyon Country without becoming 
a city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And although residents such as Edmiston pine for Canyon Country's once-slower 
pace, they do see some rewards in its growth. With the opening of the Valencia 
Town Center, which boasts Robinsons-May, Sears and JC Penney stores, residents 
no longer have to drive to San Fernando Valley shopping centers for the nearest 
department store. Price Club and Home Depot stores, whose discount merchandise 
caters to the area's growing families, have also opened recently. Movie 
theaters and the cultural programs at Cal Arts in Valencia offer Canyon Country 
homeowners some evening activities, but many residents would welcome more 
entertainment venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita Associate City Planner Fred Follstad says he would like to see 
more upscale restaurants in Canyon Country. "We basically have fast-food places 
up here," he lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Wheeler agrees. "Whenever we go out to eat at a decent restaurant, there 
are screaming kids running around," she complained. "There are no places to go 
that are just for adults." 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents, though, contend that it's the family atmosphere that sets 
Canyon Country apart from other Southland neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 For Phil and Jennifer Sykes, that sense of community starts at home. "Where we 
used to live nobody even talked to each other," said Jennifer. "Now we're 
having lobster bakes in our complex and we know all our neighbors. It's made 
all the difference."

APARTMENT LIFE: HOW TO RENT AFTER FILING CHAPTER 7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I live in Newport Beach and a few years ago the combination of a 
ruinous divorce settlement, an unexpected layoff and poor financial planning 
forced me to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even while I was unemployed, I dutifully made rent and car payments as 
scheduled. The other debts were discharged. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, I will need to rent another apartment. My landlord of six years has 
written a letter of recommendation for me indicating that I have always paid my 
rent on time and was an exemplary tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been employed at the same professional job for three years now, and I 
have a good job. Is there anything else that I can do to ensure that my rental 
application will be accepted by a new landlord? How concerned should I be about 
the bankruptcy? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: State law requires that all landlords who are marketing vacancies 
accept your rental application. It's what they do with it after that that 
counts. As for how you should be, that depends more than anything on what has 
happened with your credit since the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Honesty is the best policy and that never applies more than in your situation. 
Since the prospective landlord will find out all about the bankruptcy anyway 
when he runs your credit report, you don't lose anything by telling him about 
it before that. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell him about the bankruptcy at the time you apply for the apartment, 
explaining the circumstances surrounding it. Few things will impress a 
prospective landlord more than your open, up-front acknowledgment, and 
reasonable explanation, of a past transgression. 
</P>
<P>
 Your credit history since the time of the bankruptcy will be another of the 
keys to getting the keys to an apartment. If it's good, the bankruptcy won't 
count against you nearly so much as if your recent credit history is also 
marred. 
</P>
<P>
 It probably wouldn't hurt to remind the landlord that you can't file for 
bankruptcy for the next four years, which should make a new landlord feel a 
little more secure. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, one of your strong points is your stability, six years in one apartment 
and three years at the same job. Stress that when filling out applications. How 
to Get Possessions Returned After Moving 
</P>
<P>
 Q: After spending several years at a Brentwood apartment, I moved for health 
reasons to a retirement home in Culver City. The maintenance manager of my 
former residence supervised the move but kept three boxes of my personal 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
 These included military service documents, personal correspondences and 
foreign travel papers, among other things. My memorabilia file sustained a 
great loss because of the reluctant attitude of this manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Months later, and after numerous requests, both verbal and in writing (I even 
wrote to the owner of the building), one of the boxes has been returned to me. 
Do you have any suggestions about how I can get the rest of my belongings back? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Since you have the absolute right to your possessions, and since you don't 
mind writing letters, I would suggest one more letter to the owner before you 
go to the city attorney charging the manager with theft. If it goes that far, 
the city attorney generally will set up an informal hearing to attempt to 
resolve the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Say that you have been more than patient with your requests for return of your 
personal property, but your patience is running out. 
</P>
<P>
 As an alternative, you may sue him and the manager in small claims court to 
recover the two boxes of documents if they are not returned within, say, a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it wouldn't hurt to let him know that you will seek any damages the 
court may see fit to award if you can't resolve this dispute amicably. What 
Happens When Tenant Neglects Yard 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I own a rental property in Valencia and I have a problem I'm hoping you can 
solve. When the tenants moved into the house, they agreed to maintain the 
premises, including the front and back yard. For that, they got a lower rent 
rate since I wouldn't have to pay for a gardener. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, they did not maintain the premises. The lawn died, so it was 
necessary to plant a new one. In the process, I also chose to install a 
sprinkler system, making the total expense over $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Can I deduct any of this expense from the security deposit? Also can I 
increase their rent to pay for a gardener? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you have a month-to-month rental agreement, it can be changed with a 
30-day notice. In the notice you will withdraw the "maintenance concession" and 
increase the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a lease, it has been breached and the remedy is eviction, but you 
needn't go that far. If they are willing, and they should be, given that their 
alternative is eviction, have the tenants sign an addendum to the lease 
reflecting the withdrawal of the maintenance concession and increasing the 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 As for deducting the cost of planting the new lawn from the security deposit, 
you may deduct it. However, you may have to prove in Small Claims Court that 
the lawn died because of the tenant's failure to maintain it. You cannot deduct 
for the sprinkler system.

YOUR MORTGAGE; BILL PROTECTS BORROWERS FROM RATE GOUGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mortgage borrowers are about to get an important new set of federal consumer 
protections designed to prevent them from stumbling -- or being pulled -- into 
double-digit interest rates and crushing fees at closing. 
</P>
<P>
 High on the list of borrowers slated for new protections: Seniors who sign up 
for reverse mortgages that can sometimes saddle them with effective annual 
rates of 20% to 30% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked away in a massive interstate banking bill approved by House and Senate 
conferees is a section on "high-cost mortgages" -- including everything from 
home-improvement loans to consumer-financing plans for families with subpar 
credit reports but plenty of real estate equity. 
</P>
<P>
 The new legislation is the product of Capitol Hill hearings that documented 
rate-gouging by unscrupulous lenders and mortgage brokers who target and prey 
on vulnerable homeowners, especially elderly persons and financially 
unsophisticated borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 As one example of such scams, a 72-year-old woman described to a Senate 
committee how she was lured into a $150,000 home-improvement mortgage by a 
door-to-door con artist. When she went to closing, the fees charged by the 
lender came to more than $23,000. Worse yet, the principal and interest payment 
due every month was larger than her entire gross monthly income. But she had 
signed up for those very terms, and faced foreclosure if she failed to pay on 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bill will make it harder for loan brokers to trap unwary borrowers by 
outlawing certain types of mortgage programs outright, and by beefing up 
truth-in-lending disclosure requirements for many others. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a quick overview of some of the new protections, and what they may mean 
for you or a homeowner you know: 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most far-reaching impacts will be on the burgeoning reverse 
mortgage market for seniors. The bill carves out a whole new chunk of the 
Truth-in-Lending Act for reverse mortgage loans and lines of credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Reverse mortgages function as the name suggests: Rather than the homeowner 
sending the lender a check, the lender sends money to the homeowner. The checks 
may be monthly or demand-activated, as in lines of credit programs. Whatever 
the payment method, the senior's home equity serves as the collateral for the 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the lender's compensation includes not only a base interest 
rate but an equity share or participation in the appreciated resale value of 
the house itself. If a homeowner dies or sells the home in the first one or two 
years under certain equity-participation reverse mortgage plans, the annualized 
effective interest cost to the borrower can hit 20%, 30%, 40% or even more. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new federal rules, all reverse mortgage loan applicants will have to 
receive specialized truth-in-lending disclosures that spell out these risks 
under a range of economic scenarios. The disclosures will have to be delivered 
no later than three days prior to closing and will allow applicants to bail out 
of the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandated in the new disclosure form: A "projected total cost" forecast, 
including equity participation as well as the costs of financial annuities that 
are integral to certain reverse mortgage programs. 
</P>
<P>
 High-rate home-equity loans for consumer credit purposes are another major 
focus of the bill. It defines "high cost" as any mortgage carrying an annual 
percentage rate 10 points higher than the Treasury security rate for comparable 
maturity periods. If 10-year Treasuries are at 5 1/2%, for example, a 15 1/2% 
mortgage with a 10-year term would fit the definition of high cost. So too will 
loans that carry points and fees payable by the borrower that exceed 8% of the 
total loan amount. On a $50,000 loan, that would mean combined brokerage, 
origination and other fees of $4,000 -- not at all unusual for borrowers with 
prior credit problems. 
</P>
<P>
 On all such high-cost mortgages, new disclosures will be required emphasizing 
the effective annual percentage rate the borrower is signing up for, plus a 
last-minute way out: 
</P>
<P>
 "You are not required to complete this agreement," reads a form that all 
affected borrowers will now receive, "merely because you have received the 
disclosures or have signed a loan application." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond tougher truth-in-lending disclosures, the bill also bans balloon 
payments (lump-sum payoffs) on all high-cost mortgages with terms under five 
years. It also outlaws negative amortization plans, which allow build-ups of 
debt by adding unpaid interest into the principal balance. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: At least a modest new safety net for homeowners who need to 
borrow money, but who should never be sacked with effective rates in the 20% 
and 30% range.

SCHINDLER'S LIST TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your story on "The Schindler's List Tour" (Aug. 21) reminded me of a trip I 
took to Russia, Latvia and Estonia a few years ago. We were taken to a 
concentration camp in Latvia and, although I thought it was a good idea to not 
forget what happened there, I could not get off the bus to tour the camp. I 
didn't think I could handle it emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, who did not speak a word of English, realized I did not want to 
get off the bus. When everyone had left, he took me on a ride into the nearby 
woods. He stopped at a stream, got out and picked some wild strawberries for 
me. While I ate and admired them, he picked a few roses for me. 
</P>
<P>
 At that moment, we both spoke the same language.

 What a depressing picture of Poland.... Granted it had its horrors, but many 
countries have had the same. Why concentrate on them? Why not write about how 
Poland has rebuilt its cities and has maintained its courage and ability to 
forge ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 I will be visiting Poland in September. Yes, I'll visit Auschwitz where the 
brother of my father was killed as a political prisoner -- he was a Roman 
Catholic. But I want to see this great country where my mother and father were 
born -- I'd like to see my heritage of which I'm very proud!

 I take exception to a statement made by Joachim Russek that Poland has 
invented "anti-Semitism without Jews." This statement has been frequently used 
by anti-Poles for their own reasons but it is a canard. There are hundreds of 
thousands of Jews in Poland, but not the religious types. It would be hard to 
find a field of activity in Poland without Jews. They are in the mainstream of 
Polish life. But they don't wear yarmulkes and they don't observe the Sabbath.

 My name is Marisol Torres and I am 13. I enjoyed your article on the 
Schindler's List Tour. Many Jews who survived the Holocaust due to Oskar 
Schindler's courage and bravery will be proud of the fact that people want to 
learn more about the death camps. I have never been through the Schindler's 
List Tour, but I know it would be a wonderful experience. I am proud to say 
that if there was ever another man like Hitler, I would try my best to follow 
in Oskar Schindler's footsteps.

MAJOR, PUTTING HIS CAREER ON THE LINE, FIGHTS TO ENSURE PEACE IN NORTHERN 
IRELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Martin Walker, Martin Walker is the U.S. bureau chief of Britain's The 
Guardian and author of The Cold War: A History (Henry Holt). He also writes for 
Dublin's Sunday Tribune. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first sign of normality came to the north Irish town of Crossmaglen last 
weekend with a police radar gun for a speeding trap. They issued a sheaf of 
tickets, thanks to the advantage of surprise. It was the first time the Royal 
Ulster Constabulary had been in the area with anything but automatic rifles for 
20 murderous years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the speed traps may not last, because of a very British scene that had the 
fate of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republican Army's historic cease-fire 
announcement trembling in the balance at Downing Street last week. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one side, Prime Minister John Major, taking the political risk of his 
career in trying to swing his hesitant Conservative Party and the deeply 
suspicious Ulster Unionists behind the chance for a peaceful settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other, the Belfast ayatollah, the Rev. Ian Paisley, a man whose passion 
for the cause of a Protestant Ulster is second only to his fear of his 
Presbyterian God. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been no secret deals with the IRA," said Major, standing behind 
the long and curiously coffin-shaped Cabinet table. "You have my word on that." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have learned before what that is worth," grunted Paisley, with the hard 
accents of Belfast that each Sunday carry his sermons of hell and damnation 
through his packed church. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you will not take the word of a British prime minister, this conversation 
has no purpose," Major went on. 
</P>
<P>
 A silence fell. The founder of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster 
glowered. Major gritted his teeth. "Will you?" 
</P>
<P>
 More silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get out of this room," Major shouted -- in the version recounted by Paisley. 
"Never come back until you are prepared to say I speak the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Paisley's closest friend, the American fundamentalist Christian Bob Jones, 
once observed that Paisley was "a man of another century." 
</P>
<P>
 The century he had in mind was the 17th -- the time of England's civil war, 
which spilled into Ireland when the forefathers of the Ulster Unionists took up 
arms against the Catholic King of England, James II, and held the port of 
Londonderry through a fearsome siege that Unionists celebrate annually with 
fifes and drums and marches. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the century of God's soldiers, Oliver Cromwell's Protestant 
Ironsides, whose massacre of Irish Catholic prisoners at Drogheda stands out 
through the bloodstained centuries that make up the history of Britain's first, 
and now perhaps its last colony. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last elections to the European Parliament, Paisley was triumphantly 
returned with 170,000 votes. He has sat in the British Parliament since 1970. 
He leads the Democratic Unionist Party, and he may just hold an effective veto 
against the best efforts of President Bill Clinton, Major and Irish Prime 
Minister Albert Reynolds to craft a peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Paisley was the Unionist leader who was pointedly not asked to the White House 
this April, when Clinton's spasmodic attempts to get involved in the peace 
process became serious. Like Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), whose former 
foreign-policy aide Nancy Soderberg has been driving Northern Irish policy from 
the National Security Council, the Unionists suspected Clinton, too, of 
partiality for the Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton personally overruled his secretary of state, his attorney general 
and his CIA and FBI directors to grant a U.S. visitors visa to Gerry Adams, the 
leader of the IRA's political arm, Sinn Fein, the suspicions hardened. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, urged by London and Dublin, Clinton widened his reach, inviting the 
other Ulster Unionist leader, James Molyneaux, to the White House for talks 
with Vice President Al Gore and National Security Adviser W. Anthony Lake. That 
meeting in April, and subsequent phone calls from Lake to Molyneaux pledging 
U.S. even-handedness in the last days leading up to the IRA's cease-fire, was 
the breakthrough in Clinton's Irish policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Molyneaux is 74 and, after leading his Ulster Unionist Party for 15 years, is 
the veteran of the hard world of Ulster politics. He commands nine seats at 
Westminster, and since Major's majority is just 18 seats, Molyneaux has the 
power to cripple British government. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the IRA's cease fire is holding. The Ulster Volunteer Force, one of 
its Protestant counterparts, is teetering on the brink of declaring its own 
suspension of hostilities. . The even larger Ulster Defense Assn. and its 
commando wing, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, are vowing to "carry on business as 
normal." The day after the IRA cease fire, the UFF shot an almost-blind 
Catholic man in the back to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hard old man of the IRA, the legendary Joseph Cahill, 74, reprieved 
from a British death sentence, came to the United States last week to put his 
personal weight behind the cease-fire order. Dublin sources said he came to 
stand down three IRA active service logistics units in the United States. 
Cahill obeyed the IRA's political decision, and so will most Ulster 
paramilitary units if their political leaders give cease-fire orders. 
</P>
<P>
 The British, Irish and U.S. governments are all steeling themselves to keep 
pushing the peace process, in the almost certain knowledge that Protestant 
extremists will try to sabotage it with more killings and provocations. But 
such half-organized spasms can be withstood, if the Unionist political leaders 
back the peace. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the combined flattery of Major and Clinton have kept Molyneaux from 
rejecting the cease fire. He is not a convert to the complex next phase of 
constitutional negotiations. But he is speaking warmly of an elected Northern 
Irish assembly where Catholics and Protestants would jointly administer the 
nuts and bolts of local government. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Molyneaux's rival, Paisley, stormed out of Downing Street last week 
with that old 1689 siege of Londonderry war cry of "No Surrender," he stretched 
a thin political umbrella over the Protestant guerrillas of Ulster. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that Paisley and the guerrillas are alone. Britain wants to 
be done with the costly embarrassment, now that the end of the Cold War has 
removed that age-old strategic fear of Ireland falling into enemy hands. The 
Irish government is prepared to ask its citizens in a referendum to amend the 
constitution which calls for a united Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 And as British and Irish MPs sit side by side in the Parliament of Europe, 
representing two modern and democratic states that cooperate tolerably enough 
in a new institution that is bigger than both of them, the preconditions for 
peace are falling into place. 
</P>
<P>
 Like that police radar gun at the Crossmaglen speed trap, Paisley and the hard 
men stand out as an extraordinary oddity. But that may just be the 
contradictory way that peace will come. 
</P>
<P>
 So bitter are Paisley's suspicions that he fears he is being lured into an IRA 
trap, in which any new fighting sees the British Army unleashed against the 
Unionist forces -- who still believe they are fighting for the British 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
 To evade that dreadful outcome, Paisley might even be prepared to swallow 
hard, commend his soul to his vengeful God and take Major's word.

FOREIGN POLICY THAT WEARS ITS HEART ON THE SLEEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert A. Manning, Robert A. Manning, a former State Department official, is 
a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, the prospect of U.S. intervention in foreign lands, the source of 
often bitter debate since the Vietnam War, is center stage. Even as U.S. troops 
help Rwandan refugees and a confrontation with Fidel Castro looms, attention is 
shifting back to Haiti. Armed with a U.N Security Council endorsement and an 
"international" presence of 266 Caribbean troops, the Clinton Administration is 
edging toward an invasion of Haiti that will be the '90s version of gunboat 
diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. intervention in Cuba may seem far-fetched by comparison, the 
logic of Administration policy toward Cuba is virtually identical to that of 
its policy toward Haiti. Both are largely driven by narrow domestic politics -- 
the Congressional Black Caucus (Haiti) and Cuban Americans (Cuba). In both, 
tightening U.S. trade embargoes adds misery to the lives of ordinary citizens, 
which makes the temptation to flee their country all the more compelling. And 
in both cases, regimes lacking democratic legitimacy are somehow seen as 
threats to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Cold War, national interest or a perceived security threat was the 
prime mover behind U.S. interventions. Today, a moral imperative -- feeding the 
hungry, imposing democracy, for example -- appears to be the rationale. But 
will spending U.S. resources for such noble goals win over the American public, 
or will it generate an isolationist backlash? 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of intervention goes to the heart of the debate over what the 
post-Cold War order will be. It is an untidy, two-tier world: One, encompassing 
North America, Western Europe, Japan and parts of East Asia, is a relatively 
stable, democratic zone of peace. The other, including a large swathe of 
Southwest Asia and Africa, is a conflict zone of ethnic and religious hatreds, 
crushing poverty and failed nation-states. 
</P>
<P>
 The gap between these two worlds is growing even as the will or ability of the 
international community to close it lessens. However belatedly, the United 
States filled the humanitarian vacuum in Rwanda. But which country will step in 
when neighboring Zaire, 10 times the size of Rwanda, falls apart? 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, at a time when the United Nations lacks the resources to feed the 
world's starving, let alone stop such internal horrors as the genocide in 
Rwanda, the big powers are eroding its legitimacy by blessing what U.N. 
Ambassador Madeleine Albright euphemistically calls "sphere-of-influence" 
peacekeeping. In the name of multilateralism and international law, they are 
discrediting perhaps the most important instrument of multilateralism -- the 
U.N. Security Council. Whatever else Haiti may be, it is not enough of a threat 
to international security and peace to warrant invoking the U.N. Charter. 
Putting a U.N. stamp of political correctness on the Administration's desire to 
oust the thugs in Port-au-Prince does not make what is, in reality, the 
exercise of power politics any less so. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, each case of regional instability is different and must be 
assessed in its particulars. The problem, as the President pointed out in a 
recent speech, is that "unless human tragedy is caused by natural disaster, 
there is no such thing as a purely humanitarian enterprise." Thus, regardless 
of the motive for intervention, it almost inevitably puts you on one side or 
the other in an internal conflict. Furthermore, in a world of sovereign 
nations, few governments will sacrifice its citizens where no vital interest is 
at risk. Witness the lack of response to the U.N. call for help in Rwanda when 
genocide raged. 
</P>
<P>
 Building an international system reflective of big-power realities and 
responsive to the burgeoning challenges flowing from failed states will take 
time. Progress will be incremental, at best. Consider the U.N. success story of 
Cambodia. In effect, the 1991 Paris peace accord placed the country into 
receivership for two years, during which U.N. civil servants oversaw government 
until last year's democratic elections. But to many, the idea of trusteeship 
smacks of a politically incorrect neo-colonialism. And even if this were a 
preferred course of action, who would foot the bill? Cambodia cost the 
international community some $1 billion and its turmoil is still not over. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike those "present at the creation" of the post-World War II order, the 
Administration lacks the Soviet threat, which animated U.S. efforts to rebuild 
Europe and Japan. It is far more difficult to generate -- and sustain -- 
support for the hard slogging of forging a new world system without a direct 
threat. But it is wrong to accuse the Administration of failing to replace the 
policy of containment with new universal principles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the complex and murky global environment we live in, there is no real 
replacement for the Soviet threat. The challenge is to define U.S. national 
interests and priorities, balance means and ends, resources and commitments, 
and exercise steady leadership as a first among equals. It is on these issues 
that the Clinton Administration can be fairly criticized for leaving much to be 
desired. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of force where no vital interest is at stake, however 
well-intentioned, may only fuel isolationism and skepticism of the need for a 
strong defense. In the case of Cuba, pursuing a policy designed to ease its 
transition from post-Cold War orphan to mainstream member requires not acts of 
war, but enlightened engagement aimed at building a private sector and civic 
society -- the basis of a transition to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, starving refugees should be fed, genocide stopped, peace kept and 
democracy encouraged. But the hard reality is that not all problems have 
readily available solutions. That doesn't mean the international community 
should not do the best it can. The danger is that by raising expectations -- of 
"enlarging democracy," preventing crises where conflict grows not from 
misunderstanding but long-simmering hatred or "nation-building" of failed 
states -- a lack of realism will foster the isolationism the Administration 
quite rightly opposes. Balancing a clear-eyed pursuit of national interest with 
the strain of idealism that is the hallmark of the American character in a 
world lacking an all-encompassing threat is the key to successful U.S. 
engagement in the new era.

OIL AND POLITICS MAKE FOR DANGEROUS MIX IN NIGERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Adonis E. Hoffman, Adonis E. Hoffman, a senior associate at the Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace, was the director of the subcommittee on 
Africa in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Notwithstanding President Bill Clinton's heartfelt words that "Africa matters 
to the United States," the 1990s may become the decade of U.S. disengagement 
from Africa. Much of what happens in Africa is simply of no major consequence 
to U.S. strategic or economic interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria -- and its struggle for democracy -- should be the exception. With 90 
million people and abundant natural resources, it looms as both a regional and 
continental military power looked to by other African states to provide 
Pan-African security and stability. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 15 months since the military government of Gen. Sani Abacha annulled 
the results of the country's first free civilian elections in more than a 
decade and jailed the apparent winner, Nigeria has been in an economic and 
political tailspin. Its two powerful oil unions have undertaken a general 
strike to protest the continued rule of Abacha and the imprisonment of 
President-elect Moshood K.O. Abiola. Simply put, the oil workers have demanded 
the reinstatement of the election results, the unconditional release of Abiola 
and a series of industry-related reforms. Their weapon of choice -- withholding 
labor from the nation's premier industry -- was a potentially devastating 
tactic, given the Nigerian government's near-total dependence on oil revenues 
for subsistence. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the unions unexpectedly suspended their strike, handing the Abacha 
government a temporary victory. But now the story may take a new turn, 
intersecting the goals of the Clinton Administration and the economic interests 
of U.S. oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 During the course of the strike, all foreign oil companies were repeatedly 
asked by union leaders to suspend their operations in deference to, if not 
solidarity with, the Nigerian oil unions. Both U.S. and British companies 
rejected the request. Their operations allowed the military government to 
maintain a steady trickle (reduced from a stream) of oil revenue. In the eyes 
of the leaders of the National Union of Petroleum and National Gas Workers, the 
oil companies are equally, if not more, culpable for the loss of life incurred 
by striking workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a broadcast in August, Abacha thanked "our major partners in the oil 
industry, and others, who under very strenuous and difficult circumstances have 
stood resolutely by us. We urge you to continue in this spirit." Apparently, 
Abacha's paean to U.S. and other foreign oil companies was sufficient to clear 
their corporate consciences of any responsibility for supporting a repressive 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it appears U.S. oil companies operating in Nigeria have demonstrated 
little concern for anything other than their bottom lines. Most consider their 
posture and practice to be apolitical. But human-rights and pro-democracy 
groups and unions have accused them of ignoring workers rights and of polluting 
the environment. A U.S. petroleum executive conceded that foreign companies can 
operate in Nigeria in ways they cannot do just a few miles off the coast of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The implications of oil-company complicity in Abacha's repression emerge into 
full relief against the backdrop of the Clinton Administration's policy toward 
Nigeria. The Administration, recognizing that something must be done to end the 
crisis, has imposed limited sanctions, including restrictions on foreign aid. 
High-level envoys have been, or will be, sent to pursue talks with Abacha. The 
cooling of U.S.-Nigeria relations is likely to continue as long as Abacha's 
regime remains in power and refuses to acknowledge and respond to the tide of 
democratic yearning sweeping his country. 
</P>

 Rep. Donald M. Payne (D-N.J.), a leading member of the House Africa Committee

embargo on Nigerian oil would have on loosening Abacha's grip. The study's 
preliminary findings indicate that an embargo would not adversely affect the 
supply of oil in the United States. Any loss of Nigerian oil could readily be 
replaced with petroleum from the Baltics. As for its impact on Nigeria, the 
study concludes that U.S. action must be coupled with multilateral action to 
accomplish the intended result. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, Abacha, buoyed by his apparent victory over the Nigerian oil 
workers, has begun to rule by decree. In the 24-hour period following the 
strike's suspension, he issued five decrees, one abolishing several newspapers, 
another allowing for detention without charge or trial and a third declaring 
himself the ultimate and absolute authority with jurisdiction over all courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Africa experts caution against unrealistic expectations for the success 
of U.S. sanctions or diplomatic measures. For a diplomatic resolution to occur, 
each party must have exhausted its best efforts at achieving its objectives, 
creating an impasse. Those conditions were present two weeks ago; they are not 
today. Stronger measures may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is sure whether the Nigerian oil workers will resume their struggle for 
democracy -- time will tell. If we remember anything about the strike, it 
should be that the oil workers struck until the empty bellies of their children 
could no longer allow them to continue. The pennies more we now pay at the gas 
pump is a much smaller price, and far smaller tribute, than their efforts 
deserve.

THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE SUMMIT: A GOOD IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS NOT YET ARRIVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Henry A. Kissinger, Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger frequently 
writes for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whatever its stumbles, the Clinton Administration's policy in the Western 
Hemisphere has had its priorities right. Bill Clinton courageously led a 
bipartisan effort on behalf of the North American Free Trade Agreement. And his 
Administration has fostered democracy and market economics, as well as a larger 
Western Hemisphere community, without alienating our neighbors. It would thus 
be a pity if overzealousness in pushing a hemispheric summit jeopardized what 
has been achieved and what seems realistically within reach during Clinton's 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed by Vice President Al Gore, the Western Hemisphere summit, scheduled 
for early December in Miami, is a good idea whose time has not yet come. Heads 
of government assembled at a summit can either issue general declarations 
designed to impart a new sense of direction or, if well-prepared, they can 
issue an action program to steer their bureaucracies toward established goals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best that can be hoped for under present circumstances is a symbolic 
public-relations exercise. The new Mexican president will not take office until 
Dec. 1; the Mexican Cabinet, normally announced the day before the swearing in, 
will have had barely a week in which to establish itself. Brazil will be 
focused on the election of a new president Oct. 3, with a runoff Nov. 15 if no 
candidate wins a majority. Because the inauguration is Jan. 1, Brazil would, in 
effect, have to be represented at the summit by two presidents: the outgoing 
one, without authority, and the incoming one, as yet without power and probably 
without a program -- especially if there is a runoff. In preparing for the 
summit, the Clinton Administration will lack interlocutors to harmonize its 
views with two of the key Western Hemisphere countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, the United States has yet to formulate views capable of being 
harmonized. The policies that receive most attention -- the possible invasion 
of Haiti and the conflict with Cuba -- have little Latin American support. 
Above all, the Administration has yet to make up its mind on the overriding 
issue for the other summit participants: how to relate NAFTA to the rest of the 
hemisphere. All this risks either that divisive peripheral issues will dominate 
the agenda or that the summit will peter out in platitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 This would be a pity, because the new governments in Mexico and Brazil will be 
in an unusually favorable position to join us in giving new impetus to a 
creative Western Hemisphere policy. Mexico has passed a crucial hurdle toward 
becoming a pluralistic democratic society. And Brazil seems to have traversed 
the political instability following President Fernando Collor de Mello's 
impeachment and stands poised to reassert its influence. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, the test for the newly elected president, Ernesto Zedillo, will not 
be whether he presides over the defeat of his own party, the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI), but whether he manages to bring about a genuinely 
pluralistic process. This will not be a simple matter, given the historic 
dominance of the PRI and the regional base of other parties. But Zedillo seems 
committed to rapid political modernization. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has a dual obligation to understand the difficulty of this 
political evolution and to have confidence in the new leadership -- at least 
until there is strong evidence to the contrary. The missionary tendencies of 
some middle-level Administration officials, and their apparent preference for 
the more radical advocates of political change, should be curbed. With respect 
to the summit, this means that declarations on democratization should emerge 
from consultations in which the new president of Mexico is perceived to be a 
principal contributor and not the recipient of condescending lectures. Such an 
approach is, however, incompatible with a summit during the first week of 
Zedillo's presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is even greater with respect to Brazil, where the sequence of 
economic and political reform is the reverse of Mexico's. Mexico is moving 
toward political pluralism as the result of economic reform; Brazil is gaining 
economic momentum in the aftermath of a drastic reform of its politics. The 
fight to overcome political corruption has enabled former Brazilian Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso to master the rampant inflation that had 
threatened to undermine public confidence and drive the democratic politics 
toward extremism. After the election, the Brazilian economy will gain impetus 
from accelerated foreign investment that, in turn, will further stabilize 
Brazil's politics. 
</P>
<P>
 As Brazil masters its domestic difficulties, it will resume a leadership role 
in Latin America. It will have the strongest economy (as large as all other 
South American economies combined); one of the most experienced and able 
foreign services in the world, and an established tradition of participation in 
international affairs. A reformed Brazil can be expected to favor greater 
Western Hemisphere integration based on "Mercosur," the regional grouping of 
Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, which it has sponsored. Launched in 
1991, Mercosur has three options: It can complement NAFTA, become an 
alternative to it or ultimately combine with it. Any Western Hemisphere summit 
that fails to explore these possibilities will also fail to deal with the key 
issues before the Western Hemisphere. Thus the reemergence of Brazil as a major 
interlocutor challenges the United States to a new approach to coordination 
with our neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither such a Brazilian-U.S. dialogue nor adequate consultations with the 
other countries of Latin America will be possible before the summit. What 
little is known of summit preparations derives from a State Department paper, 
circulated to potential participants, that seems more suited to an academic 
conference than to a meeting of heads of state. Its headings are vague, the 
various initiatives it outlines as imprecise as they are vast and unachieveable 
in the time remaining. And, despite its scope, the proposed agenda is silent on 
the future relationship of NAFTA to the rest of the hemisphere. These 
deficiencies cannot possibly be corrected in the time remaining before the 
summit and in the absence of a Brazilian or Mexican contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 So long as Mexico and Brazil cannot participate in meaningful consultations, 
the existing procedure conveys a patronizing implication that the United States 
wants the summit for either domestic political reasons or as a platform to 
lecture Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 All this suggests the following necessities: 
</P>
<P>
 * Delay the summit until the spring; 
</P>
<P>
 * Use the interval to come up with a U.S. set of proposals; 
</P>
<P>
 * Take advantage of the presence at the United Nations of most Latin American 
foreign ministers during September to begin shaping an agenda that reflects a 
common hemispheric program. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned summit is a constructive step in a basically constructive 
Administration policy. It should not be spoiled by meeting for the sake of 
meeting -- when the basis for a real dialogue is so close.

LEGISLATION WITH THE LATE-NIGHT PIZZA: WASHINGTON AS A COLLEGE TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steven D. Stark, Steven D. Stark is a commentator on National Public Radio 
and CNN. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone knows cities have character -- New York as "the city that never 
sleeps," Atlanta as "the city too busy to hate" or Miami as the gateway to 
Latin America. But occasionally a city has a character that somehow escapes 
notice. Washington is, of course, a thoroughly political town -- the seat of 
government, the home to countless journalists and lawyers and the repository of 
dreaded "inside the Beltway" thinking. But it is, at heart, a college town -- 
the college, in this case, being the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewing Washington as a college town -- like Princeton, N.J., Chapel Hill, 
N.C., Cambridge, Mass., or Berkeley -- accounts for a lot of its peculiarities. 
It also helps explain many problems Americans have with their government, and 
some problems they have with Bill Clinton, eternal graduate student 
extraordinaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Most American cities are accidents of geography or commerce and began by 
attracting entrepreneurs and labor to a new, struggling industry and locale. 
College towns are different: Grounded in education, they began by attracting a 
class of people dissimilar from the rest of us -- more talkative, more 
insulated and much less action-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, because financial conditions change, most cities are forced to 
outgrow their birthrights. Los Angeles would still exist if the movie industry 
closed tomorrow, just as Chicago now has a lot more to sell than ham and grain. 
College towns change, too, but because they have a guaranteed market of 
students, they rarely face the financial turmoil other places tend to undergo. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the principal employers in both university and government towns 
don't have to operate in such a competitive market -- meaning, the kinds of 
budg-et and cutback problems the rest of the world faces don't tend to apply. 
Professors have tenure, further insulating them, while incumbents in Washington 
have accrued almost insurmountable advantages. These trends give both places a 
strange imperviousness to the economic problems that plague almost everywhere 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington and universities share other attributes, and not just because 
official Washington's response to anything is to appoint a "study commission" 
and then talk the issue to death. For better or worse, both attract a lot of 
young people and transients. Both have campuses, contained in a relatively 
small area. Both empty out on holidays: After all, nobody connected with 
government or attending the university is really from there. 
</P>
<P>
 In both places, school or government is your whole existence -- there is 
little of the separation between work and personal life that exists elsewhere. 
Both also attract a large share of hangers-on who just can't graduate and stay 
on forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have their "town-gown" problems. The government or university is the main 
employer, but the jobs provided for residents are usually clerical or 
administrative. Cleveland Park is Washington's version of the reclusive, 
academic neighborhood. Just as Yale is always accused of ignoring New Haven and 
letting it drift, so is Washington continually found guilty of ignoring the 
people who really live there. The only thing that unites citizens of the 
District of Columbia with their government-university is the Redskins -- just 
as support for sports teams are often all the town and "gown" can rally around. 
</P>
<P>
 In this atmosphere, it's probably no surprise that Washington journalism so 
closely resembles college journalism. Self-absorption is the rule: Anything 
that didn't occur on campus tends to get ignored. Reporters inevitably 
exaggerate their own importance and are forever confusing the distinction 
between reporting and opinion. It's also probably no coincidence that, over 
time, much of Washington journalism has adopted a kind of sneering, sophomoric 
attitude toward public affairs, or that shows such as "The McLaughlin Group" 
resemble, at best, a freshman political-science debate. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Clinton has exaggerated Washington's university-like tendencies. 
Since Franklin D. Roosevelt's tenure, the military provided the model for much 
of the structure of the presidency. Because Clinton never served in the armed 
forces, however, he has taken his own formative experiences -- at Georgetown, 
Oxford and Yale -- and derived his organizing principles from these 
institutions. After all, other than politics, his only real job was teaching at 
the University of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Clinton's personal staff is composed mostly of young, perpetual 
undergraduates like himself. They work late every night, college-style -- 
already several members of the White House staff with children have found 
themselves unable to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's own style is to let an issue or course slide, and then cram at the 
last minute to "pass." He governs by the late-night bull session and the 
seminar. (Remember the economic summit?) For his original health bill, he 
convened a panel of 500 experts and had them draft a piece of legislation that 
looked an awful lot like someone's graduate thesis. 
</P>
<P>
 His indecision is relatively rare in the world of politics but common in 
academia, where the most important element of any decision is making sure no 
one objects. He is drawn to events like Renaissance Weekend -- the closest 
thing Washington has to a Rhodes scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 As Nicholas Lemann has written, Clinton's tenure marks the rise of "the 
meritocracy" -- baby boomers who came to power not through the traditional 
roads of wealth and class but by educational achievement. Like any member of an 
elite, the Clintons tend to reflect the values of the institutions that made 
them -- which means that, in Washington, they have found their true home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, viewing Washington as a university town -- and Clinton as its 
fitting custodian -- is more than just an "academic" exercise. One problem with 
universities, of course, is that they aren't the real world. In fact, they're 
designed to be insulated from it. Having the seat of governance in an 
academic-like environment is a virtual guarantee that voters will tend to feel 
as isolated from the culture of their government as "townies" do from the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 The university is also a poor model for government. The military model that 
Presidents used before Clinton often got them into trouble because there are 
important differences between the way military and civilian enterprises are 
run. Yet, it works for the presidency because the purpose of the military 
frequently isn't that different from the government: to define a problem and 
work collectively to complete the task successfully. In contrast, the purpose 
of a university is to produce learning and encourage personal growth. While 
those are important individual goals, they're likely to be viewed as irrelevant 
for a government to pursue collectively for its people. 
</P>
<P>
 "College isn't for everybody," my high-school guidance counselor used to say, 
an aphorism that could well apply to a whole nation that has always tended to 
see itself as self-schooled, self-made and anti-elite. Universities have their 
place. But as the Clintons are discovering, that place isn't Washington.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; SHARON PAPA; FIGHTING TO GET MORE RESPECT FOR THE 
TRANSIT POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Proffitt, Steve Proffitt is a producer for Fox News and a contributor 
to National Public Radio's All Things Considered and Morning Edition. He 
interviewed Sharon K. Papa at her office near downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the fastest-growing police force in Southern California, quadrupling its 
ranks in just five years. Its jurisdiction is huge, covering 2,200 square miles 
across five counties. And its chief is one of the few women in America to head 
a law-enforcement agency. Still, to that vast majority of Angelenos who never 
ride a bus or step on a trolley, the Metropolitan Transit Police is all but 
invisible. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the million-plus daily bus riders, the MTA transit police provide a ray 
of order in the chaos that characterizes many bus lines. Much of their work 
involves nabbing the bullies, drunks and petty thieves who make life miserable 
for riders, and busting taggers who find buses a perfect showcase. But the 
transit police also encounter serious crimes -- shootings, stabbings and even 
an occasional bus hijacking. Yet, they remain the Rodney Dangerfields of police 
forces -- with a troubled history that adds to the lack of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Sharon K. Papa is doing her best to change that. She's fired a number of 
"problem" officers and, by most accounts, raised the level of professionalism. 
She's also taken on both the sheriff and the Los Angeles Police Department in 
turf battles, and come out the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Papa's transit police won a bidding war with the LAPD for the 
right to police the new Red Line subway. Then last summer, she warded off an 
attempt by Sheriff Sherman Block to take over her agency and fold it into his 
department. This summer, she again foiled Block, by winning jurisdiction over 
the Blue Line; the trolley service between Long Beach and Downtown had been 
patrolled by sheriff's officers since it opened in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Papa won those battles by persuading the transit board that her force was 
better equipped for the special task of transit policing. Only 36, married and 
with no children, she came up through the ranks, with nine years on the transit 
force before being named chief. Even Papa's critics concede she has been 
successful in defining her own style of community policing for the transit 
system, and in deploying her resources in innovative and effective ways. A 
native of upstate New York, she plays down the issue of her gender when it 
comes to leading a police force, but worries that, for a variety of reasons, 
too few women are considering wearing a badge as a career. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What's different about transit policing? Why do we need a separate 
agency?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Transit policing is based on a different philosophy. Most local 
law-enforcement agencies are response-oriented. They don't have a lot of 
prevention programs. In transit policing, we have to be pro-active. We have to 
take care of the quality-of-life issues -- the eating, drinking and smoking. We 
need to keep order, because how the public feels when they get on a bus or 
train impacts their perception of how safe things are there. Our officers are 
not just catching people breaking the law; they need to prevent laws from being 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How is the training for a transit officer different from what one might get 
at a normal police academy?  
</P>
<P>
 A: These officers attend a police academy just like any other peace officer in 
the state. They need to know the same things -- laws concerning arrest, search 
and seizure, penal code and vehicle code. But when our officers graduate the 
academy, they go through three more weeks of in-house training to get them 
focused on which penal-code sections are specific to transit. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, if a bus or train operator gets assaulted, there's a specific 
penal-code section for that. It's different from an assault on an individual, 
because it endangers everybody on the train or the bus. So it's important that 
our officers know the law, because the penalty can be enhanced. They need to 
learn how our alarm system works -- we have a silent alarm system similar to a 
bank's on board our buses and trains. They need to understand how to make a 
traffic stop on a bus, because that's very different from making a traffic stop 
with a car. 
</P>
<P>
 The subways are a specialized environment as well. Our officers there are not 
just police. They're responsible if a fire breaks out; they monitor gas meters; 
they really operate as public-safety officers down in that subway. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have your own concept of community-based policing for the transit 
system. How does that work?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Our community is the people who use public transit and the people who work 
on the trains and buses. Probably our most high-profile community-police effort 
is our foot-beat team Downtown, between 2nd and 9th on Broadway. They're not 
there to handle the shoplifters or problems inside the stores. They're making 
sure panhandlers aren't hassling passengers at the bus stops or that illegal 
vendors aren't blocking buses from getting in and out of stops. Merchants in 
the area did a survey and found about 75% of their customers were getting to 
Broadway via buses, and many reported being uncomfortable waiting for buses -- 
there were drugs being sold at the bus stops and counterfeit bus passes for 
sale. We started a pilot program on Broadway, and it's been so successful we're 
going into our third year. 
</P>
<P>
 So community policing for us means identifying the problems within our 
community -- in and around the buses and trains -- and creating solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Haven't you been shifting more officers from plainclothes to uniformed 
positions?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, we did a real shift. We used to use a lot of undercover teams, riding 
the buses, looking for the pickpocket, looking for taggers. And although they 
were effective -- their arrest statistics were very high -- the public wasn't 
aware of them. Even though we have signs on the buses that say, "Undercover 
officers may be riding this bus," people would always say, "Well, I never see 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 . . . So, faced with that, we decided to put teams of uniformed officers onto 
the buses and see what kinds of response we got. And although the arrests 
weren't as high -- you have to be pretty stupid to snatch a purse when an 
officer is on the bus -- the public response has been very favorable. So we are 
using a combination now -- we didn't eliminate the undercover teams, but we 
supplemented them with uniformed officers boarding the buses and trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much of your time, effort and money is being spent on graffiti?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We have 20 officers assigned full time to what we call our Graffiti 
Habitual Offenders Suppression Team, or GHOST. The team was put together in 
1989, when the graffiti problem was starting to take off in Los Angeles. The 
taggers focused on RTD buses because they viewed them as rolling billboards, 
going from one end of town to another. At that point, everybody figured it was 
just gang writing. No one knew it was a whole different phenomenon. Once our 
officers got out there and started identifying these taggers, we realized it 
was a whole second sub- culture. And, quite frankly, we were laughed at by the 
LAPD and the sheriff's department. They asked, "You've got a task force working 
a misdemeanor crime?" In their world, everything is based on major felonies, 
drive-by shootings, that sort of thing. We were concerned with the vandalism. 
It was escalating. 
</P>
<P>
 We were the pioneers in combatting taggers, so much so that we ended up 
training other law-enforcement agencies once the activity began to spread to 
freeway signs and shopping malls. We were the only ones with a database, the 
only ones who knew how to identify the taggers, the only ones who knew how they 
were different from gang-bangers. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't just focus on apprehending the vandals. We've developed a curriculum 
for the schools called NO TAG, which teaches kids respect for public and 
private property. We target kindergarten through sixth grade, and we teach kids 
why it's wrong to vandalize and what the consequences are. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The amount spent on security for buses is dwarfed by the budget for rail -- 
one breakdown shows the transit police spending $1.25 for every rail passenger 
and only 3 cents for every bus passenger. Why is that, since the bus system 
serves vast amounts of people and the rail system serves a relative few?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I've been here a long time and the bus system is near and dear to my heart. 
But we've designed a rail system that's state-of-the-art. Unlike the bus line, 
security systems are part of its design. We've got a system of security 
cameras; we've designed the stations so there are no hiding places. We don't 
have that luxury with the bus system. We've got bus stops in horrible areas, 
and just the sheer volume -- there are maybe 15,000 to 20,000 bus stops out 
there. They're two different animals. I think it's good that the focus is on 
the new system and on doing it right. But there is a recognition that we have 
to do more on the bus side, and at least half of the new officers we are going 
to get will be assigned to buses. But there are only so many dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you consider the buses to be safe?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. The unfortunate thing about the bus system is if one high-profile 
crime occurs on a bus, it gets a lot of media attention and scares people 
everywhere. One isolated incident creates fear up and down the line. But the 
actual crime rate is less than one crime per 100,000 passengers. That's 
considering that somewhere between 1.2 million and 1.4 million people are 
riding our buses everyday. 
</P>
<P>
 We're taking a hard look at how we deploy our resources. We obviously cannot 
have an officer on every bus, all the time. But if officers are deployed smart 
-- if geographically you put them where the most buses are -- you can do a good 
job with fewer officers. We're very versatile; we change as things change. In 
most city police departments, the beats may not have changed in 50 years -- but 
we modify ours a lot, based on crime trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think your gender affects your management style?  
</P>
<P>
 A: My age may affect it more than my gender. Not too long ago, I was working 
in the field. A lot of the police chiefs in this area are 20 years older than I 
am, and we've had very different life experiences. But, yes, there are 
differences because of my gender. For instance, I understand about female 
officers, sexual harassment and how the work environment should be. I'm 
probably a lot more sensitive about that than some male chiefs, because I've 
been there and I've seen it firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How are women doing in law enforcement? Do you think they are being 
afforded equal opportunity in most police forces, or is it still very difficult 
for a woman to make it as a police officer?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I can't say that women are given equal opportunities at every department 
I've seen. Things are better now than they were 10 years ago, but we still have 
a long way to go. I think it will take more women serving in high-ranking 
positions to show the guys that we can do this job and can be held accountable 
just like they are. Right now, it's still too unique. I'm sure there were 
people who thought the sheriff's department should police the transit system, 
because the chief of the transit police is a woman. And as I look around 
various departments and I see women moving up in the ranks, it's very 
encouraging, but there is much, much more to do before I could say we are 
treated equally. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm very interested in increasing the number of women in our department, as 
well as minorities. I want the department to be reflective of the community, 
and I'm proud that more than 50% of our department is minority officers. But 
the female ranks here are average for a police department. I want to see that 
improve.

EXTENDING A YOUNG HAND TO AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton -- who, supporters say, rarely gets enough credit when he 
keeps a campaign promise -- certainly deserves a great deal of applause for 
pushing Congress to pass a national service program for young Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 AmeriCorps, sort of a domestic Peace Corps, will debut on Monday when Clinton 
swears in the first group of young participants. Under the nationwide, 
federally funded program, up to 20,000 graduates of high schools, colleges and 
professional schools will tackle community service projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Priority will be given to efforts that help schools, reduce crime, alleviate 
poverty or clean up the environment. More than 2,000 AmeriCorps participants 
will be assigned to projects throughout California. Their sponsors -- 
businesses and groups that will develop programs -- include the California 
Conservation Corps, the YMCA, the Los Angeles Unified School District, UC 
Berkeley, Occidental College, the Urban Corps of San Diego, Local Initiatives 
Support Corp., Teach for America and VISTA. The U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency and the federal Departments of Agriculture and the Interior also will 
coordinate programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many participants will help children who are abused, disabled, hungry, 
homeless, poor, sick or illiterate. AmeriCorps members will also counsel 
youngsters who are in gangs, abuse alcohol or drugs, need day care or lack 
supervision after school. And that's not all. Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Southern California, participants with special skills such as law school 
graduates will work for the Legal Service Corp. on Crenshaw Boulevard in 
Southwest Los Angeles. They will spend their first year attacking homelessness, 
encouraging equal educational opportunities and protecting the environment. 
That's public service. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Central California, AmeriCorps members will help migrant and seasonal 
farm workers, and they will pay special attention to land and water projects. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Northern California, participants will teach teen-agers how to mediate 
conflicts, help people who are HIV-positive and encourage the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for their activism, AmeriCorps participants will get the minimum 
wage, health benefits and nearly $5,000 in scholarship money per year for up to 
two years. They may use their scholarships for college or vocational training 
or to reduce student loans. That's a fair exchange between these young 
Americans and the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has successfully appealed to members of the MTV generation 
to get involved and use their talents to help their neighbors. The national 
service program is an idea well worth trying.

JUDGE BLOCKS BUS FARE HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich's denunciation of U.S. District Judge Terry 
Hatter's Sept. 1 ruling temporarily restraining the MTA from raising bus fares 
displays the same irresponsibility and insensitivity to human needs that have 
characterized both Antonovich's general stand on public transportation and his 
entire political career (Sept. 2). Judge Hatter was absolutely right in finding 
"serious questions" as to whether the MTA has consistently shortchanged bus 
passengers -- who are largely poor, racially and ethnically diverse, 
transit-dependent and politically powerless -- in favor of the affluent and 
middle-class whites, who make up Antonovich's constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 In my experience as a regular bus rider, I find that the level of service I 
can expect from the MTA is directly related to the number of white people among 
my fellow passengers. The express bus I ride between my home in the Valley and 
my office near Vermont and Wilshire is always well-maintained, clean, timely 
and full but not overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when I ride downtown from Vermont and Wilshire in the middle of the 
day, the bus is invariably overloaded and dirty, the rear exit and air 
conditioning seldom function, and if any efforts are made to run enough buses 
to meet the needs of the community, or to adhere to any kind of a schedule, I 
cannot detect them. 
</P>
<P>
 In granting the temporary restraining order, Judge Hatter has merely 
acknowledged as a possibility what every bus rider knows to be a fact. It is 
not Hatter but Antonovich and his ilk who have demonstrated their "unfitness to 
serve" by permitting the MTA to run down the poor of Los Angeles. 
</P>

<P>
 It's great news that the court may prevent MTA from increasing fares. However, 
I disagree with those who complain that MTA budget problems are caused by the 
construction of rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles desperately needs a transit network of connecting rail, bus and 
trolley service. It's the waste, delays, bureaucratic overload and poor 
planning that are to blame -- not the trains. 
</P>
<P>
 PHYLLIS ELLIOTT, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In order to function properly, our rail systems absolutely depend on abundant, 
efficient, affordable bus systems. Months ago, thousands of new rail riders, 
eager to bypass earthquake-damaged freeways, finally threw their hands up and 
got back into their cars because the bus system was so inadequate to the task 
of getting these commuters from the train stations to their final destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality is that bus lines are an integral part of the rail system and 
funding and planning for the two should not be separated, if we are ever to 
have an integrated transit system that can efficiently serve any rider, inner 
city or suburban.

L.A. MAYOR'S ALLIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read Kevin Starr's "The New Power Brokers?" (Opinion, Sept. 4) with great 
interest, not as co-chairman of the Mayor's Alliance for a Safer L.A., nor as a 
businessman, but as a citizen of this community for more than 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is precisely what Starr has overlooked -- the 20 individuals who 
compose the Mayor's Alliance are not only business and foundation leaders, but 
also residents of greater Los Angeles who care deeply about our future. None of 
us are seeking public office, nor are we looking to wield any influence on how 
the city, or its police force, is managed. 
</P>
<P>
 We are merely a group of concerned citizens looking for a way to help -- to 
raise $15 million in record time to buy basic computer technology and training 
for the Los Angeles Police Department that will help keep the city safe. We're 
doing this because we believe that the key to ensuring the city's future is 
ensuring public safety. It's that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mayor's Alliance members believe it is high time for the private sector to 
work hand-in-hand with members of the community to create a city that we can 
all be proud of. Each day the Mayor's Alliance hot line (310-443-8444) receives 
pledges of $5 to $500 from citizens from San Pedro to San Fernando who feel the 
same way we do about the city's need for safety and are willing to open their 
checkbooks to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mayor's Alliance is only a catalyst -- we hope to provide a meaningful 
jump-start for the LAPD that can be further propelled by public funding. And 
next year, when this campaign has reached its goal, the Mayor's Alliance will 
be disbanded, the gift will be turned over to the city, and the LAPD will be 
one step closer to being on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparing the Mayor's Alliance for a Safer L.A. to the 1950s-era Committee 
of Twenty-Five, Starr turns back the clock more than 30 years. The LAPD is 
currently operating with technology from that same era. But times have changed, 
and the new challenges we face call for new solutions. The Mayor's Alliance 
will help bring the LAPD into the 21st Century. We all must help the city do 
the same.

CRA QUAKE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article on Community Redevelopment Agency housing dollars ("Quake-Hit 
Areas Win More Funds," Aug. 31) mischaracterized both my compromise motion and 
the issues at stake in the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the article, my motion would have actually provided more housing 
dollars to earthquake-ravaged areas ($18.7 million instead of $18 million) than 
did the motion that passed.Five million of the $23 million total contained in 
the prevailing motion was not designated for repair of earthquake-damaged 
housing units. Rather, it went for the construction of new low-income housing 
units citywide, for which earthquake victims would be given priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost in press accounts that have portrayed this issue merely as a tug-of-war 
over dollars between Valley and City was the fact that 100% of the dollars 
being debated were to be used for subsidized low- and moderate-income housing. 
These funds would have had limited ability to assist Valley earthquake victims 
of all income levels. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Times editorial pointed out (Aug. 23), this divisive City Council debate 
hinged over a grand total of $8 million -- less than one-half of 1% of the 
total earthquake aid available to us and enough to fund only two or three 
low-income housing projects.

SOME LEADERSHIP IN THE HOME INSURANCE MESS; GARAMENDI STEPS FORTH IN THE WAKE 
OF LEGISLATURE'S INACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is there a homeowners insurance crisis in California? Ask insurance companies 
and they respond with an emphatic "yes." Ask homeowners or real estate or 
escrow agents and they are unsure -- but they do acknowledge it takes more time 
and money to secure less coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is no crisis yet, there soon could be. Currently insurers that 
provide 65% of California's homeowner policies -- they include the biggest 
providers, such as Farmers, Allstate and State Farm -- are refusing to write 
new policies. That's because insurers have to offer earthquake coverage, the 
cost of which has become exorbitantly high since the Northridge quake. 
Companies that account for the remaining 35% are still offering new policies, 
but when they reach their limit, then what? We could have a full-blown crisis 
in the availability of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Preemptive moves are needed. The Legislature, however, ducked its 
responsibility and ended its session without addressing the problem, save for 
passing one bill that might help in the future but certainly doesn't now. 
Fortunately, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi has announced that because 
the Legislature failed to act he will exercise his authority to come up with an 
interim plan. At least leadership is being shown on his part. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the enormously costly Jan. 17 earthquake, major insurance 
companies have scrambled for support for eliminating the state requirement that 
they offer earthquake coverage when they sell homeowner policies. They proposed 
creating a separate earthquake insurance pool funded by a state bond issue, but 
the idea received virtually no support in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi has been looking at expanding the California Fair Plan -- the 
industry-sponsored insurer of last resort traditionally used in high fire risk 
areas -- as a vehicle for a stand-alone earthquake insurance pool. It would 
involve some risk-sharing mechanism for insurance companies. The program would 
"sunset" if and when Congress passed the proposed National Disaster Protection 
Act, which clearly would be the best solution to the earthquake insurance 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the Northridge earthquake resulted in huge claims. But critics 
maintain that insurers, in refusing to write new policies, are trying to create 
a crisis in order to eliminate the requirement that they offer new earthquake 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance companies also are asking to raise deductibles and rates for 
existing earthquake coverage, which could make such protection too expensive 
for most homeowners. Farmers Insurance, for example, is seeking a 174% increase 
in personal earthquake coverage rates. Garamendi's hearings on the rate 
requests will begin this month and will be expanded to explore extending the 
Fair Plan to provide earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the prospect of an earthquake is no fun, and neither is dealing with 
the losses after one. Washington helped immensely with the rebuilding after the 
Northridge temblor. And, ultimately, the best answer to the insurance problems 
posed by disasters like major quakes, hurricanes or floods is a national 
insurance fund, such as would be created by the proposed National Disaster 
Protection Act. However, California cannot wait for Congress to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi seems to be offering the most realistic short-term solution. He 
should do all he can to implement it before he leaves office in January.

AN EDGE MEASURED IN HUMAN LIVES; IS U.S. LOSING ITS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGE 
OVER NATIONS IT MAY ONE DAY FACE IN BATTLE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as there are ultimately no secrets in science -- what's discovered in one 
place can in time be discovered or replicated somewhere else -- neither is 
there any enduring monopoly on technology. That lack of exclusivity can be 
worrying in the area of high-tech military products. 
</P>
<P>
 As Times correspondent Art Pine reported from Washington recently, a number of 
American defense experts are growing increasingly concerned about an erosion in 
the edge the United States has long enjoyed in military technology. The worry 
is not that other countries might surpass ours in developing highly 
sophisticated military-related equipment. Rather it is that countries that are 
seen as threats to regional stability and peace could acquire advanced 
equipment that, at a minimum, would increase the cost if this country ever had 
to militarily oppose their aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Allied victory in World War II was at least hastened by American and British 
technological achievements in such fields as radar, code-breaking, the 
development of long-range bombers and, eventually, the atomic bomb. The allied 
coalition's victory in the Persian Gulf War was similarly eased by a host of 
technological advances, everything from special starlight-gathering goggles 
that allow infantrymen and tank personnel to see in the dark to highly precise 
cruise missiles and satellite positioning systems. Now, however, much of the 
technology involved in these systems is becoming available on the open market, 
with Russia and China among the top suppliers. Countries that are ready to pay 
the price -- as Iran and Iraq have shown they are -- can add a lot of 
sophistication to their military capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the United States doing enough in response? Here a quiet debate among 
defense specialists goes on. Some note the continuing lack of a reliable 
air-defense missile system to counteract enemy cruise missiles and of 
safeguards to protect the computers that are vital to military communications. 
Others, however, caution against overestimating the ability of potential 
enemies among Third World countries to coherently use whatever advance 
technology they may acquire in a way that would make a real difference. 
</P>
<P>
 On one essential point there is agreement. The United States can't afford to 
coast or skimp on continuing defense-related research and development. The 
qualitative U.S. edge in military technology has to be maintained, because 
without that edge the threat to American combatants in future conflicts could 
rise unacceptably. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War's end has allowed a downsizing of the U.S. military. But what 
remains is still the world's most important fighting force. It continues to 
require the best possible technological help and protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for the wonderful story about the young man with talent and heart to 
match, Tim McDuffy (Aug. 28)! And bless those who helped him along the way. 
Today, everything seems right with the world. 
</P>
<P>
 C. QUINN, Lake Arrowhead

</P>
<P>
 Congratulations on your coverage of McDuffy's accomplishments, and the 
opportunities that have now been presented to him.He has learned that the gift 
of talent is a challenge, often accompanied by hardships. 
</P>
<P>
 How sad it is that so many young people must learn their art in spite of their 
parents and without an adequately supported public education system. Here in 
Los Angeles, with the finest artistic resources in the world, every budding 
musician should have a chance. Each neighborhood school should offer a full 
range of opportunities to study vocal music, band and orchestra as well as the 
other arts disciplines that help make young people into well-rounded adults. 
Instead, some of the finest teachers in the world are spread too thin and 
qualified administrators are left without the financial resources to do the 
job. Too often, true talent is unrecognized, and young people express 
themselves through frustration and rage. 
</P>
<P>
 McDuffy's mentor, Ndugu Chancler, and his colleagues have made unusual 
commitments to the lives of young artists. I would like to invite additional 
members of our community to help do the same by contacting the Los Angeles 
Community Coalition for Music Education at (213) 225-5067.

 Why must you disparage one school in order to enhance another? Did your

Hamilton's musically gifted magnet? Has she heard Crenshaw's band play? 
Evidently not! They do quite well, thank you.

U.S., SET FOR JAPAN SHOOTOUT, MAY HIT OWN FOOT; TRADE: ADMINISTRATION EYES 
SANCTIONS FOR A NONEXISTENT 'PROBLEM'; RESPONSE COULD STALL CALIFORNIA'S 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM C. DUNCAN, William C. Duncan, the author of a 1973 study, U.S.-Japan 
Automobile Diplomacy, is general director of the Washington office of the Japan 
Automobile Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, meeting in Los Angeles this weekend 
with counterparts from America's three biggest trading partners, must feel 
anything but at ease. The Clinton Administration is considering unilateral 
trade action in knowing violation of the agreements and principles that the 
ministers are meeting to enhance. That issue hangs like a foreboding cloud over 
the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration says it will meet its self-imposed deadline of Sept. 30 to 
decide whether to threaten trade sanctions against Japan. If reports are true, 
the action would be taken against Japanese auto parts manufacturers. This 
should make tensions particularly high with the Japanese minister, since no 
unfair trade practice in auto parts has been identified. In fact, there have 
been repeated private admissions by U.S. government officials that the auto 
parts "problem" is largely political, not substantive. 
</P>
<P>
 Imposing unilateral sanctions against Japan with respect to auto parts would 
be a flagrant violation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and would 
repudiate the new dispute-resolution framework the United States fought so hard 
to get as a part of the GATT Uruguay Round agreement -- the implementation of 
which the ministers are meeting to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States would be taking the action simply because it doesn't like 
the balance of trade between the two countries, and in spite of the failure of 
repeated, exhaustive attempts to document charges of unfair trade practices in 
autos and auto parts. A U.S. decision to act without evidence of wrongdoing 
would abandon 50 years of global-trade consensus and fly in the face of 
America's longstanding support for free trade in competitive world markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the United States decide on Sept. 30 to move toward sanctions, Japan's 
auto makers will urge their country to "take whatever actions are appropriate" 
in response. We may be on the brink of a trade confrontation the likes of which 
we haven't seen since before the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 To solve a "problem" that doesn't exist, millions of American jobs would be 
put at risk. In California, exports account for 9% of the economy and 1.4 
million jobs. The shock of an international disruption of trade would register 
as a new and economically disastrous kind of earthquake in a state still 
struggling to recover from the last recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that so much has already been accomplished to increase U.S. sales 
to Japan in both autos and auto parts. Largely as the result of an intensive 
and sustained industry-to-industry, company-to-company effort, Japanese 
purchases of U.S. auto parts have jumped more than 500% since 1986 -- from 
$2.49 billion to $15.5 billion. In just the last five years, the number of U.S. 
suppliers to Japanese auto makers has grown more than fourfold, from about 300 
to about 1,250. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. auto makers are watching their sales in Japan soar since the recent 
introduction of basic marketing techniques like price cuts and the offering of 
cars equipped with right-hand drive. All this progress, and that potentially 
yet to come, would be blown away by the trade conflagration Kantor and his boss 
may be about to provoke.

PERSPECTIVE ON DISNEY HALL; ANOTHER BUNKER ON THE HILL; DESIGN COMPLEXITIES AND 
AN ARCHITECT'S STUBBORN CREATIVITY ARE THE CULPRITS BEHIND THE CONCERT HALL'S 
ESCALATING COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN GAMES, Stephen Games is a former architectural correspondent for the 
Guardian in Britain and wrote the BBC documentary The Right Sound about 
concert-hall design. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, the news broke that Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall 
would cost $260 million -- $73 million more than was quoted a year ago. Disney 
family representatives immediately blamed the rising tally on more expensive 
building materials, increased earthquake-safety standards and the lack of 
available qualified contractors. They later acknowledged that higher earthquake 
standards contributed only $2 million to the hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, it emerged that design complexities were the real culprits. 
Changes and cumbersome negotiations with L.A. County had dragged the planning 
process out for five years, adding more than $16 million to professional and 
consulting fees and increasing the cost of interior woodwork by $7 million. 
Important and interested parties were then found to booster the project and the 
city's need for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Concert halls are notoriously hard to build. The best halls are rectangular 
buildings with 2,000 seats at most; in anything larger and more architecturally 
inventive, the acoustics suffer. On Disney Hall, with its 2,380 seats, Gehry 
spent two years trying to resist this fundamental law before finally accepting 
what duller minds already knew: that the ideal shape for an auditorium is a 
shoe box. 
</P>
<P>
 Gehry's stubborn creativity explains other singular costs. He has tried to 
build walls that challenge the nature of building technology and has gone to 
great lengths to deny the hall's identity. He has introduced four layers of 
ceiling windows to block the sound of overhead helicopters and has fought for 
zoning variances from the city to let the building encroach on the sidewalk. He 
has installed aerospace computer engineers in his Santa Monica office and 
replaced his original acoustic consultant with a Japanese firm based in Tokyo. 
He has also rigorously defended his right to tinker. 
</P>
<P>
 A corporate client might not have given Gehry so much slack but the protracted 
design process is in some ways exactly what the Disneys wanted. Disney Hall is 
not just a musical facility but an attempt to lever Walt away from Mickey Mouse 
and into the pantheon of high culture. 
</P>
<P>
 If this serves the interests of the Disneys, does it also serve Los Angeles? 
Gehry meant Disney Hall to be a radical alternative to the artistic elitism of 
its immediate neighbor, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. But in spite of its 
modish clothes, Disney Hall was cut from the same cloth. While the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic gets a new home, Bunker Hill gets another fortified redoubt. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is representative of Los Angeles or the Disneys or Gehry, it is 
representative in the wrong way. It doesn't belong to the low-rise ticky-tacky 
vision of a homesteading paradise that makes even South-Central appealing (in a 
way that the South Bronx is not.) It does not belong to the populist culture 
that Disney invented and that deserves to be honored on its own terms. And it 
does not belong to the oeuvre of the Frank Gehry who made his reputation 
creating minimalist miracles out of no-budget and cheapskate materials (though 
five years' work and no building is a kind of minimalism). 
</P>
<P>
 What can be said is that Disney Hall conforms to Reyner Banham's notion of Los 
Angeles as "home to the most extravagant myths of private gratification." 
Selecting an architect famed for his confrontational, uncosmetic aesthetics to 
represent the inventor of Snow White and Bambi also tweaks Los Angeles' 
appetite for the bizarre. If costs have risen, we must expect the gods to smile 
when they encounter hubris. But not, perhaps, when the public sector has to 
foot 40% of the bill.

COLUMN LEFT / ERIC MANN & LISA DURAN: DON'T SPEND TRANSIT DOLLARS FIGHTING 
POOR; BETTER BUS SERVICE AND MONTHLY PASSES ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MANN and LISA DURAN, Eric Mann is the director of the Labor/Community 
Strategy Center. Lisa Duran is the lead organizer of the center's Bus Riders 
Union. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Sept. 1, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority eliminated the 
lower-cost monthly bus pass and raised the fare per ride by 25 cents. On Sept. 
2, a federal court issued a temporary restraining order on the MTA. The 
Labor/Community Strategy Center and our Bus Riders Union brought the complaint, 
arguing that the new policies would cause irreparable harm to bus riders. Fares 
were rolled back to $1.10 and the $42-a-month bus pass was reinstated. If our 
civil-rights suit -- presented by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund 
-- prevails, the MTA will have to seek "non-discriminatory remedies." 
</P>
<P>
 In the tradition of Brown vs. the Board of Education, the Bus Riders Union vs. 
the MTA addresses the racism of the 1990s, in which race, class and urban 
poverty have become inextricably intertwined. For the past two years, our 
activists have testified at every MTA board meeting and budget hearing, met 
with board members, enlisted support from community organizations and spent 
hours on the buses to build a constituency for an environmentally sound, 
attractive, bus-centered system. We argued that the MTA has designed a separate 
but unequal system in which inner-city bus riders' interests are sacrificed, 
not just for a hypothetical white suburban rail rider, but for boondoggle rail 
projects that (if ever completed) will have few riders of any races. Meanwhile, 
overcrowding on inner-city bus lines is the highest in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA's own figures paint a stark picture of racial discrimination against 
the urban poor. There are 350,000 bus riders who use mass transit every day, 
compared with only 27,000 train riders. The second-class bus system serves more 
than 92% of public-transit riders, and since the MTA will not be able to 
complete many of the rail projects it has begun, rail ridership figures will 
not get much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-seven percent of MTA riders are Latino (compared with 36% of Los Angeles 
County's population), 23% are African American (compared with 11% population), 
8% are Asian-Pacific Islander, 1.2% are Native American and 19% are white 
(compared with 41% of the population.) This ridership of 81% minority, mostly 
poor, reflects the fact that people of color are dramatically overrepresented 
in the low-wage and unemployed work forces that are public-transit dependent. A 
government agency that proclaims, "A typical MTA rider is a person of color 
(Latino or African American), in her 20s, with a household income of under 
$15,000 and no car available to use in lieu of public transit" should accept 
the responsibility to develop a non-discriminatory transit plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the MTA has intentionally diverted "discretionary" funds that could 
be used for the bus system to serve its train strategy, in which 70% of all 
discretionary money is used for 8% of the passengers, while only 30% is used 
for 92% of the passengers. The most glaring example: on July 13, the MTA raised 
bus fares and canceled monthly passes for most riders, claiming this action 
offset a $32-million shortfall. The next week, the board voted an additional 
$123 million for a Pasadena rail line that in all probability will never be 
built, using more than $50 million of discretionary funds, which could have 
covered the alleged deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 While public outrage has focused on the fare increases, (and the MTA has 
vainly attempted to package a 90-cent token and a 25-cent transfer as an 
"affordable" alternative), the threatened elimination of the $42 pass used by 
more than 75,000 Angelenos each month would be devastating. For people who take 
20 monthly round-trip commutes to work and another 20 for such "luxuries" as 
child care, health care, visiting family and attending religious services, 
transit costs would rise to $92 a month -- an additional $600 per year for 
worse service. When an agency with a $2.9-billion budget implements such 
policies, it is raising racism and class bias to a matter of principle. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the next phase of the class-action suit will continue in federal 
court. Instead of using transit money to fight us, why not accept the temporary 
restraining order as permanent. Keep the $1.10 bus fare and the $42-a-month 
pass and work with us to implement a 50-cent fare to significantly increase bus 
ridership and low-income access. Fund electric and other alternative-fuel 
low-emission buses and use transit dollars equitably to give all Angelenos a 
first-class public transportation system.

WHAT DOES THE FUHRMAN CONTROVERSY TELL US ABOUT THE LAPD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David D. Dotson, David D. Dotson served as assistant chief of the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How is it possible for a police officer who is, by his own statements, 
prejudiced toward minorities, and who may have lied in a failed attempt to win 
a disability pension, rise up through the ranks of the Los Angeles Police 
Department to become a respected homicide detective? 
</P>
<P>
 That is the question raised by the controversy surrounding Det. Mark Fuhrman, 
one of the LAPD's elite homicide investigators who responded to the murders of 
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. O.J. Simpson's defense team has 
accused Fuhrman of racism, even suggesting that the detective may have planted 
a bloody glove he found at the former football hero's Brentwood mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman's alleged racism stems, in part, from his attempt to win a 
stress-based disability pension a dozen years ago. Some of his statements to 
examining physicians reflected deep-seated racial bias. The detective further 
indicated that he believed himself incapable of controlling his emotions and 
feared that he might commit some irrational act as an officer. 
</P>
<P>
 A physician retained by the city's pension board concluded that Fuhrman was 
faking his disabilities, and his stress claim was denied. Fuhrman sued. As a 
consequence, his statements and the resulting doctor's reports, normally 
confidential, became public record. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not the charges against Fuhrman are true, the broader question is 
institutional: Does the LAPD tolerate, even condone, prejudicial attitudes as 
just part of the job of being an officer? When deciding promotions, does 
management consider such information as might be contained in a 
stress-disability application? If an officer files for a disability pension and 
is denied, should he or she be returned to full duty as if nothing had ever 
happened? 
</P>
<P>
 The simplest, and possibly the most accurate, answer to a case like Fuhrman's 
is that the department's command staff is unaware of the file contents of 
officer disability claims and, accordingly, of any troublesome problems they 
may hint at. A quick look at the pension-application process helps to explain 
why. 
</P>
<P>
 Any officer who claims a duty-connected injury or illness files an application 
for a disability pension with the City Department of Pensions. The department, 
not having an investigative capability, asks the LAPD to supply the facts of 
the incident that led to the claim. The officer is examined by physicians to 
establish and report on the degree and character of the reputed disability. 
</P>
<P>
 All the gathered information is confidential until a public hearing is held 
before the Board of Pension Commissioners. The officer's file becomes public 
when the board accepts it as evidence. When the hearing is concluded, the file 
is closed and its contents protected by law. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these procedures automatically bars police managers from learning 
about any officer's disability claim. Yet, they routinely don't look into such 
cases. As a result, valuable information is lost, particularly in the case of 
officers whose pensions are denied and who return to work still believing they 
are disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another, far more disturbing answer to how an officer can be racially 
prejudicial and still promotable. LAPD management is aware of attitudes like 
Fuhrman expressed but looks the other way. It is just locker-room talk. As long 
as such attitudes do not affect conduct, they may be offensive to some but are 
essentially harmless. 
</P>
<P>
 Two examples drawn from recent LAPD history provide some clues. 
</P>
<P>
 * One-on-one conversations with a broad sample of current LAPD officers. They 
reveal a widely held perception that prejudice, racial and otherwise, affects 
the actions of many officers and that such prejudice is tolerated by the 
organization. A departmental survey conducted in the aftermath of the 
Christopher Commission recommendations confirmed this conclusion. And, as might 
be expected, cops who are Latino, African American, female, gay or lesbian 
express much stronger views on what they see as institutional acceptance of 
prejudice. Many have filed discrimination suits against the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 * The survival, for nearly a decade, of the loosely organized "Men Against 
Women," known as MAW, in West Los Angeles precincts. A former command officer 
in West L.A. has described the group as a semi-serious protest against reputed 
preferential treatment given women and minority officers in hiring, assignment 
and promotion decisions. Only recently have efforts to curtail the group's 
activities been successful. 
</P>
<P>
 A final possibility that cannot be discounted is that officers who lose a 
disability bid make a U-turn in thinking and accept the proposition that if you 
cannot get out, you'd better get along. To the extent that these kinds of 
reversals occur, they do so in spite of management. 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done to ensure that the LAPD's culture is not accepting of 
prejudicial attitudes? 
</P>
<P>
 First, the LAPD must engage in candid introspection. More than anecdotes 
should be collected; the results of reports routinely ignored, including 
pension files and summaries of litigation against the department and individual 
officers, should be thrown into the mix. Department management must not 
arbitrarily dismiss responses that clash with their image of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, departmental management must, by act and word, convey its serious 
intention to eradicate internal prejudice. Promulgating orders and providing 
mechanisms to address the problem are only steps toward creating the necessary 
leadership. Allowing underground movements such as Men Against Women to survive 
communicates far more about official attitudes than all the regulations aimed 
at stopping them. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, management must ensure through intensive education that officers 
understand their obligations, to their colleagues and to the public, to cleanse 
the work place of prejudice. This effort must include progress reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, employees who cannot overcome their prejudice must be encouraged to 
seek other employment or retirement. They owe that to their fellow employees 
and to the community they serve.

DANA PARSONS: CYNICAL POLITICIANS ARE WASTING PEOPLE'S VALUABLE TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paging Will Rogers. Where's O. Henry when we need him? 
</P>
<P>
 They'd have a blast with family values. O. Henry would scribble a couple lines 
and Rogers would ruminate, and between them they'd capture the silliness and 
cynicism (take your pick) of politicians telling the rest of us about the 
virtues of being virtuous. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Hawkeye once said on "M*A*S*H," "It's nice to be nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the issue worms its way any deeper into national political discussion, 
can't we all stipulate that we're foursquare behind "values" but that 
politicizing it amounts to nothing more than cheap rhetoric? 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Quayle apparently is going to base an entire career around family values. 
President Clinton, who at least discusses the subject in ways much more 
listenable to my ears, is on the kick too. 
</P>
<P>
 I cruised over to Orange Coast College Friday to pick the brains of a few 
college students. Since they're the people who presumably have been missing out 
on "family values" in recent years, I was curious to see what they made of the 
whole business. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, most of them thought the whole thing is silly. 
</P>
<P>
 The several students all said they considered themselves to have values. What 
came across, however, is that they picked up their values in different ways. 
Some felt their parents instilled them; others believed they picked them up 
either instinctively or from observation. 
</P>
<P>
 Most thought a President couldn't do much about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Erika Freison, 17, if she thinks she has values. "Very much so," she 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Where did they come from? I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just from life and experience," she said. "Let's say your parents say honesty 
is the best policy, and you find $5 lying on the street. But say you're hungry 
and don't have any food. Are you going to give it back or are you going to feed 
your growling stomach? Nine times out of 10 you're going to feed your growling 
stomach." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Mauch, 18, said he got his moral compass from his parents, mainly from 
watching how they acted. And while he said he may not have adopted their 
"outlook on life," he believes he has embraced their moral code. 
</P>
<P>
 But as for values becoming part of political discussion: "It shouldn't have 
anything to do with being President," Mauch said. "The President isn't our 
parents. They just throw it out to make themselves sound better." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked how he reacts when he hears politicians talking about "family values." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just blow it off," Mauch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phuong Nguyen offered a mild dissent. She's 18, and while conceding that 
values come mainly from the family, she added: "It's important to talk about 
family values, because morality is not very important (to people) now. So we 
should talk about it, so young people have some ideas about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Thompson and Shana O'Connor were dismissive of Mr. Quayle's overtures. 
"I'm sure Dan Quayle and the people who support him might disagree, but I have 
values," Thompson, 19, said. He added, however, that many young people form 
their own values. "Parents really don't have that much influence," he said. As 
for politicians entering the fray, Thompson said, "I think it's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor agreed, saying Quayle is just trying to attract attention and make 
himself sound more important than he really is. I asked if she believes she has 
values. "I've got a few," she said, with just the right touch of insouciance 
when someone is so presumptuous to ask such a question. "I don't know if you'd 
call them values, but the things I believe in." 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of oldsters are presumably worried about young people's "values." We read 
about the 11-year-olds murdering people or selling crack and tend to forget 
that millions of other teens and preteens have a pretty good grip on what's 
right and wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 If the college students I talked to Friday are typical, lectures from the Dan 
Quayles of the world are probably going to go in one ear and out the other. 
</P>
<P>
 As Erika Freison said, "It's not really family values, because most families 
are separated or divorced or remarried or whatever. And some of the things your 
parents teach, you're not going to follow because you don't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't get any sense of moral drift from talking to these students. I got 
the clear impression they'd be resentful of people suggesting they don't have 
any values. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to them just deepened my feeling that turning values into a political 
issue is bogus. We all want a society with values, and most of us believe we 
have them. For those who don't have them, politicians talking about it isn't 
going to make much difference. If politicians behave in virtuous ways, that 
will be enough of a contribution from them, thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with apologies to O. Henry, this humble entreaty to those worried about my 
values: 
</P>
<P>
 "If I swear that Madonna is no longer a turn-ona, 
</P>
<P>
 "Will you grant me a wish and leave me alone-a?" 
</P>

 Beach Cleanup -- The 10th annual Adopt-a-Beach program, sponsored by the 
California Coastal Commission, will meet at more than 15 Orange County sites 
Saturday. Individual and groups can volunteer to collect trash and recyclables 
along Orange County's beaches and waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup efforts will span the county from Seal Beach to San Clemente. 
Coastal areas include Bolsa Chica wetlands, Upper Newport Bay and Huntington 
State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, more than 50,000 volunteers picked up more than half a million 
pounds of trash statewide. Cigarette butts and plastic six-pack rings accounted 
for the majority of the trash collected along the shoreline. Collections in 
previous years have yielded water heaters, a car windshield, a Christmas tree 
and even a kitchen sink. 
</P>
<P>
 Information on volunteering for Coastal Cleanup Day: Mark Patrick or Marianne 
Excell at the county Department of Harbors, Beaches and Parks, (714) 723-4511, 
or the California Coastal Commission, (800) COAST-4-U.

PURSUING SOLUTION TO '8% PROBLEM' YOUTHS; COUNTY'S STRATEGY WILL FOCUS ON 
HABITUAL OFFENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Probation Department has received deserved national 
attention since announcing a year ago that its study of juvenile delinquents 
found that 8% of the offenders had committed more than half the repeat cases in 
the juvenile justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 Since reporting the results of its seven-year study, which it called one of 
the largest ever attempted of juvenile delinquency in this country, the 
department has been mapping strategy for a pilot program expected to begin in 
the next few months. The goal is to identify the youngsters who are part of the 
"8% problem," bombard them and their families with a variety of resources and 
try to steer them away from a life of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials have been properly cautious in predicting results of the 
pilot project, which will involve youngsters 15 and under in Anaheim, Fullerton 
and Buena Park. Probation supervisors said they cannot be certain the program 
will work, but they correctly added they know it will be an improvement over 
the current situation. Officials in communities across the country are looking 
at what happens here, hoping to emulate any success. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of juvenile crime and its increasing violence was underscored two 
weeks ago with the disclosure that an 11-year-old in Chicago was being hunted 
for killing a 14-year-old girl, who had been hit by a bullet apparently meant 
for a gang member. The next day, the 11-year-old was found killed, apparently 
by members of his own gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Though seldom as violent as the Chicago killings, Orange County juvenile crime 
has remained enough of a problem to prompt the Probation Department's study. 
After tracking more than 6,000 first-time offenders under the age of 18 from 
1985 to 1987, and following up on some of them for up to six years after their 
first run-in with the law, the department found that 71% had only one brush 
with the police. Another 21% committed a second or third offense. But 8% 
chalked up anywhere from three to 14 more crimes or violation of probation in 
the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Those most likely to fall into the 8% bracket had problems at school and at 
home, abused alcohol or drugs and were gang members or chronic thieves or 
runaways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Probation Department's pilot project has involved a task force from 
various agencies to share information and resources. Schools and social service 
agencies can play key roles in identifying juveniles needing help. Teachers 
know who is missing class. Social workers know when things are bad at home. 
Health care workers can spot signs of abuse. Sharing that kind of information 
can help identify the youths most at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot project concentrates on involving the whole family. Plans call for 
in-home counseling and parental aides, plus day care and public health services 
and individual tutors where needed. That is a smart approach. Children brought 
up in a home with two loving parents financially able to provide a good 
education and opportunities for family fun outside the house obviously have a 
head start on staying out of trouble. But a look at today's society shows how 
few families meet that ideal. If cities and counties can help out, they should. 
</P>
<P>
 Probation Department head Michael Schumacher said about 1,000 youths are 
referred to the department each month. During six years of the study, the 8% 
identified as chronic offenders averaged nearly 20 months behind bars, at a 
cost of $44,000 apiece. The county taxpayers would be better off spending that 
money elsewhere; the chronic offenders would be better off reversing course and 
leading productive lives.

KEEPING TEACHERS FROM DROPPING CLASS; PROGRAM AIMS TO EASE STRESS ON NEW 
INSTRUCTORS IN HOPES THEY WILL STAY ON THE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When talk turns to salaries paid to movie stars, baseball players and 
television anchors, the comparison is usually to teachers' pay. The relative 
benefit to society of teaching versus professional sports is often a corollary 
for discussion. The notion of the underpaid teacher has become a truism, and 
yet it deserves repeating, especially with the advent of a new school year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the average pay for beginning teachers is $26,821 a year, 
ranging from a high of $29,463 in the Los Alamitos Unified School District to 
$20,488 in Saddleback Valley Unified. Averaged over 52 weeks, that works out to 
$394 per week. A spokeswoman said that the district's benefits are good, and of 
course the salary increases with seniority, but the fact remains that no one 
ever went into teaching to get rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, those who went into teaching to help the young, and who improve 
our society by doing it, increasingly run the risk of burnout for a variety of 
reasons ranging from heavy class loads to low budgets, not just for pay but for 
class supplies. Officials of California's teacher retirement system said at 
least 20% of the new teachers in the state quit within the first two years. 
Another study said that 37% of teachers leave after five years. 
</P>
<P>
 To try to persuade teachers to stay, the state Department of Education and the 
Commission on Teacher Credentialing have developed a project to support new 
instructors. That worthwhile program has now begun in Orange County, in 
conjunction with teacher-education programs at Cal State Fullerton and UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 teachers in the county will be paired with experienced teachers in 
their schools, learning strategies for coping with the pressures of the 
classroom from their mentors. The newcomers also will be able temporarily to 
avoid formal job evaluations, which add stress for rookies who have not learned 
how to pace themselves and who do not have lesson plans from a year or two ago 
to fall back on. The program will be a success if it can duplicate the 
remarkable increase in retention rates it has shown elsewhere in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers are unlikely ever to be paid enough to match the importance of their 
jobs. Luckily there are still enough dedicated men and women to staff the 
classrooms, spend their own money on supplies and decorations, and mark papers 
at night at home, as well as teach and help to socialize our children. The 
state is wise to try to retain experienced teachers, and reinforce the 
enthusiasm that led them into the profession.

COOPERATION STRETCHES PUBLIC'S DOLLARS; GENEROSITY OF HMO, DOCTORS ALLOWS 
SCHOOL DISTRICT TO OPEN CLINIC FOR STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the school doors swung open last week, students in the Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District were beneficiaries of a good example of cooperation 
between government and private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The state gave the district $400,000 for three years to operate a health-care 
clinic at the Rea Community Center in Costa Mesa.A health maintenance 
organization chipped in $70,000, and doctors contributed medical supplies. That 
stretches the dollars of a cash-strapped government. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic opened in mid-August and schools from both Newport Beach and Costa 
Mesa referred students from families unable to afford services from private 
doctors. The students were inoculated against measles, polio, tuberculosis and 
other diseases, and received physical examinations and hearing, vision and 
reading tests. 
</P>
<P>
 An executive of the health care firm, PacifiCare, was right in noting that 
many people believe there is no need for such a program in Newport Beach, known 
for its affluent residents and high-priced stores. 
</P>
<P>
 But the area has few doctors willing to accept payments from Medi-Cal, which 
are far lower than those paid by private insurers, and has a large uninsured 
immigrant population. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said the clinic reflected a new emphasis on having schools 
provide more extensive preventive health care to children from low-income 
families. That's smart, since it is cheaper to prevent diseases than to treat 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the new program was aptly described by Haydee Bonales, whose 
daughter needed a variety of shots to enroll at TeWinkle Middle School. Bonales 
said her family struggles to pay rent and keep food on the table on their 
income of less than $1,500 a month, so the clinic was vital. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials sensibly decided to keep the clinic open throughout the school year, 
letting students concentrate on learning and not on health problems.

PUT SPOTLIGHT ON PROP. 187 OPPONENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your expose on the two principal backers of Proposition 187, Barbara Coe and 
Ron Prince ("Creators of Prop. 187 Largely Escape Spotlight," Sept. 4), is a 
prime example of character assassination found in yellow journalism. This also 
illustrates your conspicuous bias against 187 and anyone who supports it. 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't you do an expose on those individuals who are opposed to Proposition 
187? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure that with a little investigative journalism you'll be able to find 
blemishes in the personalities of such notables as (Los Angeles County) Sheriff 
Sherman Block, Deputy Foreign Minister Andres Rozental, a member of that pillar 
of Mexican democracy, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, and even pious 
Cardinal Roger Mahony. Should they be investigated, you'll no doubt advise them 
to clean up any of their character defects. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course I, and I'm sure a great many other Californians, would be interested 
in the results of an investigation that would reveal why your "newspaper" is so 
strongly opposed to Proposition 187 and those who support it. 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, why not an investigation on the two writers of the article in 
question. 
</P>

 * As we were taught in high school debate class, "you know you've won the 
argument, when your opponent resorts to attacking you personally." The Times 
stooped to a new low when you printed a front-page news article (Sept. 4) 
personally attacking the motivations and intentions of Prop. 187 initiators. 
Could it be you've run out of valid arguments to explore in the Prop. 187 
debate, or perhaps you just refuse to acknowledge that the majority of 
Californians (independent polls consistently return statistics that 60% to 70% 
of voters support Prop.187) are clear on the main issue -- that it is wrong to 
reward those who break the law? 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Americans have a lower opinion of the media than they do of the U.S. 
Congress. No wonder that newspaper readership in the U. S. has consistently 
diminished in recent years. Consumers want news on the issues, not malicious 
gossip and biased reporting.

THOSE WHO LOVE -- AND WANT -- TO TEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I have been teaching high school in California for the past nine years. 
After reading your article ("Long Awaited Day Here," Sept. 6) I felt I should 
mention that there are many reasons for entering this profession, and many 
different types who choose to. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to what you pointed out, we are not all retired individuals looking 
for a new career or people who could not find work in our first area of choice. 
Many of my fellow teachers entered this profession out a love for the subject 
matter, and a desire to pass on this love to our students. I must also mention 
that it is not only the first year teachers who are "brimming with bright-eyed 
enthusiasm." I can point out many 25- to 30-year veterans on our campus who are 
admired for their enthusiasm as well as their experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, we are not all "altruistic" martyrs who are willing to work for 
subsistence salaries. This profession pays very well now. In addition to the 
pay, we have pleasant people to work with, great hours, wonderful benefits, a 
feeling of making a difference, and terrific vacation time. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we have our problems in California's public schools. There are many 
things that could be changed or improved. Even though we have these problems, I 
am confident that many teachers will agree with me when I say that we have a 
wonderful job. There are many jobs I could have chosen. There are many careers 
that I could move into today. We choose to be teachers.

 * The article on New Schoolteachers (Times, Sept. 6) conveniently excludes a 
whole group of the highest-qualified teachers, those who would exult with a 
starting salary of $26,000, those with decades of experience in practical, 
applied math and science, some with 10 to 20 years as part-time teachers, some 
who would out perform even Jaime Escalante himself -- the older aerospace 
engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 No school district dares to utter the words, but age discrimination seems to 
be the only apparent reason for choosing younger teachers over the older set. 
Regardless of the popularity of elderly substitute teachers in the eyes of the 
students themselves, the political dealing of the front office carries the main 
weight in hiring practices. 
</P>
<P>
 This writer has over 15 years teaching, over 20 years of engineering, over 370 
college credits, repeating the calculus series to ensure professionalism, a 
substitute math/physics teacher in nearly 20 school districts, yet still 
waiting for the first serious offer. In 1982, L.A. Unified begged this engineer 
to teach electronics in the district for $17,500 while volunteering at Narbonne 
High in the Adopt-A-School Program. Today, the phone is strangely quiet.

SUPERVISORS RAKED FOR ENDORSEMENT OF GOV. WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * After 46 years of covering and watching the activities of the Orange County 
Board of Supervisors, I thought I had seen just about everything -- good, bad 
and indifferent. But the recent press conference where four of the five 
supervisors publicly announced their endorsement of Gov. Pete Wilson's 
reelection efforts -- and the fifth let it be known that her feelings were 
along the same track -- established an all-time low in political savvy, ethics 
and even decency.  
</P>
<P>
 There are several reasons for that. No. 1: The last time I looked, the five 
supervisors hold nonpartisan offices, which, if I'm not mistaken, are designed 
to provide at least the impression of equal representation for all their 
constituents, regardless of party registration. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2: What message does this action send to the 394,718 registered Democrats 
in Orange County? Believe it or not, that's a pretty large group to be 
disenfranchised by their so- called "elected representatives." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3: The announcement was obviously timed to create the most embarrassment 
for Kathleen Brown's major appearance in Orange County the following day. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4: The five supervisors and their Republican puppeteers notwithstanding, 
there is a very strong possibility that Brown could be the next governor of 
California. If that happens, just how strong a voice do our esteemed 
supervisors think they will have in Sacramento! It shouldn't be necessary to 
remind them that one of the primary watchwords in politics has always been, 
"Don't get mad, get even." Orange County has frequently claimed under the 
Wilson Administration that it doesn't get its fair share of state funds. It may 
have seen nothing yet and guess what part of the population will have to bear 
the heaviest share of that little problem. 
</P>
<P>
 No, I'm afraid about the nicest thing you could say about their joint action 
is that it was short-sighted. For some of us, the word "dumb" comes to mind. Or 
maybe even "arrogant" would be a better description.

IT'S UP TO CITIES TO HELP LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We have now experienced many months of curtailed service in our county 
branch libraries -- fewer days, shortened hours, and reduced book and 
periodical funds. Last year there was a 35% cut in state funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, I wrote suggesting that local support be considered to supplement 
county funding. Communities in Southern California (Pasadena,, South Pasadena, 
Altadena) have passed measures by large margins. Here in Orange County, Newport 
Beach and Mission Viejo have acted and now Tustin's City Council is considering 
a program to spend $50,000 a year for added services. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not seem prudent to have cities remove themselves from the Orange 
County public library system; some have discussed it. Since libraries are 
needed by everyone in every community, it seems some action should be taken to 
maintain and develop these priceless resources.

ENOUGH CODDLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read with disgust the article, "Word Bond" (Aug. 17). 
</P>
<P>
 I respectfully request instead that the "Korean Americans" and the "Latinos" 
both learn and use English. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a first generation American born circa 1923. My parents learned and used 
English. I'm as proud, if not prouder, of my heritage as (others) are of 
theirs.  
</P>
<P>
 Enough of this coddling! 
</P>
<P>
 Even more disgusting is to hear, in public, the young descendants converse in 
a language other than English. We were taught that it is discourteous to speak 
in public in a language not understandable to other people who are present. 
</P>
<P>
 God bless America and its forebears.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC EDUCATION; GIFTED OR AVERAGE, 
STUDENTS ARE HURT BY SCHOOLS' LACK OF FUNDS; WITH STATE SUPPORT REMAINING LEVEL 
WHILE COSTS KEEP RISING, O.C. BOARDS OF EDUCATION FACE PAINFUL CHOICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN F. DEAN, John F. Dean is Orange County's superintendent of schools. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Genius dies every day in the primary grades all over California -- and that 
disaster will continue until we revise our priorities. The needs are many; the 
choices will not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 It will not come as a surprise that one of the choices involves money. 
</P>
<P>
 The recently adopted state budget for 1995 is the fourth consecutive year that 
schools are given the same dollars per student -- about $4,200 -- when the cost 
of doing business, according to a national, state and local price index, has 
risen by more than 10%. California is already among the lowest cost-per-student 
states in the nation. To stay even, that expenditure should be at least $4,620! 
</P>
<P>
 In perspective, one of the highest dollars-per-student states is New Jersey, 
spending in excess of $10,000. Their lowest-spending district is about $7,000, 
and those school districts are going to court to seek equality. Orange County 
school board members would commit mayhem (almost) for New Jersey's lowest 
amount per student! 
</P>
<P>
 With less "purchasing power," boards of education have few choices. Among 
their options are dropping elective classes including art, music and drama, 
eliminating administrative and nursing services, adding to counselor loads and, 
finally, increasing class size. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk of being lost in the crowded classroom, or deprived of the arts, 
starves genius every day. California has virtually the highest ratio of 
students per teacher in the nation. Biggest losers in the students-per-teacher 
numbers game are the less intellectually blessed children -- the ones most 
likely to slip through the cracks in classrooms of even the most motivated 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcrowded classrooms mean less time per student. And imagine for a moment 
the physical and intellectual challenge of teaching 35 or 40 sophomore English 
students five periods each day, then carrying home 180 "themes." Yes, they 
still do that, but not nearly as often. And ask yourself what you do with your 
evenings. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Since "A Nation at Risk" more than a decade ago, public education in 
California and across the nation has lived on a slide in the microscope, with 
its every move magnified to the 100th power. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite less buying power and larger classes, what have Orange County schools 
accomplished? 
</P>
<P>
 Dropout rates have plummeted to among the lowest anywhere; more students are 
graduating. Half of our graduating students are taking the SATs, achieving 
scores well above national and state averages; hundreds are enrolling in 
advanced placement classes and earning college credit, again well above 
national and state averages. 
</P>
<P>
 College-bound students in Orange County are well prepared, but how do those 
fare who are headed for employment when they complete high school? Better than 
a few years ago. VITAL LINK, one of four projects in the nation supported by 
the American Business Conference in Washington, is beginning to fill a void 
between schools and the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating schools are preparing students for that next step through career 
counseling, elective classes and direct communication between local business 
and industry. At this time, hundreds of high school students are involved, with 
Anaheim's first VITAL LINK graduating class in June sending more than 100 
better-prepared students into the world of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Our county's Business Education Roundtable (CEOs and superintendents) meets 
regularly for mutual understanding, knowing we need each other for a prosperous 
future. Literally hundreds of our business and community leaders also expand 
their knowledge and experience when they participate annually as Principals for 
a Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the critical financial picture, your schools are accomplishing much more 
than the media have room to report. Those who know our schools better than 
anyone -- parents with children in school -- rank Orange County schools best in 
California, with a strong majority awarding A and B grades! 
</P>
<P>
 If Orange County schools are doing so well, what is the crisis? For openers, 
try too many students per class, outdated textbooks, limited or no school 
library services, virtual elimination of art, music, and drama classes or 
opportunities, and 600 to 800 students per counselor in schools that haven't 
been painted or maintained properly for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the challenges surrounding our society today, the teachers are doing a 
good job, of educating our children and grandchildren, and they deserve our 
support.

EASING BABIES' PAIN IS NO SMALL MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thank you so much for printing the article, "Doctor Working to Ease Infants' 
Pain" (Aug. 1). I am the mother of a premature baby who is now 19 months. 
During the weeks of visiting my son in the neonatal intensive care unit I saw 
my fair share of suffering babies. With my own child I identified early on 
which cries were of discomfort, pain, hunger or just wanting to be held. No one 
could tell me or convince me he was not in pain as a multitude of procedures 
were performed on him. It is easy to negate these tiny little patients since, 
after all, they cannot speak, and the medical field has refused to acknowledge 
they do have emotional and physical feelings.

<P>
 Research now has shown us that a newborn distinguishes between his mother and 
a stranger holding him. In doing research in this area, I believe that the 
medical professions will discover the degree to which the nervous system is 
developed in these tiny patients, therefore confirming they feel pain, and also 
discovering the ability to tolerate anesthetics or pain-controlling agents, as 
long as the dosage is properly administered and monitored closely. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that fear of liability when administering pain relief to babies is 
the culprit. Like everything else, no one wants to get sued, and this, coupled 
with the fear of the unknown, has slowed progress in this area. 
</P>
<P>
 I applaud Dr. Perry Eisner for "sticking up for his tiny patients." He is a 
doctor from his mind down to his heart.  
</P>
<P>
 What a terrible introduction into this world. Think about it. These newborns 
have gone from the comfort of their mother's womb, where everything is provided 
-- warmth, security, nourishment -- to a cold, bright and noisy hospital room, 
where they are subjected to medical procedures such as shots, having their 
blood drawn, IVs put in, worse yet, operations with little or no anesthetics. 
How barbaric! The true crime is that with all our economic backing, technology 
and sophisticated gadgetry we have made virtually no progress in this area.

BICYCLISTS INDEED BROKE SEVERAL LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Steven Redpath's letter of Sept. 4 attempted to justify the blockage of 
traffic by bicyclists, and was titled "Mass Bike Ride Broke No Laws." On the 
contrary.In addition to being ill-advised, the activity broke several laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Redpath claims that the lanes on Beach Boulevard are "substandard" and too 
narrow to allow a car to pass a single bicycle. This is absolutely untrue for 
the curb lanes he should be riding in. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition then to violating section 21202 of the Vehicle Code, he and the 
other riders also violated sections 21654 and 21656. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these three sections allow the cyclists to "bunch up" at a red light 
for any reason, as they were doing in the photo, and which Mr. Redpath excuses 
on the irrelevant and untrue grounds that no one else could get through the 
light if the cyclists were in single file. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these sections require any vehicle, bicycles included, to drive at the 
extreme right-hand edge of the pavement when they are going slower than normal 
traffic on the road. If a slow-moving vehicle is being followed by five or more 
other vehicles, then the slow driver is required to pull off the roadway at the 
first safe place to do so and allow the other vehicles to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing number of bicyclists are gleefully justifying dumb-driving habits by 
supposed loopholes they read into these sections.

MODIFICATIONS TO CLASSROOM AREN'T THE ANSWER IN CASE OF JIMMY PETERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * This is in regards to the ongoing saga of Jimmy Peters. I am a special 
education teacher and wholeheartedly support full inclusion and parent 
involvement. I also expect cooperation from a parent in the ongoing struggle to 
include special education students into the regular classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Peters has unfortunately set back the attempts to include all special 
education students into the classroom. Does he realize that regular education 
teachers read the newspapers also? They miss all of the positive attempts at 
inclusion because of his ongoing battles. I understand the district is making 
attempts to accommodate his son. He needs to understand that compromise 
sometimes is the best solution. 
</P>
<P>
 I too would like to see my students included in the regular classroom and make 
the best attempts to do so. However, unfortunately, not all teachers are 
accepting, not all districts are accepting and the negative press that Mr. 
Peters is receiving has only made it more difficult for others. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that we will soon read less of Jimmy Peters and find more of the 
positive role models for inclusion that are happening in the Orange County 
area. There are plenty of successful cases of inclusion; let's hear about those 
students.

 * I find Jim Peters' attempts to privatize a public school for the benefit of 
his son dismaying. Schools are drained of funds, yet $5,000 has been spent to 
handle his child. Mr. Peters also wants two-way mirrors installed, and the 
boy's baby-sitter hired as a teacher's aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the "appropriate educational program" Mr. Peters seeks can be found at 
a private school, rather than disrupting the education of everyone at this 
publicly funded school.

 * The new school year begins with renewed demands by special education 
advocate Jim Peters that his disabled child, Jimmy, will be "mainstreamed" into 
a regular first-grade classroom in the Ocean View School District. We have been 
reading about this case for the past six months. The most recent article about 
Mr. Peters and Jimmy shows that the parent now wants the following 
modifications to the regular classroom at Circle View Elementary for the 
'94-'95 school year: Moving the class to a different room, hiring the child's 
baby-sitter as an instructional aide for his child only, replacing students in 
the proposed class with those deemed more sympathetic to the child, the 
purchase of special education materials, purchase of an aquarium and guinea 
pigs (or the housing of Jimmy's pet rabbit), and the placement of an eating 
station in the room. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition the school district has spent $5,000 training the proposed teacher 
in techniques to deal with Jimmy and $1,200 in a failed attempt to hire a 
behavior specialist to design an assessment plan for Jimmy. 
</P>
<P>
 A note to Jim Peters: Do you fail to see the inconsistency of one hand 
claiming that your child can function in a normal classroom and on the other 
hand trying to transform it into a special education class set up for the 
benefit of your child alone? Can you not see the chaos that would result if 
each and every other parent made similar demands that the school provide the 
perfect learning environment for his or her child with the entire focus pointed 
toward that end? 
</P>
<P>
 Mainstreaming is a valid concept. Certainly any disabled child who can fit 
into a normal classroom should be allowed to attend and reasonable 
modifications to the classroom and program should be considered to expedite the 
process. It is now up to the Ocean View School District to draw the line at 
what is reasonable in terms of time, money and sacrifice by the others in 
contact with Jimmy.

SOUNDS OF SILENCE

 * The other day I realized how nice it is to do without! I mean without the 
noisy rock concerts from the Pacific Amphitheater, which used to shake our 
house, which is slightly more than a mile away -- but right in the sound 
pattern. The silence, not only in the evenings but in the afternoons when they 
would practice, is a delight. How sweet it is!

THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF SOCIAL SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In your editorial, "Social Services and a Changing County" (Aug. 21), I was 
struck by your sentence, "The county shares in the blame." 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mean we the people are somehow obligated to the Spanish-speakers 
that are overwhelming our social services? Shall we offer the same kind of 
largess to the Vietnamese, Koreans, Armenians, Chinese, etc.? 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, we have plenty of money for all these programs, right? If not, let's 
close a few more libraries, because our first obligation above all is to the 
poor that Mexico exports to us in ever-increasing numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, and do we need them to keep on coming. After all, there is an unlimited 
demand for busboys, agricultural workers, gardeners and carwash workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Try to restrain your illogical little liberal hearts. Some of us who are not 
mean-spirited nevertheless understand we cannot feed, educate and provide 
health care for the poor of the whole world. 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID ELIZONDO

<P>
 * Your editorial, "Social Services and a Changing County" is "right on." It 
reveals another glitch in Orange County's support for social services, the 
crisis intervention and prevention mechanisms to deal with the weaknesses in 
our social institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Long Beach's Department of Social Work has been trying to fill the 
massive gap in the availability of professionally trained social workers in 
Orange County as has USC's local social work campus. Our two-year master's 
program has averaged 40% ethnic minorities, and 17% of the total are Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Your significant attention to the need to keep up with the changing 
demographics of Orange County and Southern California also carries another 
message, the limited number and support for schools of social work in this 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Three longtime schools (CSULB, USC and UCLA) account for a third of the 1,100 
master's (in social work) graduates in California. Surveys indicate that all 58 
counties in California have difficulty filling positions.  
</P>
<P>
 And behind this lack has been nearly three decades of "declassification" of 
professional social work positions in governmental and voluntary sector 
agencies to hire cheaper untrained workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, there is a need for MSWs for what has been designated by the Department 
of Labor as one of the most needed professions.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS: INSIGHT; WATCH FOR A NEW STYLE IN THE WORKPLACE -- 
'LINKING LEADERSHIP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY B. ROSENER, JUDY B. ROSENER is professor in the Graduate School of 
Management at UC Irvine. She is co-auther of Workforce America! Managing 
Employee Diversity as a Vital Resource. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Theories about leadership are plentiful. Corporate executives continually seek 
leadership models to help make their organizations more effective and 
profitable. Implicit in many of these theories is the notion that successful 
leaders exhibit a set of traits such as vision, drive, commitment, charisma and 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 These traits are often confused with leadership or management styles that 
describe the way traits are manifested in everyday actions. This confusion is 
understandable, because until recently it was agreed that the style most 
executives used -- the traditional top-down or command-and-control 
decision-making style -- worked well. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when a different, "Japanese" management style began to attract the 
attention of U.S. executives -- and when research showed that many female 
executives tended to use a power-sharing, consensus-building style similar to 
the Japanese -- attention shifted from leadership traits to leadership styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Because possessing leadership traits these days is thought to be necessary but 
not sufficient to ensuring success (however defined), an examination of 
leadership styles seems warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 The visibility given to the leadership style change undergone by Jack Welch at 
General Electric -- from command-and-control to a more interactive, 
consensus-oriented approach -- is an indication of this shift. The question 
today is whether advances in technology, demographic changes, international 
competition and the rapidity of change are resulting in a new type of 
leadership. I think they do. I have labeled it "linking leadership." It is a 
style that recognizes that leaders have to manage non-traditional linkages and 
must think horizontally and diagonally as well as vertically. 
</P>
<P>
 Linking leaders use the structural power inherent in the command-and-control 
style at the same time they use the personal, informal power associated with 
interactive leaders. They employ traditional top-down decision-making while 
also using a bottom-up, participatory decision process. They base their 
decisions on objective analysis but are also comfortable with ambiguity and 
reliance on subjective observations and qualitative data. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, this type of leader links traditional management styles in new 
ways. Just as important, these leaders link ideas from customers, suppliers, 
competitors, employees and academics. They also link organizations, markets, 
functions, customers, suppliers and competitors in working businesses and 
coalitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to remain competitive, it is necessary to know with whom to link, 
when to link and how best to link," says Alan King, president and CEO of 
Tustin-based Silicon Systems, a $320-million (revenues) manufacturer of 
semiconductors that specializes in mixed-signal integrated circuits. 
</P>
<P>
 King characterizes Silicon Systems as a specialty firm whose engineering and 
marketing departments are linked with customers in innovative configurations. 
Customers become partners with Silicon Systems in a corporate relationship 
referred to as "customer partnering." Such working relationships require 
leadership skills quite different from those of former times -- skills that 
King feels are described by the linking-leadership style. 
</P>
<P>
 Another corporate executive who operates as a linking leader is Cathy Wood, 
president of Positive Productions, which develops multimedia point-of-sale 
kiosks. 
</P>
<P>
 Through stock ownership and revenue sharing, a wide variety of employees are 
linked together in the Newport Beach firm's wins and losses. In turn, says 
Wood, employees' professional, financial and personal goals are linked to the 
company's goals and values. For example, those who wish to work four-day weeks 
so they can spend more time with their families can do so. Those who prefer to 
work longer hours can do that. It is part of the firm's culture to match 
employee lifestyle preferences to company requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of organization is quite different, Wood says, from the 
multimillion-dollar retail loan portfolio she used to manage at Mellon Bank in 
Pittsburgh. She has moved away from the more traditional leadership style she 
previously used -- one in which control and evaluation were based on numbers of 
hours worked, direct supervision, fitting in and top-down decision making. 
</P>
<P>
 At Positive Production, employees are treated as partners rather than workers. 
Wood has less direct control, but she is confident that evaluating performance 
in terms of contribution -- not time -- works. 
</P>
<P>
 If Alan King and Kathy Wood are representative of other executives, it seems 
likely we will be hearing more about the linking-leadership style. Admittedly, 
putting labels on the way leaders lead provides an avenue for thought at best. 
All leaders demonstrate their leadership traits in a multiplicity of ways 
depending on a myriad of factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The message, then, is that managing linkages -- be they the result of how 
organizations are structured or the values that drive a firm -- requires 
leaders to control, motivate and evaluate performance in new ways. It also 
means sharing responsibility and revenues so that there are multiple winners. 
For executives most familiar with competition as a zero-sum game, becoming a 
linking leader may pose a significant challenge.

WILLIAMSTOWN, MASSACHUSETTS; 'A VILLAGE BEAUTIFUL'; THAT'S WHAT LOCALS CALL 
THIS HISTORIC NEW ENGLAND TOWN, WHERE THE FALL LEAF SHOW WILL SOON BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Come stomping into this town looking for trouble, I dare you. The Berkshire 
hills will roll pleasantly beneath you, Mt. Greylock will rise gently on the 
horizon and the landscapewill enfold you in springtime greens, winter-white 
flocking or, now that fall approaches, a super-saturated leaf scene of reds and 
oranges. Steeples, porches, red bricks, Colonial columns and clapboard walls 
will arrange themselves around you. The streets will be neat, the lawns 
trimmed, the 90-odd buildings of Williams College handsomely historic. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't even count on the students for disorder. During my three-night visit 
to this northwestern corner of Massachusetts last spring, I hiked out to the 
college's Cole Field and watched the graceful and fierce women of the 
Middlebury College lacrosse team destroy ateam of Williams women, 16-7. After 
the clock ran out, the vanquished Williams women lay down their sticks, 
gathered in a circle and raised their voices. Here it comes, I thought, a 
little enmity, a little nastiness, a little . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Nice game, Middlebury!" they chanted. "Good job, officials! Good luck, J.V.!" 
</P>
<P>
 Good job, officials!? So goes life in Billsville, as its roughly 8,400 
residents sometimes refer to it. The energy and menace of Manhattan lie just 
155 miles to the south, and the traffic-packed side streets and dense 
neighborhoods of Boston boil about 140 miles to the east. Williamstown endures 
at a point three hours' drive from each -- culture and nature its twin themes, 
its commercial core occupying a single city block. 
</P>
<P>
 To travelers from west of the Mississippi, Williamstown remains largely 
unknown, and is easily confused with Williamsburg, another town dating back to 
Colonial days. (For the record, Williams burg is a Virginia village near 
Washington, D.C. Williams town stands four states northeast of there, in the 
northwest corner of Massachusetts.) 
</P>
<P>
 To travelers from the east, Williamstown is a well-known retreat. Some roll in 
for a few days of fall foliage admiration -- a normally spectacular show that 
has the added advantage of being off more crowded leaf-peeper routes -- or for 
visits to the community's pair of top-flight art museums, or for summertime 
music at nearby Tanglewood. (Though Tanglewood -- a 200-acre estate in Lenox -- 
is best known as the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and music 
director Seiji Ozawa, its schedule this year in a new concert hall included 
Frank Sinatra, Raffi, Wynton Marsalis and James Taylor.) 
</P>
<P>
 The main performing arts attraction in Williamstown proper is the Williamstown 
Theatre Festival, a 40-year-old series of summer productions headquartered 
behind the white columns and red brick walls of Williams College's Adams 
Memorial Theater. Since 1959, when playwright Thornton Wilder played the stage 
manager in a production here of his own "Our Town," the festival has commanded 
great attention from New York theater folk and now draws about 50,000 playgoers 
each summer, about 90% of them from New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and 
Connecticut. The past summer's program of 10 productions at three sites 
included Julie Harris, James Whitmore (who played the stage manager in a 
revival of "Our Town"), Blythe Danner, Christopher Walken, Christopher Reeve, 
Paxton Whitehead, Stephanie Powers, Robert Wagner, Richard Benjamin, Stockard 
Channing, Julie Hagerty, Helen Hunt, Maureen O'Sullivan and Richard Thomas. The 
season runs from late June to late August. Tickets usually go on sale in early 
June, run $11-$30 for most shows and sell out quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Workaday Williamstown is impressive too, largely for its lack of real-life 
drama. In the town's last annual report, which covered the year ended June 30, 
1992, Williamstown's various local agencies logged just one case of vehicular 
homicide and 17 cases of assault and battery, against 39,388 library books 
circulated, 1,144 hunting and fishing permits issued, 30 reports of barking 
dogs, six stray cats and one raccoon tested for rabies. (The paperwork came 
back negative.) 
</P>
<P>
 With such high culture, low crime and splendid scenery around, Williamstown 
has grown a bit proud of itself. Though Williamstown is essentially contiguous 
with the down-at-the-heels, blue-collar burg of North Adams, white-collar 
Williamstown people seem to view that town at the other end of Main Street as 
merely a distant acquaintance. The official Williamstown motto, inscribed 
boldly on a white sign at the end of Spring Street, is "the Village Beautiful." 
 
</P>
<P>
 It's true, the village is beautiful; even the Mobil station is a handsome 
brick building. But if all this civic pride gets difficult to take, a cynical 
city visitor can find some comfort in local history: Williamstown owes its 
distinguished existence to an old soldier's well-founded pessimism, and if the 
world were only a slightly different place, city boosters today would be 
begging drama critics to please come see the West Hoosuck Theatre Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1755, a wealthy Yankee colonel named Ephraim Williams Jr., doubtfully 
facing a campaign against French and Indian troops, was inspired to update his 
will. In the updated document, Williams earmarked funds for establishment of a 
town and a "free school" west of Fort Massachusetts, but only if those 
enterprises would bear his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, the colonel was killed in battle a month later. By 1791, the 
township of Williamstown (formerly known as West Hoosuck) had been incorporated 
and the Williamstown Free School was newly established. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangers may notice that the university cites 1793, not 1791, as its founding 
date. It was 1793 when Massachusetts judicial officials approved the conversion 
of the school into a college, thereby advancing the cause of higher education 
and laying the groundwork for the assessing of tuition fees. Thus private 
Williams College, former free school, is now able to charge its students 
1994-95 tuition and room-and-board fees of $25,560. 
</P>
<P>
 But why dwell on footnotes when so much history stands here so tangibly? In 
the center of town, most of the oldest buildings belong to Williams College, 
which serves its 2,000 students on 450 acres. On Main Street alone, the college 
offers up the stolid gray tower of Thompson Memorial Chapel (1903), the 
piercing white steeple of the First Congregational Church (1869), the white 
columns of Chapin Hall (1912) and Adams Memorial Theater, and the red bricks 
and white clapboard of just about everything else. On the same street, the 
city's public library sits in an 1815 building and, a few blocks west of the 
main drag, the city's first burial ground occupies a hillside. Westlawn 
Cemetery, home to scores of 18th- and 19th-Century gravestones, sprawls above a 
broad view of the town and distant hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The logical place to sleep in such a town is someplace drenched in tradition, 
and there are many options. Beginning in the middle of town with the Colonial 
Williams Inn and radiating out into the hills, there are more than 30 hotels, 
motels, inns and bed and breakfastoperations in greater Williamstown, most of 
them assembled with traditional New England architectural sensibilities. At 
least three Victorian B&Bs date to the 19th Century. I admired them all, and 
might well seek them out on another trip, but this time I stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I lodged at Field Farm, a strikingly modern home on a 254-acre farm 
about six miles outside town. It's a fascinating structure, full of picture 
windows, stark planes, rakish angles, blondish woods and modern art. Outside is 
a tennis court on one side and a big pond on the other. With its metallic door 
handles and window frames, the house seems very efficient, forward-thinking and 
respectful of nature, the kind of place Frank Lloyd Wright would put up next to 
Walden Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the architect's name was Edward Gooddell,and the home's five 
bedrooms, each with private bath, are unusually expensive to heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The home began in 1948 as a residence for millionaire, art collector, 
furniture maker and Williams College alumnus Lawrence H. Bloedel and his wife, 
Eleanor. But in 1984, the Bloedels donated the home, its custom furniture and 
the surrounding acreage to the Trustees of Reservations, a Massachusetts 
nonprofit land-preservation group. Then it stood idle for a few years, while 
hands were wrung. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, local innkeepers Dave and Judy Loomis volunteered to take over the 
building and operate it for the organization as a five-room guest house. The 
trustees said yes, and Field Farm has now been a guest house for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooms run $90 nightly and breakfast is included. If you're willing to do 
without a phone in your room or free shampoo, it's a great opportunity to wake 
up in a sort of hypothetical 21st-Century room and look out over an old New 
England landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 During my visit in May, the cold wind rippled the pond, and every morning a 
grove of densely grown trees stood dew-soaked and surging with spring sap. In 
fall, the picture windows frame vast expanses of leafy red, oranges and 
yellows. On my second morning at the farm, I got a specialist's perspective on 
the trees, the sap and the dew. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other guests had come to town from the Boston area for a wildflower 
walk, and one of them was Russell Cohen, a spectacled, bearded, pony-tailed 
lecturer on edible plants. He was a big fan of the flora around Williamstown, 
he said. Then he ticked off a long list of flowers commonly found in the area, 
describing their looks and assessing their edibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, he said, would be tasty on toast; others were poisonous when eaten raw 
but harmless after a boiling or two. Since I wasn't confident in my ability to 
remember which was which, I refrained from snacking during my hikes across 
farmlands and into the hills. The view, the woodsy sounds and the clear air 
were enough. Besides, I had this further observation of Cohen's to comfort me: 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how all of these wild meats, like rattlesnake, taste like chicken? 
Well, wild plants tend to taste like spinach." 
</P>
<P>
 Onward, then, to urban and indoor Williamstown. 
</P>
<P>
 Spring Street, the town's principal shopping street, is lined with two-story 
buildings and handsome storefronts. There's a post office, an antique store, a 
college casual-wear shop, a pizza place, Pappa Charlie's sandwich shop, a 
pottery shop, the Berkshire Hills Market, sporting goods and stationery stores, 
a coffeehouse. Set back from the street, on Bank Street, is the Purple Pub, a 
student hangout. A block east on Water Street is Water Street Books, the best 
bookstore in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway between Spring and Water streets stands the neo-Colonial Williams 
College Museum of Art, whose collection is strong on American art of this 
century. (Admission is free.) 
</P>
<P>
 But the most prominent museum in town is the Sterling and Francine Clark Art 
Institute, a short drive from the campus and Spring Street area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clark, also free, was founded in 1955, thanks largely to family funds that 
came from the Singer sewing machine fortune. The museum's collection, much of 
it acquired in the 1920s, '30s and '40s by Robert Sterling Clark for his own 
enjoyment, is dominated by French Impressionists, including more than 30 
Renoirs and some Degas, although works from Americans John Singer Sargent and 
Winslow Homer are on hand as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the campus buildings, one of the most popular with visitors is the 
Chapin Library of Rare Books, where I found a white-haired man in conversation 
with a librarian amid marble flooring and elaborate wooden shelving. 
</P>
<P>
 If I eavesdropped accurately, he was a 1933 Williams alumnus, contemplating a 
bequest and troubled by the fact that kids today don't seem to know who Paul 
Whiteman was. (Paul Whiteman: New York-based band leader, jazz pioneer, 
commissioner of George Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue," and donor of scores, 
recordings and other memorabilia to the Williams College library's special 
collections department.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapin Library's main attraction is its collection of Revolutionary-era 
documents, including a 1776 printed version of the Declaration of Independence, 
a 1777 copy of the Articles of Confederation and Union, a 1789 draft version of 
the Bill of Rights, George Washington's copy of the Federalist Papers and, my 
favorite, a 1787 letter in which Virginia Constitutional Convention delegate 
George Mason complains vigorously about "fatal" flaws in the newly drafted U.S. 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 By Mason's reading, the Constitution gave too little power to the president, 
created an unnecessary executive office (the vice presidency), failed to 
preserve liberty of the press, gave too much power to the Senate (allowing 
senators "to accomplish what usurpations they please upon the rights and 
liberty of the people") and too much power to the judiciary ("enabling the rich 
to oppress & ruin the poor"). 
</P>
<P>
 A government based on such a document, Mason warned, could "produce a 
monarchy, or a corrupt tyrannical aristocracy; it will most probably vibrate 
some years between the two, and then terminate in the one or the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Later the Bill of Rights came along and dealt with some of Mason's complaints, 
but many of them have gone unanswered.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the best measure of Williamstown's pleasant and becalming nature may 
be this: Even with all that goes on these days in the world beyond 
Williamstown's boundaries, it is possible to step out of the Chapin Library 
into a sunny day, look out at this orderly land of trees and hillocks and 
steeples and well-scrubbed undergraduates, and decide that George Mason was 
probably wrong. GUIDEBOOK

 A Quaint, Quiet Corner of Massachusetts 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: Williamstown lies about 155 miles northeast of New York City 
and about 140 miles west of Boston. The nearest airport is in Albany, N.Y., 45 
miles west. The drive from New York (via Taconic State Parkway, Route 295 East, 
Route 22 north, Route 43 east and Route 7 north) or Boston (via Route 2 all the 
way, or via the Massachusetts Turnpike to Route 20 west and Route 7 north) 
takes about three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: During summer theater and fall foliage seasons, reservations 
are vital. I stayed at Field Farm Guest House (554 Sloan Road, Williamstown, 
Mass. 01267; tel. 413-458-3135), a five-bedroom modern house overlooking a pond 
amid 254 preserved rural acres. Each room has private bath and three have 
upstairs balconies. Six miles outside of town. All rooms $90 nightly. No credit 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orchards (222 Adams Road, Williamstown, Mass. 01267; tel. 800-225-1517 or 
413-458-9611) is the fanciest hotel and restaurant in town, oddly located amid 
strip malls along the main drag. Lots of dark paneling in public rooms and 49 
rooms around a manicured garden courtyard. Standard double rooms: $120-$150. 
</P>
<P>
 The Williams Inn (480 Main St., Williamstown, Mass. 01267; tel. 413-458-9371) 
is a short walk from most campus buildings, includes restaurant, indoor 
swimming pool, 100 rooms and seems child-friendly. Double rooms: $100-$145. 
</P>
<P>
 Among more affordable lodgings, the Maple Terrace Motel (555 Main St., 
Williamstown, Mass. 01267; tel. 413-458-9677) is clean and convenient. Double 
rooms $44-$83, depending on the season. A bed and breakfast, The House on Main 
Street (1120 Main St., Williamstown, Mass. 01267; tel. 413-458-3031), offers 
rooms in a residence dating to the 18th Century. Three rooms with private 
baths, three that share. Double rooms: $65-$85. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: Hobson's Choice (159 Water St., Williamstown, Mass. 01267; tel. 
413-458-9101). Seafood emphasis, several dishes served blackened (in Southern 
style) and three vegetarian entrees. Dinner main courses: $9-$13. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin's (117 Spring St., Williamstown, Mass. 01267; tel. 413-458-4489). 
Nouvelle American, located at the end of town's main shopping block. Dinner 
entrees: $15-$19. 
</P>
<P>
 For light meals, The Store at Five Corners (junction of Routes 7 and 43, 
Williamstown, Mass. 01267; tel. 413-458-3176) in South Williamstown sells fancy 
foods but keeps its in-house menu under $6. On the shopping block of Spring 
Street, Pappa Charlie's (28 Spring St., Williamstown, Mass. 01267; tel. 
413-458-5969) draws a heavy student crowd (lunch prices under $4).

<P>
 Ladies and gentlemen, the authorities have spoken, and it turns out we're a 
four-night town. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be amusing news to those who have spent four or 40 years in the Los 
Angeles area -- or to those who fled in horror after a day or two here -- but 
here it is in print under the grand imprimatur of Michelin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new Michelin Green Guide to California -- the venerable French 
company's first effort at assessing this state -- the editors' suggested 
driving tours allow four days for Los Angeles, the same for San Francisco. San 
Diego gets three; Santa Barbara and Monterey, two. Laguna Beach and San Luis 
Obispo are worth one. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelin's main business is still making tires, but over nine decades, the 
company has also built a reputation as the western world's most highfalutin 
guidebook publisher, issuing star-ratings in its Red Guides that send 
repercussions throughout Europe's restaurant industry. In recent years, the 
company has increased emphasis on its green touring guides -- which don't list 
hotels or restaurants -- and extended its reach to cover New York, Washington, 
D.C., New England, Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until this summer that the company took on California. The 
result is the 264-page Michelin Green Guide to California ($16 in most 
bookstores), sturdily bound, handsomely illustrated, conveniently shaped to 
squeeze into a pocket, heavy on history and light on the pie-in-the-sky 
rhapsodizing that undercuts the credibility of so many guidebooks. But the most 
entertaining elements are the uncredited authors' decrees of just how much 
attention a city, town or landmark is worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the missions, Michelin likes San Carlos Borromeo (in Carmel) and Santa 
Barbara best. At Disneyland, Michelin likes Tomorrowland and Fantasyland best, 
Main Street USA and Adventureland least. In Yosemite Valley, Yosemite Falls 
gets three stars; Bridalveil Fall, only one. 
</P>
<P>
 The most anyone can hope for from Michelin is three stars, a judgment that a 
destination is "worth the trip" by itself. Among the attractions to make that 
category: Yosemite, Hollywood, Death Valley, Big Sur, Hearst Castle, 
Disneyland, the San Diego Wild Animal Park and Avenue of the Giants, the 
32-mile parkway through redwood forest near Garberville. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those that rate two stars ("worth a detour"): Palm Springs; Pasadena; 
Lake Tahoe; Lava Beds National Monument (in California's northeasternmost 
corner); the wine country north of San Francisco; the gold country north of 
Sacramento; Sacramento itself; Monterey; Mt. Whitney; the missions at San Juan 
Capistrano, San Luis Rey and Lompoc (La Purisima Concepcion), and Joshua Tree 
National Monument. 
</P>
<P>
 Those that rate a single star ("interesting") include: Catalina Island, 
Berkeley, Idylwild, Julian, Long Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, and 
Scotty's Castle in Death Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those that fall short of "interesting": Bakersfield, Fresno, Riverside, 
Ventura and Santa Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
 I immediately went looking for goofs and causes for outrage in the new book. I 
found no howlers (unless, I suppose, you work for the chambers of commerce in 
Bakersfield, Fresno, Riverside, Ventura or Santa Rosa) and learned more than a 
few things. (For instance: When Disneyland opened in July, 1955, the live 
television coverage was hosted by an actor named Ronald Reagan.) But there's 
still plenty in the book to fuel healthy arguments among longtime Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento, more interesting than Berkeley? The Lompoc mission, more worthy of 
a visit than Catalina? 
</P>
<P>
 "Historical importance," explained Michelin editor and project manager 
Ann-Marie Borkowski, whom I found at the company's U.S. office in Greenville, 
S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Borkowski, raised in Ohio and Indiana, had spent just two weeks in California 
before she undertook this project and logged 15,000 miles in 22 weeks of 
inspections around the state. Nine other researchers and editors together spent 
another 48 weeks on the road here -- traveling anonymously and paying their own 
way to avoid any appearance of impropriety, even though the guide doesn't 
evaluate hotels and restaurants. In all, the research lasted three years. Few 
guidebook authors do so much homework, or pay their own way. 
</P>
<P>
 So what exactly did they look for? That certain something goes undefined in 
the guidebook, but Borkowski said the criteria include historical significance, 
accessibility, beauty, how representative the site is of the region, "and also 
how much fun it is. Is it amusing? Does it entertain the visitor?" 
</P>
<P>
 I threw out a couple of other quibbles. Ojai, the artsy, oak-shaded Ventura 
County enclave between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, isn't even acknowledged 
on maps, let alone granted a star. Cambria, whose pine-studded slopes, rocky 
shores, many art galleries and snug, fog-shrouded beachfront hotels are a 
standard addition to a Hearst Castle trip, gets no listing of its own and only 
a passing one-sentence reference in a section on the Central Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai was a little too far off the beaten path and not quite striking enough to 
merit a detour, Borkowski said. And though she spent a night there, Borkowski 
and her colleagues ultimately ruled that Cambria didn't quite offer broad 
enough appeal to merit recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our point really isn't to please everybody," Borkowski said. "We really are 
trying to help people who aren't familiar with (California), and are only 
coming for a week or two."

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: COLOR IT FALL IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although leaf-peepers often think they have to go East to see spectacular fall 
color, some of California's finest fall colors can usually be found in the 
historic Gold Rush towns of Grass Valley and Nevada City and along the 160-mile 
Yuba-Donner Scenic Byway, a looped route that goes through the Tahoe National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Peak color weeks are difficult to predict, but tourism sources say mid-October 
to early November is usually the most colorful period. Color tour maps are 
available and visitors may call ahead to check conditions.  
</P>

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: 85 LIONS PERISH IN SERENGETI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canine distemper virus has killed about 85 lions in the Serengeti National 
Park in the heart of Africa's safari land. But as devastating as the epidemic 
has been, researchers say the area still has the continent's largest population 
of the big cats. 
</P>
<P>
 The epidemic was first detected at the beginning of the year, according to 
Craig Packer, co-director of a 28-year lion study that has focused on 250 of 
the 3,000 lions in the Serengeti, Tanzania's most famous game park. It is 
contiguous with the Masai Mara game reserve in neighboring Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 Lions are social animals that live in "prides" and up to 80% of some of the 
prides in the Serengeti study may have been wiped out. Packer stressed, 
however, that published reports of hundreds of fatalities caused by a wide 
variety of other diseases, such as AIDS, are incorrect.  
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview from Seronera,Tanzania, Dr. Melody Roelke, a 
veterinarian for the Tanzania National Parks Service, said the highest death 
rate had occurred in the woodlands on the edge of the plain, but "in the middle 
of the plain, where visitors go, we didn't lose any. There are plenty of lions 
to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers suspect that the lions contracted distemper from domestic dogs 
living near the park. Canine distemper got its name because it usually strikes 
dogs, wolves and foxes. But researchers have found that it can also afflict 
felines such as lions, leopards and tigers, as well as skunks, raccoons and 
other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaccines are impractical for wild animals, says Packer, a behavioral ecologist 
at the University of Minnesota. However, efforts are under way in Tanzania to 
begin a program to inoculate domestic dogs, which would, in turn, help protect 
the lions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the epidemic appears to be tapering off and there is no 
indication that it has crossed the border into the Masai Mara.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: STANISLAUS RIVER; A RAFTING TRIP IN MOTHER LODE COUNTRY LETS 
KIDS -- AND PARENTS -- TASTE ADVENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Zamichow is a Times Metro writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For several weeks, 12-year-old Sam lamented the lack of adventure in his life. 
Been there, done that, he said. Beach smeach. 
</P>
<P>
 So the challenge: Come up with something for young Indiana Jones that would 
still be fun for Ben, 9, and Katie, 6. 
</P>
<P>
 We decided on white-water rafting on the Stanislaus River, a one-day trip ($65 
per youth, $85 per adult) that wends through a beautiful limestone canyon in 
Mother Lode country about 40 miles west of Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivers are rated in classifications that run roughly from one (bathtub 
splashing) to six (bring your own barrel to Niagara). Stanislaus is rated class 
3 or moderately difficult, with enough white water to thrill the kids but not 
enough to give us ulcers. We hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 After a six-hour drive from Los Angeles, we arrived in Columbia -- a small 
historic mining town -- and settled into the Columbia Inn Motel, a half-mile 
from where we would meet the following morning for rafting. For $76 a night, we 
got a noisily air-conditioned suite that included two bedrooms and a bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, dressed in bathing suits, shorts and old sneakers, we drove 
to meet our rafting guides. We solemnly slathered on sunscreen and trooped 
aboard the blue school bus that would take us to our river. 
</P>
<P>
 We had agonized over bringing Katie. Though an able swimmer, was she too 
young? Most outfitters take children ages 7 or 8 and up. After we selected 
Columbia-based Zephyr Whitewater Expeditions, the guides assured us that she 
could travel in the more-stable lunch raft, an oar boat loaded with food. 
</P>
<P>
 Aboard the bus, our driver warned our group about sunscreen. "Don't put lotion 
on your foreheads -- it will just drip into your eyes. And don't put it on the 
backs of your legs -- it'll make it harder to grip," he called out. Too late. 
"Oh great, now we're in for it," mumbled Sam, envisioning vain attempts to 
clutch a raft with his greased legs as it bucked beneath him. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 50-minute ride bouncing along an old one-lane road -- a Class 5 bus 
trip to a Class 3 river, the guides joked -- we reached our cobalt-blue rafts 
and were snugly fitted into our life vests. 
</P>
<P>
 Our guide and trip leader Ralph Posten explained the various mishaps that 
might befall us. The rafts could flip. Or get punctured and deflate. We might 
be knocked overboard. Should we find ourselves underwater beneath the boat, it 
was best to push down from the boat bottom and swim out from under it. The main 
thing, Posten assured us, was to stay calm, and always float feet-first. And 
stay away from trees and logs that might trap you in a current. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go in the lunch boat with Katie," announced Ben, whose only notion 
of a white-water raft trip was from a Cinemax film about the Colorado River -- 
terrifying footage that showed passengers being flung like dolls from their 
vessels and rafts overturning into angry, churning water. An afternoon playing 
Game Boy on the living room couch was looking better and better.  
</P>
<P>
 We reassured him that the river we were about to face was nothing like the 
Colorado. Then Posten explained that he'd been a guide for 16 years and had 
suffered no misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Katie settled happily into the oar boat, waving and grinning where she sat 
between two older women, who also wanted a more sedate voyage. The four of us 
joined two Canadian women in a paddle raft and Posten, seated at the rear, put 
his rookie crew through basic training. Right turns. Left turns. Back paddling. 
And double-time or "digging in." Of course, the most important tactic Posten 
showed us was how to use our paddles to splash the six other boats in our 
group.  
</P>
<P>
 With that, we paddled into the river's current, where every rapid had a name 
and a story. There was Cop Rock, a tribute to the five policemen it stranded 
some years ago. And Big Dog, where a woman's shorts got snagged on a tree, 
trapping the woman in a compromising position during the extended rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the first few rapids, which were among the most difficult on the 
river, we realized we were going to get bounced, drenched and have a blast. 
Katie described one of the rapids later: "You go down, then you go up. Then you 
go down and then you go up and then you get a big splash. It was kind of scary 
and kind of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Ben quickly relaxed and launched fierce water fights with the others in our 
flotilla. Under the hot sun, the cool clean water was wonderfully refreshing. 
And Posten kept our group entertained by pointing out the various hide-out 
caves used by the legendary bandit Joaquin Murieta. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-morning, Posten suggested we float through some light rapids. We all 
jumped overboard, Katie too, floating on our backs as the current pulled us 
along. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after noon, we found a lovely sandy area and pulled off for lunch. The 
guides set up a table with a huge spread of sandwich-makings, fruit and juice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stanislaus was the site of one of California's most prolonged 
environmental battles, and you can see, well up the canyon sides, where 
vegetation was killed when the New Melones Reservoir was filled about 12 years 
ago. Many years' drought has brought down the water level and reopened the 
river for rafting. (We were told it would take several years of strong rainfall 
to refill the Melones, so rafting is safe for the near future.)  
</P>
<P>
 It remains a spectacular canyon. There are no roads in sight, only occasional 
signs of old mining ruins. Eagles fly overhead, and blue heron nest on the 
banks, once the territory of the Mi-Wok Indians. A number of outfitters run the 
river into October. 
</P>
<P>
 After lunch, we piloted our rafts through a quieter series of rapids. But not 
to worry about adventure: Posten corralled the rafts alongside some cliffs 
leaning out over a wide pool. Yup, time for a high dive. As Posten put it, the 
place he had chosen was about 25 feet above the water. But in the retelling, it 
would become 70 feet. For those of us afraid of heights, of course, it seemed 
like 70 feet. After Sam and Ben saw their knock-kneed Dad go for it, they took 
the feet-first plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing left to fear. 
</P>
<P>
 The rafting ended about 4 p.m. with a tow through about a mile of the 
reservoir where the river stops flowing.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ecstatic after the raft trip, we spilled into the streets of Columbia. With no 
cars allowed in the historic part of town, Columbia is vintage Western, replete 
with a dusty main street, hitching posts, a blacksmith and saloons. After 
scouting out the museums, we made a beeline for the authentic stagecoach parked 
outside the Wells, Fargo & Co. building on Main Street, buying tickets ($4.50 
per child, $5 per adult) to ride shotgun on top of the coach. Katie giggled and 
beamed, especially when we got held up by a masked rider. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, we zipped over to the gold mining outfit where young prospectors 
can rent pans ($3) to sift through a mud-filled trough. In one hour, each had 
enough gold (or fool's gold) to be content. 
</P>
<P>
 For dinner, we selected the Lickskillet Cafe on State Street, which offered 
reasonably priced California cuisine, outdoor tables and room to run, an 
important attribute for the young and the restless. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, we discovered a marvelous trail near town leading, after a 
half-hour hike, to a place called Natural Bridges. There, a small stream 
trickled into a series of huge cathedral-like limestone caves. We swam through 
deep, dark pools of fresh water and came out the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Before we left, we stopped at Springfield Trout Farm just outside Columbia, 
where the proprietors supply tackle and you pay for the fish you catch. Once 
the kids snared some frisky trout, which were cleaned and packed on ice, we 
headed out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam judged the rafting trip a success and wrote this afterward: "It made 
Raging Waters and Wild Rivers times 20 look sick. You paddle left, right, 
forward, backward and hang on for dear life. If that's not enough, you jump off 
25-foot cliffs, have gruesome water fights, see great views, float in pools and 
get splashed to death." Budget for Five

HIKING: ENGLAND: STROLLIN' ALONG THE RIVER THAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Horses and Holsteins grazing in the fields, anglers casting for perch and 
pike, bowlers facing wickets in a game of cricket, a wave and a smile from 
friendly lock keeper -- these are some of the sights you'll see while 
sauntering along the Thames Path, one of England's more intriguing 
long-distance trails. 
</P>
<P>
 The River Thames, Britain's most famous blue highway, runs through the heart 
of southern England. Alongside the river is the Thames Path, a nearly level 
trail that leads from the center of London through the storied towns of 
Windsor, Henley-on-Thames, Abingdon, Oxford and Lechlade to the Gloucestershire 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thames Path offers a slow-motion exploration of three different riverside 
scenes: For an unforgettable view of London, try a walk along the capital 
city's "Royal River"; the enthusiastic sightseer will enjoy the middle Thames 
with its churches, abbeys, inns, pubs and restaurants; above Oxford, 
solitude-seeking nature lovers will find the pastoral path to their liking. 
</P>
<P>
 For a quick orientation to London's Thames, board one of the sightseeing boats 
that leave from Westminster Pier, located near the Houses of Parliament. The 
tour boats travel both up and down the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the capital, the river and its accompanying path wind through beech 
woods, chalk hills and wildflower-strewn meadows. Patrolling the Thames are 
ducks, mallards, teal and swans. 
</P>
<P>
 To plan your Thames Path sojourn, buy a copy of the Nicholson/Ordnance Survey 
Guide to the River Thames (Robert Nicholson Publications), easily obtained in 
London. Or order a copy locally at the specialty travel bookstore Geographia in 
Burbank; telephone (818) 848-1414. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Nicholson Guide emphasizes boat travel (another wonderful way to 
explore the Thames) and details such things as how to navigate through the 
river's 45 locks, the book is also loaded with invaluable "Notes for Walkers." 
Walkers will also appreciate the guide's descriptions of sights, eateries and 
accommodations, as well as remarkably detailed maps that highlight the Thames 
Path. 
</P>
<P>
 With creative use of the Tube and British Rail, you can reach some 
surprisingly remote trail heads on the Thames by early to mid-morning. Saunter 
10 to 15 miles up or down river, then return to London from the most convenient 
rail stop. For the Upper Thames Path, it is easiest to use Oxford as a base. 
The Thames Path Where: Alongside the River Thames Southern England. Distance: 
From London to the Source of Thames is 163 miles one way; many 10-to-15-mile 
day walks possible. Terrain: Woodlands, meadows, cities, villages. Highlights: 
Urban-pastoral exploration of England's most famous waterway. Degree of 
Difficulty: Easy-moderate. No hills! Precautions: Some detours required where 
private land ownership borders the river. For more information: British Tourist 
Authority; tel. (800) G02-BRIT

BOOKS TO GO: GOTHAM'S CAR-FREE CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CAR-FREE IN NEW YORK CITY; THE REGIONAL PUBLIC TRANSIT GUIDE, 1994-1995 
edition, edited by Robert J. Ravelli (Camino Books, $7.95 paper); FLASHMAPS NEW 
YORK, edited by Marcy S. Pritchard (Fodor's, $8.95 paper) and NYC CULTURE 
CATALOG; A GUIDE TO NEW YORK CITY'S MUSEUMS, THEATERS, ZOOS, LIBRARIES, 
BOTANICAL GARDENS, CONCERT HALLS, HISTORIC HOUSES by William L. Beavers 
(Abrams/Alliance for the Arts, $12.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 In fall, many a Californian's fancy turns to New York. Wouldn't a quick trip 
back there be nice right about now? The weather, at least theoretically, is 
beautiful. The hotels and restaurants are hungry for imported business after 
the summer doldrums. And then there's all that culture, culture, culture. That 
the visitor will be "car-free" in New York City, of course, is understood. 
Who'd want to fight traffic, scrap for a parking space, worry about vandals and 
thieves with a rented Ford? "Car-Free in New York City" is a useful guide that 
goes far beyond mere public transport information and tips for getting around 
Manhattan. Included are details of free attractions in the city, suggested day 
trips (by train), interesting neighborhoods, discounts and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Fodor's Flashmaps series ("The Ultimate Street & Information Finder") is a 
splendid little (nearly pocket-size) volume that packs a dazzling quantity of 
information into its tightly formatted, graphically sophisticated design. Here 
are easy-to-read maps of everything from airports to restaurants to churches to 
ZIP Codes,with addresses and phone numbers. You won't get any particulars here, 
but the hard facts are copious and easily accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 "NYC Culture Catalog," produced by the Alliance for the Arts, "a nonprofit 
organization dedicated to policy research, information services and advocacy 
for the arts in New York City," is laid out like a catalogue of university 
extension courses. It's written like one, too ("Korea's rich cultural heritage 
is celebrated through performance and exhibition programs presented by the 
Korean Cultural Service"). Assuming that this tone doesn't bother you, it's a 
comprehensive, information-packed key to what seems like darned near everything 
cultural to see and do in Gotham. 
</P>
<P>
 A THOUSAND LEAGUES OF BLUE; THE SIERRA CLUB BOOK OF THE PACIFIC; A LITERARY 
VOYAGE, edited and with an introduction by John A. Murray (Sierra Club Books, 
$16 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 The endlessly enthralling Pacific Ocean, which encompasses everything from the 
sunny beaches of Southern California to the frozen reaches of the Arctic and 
the Antarctic, with the Galapagos Islands, Hawaii, Japan, Australia, New Guinea 
and about 100,000 other places in between, has inspired writers (and 
preliterate observers) for thousands of years. This rich, delicious collection 
goes back as far as Capt. James Cook (an account of his visit to Easter Island 
in 1768) and comes up as close as Barry Lopez on the Galapagos and the volume's 
editor on the aforementioned California coast. Also included are Charles 
Darwin, Herman Melville, Mark Twain, Jack London, Edward Abbey, Annie Dillard 
and Peter Matthiessen. 
</P>
<P>
 ZOO by Anthony D. Marshall (Random House, $12 paper) and THE ZOO BOOK; A GUIDE 
TO AMERICA'S BEST by Allen W. Nyhuis (Carousel Press, $14.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 Some people hate zoos and don't care who knows it. Zoos exploit animals, say 
the critics, and subject them to mistreatment. The place of wild beasts is in 
the wild. True, to an extent. But zoos, especially in the United States also 
protect animals, both individuals and species, and can engender in us urban 
humans an appreciation and respect for creatures of the wild that might one day 
translate to their conservation and preservation. Anthony Marshall's guide to 
this country's zoos, aquariums and wildlife parks addresses the issues of such 
conservation and preservation, and tells us not just what's in the places he 
covers but what gets done there, and by whom, and with what intent. Allen 
Nyhuis' book is more concerned with facilities and attractions. Both include 
directions, opening hours and other practical information. 
</P>
<P>
 Quick trips: 
</P>
<P>
 NORTHERN CYPRUS; A TRAVELLER'S GUIDE by Eileen Davey (I.B. Tauris Books/St. 
Martin's Press, $19.95 paper). Northern Cyprus is Turkish Cyprus, less 
developed than the Greek-run southern part of the island, and still full of 
unspoiled landscapes and extraordinary human remains (from Neolithic villages 
to Venetian walled cities). Eileen Davey is an archeologist and historian, and 
her account is highly detailed, though it does lack scene-setting romantic 
flair. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH DAKOTA by T. D. Griffith, photographs by Paul Horsted (Compass American 
Guides/Fodor's, $16.95 paper). With handsome color photography, miscellaneous 
documentary material (historic portraits, old railway posters), numerous 
sidebars and asides and a fact-filled but lively text, this new entry in 
Fodor's Compass series gives weight and shape to a fascinating state most of us 
(for shame!) would probably have trouble finding on a map.

 During a typical week of the prime June-to-September mountain-biking season, 
Karl Lund escorts 20 riders on tours around Deer Valley Resort in Park City, 
Utah. Cyclists experience a range of elevations, from about 8,000 to 9,400 
feet, Lund said. And before each tour is over -- whether the ride is a 
five-mile jaunt or a full-day outing -- Lund is likely to hear at least a few 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some riders are short of breath or dizzy, or their wrists have become 
fatigued from the rough terrain," said Lund, director of the resort's mountain 
bike school. Other riders complain about exhaustion or muscle aches and pains. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6 million cyclists now ride off-road regularly, according to estimates 
from the International Mountain Bicycling Assn. As mountain biking has caught 
on in a big way, so has awareness that it's not as simple as taking a cruise 
around the block. For some, that epiphany comes a bit too late, occurring, for 
example, when the cyclist is pedaling up the first steep hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between finishing a mountain bike tour feeling tired but 
accomplished or tired, defeated and in pain has a lot to do with conditioning, 
good preparation and an honest assessment of one's physical shape, said Lund 
and other experts. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are many ways to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 Know your level of health and fitness before pedaling off, said Dr. Bert 
Mandelbaum, an orthopedic surgeon and director of sports medicine at St. John's 
Hospital and Medical Center, Santa Monica, and an avid cyclist. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are a non-athlete over age 35, consult your doctor first for 
appropriate testing," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Once a physician gives the green light, mountain bikers should devote adequate 
time to getting into shape or improving their fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pre-trip conditioning is no short-term rush project," said Tim Blumenthal, 
executive director of the International Mountain Bicycling Assn. in Boulder, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the best things to do is to recognize your own (fitness) condition and 
to know what kind of terrain you will be riding." Training on terrain similar 
to what you will be riding can be very helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 For recreational, low-intensity bike tours, riders should start getting into 
better condition at least one month in advance of a trip, Mandelbaum said. "Try 
to ride an hour a day, four times a week," he advised. For more intensive 
tours, start training at least three months in advance, Mandelbaum said. Spend 
six or seven hours a week on the bike. Later, include hill and interval 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tour will be at altitude, try to train at altitude at least on some 
pre-trip rides. The week before the tour should be not as intensive but, 
rather, a kind of detraining week, Mandelbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing proper safety equipment can help ensure comfort. Helmets are a 
necessity. Pick those approved by ANSI or the Snell Foundation, Blumenthal 
said. Bike gloves can help absorb shock and keep hands from getting fatigued, 
experts agreed. Cycling shorts with a padded crotch are recommended. Sneakers 
are acceptable footwear, Blumenthal said, but stiffer shoes such as bike shoes 
can be more comfortable in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Take along a bike first-aid kit, readily available in most cycling stores. Be 
sure the bike is in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Attention to diet can also help riders sail through a mountain bike tour. 
Stick to a high carbohydrate diet, Mandelbaum said, especially just before the 
tour. And drink plenty of fluids the day before. He recommends sports drinks 
with electrolytes and carbohydrate mixtures. Take along sports bars to maintain 
energy during the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent altitude-related problems on the bike tour, take it slow once you 
arrive at the destination. If possible, allow at least one day of non-strenuous 
activity to adjust to the higher altitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Altitude sickness, also called mountain sickness, occurs because of reduced 
atmospheric pressure and, thus, reduced oxygen. The oxygen level in the blood 
declines and other blood chemistry changes occur. It can be life-threatening if 
it progresses to severe stages. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with heart and lung problems or uncontrolled diabetes are more prone, 
but it can strike anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can be fit at sea level and have problems with altitude," Mandelbaum 
said. Altitude problems can begin at elevations of 4,000 feet. Feeling winded 
can be the first symptom. Others may include dizziness, headaches, drowsiness, 
nausea and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
 When altitude problems surface, switch to a lower pace and lower gears, 
Mandelbaum advised. Descend to a lower elevation. If symptoms still don't 
improve, seek medical help. 
</P>
<P>
 The Healthy Traveler appears the second and fourth week of every month.

SHOPPING: GREAT BRITAIN; IN STAFFORDSHIRE, HOME OF WEDGWOOD AND SPODE, THE 
VILLAGES OF STOKE-ON- TRENT SELL SOME OF THE BEST CERAMICS AT BARGAIN PRICES

<P>
 Looking for the quintessential English gift to take home; something classy, 
classic and history laced? After living in London for several years, I was in 
the same position. Having exhausted the usual tea-related gifts, I was 
searching for something new for the holidays. The obvious solution: a trip to 
Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoke-on-Trent is the center of the Staffordshire pottery-making industry that 
produces almost all of Britain's world-famous ceramics. A visit there last fall 
provided not just a shopping experience, but an introduction to some of 
England's finest pottery. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Stoke-on-Trent, during the mid-18th Century, that Josiah Wedgwood 
created the process for a new form of cream-colored earthenware that replaced 
expensive porcelain and black pottery as the first light-colored ceramics 
affordable to the English middle class. Prior to that, porcelain -- which was 
developed by the Chinese and, centuries later, mastered by the Germans -- had 
been available but at prices so high that only the wealthy could afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Staffordshire area was also home to other pioneers in the pottery 
industry, including Josiah Spode, who is credited with creating bone china 
(porcelain made with bone) in about 1799. And so it is that in Stoke-on-Trent 
almost all forms of ceramics -- including porcelain, earthenware, bone china 
and fine china -- were either created, perfected or amplified, and are 
manufactured and sold today in varying forms. 
</P>
<P>
 The county of Staffordshire is rich with industrial heritage and little has 
changed in its villages for hundreds of years. Filled with Victorian 
architecture and surrounded by beautiful countryside, each of its towns has a 
distinct identity and character, yet all share one common theme: pottery. 
</P>
<P>
 The potteries are contained within six different villages that are 
incorporated into the town of Stoke-on-Trent, along the River Trent. The 
villages of Burslem, Stoke, Hanley, Fenton, Longton and Barlaston are about a 3 
1/2-hour drive northwest of London, or a two-hour ride by train. Taking the 
train is a viable option for travelers since threading through each village is 
China Link, a privately owned bus service that picks up travelers at the Stoke 
Railway Station, tours many of the china attractions and allows visitors to 
stop, shop and board the next bus when they wish. Buses run from village to 
village, manufacturer to manufacturer during business hours, Monday through 
Saturday, except on holidays. Tickets cost about $6.50 for a day pass and can 
be purchased on the buses. 
</P>
<P>
 The potteries of Stoke-on-Trent offer great bargains. Although individual 
shops vary greatly, most sell items 30% to 50% less than retail shops in London 
and are stocked with patterns and styles not seen in the United States. The 
shops contain everything from perfect-quality china to end-of-the-line 
close-outs to discontinued lines and seconds (imperfect pieces). Although 
discounts on perfect items are slight, excellent bargains can be found among 
discontinued lines and seconds. To search the shops is to take a lesson in 
history, as well as in design. 
</P>
<P>
 The factories don't look impressive. They are mostly block-long brick 
buildings with, perhaps, a glass-fronted factory showroom. I noticed the 
characteristic brick bottle-shaped ovens at many, although most kilns are now 
fired by gas and electricity and the ovens are slowly disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the factories have showrooms, brightly lit and neat; others seem less 
professional, more factory-like and are set up so that visitors need to rummage 
for treasures. We liked those the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Most conduct their own tours, demonstrating working methods and skills, and 
usually they take about two hours. This means that a day is really not enough 
time to visit all of the factories, museums and visitor centers, although we 
made it work as a shopping expedition. Were I to do it again, however, I would 
plan two or three days to explore the manufacturers, learn about the craft and 
shop at leisure. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend and I loaded up the car with a nice picnic lunch and embarked on a 
great shopping experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Following an early morning drive along easily navigated highways surrounded by 
farms, villages and tree-studded countryside, we arrived at our first stop, 
Burslem, birthplace of Josiah Wedgwood and -- on site of his first factory -- 
one of the first successful pottery towns. On Sandbach Road, east of the city 
center, we found Moorcroft Potters. Well-known among aficionados for its method 
of production and hand-painting, which involves putting the decoration on 
before the first firing, the pottery is still a family business. Moorcroft 
produces a special powder-blue china and the shop sells a variety of items 
including handmade pottery, bowls and plates that are all quite beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far from the center of Burslem, around the corner on Nile Street, is one 
of the many Royal Doulton pottery factories. Royal Doulton carries more than 
30,000 individual items and manufactures such lines as Minton, Royal Crown 
Derby and Royal Albert. The Royal Doulton shop sells Royal Doulton figures, 
character jugs (mugs with a character's face incorporated into the design), 
dinner and tea services, gift ware and child-size china called nursery ware. 
</P>
<P>
 We were interested in several pieces of Bunnykins nursery ware. Designed by a 
nun 60 years ago, the china is decorated with rabbits and delightful country 
nursery scenes. The baby set, which included a baby plate and two-handle mug, 
was priced at about $30 for perfect quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Next we drove to Stoke, about 20 minutes southeast, to visit Minton -- one of 
the most famous potteries in all of England. Described by Britain's Queen 
Victoria as "makers of the world's most beautiful china," the Minton factory on 
London Road sells bone china dinner and tea services, including perfect pieces 
and seconds. Visitors can also order perfect-quality items for shipment home, 
including limited editions of selected Minton Bicentenary commemorative pieces. 
A perfect-quality, five-piece place setting of Dutch Blue Delft china was about 
$95. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Church Street, Spode Potteries sells slightly imperfect and best-quality 
fine bone china, stone china and imperial earthenware. Also available was boxed 
gift ware and a wide range of their famous Christmas Tree pattern: gold-edged 
pottery with decorated Christmas trees ornamenting each piece. 
</P>
<P>
 We traveled to Hanley to find Mason's Ironstone, Land of Legend and Aynsley 
China potteries, as well as the Potteries Shopping Centre, which houses several 
of the city's famous potteries under one roof. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Aynsley China shop I found a perfect-quality five-piece place setting 
of Moselle china, delicately edged in a scallop pattern for about $100. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mason's Ironstone, near the center of town, I was quickly attracted to the 
Blue Denmark China, which is reminiscent of the Blue Dutch Delft. A 
perfect-quality, five-piece place setting was about $25 and seconds were 40% 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the Potteries Shopping Centre in Hanley that was our favorite stop 
for fast finds. Visitors can purchase brand-name china, gift ware, crystal and 
porcelain, including Royal Doulton, Spode and Royal Worcester at reduced 
prices. The center is ideal if you are on a tight schedule, although selections 
are more limited than at individual factories. 
</P>
<P>
 On Litchfield Street in Hanley is Coalport Pottery, a division of Wedgwood. 
Coalport's fine bone china vases, flowers, earrings, figurines and tableware 
are known for exquisite hand-painted, lightly decorated floral designs. 
</P>
<P>
 The gift shop also has a selection of seconds, including Wedgwood crystal and 
tableware at reduced prices. One of my favorite figurines was eight-inch-tall, 
auburn-haired Bridget, who is demurely elegant in her periwinkle-blue gown for 
about $145. 
</P>
<P>
 Southeast of the village of Longton's town center, on Normacot Road, is 
Portmeirion Potteries Ltd. A favorite of many china collectors, Portmeirion is 
best known for earthenware and durable white stoneware turned out as colorfully 
decorated wildlife and plants. The factory store sells seconds on boldly and 
colorfully drawn oven-to-tableware in famous patterns of botanical gardens, 
birds of Britain and summer strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
 Staffordshire Enamels on Weston Coyney Road in Longton had already produced 
its Christmas collection when I was there. I liked the limited edition enameled 
Christmas box decorated with a scene inspired by "nine drummers drumming," from 
the Christmas song, "The Twelve Days of Christmas." It sold for about $100. 
</P>
<P>
 The village of Longton also has many other small potteries, with names known 
to china collectors including Amber China Ltd., Birchcroft Fine Bone China, 
John Beswick and Royal Grafton. 
</P>
<P>
 About six miles south of Stoke is Barlaston, which was to be the last village 
on our tour. It was there that we visited the Wedgwood Visitor Center, which 
can be found by following brown signs decorated with a Portland vase logo 
posted on main streets around town. 
</P>
<P>
 Queen Charlotte, wife of George III, was fond of Wedgwood pottery. As a 
result, Wedgwood's design became widely recognized as Queen's ware. Wedgwood is 
equally well-known for its nursery ware, Mason's ironstone, crystal and fine 
bone china. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at Wedgwood, we saw one of their newest designs, Cantana, a fine china 
pattern that has bands of deep blue and gold edging its borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Complementing pieces also feature a full border of the marbleized blue design. 
A best-quality teacup and saucer was about $30. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a long day as we loaded up the car with great gift bargains -- 
including several pieces of Bunnykins nursery ware, a Royal Doulton picture 
plate, a set of Spode Christmas tree china, a small Coalport porcelain 
figurine, a Staffordshire enamel keepsake box and a large Moselle platter for 
Thanksgiving turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 We also bought a few beautiful pieces for ourselves, including Wedgwood 
trinket boxes, a pale blue Wedgwood Jasper cameo pin, dessert dishes and Minton 
bone china tea sets and headed back to London . . . grateful that we didn't 
have to carry our purchases onto an airplane. GUIDEBOOK

DESTINATION: GERMANY; ISLAND PLAYGROUND IN THE NORTH SEA; WITH FAIRY-TALE 
VILLAGES, CRYSTAL AIR AND WIDE UNSPOILED BEACHES, FOHR HAS CHARMED GERMANS FOR 
CENTURIES BUT IS LARGELY UNKNOWN TO AMERICANS

 The Don of Canterbury himself met us at the ferry that dropped us in Wyk on 
the North Frisian island of Fohr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to Fohr," said the Don's companion, Chrystl Flugare, greeting us 
warmly. "Did you know, by the way, that there are more Fohrians in the United 
States today than remain here on the island?" This native imbalance was news to 
us. However the Don -- actually a sturdy, off-white Scottish terrier -- barked 
in vigorous corroboration, shaking himself for emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
 Flugare, a Hamburg hotelier and an old friend, had invited my husband Bill and 
me to spend a few days on Fohr (pronounced Fur ) , in the North Sea off 
Germany's west coast, to experience the island's unspoiled natural beauty and 
spectacular bird life, as well as its healthy, invigorating climate and unique 
architectural charms. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawn by the sea air and Fohr's bracing breezes, Danish King Christian VIII 
spent his summers on the isle from 1842 to 1847, along with his 100-odd 
entourage. Hans Christian Andersen and Johann Strauss also whiled away the 
weeks at Wyk. The Waltz King's Nordseebilder waltzes were penned in a small 
house on Wyk's boardwalk in 1879, between beach hikes and cafe forays, no 
doubt. Today, Fohr is visited largely by Germans (many from nearby Hamburg and 
from Berlin) as well as neighboring Danes and the Dutch. They and others come 
to the island in search of a quiet, no-hassle summer and early fall vacation 
filled with clean air, abundant animal life and low prices in an unspoiled 
natural setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Flugare drove us through Wyk's harbor on the island's southeast corner, with 
its colorful melange of weather-beaten shrimp cutters, tidy yachts and yawls. 
On the deck of one vessel sat a fisherman amid long, grayish, rectangular nets 
overflowing with tiny pink North Sea shrimp, called krabben, the local 
delicacy. Plump, white and woolly sheep grazed on the inland side of the 
ancient 25-foot dike encircling most of the island -- a descendant of the 
original sea wall built in 1492 after a great flood. In the distance on gentle 
inland slopes were dozens of gyrating electricity-generating metallic white 
windmills, looking for all the world like giant tai chi devotees. Our 
comfortable apartment was in a two-story, russet-roofed, red brick building 
behind a blooming screen of white beach lilies and wild roses, off the south 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 One look at the spectacular sight from our living room windows and we 
congratulated ourselves on being there. Framed by tall beach pines was a wide 
expanse of beach interspersed with delicate turquoise rills of sea water. 
Beyond was the indigo blue North Sea topped with a shimmering, silvery sky 
dotted with clouds in perpetual motion. The sand flats or wattenmeer (literally 
"cotton sea"), as the Germans call it, surrounds the North Frisian isles. They 
are a part of Germany's largest national park. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Don ("Doni" to his friends) explored sandcastles, we dug our toes 
deep into the inviting sand, gradually imbibing Fohr's special atmosphere and 
light. The late September air we inhaled was cool, crisp, crystal clear -- the 
stuff of which the island's reputation as a health resort was built. In fact, 
Wyk -- Fohr's main village and only port -- was already a kur-ort or spa and 
bathing resort in 1819, well before Christian VIII's first royal visit. And 
there are still local kur hotels that offer something like the 19th-Century 
Victorian cure: a regimen of massages, mud packs, salt water inhalations and 
saunas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The beach, strewn with old-fashioned wicker beach baskets in rainbow stripes 
and shaded with varicolored awnings, mirrored a scene out of "Death in Venice." 
We walked along the wattenmeer gathering seashells, tiny snails and other 
fauna. The light around us changed constantly from soft gray to pale blue to 
dark gray and, unexpectedly, to a luminous pinkish mauve as the clouds hastened 
past and the sun's last rays blazed through. This light show, peculiar to the 
North Sea, infiltrated Dutch paintings such as Vermeer's and suffuses Emil 
Nolde's colorful, often careening art. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the narrow, flag-adorned mittelbrucke (or middle bridge) pier is Wyk's 
picturesque main street. The boardwalk is separated from the beach by islands 
of low sea grass, elms and beach pines. Its outdoor cafes, chic boutiques and 
emporiums with souvenirs and clothing made of local wool are housed in low, 
white-gabled and balconied red brick edifices. 
</P>
<P>
 Flugare took us for a ride the next morning. Doni accompanied us, occasionally 
emitting his own, inimitable sightseeing insights. 
</P>
<P>
 Fohr is a roundish oval about 7 1/2 miles long by 5 miles wide, of sandy 
moraine and alluvial marsh. Because it lies inside the other North Frisian 
isles of Amrum and Sylt, closer to Germany's Schleswig-Holstein coast, Fohr is 
somewhat protected from North Sea storms. From afar, Fohr's small villages look 
like miniature woodlands encircling fairy-tale thatched-roof houses. Amrum's 
red lighthouse and the spire of Nieblum's St. Johannis church loom above the 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Nieblum is known as the prettiest village in Germany's Schleswig-Holstein's 
state. On both sides of its cobblestone main street are delightful Frisian 
houses of pink brick or white stone. Their overhanging, olive-tone thatched 
roofs are rounded, lending structures the look of awkward, plump, yet somehow 
endearing dumplings. The window frames and doors, painted blue, sport carvings 
of whales, whaling ships and an occasional windmill over an arched doorway. 
Entwined in the white pocket fences bracketing the homes, when we were there 
last September, were red and pink roses, giant dahlias and fuchsias in bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 The whales and nautical symbols, Flugare explained, go back to Fohr's "Golden 
Age" from 1600 to 1800, when seafaring and whale-hunting were the island's 
chief occupations. In 1760 there were only 64 sea captains on Fohr. A decade 
later, more than 150 Fohrian captains commanded Dutch, Danish and Hanseatic 
whaling expeditions. Setting out in late February for the Greenland region, 
they were joined by more than a third of Fohr's population of 4,500. All that 
ended about 1800 when the Napoleonic wars and conflicts between England and 
Denmark effectively halted sea commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Fohrians emigrated over the next decades (and again after both 
World Wars) for economic and political reasons. By the mid-19th Century, 
particularly after gold was discovered in California, 70% of the able-bodied 
men, followed by 30% of the women, left the isle. That's why you'll find more 
Fohrians overseas, especially in America, than here, Flugare said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Nieblum's meeri , or pond, dozens of green-headed mallards, mottled ducks, 
black scoters and gaggles of bean geese and eider ducks strolled along the 
water's edge, dove in or sunned themselves on the grass. The more enterprising 
and hungrier birds took nourishment from the hands of several giggling 
toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Don barked energetically as we drove further west toward Gotting Kliff. 
Looking up, we saw an arc of black and white lapwings, eider and gray plover 
winging overhead. A 27-foot high, one-mile long promontory, Gotting Kliff was 
formed by the wind and water depositing stones, boulders and sand ashore, then 
withdrawing their bounty. From Gotting's peak we gazed down on the wild and 
beautiful rock-strewn beach and the giant boulders shouldering the shore. 
Black-and-white Holsteins and the rarer brown-and-white Frisian cattle grazed 
on the marshy pastures beyond the Kliff. The other side of the road was aglow 
with yellow rape fields: Rape oil is used as a gasoline substitute on 
environmentally correct Fohr. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The North Frisian islands extend from Denmark to the Netherlands along 
Europe's west coast. Politically and culturally the islands seesawed back and 
forth between German and Danish influence until 1864, when the Prussian dukes 
of Schleswig-Holstein claimed the North Frisians for themselves. The Fohrian 
dialect is closer to English than to German, Danish or Dutch. The name Fohr is 
supposedly derived from the Frisian dialect word feer (dry land) -- a dry 
haven, indeed, the isle must have seemed to the Vikings who wandered south down 
the North Sea in the 9th and 10th Centuries to settle there. 
</P>
<P>
 In Witsum, founded during the Middle Ages as were most of the isle's villages, 
we stopped at Joe's Smoke Barrel to buy smoked eel -- another local treat. "My 
father, my grandfather and his father were all fishermen here," said Joe, whose 
last name we never learned. "The men in the family went whaling in the 1700s. 
They made a good living." Fohr's chief industries today include dairy farming, 
mining of sea salt and fishing for mackerel, eel and mussels. 
</P>
<P>
 After lunch on Wyk's boardwalk (scrumptious krabben soup), we rested briefly 
in our apartment. Our quarters included a cozy bedroom, spacious bathroom and 
combination living/dining room and kitchen, with the homey comforts of a VCR, 
dishwasher and microwave. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning with Hamburg hotelier and restaurateur Helge Walter, 
Flugare's longtime companion and our old friend, we were back in Nieblum at the 
13th-Century St. Johannis Kirche. 
</P>
<P>
 In the church cemetery, among bittersweet and blooming impatiens, are more 
than 260 tombstones dating from the 17th to the 19th Century. Some are adorned 
with elaborate Baroque designs, others bear biblical illustrations. Three 
windmills seemingly at full tilt mark miller Hans Christiansen's grave. Capt. 
Karsten Karstens (1687-1763), one of many high-ranking seamen interred there, 
is symbolized by a whaling ship with sails furled, indicating that he died at a 
ripe old age. The full sails on Capt. Peter Peterson's tomb denote that he 
expired young. 
</P>
<P>
 From Osterland (Fohr's eastern portion) we continued to Westerland (the isle's 
western part) and paid a visit to St. Laurenti's church, also of Romanesque 
origin. After admiring a glorious 15th-Century altar piece housing 12 saints, 
we went in search of Fohr's most famous citizen, Matthias Petersen or Peter 
Matthies, born in Oldsum in 1632. Matthias captured 14 whales on a single 
voyage and a total of 373 before he retired -- as explained on his tombstone -- 
earning him the nickname "Matthias the Fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Lunching outdoors at Kleines Helgoland near Wyk's marina, we watched Elfriede, 
a spiffy two-masted ketch glide out of the bay as two loaded shrimpers came in. 
Later we walked along the footpath on the flat, narrow ridge of the ancient 
seawall that meanders around most of the isle. 
</P>
<P>
 A whale bone archway leads to Wyk's Frisian Folklore Museum. The replica of a 
captain's cabin aboard ship, in the extensive whaling exhibit, reminded us of 
the captain's house in Oldsum. One imagined generations of whalers sitting and 
rocking in the chairs by the fire in the pesel or parlor reproduced nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening we dined superbly at Altes Pastorat, a charming, 300-year-old 
former manse, now an inn and restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, walking on the beach, the full moon's midnight rays illuminated our 
path among the sandcastles and old-fashioned wicker beach baskets. The Don 
emitted a great sigh . . . of contentment? Our sentiments, exactly. GUIDEBOOK

TAKING THE KIDS: HOOKED ON TIDE POOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Look, there's a starfish," Reggie said excitedly, pointing alongside the 
slippery rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found the first crab," Matt said triumphantly. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids gently touched the sticky sea anemones, making them close up like 
bumps on the rock. They splashed a barnacle and watched it open. They found 
snails and chitons clinging to the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The adventure was all the better because they were making these discoveries 
for themselves, not in an aquarium -- though those are plenty fun -- but in 
natural tide pools along the seashore at a nearly deserted Oregon beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tide pools are made for kids. They flock to them like video arcades," said 
Paul Erickson, a New England Aquarium biologist who developed a series of 
educational television programs on tide pools and beachcombing that have been 
used in schools across the country. (Teachers can call the New England Aquarium 
for information about the programs at 617-973-5200.) 
</P>
<P>
 For the uninitiated, tide pools are small rocky pockets along the ocean that 
hold the salt water in when the tide goes out. Some are small, others large. 
Entire communities of sea life live in these tide pools -- sponges, snails, sea 
slugs, jelly fish, mussels and even octopuses. They're an amazing array of 
colors, shapes and sizes: purple sea urchins, red starfish, green anemones. At 
low tide, they're brimming with sea life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tide pools are a world-class wilderness adventure in microcosm," said 
Erickson. "You don't have to go to Alaska or Costa Rica. It's amazing what 
you'll find right here." 
</P>
<P>
 Tide pools are anywhere there's a rocky ocean coast: at Acadia National Park 
in Maine or Olympic National Park in Washington; at Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro 
or farther north at Carpinteria State Beach, just south of Santa Barbara, and 
at Asilomar Beach in Santa Cruz. We found the best tide pools we had ever seen 
just south of Newport at Seal Rock State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Fall and even early winter are great times to explore tide pools, the experts 
say. "The crowds are gone," Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even better, this is one family outing that doesn't cost anything nor does it 
require more than an afternoon. Just make sure to wear sneakers, bring extra 
clothes (the kids are likely to get wet) and a first-aid kit. Check the tides 
(low tide is the best), grab a pocket tide pool guidebook for the region and 
head out to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Tide-pooling is also a great way to get the kids excited about science. 
"Science is about looking at the world and making connections," said Gary 
Widdison, a former California science teacher who now produces interactive 
science videos for Los Angeles schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "If kids can experience science for themselves, those are the lessons they 
retain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many marine scientists were first hooked on the ocean by exploring tide pools 
as kids, Erickson said, adding that reading the Eyewitness series book could be 
helpful: "The Seashore" by Steve Parker (Knopf, $12.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Take time to visit an aquarium so everyone will recognize what they are 
seeing. Both the New England Aquarium in Boston and the Oregon Coast Aquarium 
in Newport, for example, have state-of-the-art tide pool exhibits and touch 
pools. The Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro and the Sea Center at Stearns 
Wharf in Santa Barbara also have large touch pools.  
</P>
<P>
 But don't be deterred if there's not a tide pool around. Any sandy beach can 
prove to be fertile exploring territory, Erickson said. His own childhood 
explorations along the Long Island and New Jersey coasts ultimately steered him 
toward a career in science. "We stuck our heads underwater with a snorkel. and 
we were there for two weeks," looking at tiny fish, crabs and seaweed. "I got 
hooked on science right there." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tide-pooling also is a way to teach children respect for all living 
creatures," Erickson said. "They won't find cuddly things here, but all kinds 
of strange creatures that they might even have trouble believing are alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Because tide pools are full of living creatures, it's important to teach 
children "tide pool etiquette," as well as some safety rules before heading 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocks are slippery and huge waves can sneak up. "If it's a rough day, don't go 
near the water," Erickson said. Leave before the tide comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't let the kids take any of the sea creatures home. This will kill the 
creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Widdison uses the one-finger rule with his five kids: Only touch a sea 
creature with one finger. Never rip a snail or other animal from the rocks. Be 
gentle, he advises, and teach the children to leave everything the way they 
found it. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the Kids appears weekly.

DESTINATION: NEW HAMPSHIRE; CLOUD COVER; HILLTOP MANSION ELEVATES THE TOURIST 
SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SILK, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shoe magnate Thomas G. Plant once wrote, with considerable understatement, 
that his New Hampshire hideaway was "an estate for a man who enjoys big 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's no denying that his dream home, now a tourist attraction known as 
Castle in the Clouds, was built on an epic scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, atop a 1,300-foot-high hilltop overlooking the vast confusion of 
island-dotted bays and waterways that form Lake Winnipesaukee, Plant built his 
stately pleasure dome, his Xanadu. Using granite stones and oak beams, a small 
army of artisans labored three years to build the multimillionaire an eagle's 
nest of a home, a place where he and his new wife could sit, quite literally, 
on top of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant has long since gone to meet his maker, but his rock-solid, castle-like 
home still stands. And for the hundreds of lowlanders who flock daily to the 
home Plant called Lucknow (after the former Indian capital of the nabobs of 
Oudh) and to the thousands of acres of woods and mountains that surround it, 
Castle in the Clouds is a peak experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, at the edge of an ancient volcano, amid the highest peaks in the Ossipee 
Mountains, the views are as expansive as anything you'd get from a flying 
carpet. From Castle in the Clouds, you might survey the green forests of 
Moultonborough Neck, the hamlet of Melvin or the hummock on Rattlesnake Island. 
Then there's Little Wortleberry Island, Far Ozone Island and Little Bear 
Island, to name a few. The Belknap Mountains rise on the southern horizon, 
distinguished by Gunstock, striped with ski trails. 
</P>
<P>
 At the high end of the twisting road that switchbacks upward to the castle, 
visitors can tour the old mansion, saddle up for rides through the mountains, 
hike to waterfalls and dramatic lookouts or toss handfuls of Purina Trout Chow 
to the giant rainbows that thrum in the waters of Shannon Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 The castle itself is the biggest draw. Once off the Jeep-drawn tram that 
ferries visitors to the mansion, crowds gawk at the sturdy stone edifice Plant 
moved into in 1914. The millionaire, who began working a menial job in a shoe 
factory at the age of 13, showed such ingenuity and creativity that he owned 
the business by the age of 27. He soon purchased additional factories and, 
after amassing a fortune, retired at the age of 50 and began planning his home 
in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Castle in the Clouds' granite building blocks are shaped like 
pentagons, the five points representing the five major world powers in the 
years preceding World War I. It reportedly took a stonemason a full day to 
shape and lay three stones; at one point Plant employed about 1,000 
stonecutters. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, a self-guided tour leads through the old kitchen and pantry, the 
dining room, the game room, the bedrooms, baths and the library. And in true 
castle tradition, there's even a secret room, reached by a small hidden door. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic library, guarded by a pair of huge winged griffins carved from a 
block of mahogany, is filled with Napoleonic memorabilia -- statues, portraits, 
prints of the emperor leading his troops into battle, a scene from his marriage 
to Austrian Archduchess Marie Louise. Besides a knack for empire building, 
Plant and Napoleon shared a height of about 5 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs, Plant's bedroom on the east side of the house is sited to afford 
perfect views of the sun rising over Bald Knob, the rocky point framed by his 
window. His wife's west-side bedroom provided a strategic lookout on the 
setting sun. In between was a breakfast nook with a romantic balcony. Today, 
the second-story walkway is a popular spot for newlyweds posing for pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Castle in the Clouds hosts weddings almost weekly; it's hard to imagine a more 
romantic spot to tie the knot. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant's old home has taken on a new luster over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive oak arbor was rebuilt, the floors restored and the walls painted. 
In fact, efforts to restore the property's former grandeur are visible all over 
the estate -- in miles of new post-and-rail fence ringing pastures for the 
horses, in new walkways and picnic areas and, most of all, in the new plant 
constructed to bottle the crystalline waters bubbling up out of numerous 
springs on Faraway Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 The water gushing toward the plant and into plastic bottles rises in a 
sheltered, sandy-bottomed cistern about a mile away. The waters -- more than 
100 gallons per minute -- swirl through the sand like transparent tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring is one of many rising in the volcanic stone of the Ossipees; 
Plant's property comprises the entire watershed for many of the springs that 
gurgle to the surface on the grounds of his former estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the water pooled in the rock-walled cistern is then channeled toward 
the bottling plant via an underground pipeline. The excess gushes into a small 
reservoir, then begins its slow descent toward Winnipesaukee. The gently 
burbling flow is joined by a host of other spring-born tributaries as it 
tumbles along the course of a rocky brook. 
</P>
<P>
 The chorus of watery voices culminates at the Falls of Song, a popular 
sightseeing spot on the castle grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The pure spring waters that drew the new owners -- Castle Springs, LP -- were 
also part of what lured Plant to this part of the world after searching all of 
North America and Europe for the perfect home site. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant harnessed the springs to provide his own water supply. He and his wife, 
Olive, drank it and bathed in it. It also fueled Plant's bizarre bathing 
contraption -- a shower in which the bather stood encircled by steel rings. At 
the twist of a lever, the shower-taker was bombarded by jets of water bursting 
forth with 70 pounds of pressure. The sprays were said to hit the bather's skin 
like a rain of needles. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottlers hope the spring water's fame will one day eclipse the mansion's, 
and so they have changed the name of the Plant's former estate to Castle 
Springs; the home is still called Castle in the Clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors are invited to tour the springs, visit the bottling factory for a 
peek at the operation, watch a brief video about the springs and an exhibit 
about water and the local geology. Just in case you work up a thirst, free 
samples are dispensed to visitors. GUIDEBOOK

 MADISON AVE. LOSS: It's a busy time at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in 
Santa Ana. Tonight it holds its major fund-raiser in its courtyard -- with a 
$100,000 goal -- and Sunday it opens two new exhibits, California 
Impressionists and a separate collection of portraits and still lifes. . . . 
The museum has also completed a major task, finding a name for its upcoming 
children's museum. Chosen was "Kidseum," through a local children's contest. 
Says spokesman Brian Langston: "We could have spent $100,000 on Madison Avenue 
and not come up with one better!" 
</P>
<P>
 NOT JUST A STROLL: If you see a few hundred people walking around Lake Mission 
Viejo today, they're not just checking out available real estate. Their "Walk 
Around the Lake" is to raise funds for ovarian cancer research. . . . Anybody 
can join in -- 10:30 a.m. start, minimum donation of $15 -- and if you can't 
last the three miles, there's a "sag" wagon to provide relief. 
</P>
<P>
 BACK AT IT: Since his playing days ended 20 years ago, Los Angeles Rams Hall 
of Famer Deacon Jones -- part of the "Fearsome Foursome" -- has remained 
loosely associated with football. But now, he says, "that old flame is 
ignited." . . . . Jones is in his first year on the Rams' radio broadcast team 
(KMPC-AM). Says Jones, who will share analyst duties with Jack Snow at today's 
game in Atlanta (C2): "Now I'm down in the locker room, I'm at practice, 
traveling with the team -- it's just like the old days, really." 
</P>
<P>
 CHEAP GAME? If you think it just costs too much to take in a Rams game at 
Anaheim Stadium, it's still cheaper than most places in the National Football 
League. Team Marketing in Chicago has put out its annual football attendance 
cost figures, ranking the Rams only the 16th most expensive out of 28 teams. . 
. . Four people can gets sodas, beer, hot dogs, parking, tickets and a program 
for $178. The same deal at the L.A. Coliseum for the Raiders would cost you 
$201. Most expensive: San Francisco, at $236. Cheapest: Green Bay, at $151.

SISTER PARISH; KENNEDYS' INTERIOR DESIGNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sister Parish, the venerated interior designer whose career took her from 
housewife and mother to a one-room New Jersey business and then on to 
refurbishing the White House for the Kennedys, has died at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Parish died Thursday at her home in Dark Harbor, Me., after a lengthy 
illness, said her daughter, Dorothy B. Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 During her six decades in the business, Mrs. Parish became not only the grande 
dame of American interior decorating but a symbol of success to professional 
women nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Kennedys, she worked for many of America's best-known 
families: the Astors, Mellons, Rockefellers, Vanderbilts and Whitneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Parish was "the most famous of all living women interior decorators . . . 
(her) ideas have influenced lifestyles all over America," Vogue magazine once 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Her business started in a one-room office at a farmhouse in Far Hills, N.J., 
and evolved into the pricey Manhattan-based Parish-Hadley Associates. (Her 
partner had been Albert Hadley.) 
</P>
<P>
 Born Dorothy May Kinnicut in Morristown, N.J., she was dubbed Sister as a 
child and the name stuck. Her interest in decorating was first aroused by a 
visit to Paris, where she was impressed by painted French furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 She married Wall Street stockbroker Henry Parish in 1930 and moved to Far 
Hills, where she was a wife and mother before establishing her firm, which she 
originally called "Mrs. Henry Parish 2nd Interiors." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House was her biggest coup. She had met Jacqueline Kennedy in the 
late 1950s and redecorated the Georgetown home she shared with then-Sen. John 
F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kennedy became President, Mrs. Kennedy named Mrs. Parish as a consultant 
in redecorating the White House and placed her on a committee to furnish it 
with 19th-Century pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Parish -- whose father collected antiques that she called "awful English 
brown," was a champion of the American country style, which dovetailed with 
Mrs. Kennedy's wishes. The First Lady was a person of "simple tastes who wants 
to create a home," Mrs. Parish said.

MAST HYSTERIA; TALL SHIPS' ARRIVAL TURNS LANDLUBBERS INTO OLD SALTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Cannons popping and sails billowing, a slice of 19th-Century nautical history 
cruised into Dana Point Harbor Saturday in a coastal celebration of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 This annual festival of tall ships led by Orange County's brig Pilgrim seemed 
a tailor-made event for kids such as 3-year-old "Pirate" Perry Waldman and 
41-year-old Bob "Silverbeard" Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 For Waldman, a fan of Captain Hook and the Treasure Island Hotel in Las Vegas, 
the harbor scene on the grounds of the Orange County Marine Institute proved an 
exciting venue to unsheathe his plastic sword, rub shoulders with "real" 
pirates and pal around with a young girlfriend he called "Shark Bait." 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I knew this was going on here, I knew I had to bring Perry," said 
the youngster's dad, Robert Waldman. "He loves the tall ships. As young as he 
is, I really think he enjoys the romance of all this." 
</P>
<P>
 How else could anyone explain the appearance of Chandler? 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in period clothing, a long machete safely tucked in his belt, 
"Silverbeard" walked the grounds carrying what he claimed was the skull of his 
mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 "She don't eat much. She don't nag much. I'd say she's damn near perfect," he 
said, thrusting the gray plastic figure closer to one tourist. 
</P>
<P>
 Never straying from character, the Riverside resident said he's been a pirate 
"all me life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Aye, it's the fantasy of it," he said. "It is another time, another place. 
For me it's an escape." 
</P>
<P>
 The colorful nautical theme touched nearly every display at the festival. From 
fish T-shirts, paintings and scrimshaw, the celebration even featured a 
miniature dolphin merry-go-round. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the real stars of the day were the graceful vessels bearing the names 
Hawaiian Chieftain, Swift of Ipswich, Pilgrim of Newport, Kelpie, Spike of 
Africa, Red Witch, Curlew and Witch of Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched in April, 1979, the Witch of Wood is the creation of Capt. Stan 
Pietrucki, whose fascination with tall ships began when, as a child, he built 
boats "to float through mud puddles." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I just kept building them bigger and bigger," said Pietrucki, 
standing before his biggest "model" yet. "It's madness, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 All of 61 feet and 35 tons, the Witch of Wood took Pietrucki 17 years to build 
and it has since become a permanent home for him and his wife. From the dock, 
the fine-lined schooner looks like a relic from a bygone time, but below deck 
the Pietruckis enjoy most of the modern conveniences. 
</P>
<P>
 There are tiled sinks and a high-tech radio system in the cabin, a microwave 
in the galley and a step-down shower in the head. "I don't think you'll see 
that in many of these ships," Pietrucki said, pointing his land-loving guest 
toward the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the armada assembled Saturday in Dana Point Harbor, the Witch of Wood might 
be the smallest. But Pietrucki -- his salt-and-pepper hair pulled into a short 
ponytail -- said his eight cannons "pack a pretty big bite." 
</P>
<P>
 "We operate this as a pirate vessel," he said, preparing for launch. "It's a 
totally different lifestyle. I don't have a garage to store a bunch of stuff. 
But it's the freedom we enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Chris Fox of Dana Point, a crew member on the Witch: "This is a throwback 
to a great age. It is a lifestyle that doesn't conform to the normal rules of 
life. A sailor's life is confined to the ship, but the wide-open expanses of 
the ocean is your world." 
</P>
<P>
 By noon Saturday, the coastal hillsides in South County were dotted with 
people who had gathered to watch the graceful procession of vessels set out to 
join another group at Aliso Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the fleet made the turn back to Dana Point, dozens of pleasure boats 
joined the parade back to the harbor, some sounding their horns. 
</P>
<P>
 While the ships were at sea and briefly out of sight, artist Gregory Lincoln 
was displaying his works, a number of which included paintings of the same tall 
ships about to return to port. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ships are really the attraction here," Lincoln said, dressed in a 
long-sleeved mariner's shirt and cap. "People can't see this everyday. It's 
part of the history and romance of the so-called good ol' days."

SAWDUST FIRE TOUGH TO GET OUT; COMBUSTION: A FIRE CAPTAIN SAYS THE SMOKY, 
SMELLY OUTDOOR BLAZE COULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED EASIER IF PILES OF WOOD CHIPS HAD 
BEEN SEPARATED. BUT NOW IT COULD BE BURNING FOR QUITE AWHILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Flames up to 100 feet high whipped through piles of wood chips at a sawdust 
plant across from the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station Saturday, creating a 
plume of smoke visible across the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters said the blaze started Friday afternoon and by Saturday had 
consumed about two of the six acres of chips blanketing the Golden Coast 
Sawdust Products Inc. property off Irvine Boulevard, which was closed for much 
of the day between Sand Canyon Avenue and Alton Parkway. No injuries were 
reported, and there was no damage to structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fires like this can go for weeks sometimes," Orange County Fire Capt. Dan 
Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 County and El Toro Marine firefighters used bulldozers to carve corridors 
through the mounds of wood chips, piled as high as 50 feet, in hopes of keeping 
the flames from spreading into unburned sections. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire would have been easier to control had the mounds of wood been 
separated into smaller piles, as required by fire codes, Young said. The plant 
was in compliance with codes during a fire-safety inspection earlier this year, 
although warnings have been issued in the past to keep mounds separated, Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the fire, which might have started through spontaneous 
combustion, posed no danger Saturday to nearby base housing, plant nurseries or 
avocado groves. Fire officials received hundreds of calls from residents 
throughout the county who smelled smoke, Young said. At one point early 
Saturday, thick smoke spread by shifting winds triggered smoke detectors in 
many nearby Marine base homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighbors expressed concern about the possibility of the fire's burning 
for days. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Jurack, a sixth-grade teacher at El Toro Marine School, feared that 
smoke and ash could disrupt classes. That has happened before from other fires 
in the area, including one at a fertilizer plant, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely going to affect our school," he said. "You can smell it for 
miles. . . . I can't imagine that even wood burning is going to be healthful." 
</P>
<P>
 Company employees detected the fire at about 4 p.m. Friday and attempted to 
put it out themselves. The County Fire Department was called in after midnight 
to the unincorporated area when the fire was clearly out of control, Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we would have been called eight hours earlier, we could have really 
minimized the damage," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant grinds wood into chips and compost fertilizer. Smaller fires are 
relatively common in such deep wood chip piles, Young said. Typically plant and 
other organic materials buried below the wood decompose, generating heat that 
sparks flames. The deeper the pile, the more chance that enough heat will be 
trapped to set off a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you only know it's burning by smoldering smoke on the surface," 
Young said.  
</P>
<P>
 Plant owner David Braga could not be reached for comment. The cause of the 
fire is under investigation, Young said.

UCI AWAITING OFFICIAL WORD ON DIRECTION; EDUCATION: ANTICIPATION RUNS HIGH AS 
CHANCELLOR WILKENING PREPARES TO UNVEIL HER VISION FOR ENHANCING UNIVERSITY'S 
FUTURE IN AN ERA OF BELT-TIGHTENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the end of the academic year, professors, librarians, lecturers and 
other members of the UCI community have been anticipating word from Chancellor 
Laurel L. Wilkening about the fate and direction of their university during an 
era of financial belt-tightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, they'll get an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening, the third person to head the sprawling Irvine campus since it was 
opened in 1965, will break her silence Friday when she unveils her blueprint 
for UCI's future -- a future that includes doing more with less, with a goal of 
enhancing the university's academic stature. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI must cut about $10 million from the upcoming academic year's budget, 
according to UCI spokeswoman Karen Newell Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the summer, administrators began looking for budget cuts in each of the 
university's departments to reach that mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the cuts, officials propose slashing nearly $5 million from a budget of 
about $155 million for academic affairs, research and graduate studies; about 
$1.4 million in spending cuts were found in the administrative and business 
services' budget of about $25 million; and about $1.3 million in cutbacks was 
found in the student affairs' budget of about $16 million, according to campus 
budget planners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to keep cuts far from research and instruction," said Roy 
Dormaier, assistant executive vice chancellor for research management and 
analysis. The proposed cuts take a larger bite out of administrative budgets 
than out of those that pay for professors or library hours, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The university's total operating budget -- including state, student and 
outside money -- will be about $600 million this year, Dormaier said. Officials 
usually can only cut from areas funded by state money and student fees, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI isn't alone in its budget-cutting woes. Between the nine campuses in the 
University of California system and its administrative offices, about $433 
million was cut between 1990 and 1993 -- including $80 million at UCLA, $67 
million at UC Berkeley and more than $25 million at UCI, according to UC 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The coming budget cutbacks are expected to lead to fewer university positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a lot of cuts around here, and people are fearing they're 
going to lose their jobs," UCI Associated Graduate Students president Bob 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days are taking their toll, in terms of campuswide morale and attitude 
about work," said Elizabeth Newcomb, volunteer coordinator with Student Health 
Services, which may face some changes in the future. "Yes, it's beautiful here, 
and the '80s were an enthusiastic time. But now times are tough and a lot of 
people are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 After a summer of anticipation, some university employees think it's about 
time that Wilkening makes known her vision and direction for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does seem to me the time has come for the chancellor to speak up," English 
and comparative literature professor John Rowe said. "There's sort of a general 
sense in the community that the chancellor has not taken a public position on 
many issues." 
</P>
<P>
 But still, many don't expect her to announce immediate and drastic changes for 
the university Friday. She's expected by some to restrict herself to trimming 
programs that were singled out for cutbacks by UCI faculty and staff members 
studying UCI's structure. And she has hinted that she will refocus the 
university's efforts on raising UCI's national profile as a research 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening's report will be the climax to a series of steps that officials 
began taking to slim down UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year ago, two task forces of administrators, professors and other 
UCI employees gathered to take a closer look at the university. Their mission? 
Identify the policies and programs that should be changed to make UCI a better 
institution in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The task forces alarmed many students, staff members and faculty members when 
they released the reports on their findings in February. Some of their 
recommendations included closing the education, physical education and 
comparative culture departments. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI graduate students, managers, instructors and others debated the reports 
for months on electronic mail. Many in and around the UCI community wrote 
administrators to defend programs, especially the education department. 
</P>
<P>
 By June, the Academic Planning Council -- a third group of UCI representatives 
-- digested more than 700 written responses and came up with their 
recommendations for Wilkening. The panel's vision: making UCI one of the top 30 
research institutions in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 They recommended saving the education program, which drew sighs of relief from 
UCI educators. But they have heard nothing official from the chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a small issue for us," said Carol Booth Olson, coordinator of 
the UCI Writing Project. "Our jobs and reputations were on the line. We're all 
keenly interested in what she (Wilkening) has to say." 
</P>
<P>
 While students, faculty and staff members discussed the reports, some of the 
university's most celebrated teachers accepted wide-scale early retirement 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
 The deans of fine arts, undergraduate studies and physical sciences, as well 
as the founding chairman of the chemistry department, retired July 1 as part of 
a systemwide program that offered employees incentives for early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third round of buyouts for faculty and staff members, and it meant 
a saving of about $7.8 million in salaries -- even though some of the 
professors are returning to teach part-time, UCI officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 75 faculty members left as part of the buyout, including two of nine 
professors in the comparative culture department, six of about 45 professors in 
the English and comparative literature department, and three of about 15 
faculty members in the Spanish and Portuguese department. Some professors fear 
the positions won't be filled or that part-time instructors will teach many 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, people react more acutely if a program is closed," comparative 
culture professor Raul Fernandez said. "But there's an army (of faculty) 
leaving the campuses. . . . The faculty that are left have more work to do. 
They have more graduate students and larger classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Wilkening will get her turn to talk about improving the university's 
fortunes and succeeding despite cuts in student services, faculty and 
management. She is expected to talk about attracting more research grants to 
UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the critical things is enhancing research stature," UCI spokeswoman 
Karen Newell Young said. "It would help financially support other priority 
areas," such as undergraduate education. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said money entering the university because of grants could help enhance 
UCI's image, attracting better professors and graduate students and attracting 
money from donors as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only way we can fund initiatives without more money than the state's 
willing to spend," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some faculty members are concerned about the direction the University of 
California will take in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The university is being reorganized to mirror what a large corporation is 
like," said comparative culture professor Gilbert Gonzalez, whose department 
was recommended for closure by the task forces. "Rather than students being the 
people the institution serves, they're consumers. Education has become the 
product." 
</P>
<P>
 Interested students are awaiting and debating the direction of the campus, and 
opinions differ about where UCI should be headed in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a second-year student in the Graduate School of Management, said he 
looks forward to change, but thinks it will be difficult to alter the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the chancellor intends to do things to improve the university; I have 
no doubts her motives are good," Miller said. "But we have a huge dinosaur 
here, and if it doesn't want to change, how do you make it change?" College 
Cuts 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's vice chancellors, working with administrators of the university's 
various departments, have come up with $10 million in budget cuts for the 
upcoming academic year. The cuts worked out this way, with rounded amounts in 
millions: 04,40,08,06,07 Campus area Budget Cut % cut University advancement, 
chancellor, $5.1 $0.3 6% executive vice chancellor Student Affairs and campus 
life 15.6 1.3 8 Administrative and businesses services 24.6 1.4 6 Academic 
affairs* 154.6 4.9 3 UCI Medical Center 9.0 1.6 18 Savings from unspent 
reserves for -- 0.5 -- employee benefits * Includes College of Medicine and 
Research and Graduate Studies 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Total UCI Medical Center budget for 1994-95 is estimated at $150 
million, but taxpayer-funded portion is $9 million. Rest comes from other 
sources.

A CLEAN SLATE; CHAKA SAYS THE NOTORIOUS TAGGER DAYS ARE BEHIND HIM, BUT SOME 
DOUBT HIS SINCERITY 
</P>

 Chaka crouched with a dozen spray cans in front of a wall in the blistering 
heat of the Lancaster desert. With the sweep of his right hand, he shot bold 
black lines on the white surface. It was not graffiti that he sprayed, but a 
biblical scene: Men walking from blackness into a stunning rainbow and a golden 
yellow sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaka, a.k.a. Daniel Bernardo Ramos, was once California's most notorious 
tagger, a Boyle Heights teen-ager who sprayed his moniker in the dark of night 
on 10,000 walls, bridges, freeway signs and lampposts between Oakland and 
Orange County, according to prosecutors. During his two-year spree, cut short 
by arrests and drugs, he was hailed by some as an anti-Establishment hero and 
reviled by others as a monstrous symbol of urban blight. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, at 22, he has been tamed. He lives in an all-male drug rehab center on 
a dusty two-acre flood plain, awakening every day at 4:30 a.m. for prayers. 
Secular books, tape recorders, radios and televisions are forbidden, as are 
cursing, alcohol and visitors. No cars, no phones. His Eastside homeboys and 
tagging partners do not know where he has gone. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also 54 rules of conduct at the center, regulating everything from 
hairstyles to restroom visits during church service. Loudspeakers almost 
constantly blare tapes of zealous religious sermons. Lights go out at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the story of how a young man from a violent housing project got caught 
up in the obsessive narcissism of graffiti vandalism, helped make tagging a 
national phenomenon, and then let his life crash in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also the story about how -- for now -- he is going straight, calling 
himself "The New Chaka," yet still plagued by the wreckage of his teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaka was already an infamous, shadowy figure for his prolific attacks on 
walls and signs when he was first arrested for vandalism four years ago. As so 
often happens in the culture of instant celebrity, his capture catapulted him 
into the klieg lights: There was talk of art shows, posters and T-shirts 
bearing his tag and even movie deals. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, though, it was all downhill. Twenty-four hours after his release, 
Chaka was busted again for tagging a courtroom door. Later, he was arrested for 
possession of marijuana and violating his probation by carrying a marking pen. 
</P>
<P>
 The offers evaporated. He got a 14-year-old girl pregnant. His life dissolved 
into a grab bag of crack cocaine, LSD and angel dust. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Chaka says he has reformed and found God. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came down to the lowest of the darkest pits," he said at an outdoor table 
in the rehab center, speaking softly and haltingly. "I sure don't want to go 
back to that lifestyle again. I refuse. I refuse to be like the dog that runs 
back to eat its own vomit." 
</P>
<P>
 Many will never forgive Chaka for the thousands of dollars of property damage 
that he has wrought. Although he was sentenced to 1,560 hours of graffiti 
cleanup, his subsequent arrests and jail time meant that he never carried it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "My frustration is that the community never really got paid back and I think 
he still owes the community," said Peter Shutan, the former Los Angeles County 
prosecutor who handled Chaka's case. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Ramos' parents arrived in the United States from Costa Rica, settling 
first in Boston and then moving to Los Angeles when Chaka was 4. Bernard Ramos, 
Chaka's father, acknowledges having a drinking problem that sometimes caused 
him to erupt at home. His wife, he and others say, would often get angry and 
hit Chaka and his older brother, David. 
</P>
<P>
 "She blames me; I blame her. We blame each other," said Ramos, 57, a janitor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ramoses settled into the Aliso Village project in Boyle Heights, a 
neighborhood claimed by 14 gangs. The violence, and the threat of it, were 
constant. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, Chaka's teachers asked his parents to consider after-school art 
classes for their boy, a request they could not afford. At 10, Chaka -- 
nicknamed by his friends after a cave boy character on a Saturday morning 
television show called "Land of the Lost" -- began smoking marijuana and angel 
dust. 
</P>
<P>
 The vandalism started one evening when his older brother, a known gang member, 
walked Chaka to a trash bin a block from the neighborhood police station, Chaka 
said. Vigorously shaking a can of red paint, David sprayed his street name, 
"Shaft," and passed the can to his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 With bold, deliberate strokes, the 16-year-old boy spelled out in quivering 
block-like letters: "CHAKA." 
</P>
<P>
 "My adrenaline was pumping; it was a thrill," Chaka said. "And getting away 
with it -- that was too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Chaka had a purpose. David had already told him that he was not 
welcome in his gang, and Chaka did not have the stomach for the violence. Here 
was something that set him apart. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, he says now, a way out of the apartment where his parents fought and 
his brother stowed guns, a way out of a neighborhood where he had been mistaken 
more than once for his brother and shot at. It was peaceful when he stole away 
in the dark of night, usually staying out between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. with a 
knapsack loaded with 15 cans of spray paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no different than an alcoholic," he said. The more he tagged, the more 
he wanted to tag. 
</P>
<P>
 He planned his missions methodically, keeping tabs on a variety of maps. He 
would mark the areas he had struck with one color, and mark future targets in 
another. Lacking a car, he made his forays on bus, collecting a large box of 
bus schedules that told how far he could travel and how late the last bus ran. 
</P>
<P>
 He stole cans of spray paint and locked them in closets at home. "My parents 
didn't say anything," he said. "Before they'd be saying anything, I'd be out 
the door." 
</P>
<P>
 He finished the 11th grade at 17 and dropped out of high school. He had a 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every night, he says, he would take a bus to the end of the line and 
walk through a neighborhood until dawn, strategically painting his name in 
prominent spots along a main artery, busy intersections, or near amusement 
parks or malls that kids cruised. To paint freeway signs he would dangle by a 
leather belt. On any one block, he usually signed his name four times: twice on 
each side of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 He developed two outfits. In the rough, crime-ridden neighborhoods, he wore 
torn Levi's with an army jacket and brown leather work boots. In the 
middle-class neighborhoods -- Pasadena and Altadena, for example -- he donned 
"nice, appropriate jeans," a brand-new casual jacket and dressy shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 If the police spotted him in a well-to-do area, he had a standard response -- 
he was taking the bus home. "I'd bring a small book and go to the bus stop and 
read," he said. "I got so good I could have gone anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 He became, in his own mind, a mysterious super hero speeding through the dark. 
The boy who felt so vulnerable in the projects began to feel invincible on this 
new turf. The prospects of encounters with police only made his missions more 
enticing. 
</P>
<P>
 Older taggers such as Sleez, Whisk and Prime warned Chaka that he would one 
day get caught. They had a saying: "Just as you catch the walls -- they will 
catch you." 
</P>
<P>
 To his astonishment, after two years of full-time tagging, Chaka finally got 
caught plastering his name on a Lincoln Heights traffic light, three months 
after his 18th birthday in late 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't run away," Chaka recalled. "I assumed the cops would let me go 
because I was just a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, police said, he yelled: "I am the famous Chaka!" 
</P>
<P>
 After pleading no contest to 10 counts of vandalism, Chaka spent five months 
in jail and a county mental hospital. His sentence included 1,560 hours of 
graffiti clean-up.  
</P>
<P>
 In the world of taggers, this was the ultimate insult. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't take your name off the wall," said Johnny Odom, director of the 
Aliso Pico Community Center, "because the homeboys are going to think that you 
are crossing yourself out. . . . It'd be suicide in the 'hood. It'd be 
hara-kari." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chaka never did. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 24 hours after being released from jail on probation, he was arrested in 
May, 1991, for allegedly scrawling his name on a courthouse elevator door on 
his way to see his probation officer -- a crime he still says he did not 
commit. Four days later, he was arrested again -- this time for trespassing on 
a city golf course and possession of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of many, he had become an arrogant young man. When Odom asked him 
to remove his moniker from the community center's wall, Chaka demanded to be 
paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
 More drug arrests and more jail time followed. The folk hero hype faded. In 
1992 he returned again to the increasingly violent world of Boyle Heights. His 
brother's gang involvement had escalated. The family's apartment more than once 
was strafed by rival gangs. Chaka, whose face was plastered in police stations, 
could tag no more. 
</P>
<P>
 Hounded by his lost opportunities, he got high almost constantly. He found 
himself ducking bullets fired by his brother's enemies. Outside his home, Chaka 
got shot above his left ankle. From then on, he said, he carried a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 One chilly evening, as Chaka headed home, his brother -- stoned and drunk -- 
mistook him for someone else and opened fire, Chaka and others said. Hearing 
the commotion, Maribel Mora -- then 14 -- peeked out the window. She saw a 
young man, kneeling between cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't dressed like a gangster; he had on brown Dockers," Mora recalled. 
She yelled for him to duck into her family's apartment. Her mother, she said, 
gave Chaka a glass of water and turned to her daughter, saying: " This is the 
famous Chaka; he is going to do something with his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Mora was impressed by Chaka. "To us girls, it was kinda cool -- Chaka, the 
tagger. I know it sounds kinda dumb, but it was like an honor," she said. "I 
didn't know how to watch out for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, Mora learned she was pregnant with Chaka's child. But Chaka 
had little interest in a monogamous relationship with a girl six years his 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every night, I'd be out," he said. "I'd be high, completely loaded. She'd be 
out there with her big stomach looking for me." 
</P>
<P>
 When the baby was born in November, Bernard Ramos kicked open his son's 
bedroom door. "You're nothing but a junkie!" Chaka remembers him shouting. "How 
are you going to support this baby?" 
</P>
<P>
 The worst part about his father's rage, Chaka thought, was that he was right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go to college and I blew it. All these failures weighed my heart 
down," he said. "I was hooked. I was a user." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only five days after the birth of his son, Chaka took the tiny infant to hear 
a street preacher, Joseph (Jojo) Sanchez. Sanchez, informed by a bystander that 
he was talking to a street celebrity, recognized that the youth was strung out. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to be able to change on your own," Sanchez told him. 
Gradually, the two forged a friendship, with Sanchez urging Chaka to visit his 
charismatic, nondenominational rehabilitation program in the Lancaster desert 
-- an invitation that Chaka kept declining. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired of seeing Chaka stoned, Mora told him he could forget about seeing their 
son if he did not stop using drugs. High on PCP, Chaka burst into tears. He 
wept for hours. At 4 a.m., he called Sanchez's program and hysterically 
demanded that he be picked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Rogers, then the office manager, answered the phone. "I thought someone 
was trying to kill him," recalled Rogers. He drove to Aliso Village and got 
Chaka, who was suffering flashbacks and shaking so badly he could scarcely 
speak. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months since, Chaka has gone straight. Yet there is the painful 
reminder of responsibilities he has ignored. His son, Daniel, named after his 
father, is 9 months old. Maribel Mora, now an 11th-grader, is struggling to 
stay in school and work a part-time job. Chaka's piety leaves her cold. She 
wishes he would get a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know somewhere in the Bible, it's got to say something about family," she 
said. "Chaka has left us behind. My baby doesn't have any food; Chaka is just 
doing good for himself. Meanwhile, me and my baby are having a hard time." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaka does not give Mora money for their child because he pays $200 of his 
monthly $211 welfare check to Sanchez for room and board in the program. He is 
not eager to re-enter the outside world. Although he will officially graduate 
from Sanchez's all-male academy in two months, he says now that he intends to 
stay two more years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to help myself before I help others," he said. "This takes time; it 
doesn't take overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 When prosecutor Shutan last saw Chaka a few months ago, the young man was full 
of Bible talk, but Shutan thought his words seemed forced, like mismatched 
jigsaw puzzle pieces. Shutan told Chaka he doubted his sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
 To Shutan, the story of Daniel Bernardo Ramos could still go either way. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, the indications are that he hasn't grown up yet," the prosecutor 
said. "It doesn't appear that he benefited from his 15 minutes of fame. He was 
someone who was desperate for attention -- and got it."

STARTING ANEW; RECOVERY: PASADENA GLEN COUPLE ARE FIRST BURNED-OUT HOUSEHOLD IN 
NEIGHBORHOOD TO MOVE BACK. NEW HOME USES PIECES OF OLD ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While other homeowners burned out by the Altadena firestorm were still 
haggling with insurance companies, sweating out seismic safety tests or 
debating whether to move back to a fire and flood zone at all, Steve and Ellie 
Schindler put the finishing touches on their new home in Pasadena Glen. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the din of bulldozers and construction crews working on flood control 
measures along the winding canyon road, the couple settled into the home that 
rose from the pieces of the old one. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the third homeowners burned out by last year's Altadena fire to move 
back in -- and the first in Pasadena Glen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 27 blaze incinerated 27 of 65 homes in the Glen, a tree-shaded nook 
above Pasadena in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schindlers' new, spacious Tudor-style home will never replace the 15 years 
of memories they had accumulated in the old residence, said Ellie Schindler, 
51, but they saved what pieces they could. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nice thing about the new house is it's got bits of the old house in it," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those items include fireplace bricks, bathroom tiles and segments of the 
foundation that Steve Schindler salvaged from the rubble and had built into the 
new house.  
</P>
<P>
 So now, despite the empty cement bags strewn around the lawn and the pile of 
boxes in her living room, despite the jitters that keep her checking and 
rechecking burners to make sure no sparks catch flame, Ellie Schindler said, 
"It's good to be home." 
</P>
<P>
 Their early return was made possible by a combination of luck and 
perseverance. Early on, it was uncertain whether the county's Department of 
Public Works would allow rebuilding in the Glen at all. But determined to come 
back, Steve Schindler hired an architect anyway, only two weeks after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months later the design plans were done, but there was still the county 
to contend with. Then, on April 12, the Board of Supervisors approved a 
rebuilding plan for the area. Homeowners agreed to install turnarounds for 
emergency vehicles and culverts that would prevent the kind of flood that 
inundated the fire-stripped area in February. A federal grant paid for part of 
that. A local assessment district is charging $500 per household this year to 
cover the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schindlers got their building permit that same day. Two days later, their 
contractor went to work at the stream-side plot. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, they reached a settlement with their insurance company, 
an easy claim compared to those of other homeowners, who are still battling 
over payments. After the fire, many were shocked to learn they weren't covered, 
that their policies lacked replacement cost coverage, had loopholes that 
excluded fire damage or didn't include the cost of meeting stricter building 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, said Fred Mensich of the Disaster Recovery and Preparedness 
Center in Pasadena, only 37 residents -- out of 126 homes destroyed in the 
Altadena fire -- have even applied for building permits. Twenty-one permits 
have been granted, and about a dozen homes are nearing completion. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, the Schindlers are the only ones in the Glen to even begin, 
must less finish, rebuilding. They hope their success will inspire some 
discouraged neighbors to join them. 
</P>
<P>
 A Caltech astrophysicist, Steve Schindler, 54, credits his scientific 
background with providing the philosophical impetus to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're looking at here are engineering problems," he said. "At Caltech we 
solve engineering problems all the time. We're known for that. I never had any 
real doubt we'd move back." 
</P>
<P>
 In October, even before the fire's one-year anniversary, they'll christen 
their home with a family reunion, bringing in relatives from Alaska to Florida. 
After their grandchildren have happily left their footprints and smudge marks, 
Ellie Schindler said, it will really feel like home.

JAMES AUBREY JR., FORMER HEAD OF CBS AND MGM, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Thomas Aubrey Jr., who presided over retrenchment at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 
and the resurgence of CBS in tenures that were marked by creativity and 
callousness, has died, it was reported Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 His son, James W. Aubrey, said the executive who brought "The Beverly 
Hillbillies," "The Dick Van Dyke Show," "Green Acres" and many other top-rated 
programs into the nation's living rooms, was 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Aubrey -- the first man to head a film studio and a TV network -- died of a 
heart attack Sept. 3 at UCLA Medical Center. The younger Aubrey said his father 
realized he was ill, called paramedics and got dressed while he awaited them. 
He was found unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he probably thought it was just a severe asthma attack," his son told 
Associated Press. "He was a very healthy man. He ran four or five miles a day. 
I always thought he would outlive me." 
</P>
<P>
 Aubrey was once one of the most feared and respected figures in broadcasting: 
Lucille Ball admired him "as the smartest one up there" (the CBS executive 
suite), while John Houseman dubbed him "The Smiling Cobra." 
</P>
<P>
 Aubrey was born in La Salle, Ill., attended Princeton University (where he 
played football) and entered the entertainment industry in the early 1940s. By 
1956, he was manager of network programming at CBS. In 1957, he became vice 
president of programs and talent and two years later was named network 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 For a man whose career was the focus of twin spotlights, he was an intensely 
private person. In 1986 he gave what was probably the most extensive interview 
he ever granted, to the late Paul Rosenfield of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not doing this for the sizzle," he said at the time, shortly after he and 
a few investors began a company called Entermark, which financed low-budget 
films. It evidently was to discuss the fledgling company that he agreed to the 
interview at all. 
</P>
<P>
 His last few years proved relatively modest compared to the 1959-65 era, when 
he was president of CBS, and the period from 1969 to 1973, when he held the top 
spot at MGM. 
</P>
<P>
 He was as much respected as he was disliked during those two periods. But the 
hard-line reality of both tenures was that in 1963 under Aubrey, CBS had 12 of 
the top 15 nighttime series on the air and all 12 of the top daytime soaps. And 
he later was credited with saving MGM from financial ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 "No man in TV history made bigger profits -- or more enemies," the Washington 
Post said. And when he was abruptly fired by CBS chief William S. Paley in what 
proved a murky dispute over his highhanded manner with subordinates, coupled 
with a dip in ratings brought on by three disappointing Aubrey projects, CBS 
stock dropped nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he brought dozens of successes to the small screen, including 
"Petticoat Junction," "The Munsters" and "Gilligan's Island," he also canceled 
the series of such legends as Jack Benny, Garry Moore and Arthur Godfrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Aubrey was asked at a UCLA film class why he once put three series on the air 
in a single season without making a pilot of any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arrogance, I guess," replied the man who also brought the National Football 
League to CBS for a blind and then-staggering bid of $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
 When he joined MGM, it was a studio that had been preeminent in the film 
industry but was then in dire financial straits. He and principal owner Kirk 
Kerkorian sold off land, props and Judy Garland's ruby slippers from "The 
Wizard of Oz," cut salaries, turned off the heat in some office buildings and 
fired 3,500 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Aubrey also canceled some films that were only days away from production and 
decreed that no MGM picture henceforth would cost more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was to reduce an $80-million bank debt to $22 million. 
</P>
<P>
 With those cutbacks and the success of the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, the 
studio was well in the black when Aubrey left in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Aubrey said he walked away from life at the top because he "just didn't want 
to do it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted he had always operated with total candor but realized that he hurt 
people with that honesty and said, "I don't want (more) power now, or 
authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, he said he had discovered that expectations for movies, unlike 
TV, were "unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every picture is supposed to be a smash," and when it isn't "the executive 
becomes the heavy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He stayed away from entertainment executive suites for more than a dozen 
years, returning to start Entermark, whose partners -- mostly oilmen and 
ranchers -- included former Texas Gov. John Connally. 
</P>
<P>
 The silver-haired, distinguished-looking Aubrey, who had been the inspiration 
for fictional studio executives in several books, was known throughout his 
career for two things: his sometimes painfully blunt assessments of people and 
projects, and a keen, highly visible power of concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he ever considered an acting career, he was asked in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh God, no! I've been enough of a ---- in my life without becoming a star 
too!" 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Skye.

SLAIN GUARD HAD SPOKEN OFTEN OF DYING; SHOOTING: BEFORE BEING GUNNED DOWN LAST 
WEEK, BRINKS WORKER DENNIE PLESE WARNED OF THE PERILS OF HIS JOB, FAMILY 
MEMBERS RECALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If Dennie Plese had been able to speak to the gunman who ambushed him outside 
a Beverly Hills bank, he would probably be alive today, family members believe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valencia resident was a witty, athletic man with 38 years of experience as 
a Brinks armored car guard who had survived two other robberies along his route 
during the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a way of putting people at ease," said Lori Retig, his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Plese, 60, was shot and killed Tuesday morning as he delivered bags of money 
to the Manufacturers Bank branch at 9701 Wilshire Blvd. It was his first stop 
of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman, who escaped with an undisclosed amount of money, reportedly lay in 
wait and shot Plese in the back of the head as he entered the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 The daylight shooting in Beverly Hills surprised many, but Plese himself was 
very aware of the dangers surrounding his job. 
</P>
<P>
 During a trip to Las Vegas last summer, one of the regular getaways Plese took 
there to spend time with family, he spoke pointedly with his daughter and her 
husband about what to do in the event of his death. Plese predicted then he 
would probably die on the job someday, but was reluctant to give up the 
position due to financial considerations, said son-in-law Doug Retig. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked to him several times at length about retirement, about the danger," 
said Doug Retig. "He just couldn't retire." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before the shooting, after returning from a vacation, Plese joked he 
would be killed when he returned to work, Doug Retig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Plese's 38-year career with Brinks was spent as a driver, sitting 
behind a bullet-proof enclosure, but Plese began working as a messenger in 1984 
because the job paid more. During the robbery Tuesday, Plese's partner was in 
the armored truck -- unaware of the shooting until told by a witness, according 
to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no suspects, said Lt. Frank Salcido of the Beverly Hills Police 
Department. The gunman is described as white, in his early 30s, between 5 feet, 
9 inches and 5 feet, 10 inches tall, with black hair and a black mustache. He 
has a long, narrow face, a medium build and was wearing a dress shirt, tie and 
dark pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Unknown to family members until after his death, this was the third time Plese 
had been robbed in the past six months, Lori Retig said. His reactions in those 
encounters show he would have cooperated and survived this robbery if only the 
gunman had given him a chance, they believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this guy had said to my dad, 'Give me the money, man,' my dad would've 
said, 'Do you want my watch, too?' " Lori Retig said. "My dad easily would have 
done something quick-witted." 
</P>
<P>
 In one earlier incident, a man wielding a gun approached Plese and told him to 
drop the money he was carrying and then run away. Plese dropped the bag of 
money, but refused to run, saying he had a bad heart. The gunman fled with the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Plese headed off violence in the second incident when he saw two men with 
weapons approaching him. He quickly sat down on the pavement, holding the bags 
of money out in front of him. The robbers took the bags and left him 
unmolested. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dennie Plese was born in Marion, Ill., but grew up in Burbank. He served in 
the Marine Corps from 1951 to 1953, working mostly as an MP despite -- at 5 
feet, 4 inches tall -- being the shortest man in his unit. 
</P>
<P>
 His height precluded a career with the sheriff's department, but after brief 
stints working in a bakery and as a car salesman, Plese joined Brinks. While 
living in Burbank he met his future wife, Loretta, and they later moved to 
Sunland, where they lived for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pleses moved to Valencia in 1977, drawn to the community when their 
daughter and son-in-law began looking for a home there.  
</P>
<P>
 Plese enjoyed a healthy lifestyle that included jogging and active 
participation in the Newhall Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Plese was an avid science fiction fan, enjoyed classical music and stressed 
the importance of education to his daughter, Lori, and son, Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never wanted us to settle for anything less," Lori Retig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plese will be cremated and his ashes will be spread in the mountains in 
deference to his love of camping, she said.

SPREADING THE WORD; LANCASTER EVANGELIST GUIDING EX-TAGGER HOPES TO REAP 
PUBLICITY BOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An evangelist is trying to remold Chaka the infamous tagger into Chaka the 
Christian media star, which could be a publicity boon for the evangelist's 
rigidly disciplined soul-saving camp in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to reach thousands of people," predicted Joseph (JoJo) Sanchez, 
Chaka's new spiritual mentor, who runs Youth Academy U.S.A., an isolated desert 
camp for unruly young men where taped sermons blare almost nonstop over outdoor 
loudspeakers and the "cadets" are subject to discipline combining aspects of 
the military and the monastic. 
</P>
<P>
 But more work is needed before Chaka, whose real name is Daniel Ramos, can 
carry out plans to make him a messenger of Christian values to taggers, drug 
users and gang members, Sanchez said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, "he's being massaged and fine-tuned," said Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 The claimed religious conversion of Chaka, a celebrity incircles where 
religion has little sway, could make him a big draw for disaffected youths to 
evangelistic crusades. Celebrity counts in the world of evangelism as well as 
in secular society. 
</P>
<P>
 Stardom for Chaka could give a higher profile to Sanchez and his 20-year-old 
Inner Cities Youth Ministries. It's a role that Chaka has already begun to 
envision himself in. "I'm still using that name (Chaka) in order to plead a 
cause . . . for those who are lost out there," Ramos, 22, said in an interview 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaka haltingly employs religious metaphors about escaping the dark prison 
cells of pride and drugs in talking about his new perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had a supernatural vision shortly after meeting Sanchez in which it 
was revealed to him that he would use his artistic bent to paint on walls -- 
formerly expressed by writing his name thousands of times on other people's 
property all over the state -- to create religious murals in poor, urban 
neighborhoods throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez said he has not baptized Chaka yet, apparently because Chaka is still 
so new to the religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to see that Chaka is rooted in faith," said Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, a 42-year-old Pentecostal minister, once steered Wendell Tyler, who 
played for the Los Angeles Rams and the San Francisco 49ers, into a Christian 
lifestyle. In 1981, the two men were attending the same church service in 
Southern California when Tyler went to the altar at the close of the service, 
saying he was willing to accept Jesus as his savior and cast aside his use of 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez volunteered to guide Tyler's growth as a Christian, and Tyler has 
continued to assist Sanchez with special projects, appearing last month at a 
fund-raiser for the Youth Academy in Lancaster and recruiting Chaka for artwork 
on a proposed line of sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, who moved his independent ministry from Riverside to the Antelope 
Valley in 1986, divides his time three ways: overseeing the desert camp, 
co-pastoring with wife Becky an 80-member congregation in Lancaster and making 
evangelistic forays into Southland urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez met Chaka by chance in November when the evangelist took his "church 
on wheels" van to the Aliso Gardens housing project in Los Angeles where the 
convicted tagger lived. He prayed with Chaka during a second encounter, and a 
month and a half later responded in person when Chaka called him at 4 a.m. to 
plead for help in turning around his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was that Chaka decided seven months ago to move into the desert 
camp on a 2.5-acre compound about seven miles northwest of downtown Lancaster. 
It houses more than two dozen young men -- most of them assigned there by the 
courts for rehabilitation in a tightly regulated, nine-month training period. 
</P>
<P>
 John Nunez, a self-described former heroin addict who lived at the academy 
before becoming an administrator in the ministry office, said the men are 
taught some job skills before they leave. "(But) our main focus is working with 
the men's minds and teaching work habits," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The men, principally between ages 17 and 24, are called cadets and sign an 
agreement to abide by 54 rules that regulate their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Military-like regulations for the cadets include no complaining or arguing 
with superiors, no tank tops or caps, no lying down except on days off, 
frequent inspections of living quarters, addressing others as "brother" or 
"sir," and no weekend passes for the first three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The monastic elements include rising as early as 4:30 a.m. for prayers that 
begin at 5:20 a.m. After breakfast and cleanup chores, everyone assembles to 
watch a televised Bible study program on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. The 
workday ends at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evenings, the men are either in Bible classes at the academy or taking 
part in services at Sanchez's church in town, in addition to attending church 
Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Academy rules specifically prohibit "fellowshipping" or exchanging telephone 
numbers with women inside or outside the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez began the church three years ago, naming it Dream Center 
International, a name he said was inspired by a biblical verse which says that 
without visions, or dreams, humans perish. 
</P>
<P>
 The evangelist is at no loss for dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to start 10,000 churches and 10,000 academies," he said. With more 
financial support, he said, the academy could expand to take in as many as 100 
troubled young men. In turn, he said, they would provide the cadre for setting 
up more such churches and academies. 
</P>
<P>
 His lofty aim is in keeping with a controversial movement inside Pentecostal 
Christianity, called "word of faith" by supporters and the 
"name-it-and-claim-it" movement by critics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez has a close relationship with a nationally known exponent of the 
movement, televangelist Kenneth Copeland of Fort Worth, Tex., and another 
movement leader, the Rev. Jerry Savelle, also of Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men's television programs are often shown at Sanchez's Youth Academy. 
Two academy graduates recently went to Texas on scholarships for a 12-month 
Bible course at Savelle's ministry headquarters, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Evangelical critics contend that Copeland and like-minded ministers espouse 
heretical views that believers become Godlike in spiritual authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tend to say that just as God in the Book of Genesis spoke and the world 
came into existence, we too, because we are becoming Godlike, create by our 
spoken word," said Shane Rosenthal, a vice president for Christians United for 
Reformation, an evangelical group in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 In their defense, Sanchez asserted that the movement is firmly rooted in the 
New Testament. "We believe that with the faith of Jesus Christ, which is in us, 
that we can do all things in Christ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez also said he deplores the theological disputes. "This is a tragedy, 
that as a church we are acting like the Crips and the Bloods," he said, 
referring to rival gangs in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that people are dying out there, kids are killing each other," 
Sanchez said. "We need to get away from minute things. We can't get involved in 
dogma when our neighbor is suicidal and people are crying out for help." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Chaka spoke of the power of the spoken word for good or bad, 
but primarily in the context of reaping what you sow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Words are so powerful," he said. "All it takes is one word of God to change 
someone's life who is in need. If you tell people good things, it's better than 
a hug."

BOY, 15, KILLED, 2 OTHERS HURT IN SHOOTING; VIOLENCE: GUNMAN FIRES INTO CROWD 
OF ABOUT 300 YOUTHS AT CANOGA PARK CAR CRUISER HANGOUT. GANG DISPUTE IS BLAMED.

 A 15-year-old boy was fatally shot and two other youths wounded by gunfire at 
a popular car cruiser hangout, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police said the 11 p.m. Friday shooting was touched off by a fight 
between rival gang members among the 300 people congregating in a parking lot 
at Roscoe Boulevard and DeSoto Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 An unknown gunman in one car opened fire on the crowd, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old victim was taken in a patrol car to West Valley Hospital, 
where he died of gunshot wounds to the upper torso, police said. The Los 
Angeles County coroner's office identified the youth as Michael Banas. 
</P>
<P>
 Identities of the other two victims were not released Saturday. Police said 
they were treated for gunshot wounds to the upper torso and legs at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center. One was released. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday morning, police crime-scene tape was stretched over several spots 
in the parking lot of a strip mall on the northwest corner of the intersection 
and in front of apartments farther west on Roscoe Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants were unsure exactly what had happened, but said that Kevin's 
Burgers, on DeSoto Avenue, has been the scene of the weekly car cruise for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bertha Banuelos, manager of the restaurant, said the young people who come to 
show off their cars had been peaceful in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was cleaning up after closing at 10:45 Friday night when she 
heard what could have been gunshots behind a gas station across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she saw youths running toward the noise, but did not see what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 An attendant at the gas station Saturday morning said the night attendant has 
frequently called police to complain about the youths congregating there. 
</P>
<P>
 "They break it up," he said. "As soon as they leave, (the cruisers) come 
back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Devonshire Division detectives investigating the shooting were not available 
for comment Saturday. A statement released by police earlier said no suspect 
had been established.

SCOTT HARRIS: IT'S SCHWAB'S, THOUGH NOT SO ORIGINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years we have witnessed the Westsidefication of Ventura Boulevard. 
Exhibits A through Z are the restaurants. Toscana, Cha Cha Cha, Versailles and 
Amazon are but a few that were cloned from originals south of the Santa Monica 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was surprising to stumble upon a new joint that calls itself The 
Original Schwab's Grill. Now this seemed a cheeky claim. The original Schwab's, 
as movie buffs know, was the Hollywood landmark with a clientele that included 
the likes of Judy Garland, Clark Gable and the Marx Brothers. In its heyday, 
Charlie Chaplin might step behind the fountain to make his own milkshakes, 
Gloria Swanson would shop for cosmetics and pretty girls would sit at the 
counter, hoping to be discovered, just like Lana Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwab's was a star itself in the film "Sunset Boulevard." Having been 
rebuffed by Sheldrake, the studio chief, screenwriter Joe Gillis (William 
Holden) delivered this line to the audience: "After that, I drove down to 
headquarters. That's the way a lot of us think about Schwab's. Kind of a 
combination office, coffee klatch and waiting room. Waiting, waiting for the 
gravy train." 
</P>
<P>
 That Schwab's, the one that everyone considers the honest-to-goodness 
original, evolved into a tourist trap and closed its doors in 1983. But there 
is no statute of limitations on legends. So any place that tries to pass itself 
off as "The Original Schwab's" has some explaining to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latman brothers, Rick and Nat, are ready. The Schwab's at Sunset and 
Crescent Heights, Rick points out, was a pharmacy that had a lunch counter. 
Their Schwab's, which opened in Encino two weeks ago, is only a purveyor of 
food, not food and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 A technical point. But who gave the Latmans the right to call their place 
Schwab's? 
</P>
<P>
 Their grandfather, Leon Schwab, did. 
</P>
<P>
 When Leon and his surviving brothers decided to shut down the 51-year-old 
family business in 1983, just about everything was auctioned off. The rights to 
the Schwab name, however, stayed in the family. And though the Latman boys 
readily acknowledge that not every member of the Schwab clan necessarily 
approves of their venture, grandfather has given his blessings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing pretty good," says Leon Schwab, 83. "They think it's a big 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 They certainly hope it's a big thing, though it would be hard to match the 
success of the four Schwab brothers. The sons of Polish immigrants, Jack, Leon, 
Bernard and Martin Schwab owned six pharmacies at the peak of their success. 
Leon's grandsons are now following in their footsteps, teaming up to form a new 
incarnation of the family business. Rick, a 28-year-old investment banker, has 
handled the financial end of the venture, while Nat, a veteran of the 
restaurant business, oversees operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Rick tells the story, each Schwab brother played a specific role in 
their collective success, but it was their grandfather who might be considered 
the master strategist, selecting the location close to the old RKO, Republic 
and Columbia movie studios. He also gave Hollywood columnist Sidney Skolsky a 
second-floor office. Skolsky reciprocated with a monthly magazine feature 
called "From a Stool at Schwab's." He once declared that "at Schwab's they 
operate on the notion that Joe Doakes is just as important to Joe Doakes as 
Lana Turner is to Lana Turner." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon may have passed down the gene for chutzpah to his grandsons. If all goes 
according to plan, The Original Schwab's Grill will clone more eateries called 
The Original Schwab's Grills. 
</P>
<P>
 This may not say much for the concept of originality, but then The Original 
Schwab's Grill does not exactly offer an original concept. What they offer is a 
twist on a common theme. It's another retro diner that evokes the 1940s and 
1950s with its decor, movie posters and a menu that features several items you 
may have found at Schwab's on Sunset, such as the French dip (excuse me -- 
"Joe's Famous French Dip"). The twist comes with such '90s fare as the Pure 
Vegetable Burger and the tres L.A. dish that is Jody Maroni's Original Sausage. 
(There's that word again.) 
</P>
<P>
 Does the world really need another retro diner? "The answer is no," says Rick 
Latman. For Schwab's Grill to succeed, he says, it will have to make it as "a 
family diner" that offers good food, reasonable prices and excellent service. 
The hope, he says, is to capture at least a fraction of that magic. 
</P>
<P>
 The famous name is a head start. The other night, it made me pull over. I 
couldn't help but think of the legend of Lana Turner's discovery. (Leon Schwab, 
incidentally, swears the story is true, despite reports to the contrary.) 
Stepping inside, I couldn't help but think that somebody like Sherry Lansing 
would take one look and decide to put me in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the place was empty. The lunch trade may be brisk. But on that night, at 
that moment, I was the only customer. 
</P>
<P>
 So here I am, stuck with the same gig. Maybe a fresh approach, a new name, 
something original, would help. Perhaps: "From a Stool at The Original Schwab's 
Grill." 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe not.

WATER USERS HOPE TO CHART COURSE FOR VENTURA RIVER; CONSERVATION: COALITION 
WILL EXAMINE A PLAN TO MANAGE THE WATERWAY NOW, AND IN THE EVENT OF ANOTHER 
DROUGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With water in the Ventura River still plentiful, a coalition of water leaders 
is moving to speed up planning about the river's future before a new drought 
that could make regional cooperation more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 The major users of the river plan to huddle Tuesday with environmentalists, 
resource agencies and landowners in an effort to draw a plan to manage the 
river so that all needs are met now and in the event of the next drought. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are ever-increasing demands on the river system," said Chuck Curtis, 
general manager of the Ventura River County Water District, which pumps water 
from the river south of Ojai. "We want to be sure there is sufficient water for 
all the uses so we don't run out of water now or when the next drought comes. 
And it will come." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis and John Johnson, general manager of Casitas Municipal Water District, 
originally hatched the idea to form a ground-water management plan for the 
entire river that would regulate pumping of underground river water, which 
ultimately depletes the surface flow. 
</P>
<P>
 But initial meetings with the California Coastal Conservancy and others 
persuaded them to expand the scope beyond pumpers to include farmers, 
landowners, wildlife agencies, cities, the county and others, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought that if we're going to do this and make it succeed, we ought to 
put all our heads together," Johnson said. "Ultimately, if we don't bring in 
all the parties, it's not going to go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only must all parties come together, but the plan must be broad in scope, 
including all 226 miles of the river's watershed and all 52 miles of its 
tributaries, said Mark Capelli, executive director of the Friends of the 
Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 Capelli called the upcoming meeting a half-step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole watershed needs to be under one umbrella," he said. "You can't take 
water from one tributary or leave water in another without affecting the other 
sections." 
</P>
<P>
 But Capelli said he planned to work with the group and hoped to help broaden 
its approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be in an exploratory mode at this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura River proper begins at the confluence of the two forks of the 
Matilija Creek, the two largest and steepest tributaries. 
</P>
<P>
 From the confluence, the Ventura flows 16 miles to the ocean, supporting rare 
and endangered species of wildlife, including the steelhead trout and the 
tidewater goby fish, the least Bell's vireo, the least tern, the snowy plover, 
the California brown pelican and others. 
</P>
<P>
 But the river also acts as a drain for the Ojai and Ventura River valleys, 
picking up runoff from farms, city streets and gutters along the way. At the 
river's mouth, a permanent encampment of homeless people live, cook and dispose 
of garbage and sewage in the river. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, as more people move to the area and there is more demand for 
water from the river to support residents, golf courses and businesses, the 
river becomes increasingly imperiled, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Curtis, Johnson and others hope to put together a plan to ensure the 
river's future and their future water supplies. Ideally, they say, they would 
like to come up with a plan similar to the one being developed for the 100-mile 
long Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clara River Management and Enhancement Plan, which includes 
participants from both the counties of Los Angeles and Ventura, cities in both 
counties as well as resource agencies, farmers and property owners, aims to 
both protect and manage the river. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is nearly finished gathering information on the river, its 
inhabitants and users and will soon begin writing a draft plan for release next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Conservancy, which provided $250,000 in seed money to get the 
Santa Clara plan started, also may help organize the effort for the Ventura 
River. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy has also committed $500,000 to help restore the Ventura River 
Estuary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we've already contributed to the estuary plan, we're very interested," 
said Reed Holderman, resource enhancement manager for the state agency. "What 
happens upstream is going to come downstream. If the quality is good and the 
water is clean, it will be a healthier environment for the estuary." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, which has led the effort to develop a plan 
for the Santa Clara, encourages such plans and will help however it can with 
the Ventura River, said Cat Brown, a service wildlife biologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the work began on the Santa Clara plan, "Fish & Wildlife did not talk 
with water districts and the farmers, and Fish and Game had little contact," 
she said. "Now, we all sit down and talk together." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, she said, the public is more aware of the river and its 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago the Santa Clara was almost an invisible river; now, it's got 
name recognition. People know about the endangered species there and the 
resources. It's as if the river got an agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ventura River needs an agent too." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Ventura, by far the largest water user on the river, also plans to 
participate in the plan, said Steve Wilson, the city's water superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 On orders from the California Department of Health Services, the city is

ELECTIONS/ OXNARD CITY COUNCIL; 11 CANDIDATES SET SIGHTS ON RACE FOR 2 SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If the November election goes his way, candidate John C. Zaragoza will give 
the Oxnard City Council its first Latino majority in the city's 91-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 If businessman Dean Maulhardt is successful, a member of an Oxnard pioneer 
family will return to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven candidates are vying for the two open City Council seats on the Nov. 8 
ballot, including the co-founder of a defunct homeless shelter, a 
self-appointed government watchdog who has run and lost in every election since 
1972, a retired engineer who wants to start an Amish-like farming commune in 
Oxnard, and an accountant who wants to build public housing towers along the 
Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Optometrist Tom Holden, who won a seat on the council in a special election 18 
months ago, is the only incumbent seeking reelection. Longtime Councilman 
Michael A. Plisky has decided to retire from the council so he can run for a 
seat on the Oxnard Harbor District, which runs the deep-water Port of Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said he believes Holden has a tremendous advantage 
as an incumbent amid a wide field of challengers who are not well-known to 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is really only one seat up for grabs," said Lopez, running unopposed 
for his second consecutive term as mayor. "Contrary to what many people think 
about incumbents these days, I still think they have a great advantage, 
especially in large races like this." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter who lands in the coveted seats, the council is unlikely to veer from 
its ambitious pro-growth path, former Oxnard Mayor Jane Tolmach said. But the 
council's views on such firebrand issues as redevelopment and affordable 
housing could change dramatically, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of the people in the city are opposed to redevelopment, yet the 
council is for it," Tolmach said. "The person who is elected may have a key 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, only two of the five council members have been able to vote on a 
redevelopment issue because of various conflicts of interest, Oxnard City Atty. 
Gary Gillig said. 
</P>
<P>
 A myriad possible redevelopment areas, bisecting the city from north to south, 
are under consideration. New council members could tilt the vote on 
redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 "One person changes the dynamics of the council completely," Lopez said. "How 
it changes depends on the person." 
</P>
<P>
 Council candidate Dean Maulhardt, a fourth-generation Oxnard resident, is the 
descendant of two prominent farming families, the Maulhardts and the Borchards. 
He worked 20 years for the family farm, growing lemons, strawberries and 
avocados before starting a packaging business in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city itself, its history and its politics, has always interested me," 
said Maulhardt, whose cousin, Edwin Carty, was mayor of Oxnard in the 1950s. "I 
would like to keep the tradition open." 
</P>
<P>
 A well-connected pro-business candidate, Maulhardt is banking on many voters 
recognizing his family name. "I've got some business recognition in town," he 
said, "but I'm far from a shoo-in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maulhardt said he will campaign hard to win a seat on the council. His major 
campaign themes include his support of more community-based policing and 
Neighborhood Watch programs. He also wants to trim the size of city government 
and run Oxnard more like a business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some accountability is required for the city, like a business," Maulhardt 
said. "The city is there to provide services for the people, not to do unto 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
 As a councilman, Maulhardt also would try to attract more manufacturing 
industries to the city and help local farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Council candidate John Zaragoza, a former Oxnard solid waste superintendent, 
said he worked 20 years for the city without missing a day, and would continue 
his industrious ways as an elected official. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the current council is coming up with a quick-fix approach to our 
problems, which could have long-term detrimental effects," Zaragoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he wants to join the council so he can steer the city back to public 
service. "Some people say the city ought to be run like a business," he said, 
"but the city is here to provide services, not to make a profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Zaragoza believes in creating more low-cost housing, bringing in more 
high-tech business to the city, enlarging Neighborhood Watch programs, and 
starting more jobs and recreation programs for youth. He has already raised 
more than $11,000 for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaragoza downplayed the significance that his election could create the first 
Latino majority on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not thinking about a Latino majority," Zaragoza said. "I'm an American, I 
was born here, and I'm interested in representing all of the people of Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Leticia Alvarez, a 32-year-old undergraduate at USC and Aztec dance 
performer, said she wants to be the first council member to represent all 
Oxnard residents, regardless of wealth or ethnic origin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, there are two Latinos, an African American and two Anglos, but no one 
represents the average person," Alvarez said. "Diversity is real important to 
me. I can represent all of the people in Oxnard fairly and objectively." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez wants to encourage businesses to locate downtown instead of near the 
Ventura Freeway. She also favors building more police substations and creating 
more youth programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids need somewhere to go, somewhere to hang out," Alvarez said. "Otherwise 
they're bound to get into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of a Latino advocacy group said any Oxnard candidate with a Latino 
surname has a ready base of support from the city's Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Latino community has gone so long without any representation that it's 
likely to support the Latino candidates," said Marcos Vargas, executive 
director of El Concilio del Condado de Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "But people are becoming more sophisticated voters," Vargas said. "They're not 
just going to vote for the brown face, they're going to vote for the person who 
is going to do the most for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Holden said he is seeking his first full term because he has much 
left to accomplish after 18 months in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a shift in the way the city does business," Holden said. "We 
are now committed to maintaining current services despite decreasing revenue. 
We need to continue moving forward with new ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Holden believes in restructuring city departments to save money, increasing 
police and fire services, funding more youth programs, and creating more jobs 
by making Oxnard's business fees more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 He also stressed the importance of renovating downtown Oxnard to bolster the 
city's image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe that a city is only as good as our downtown," Holden said. 
"We can have stunning projects in our periphery, but people will still think of 
Oxnard as downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Holden supports cosmetic improvements of downtown, better lighting, turning A 
Street into a more prominent thoroughfare, and building more parking in front 
of the area's stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Council candidate Fred A. Judy is best known as co-founder of the Zoe 
Christian Center, a homeless shelter that closed down last year after falling 
more than $300,000 in debt. He said he wants to bring a sense of humanity to 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Judy has accused Oxnard leaders of conspiring to shut down his shelter and 
said he has no love for the council, or politicians of any stripe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a battle with the city of Oxnard for many, many years, and the people I 
was trying to help were put out on the streets," Judy said. "Since the center 
collapsed, I've had a hard time making ends meet. . . . The people want to help 
those who have problems. It's the politicians that don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy, who is now a trustee with the Oxnard Union High School District, wants 
to help small businesses, create jobs for youth, and refurbish downtown Oxnard 
with a Spanish motif. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Lockwood, a retired federal fire chief, has run unsuccessfully in every 
Oxnard City Council election since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockwood said he has already placed $11,000 of his money in his campaign 
coffers for this year's race, and expects to spend more before November. He 
spent more than $15,000 on his special election race last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran upon popular demand of the people," Lockwood said. "But just who, I'm 
holding confidential. I have been offered large contributions, but I consider 
it legal bribery. I've turned them all down." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockwood is the founder of the Oxnard Madder Than Hell Watchdog Committee, 
frequently attending meetings as a self-appointed council critic. He wants to 
make the city attorney an elected position, and increase the number of council 
members to seven. Lockwood also supports preserving farmlands and wetlands, 
creating more affordable housing, and increasing police and fire personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Karrin said he wants to bring a little common sense to City Hall. A New 
Yorker who moved to Oxnard 13 years ago, Karrin said he hates the City Council, 
labeling it as incompetent. He is running as a folksy outsider, taking shots at 
the incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men who take care of glasses do not know how to run a business," he said, 
referring to Holden and Lopez, both optometrists. "They have absolutely no 
control of what they're doing. They let the city staff do whatever they want, 
and they just go along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Karrin, 78, a former meat market owner and caterer on Long Island, said if 
elected he would seek the resignation of Gillig and City Manager Tom Frutchey. 
</P>
<P>
 Karrin wants to make Oxnard solvent, hire more police and firefighters, build 
affordable housing for low-income residents, reorganize city departments, and 
make it simpler for developers to move projects through the city bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah De Moss, a part-time receptionist and child-care provider, is running 
for a council seat again because, she says, the southern end of Oxnard has been 
neglected for years and politicians have forgotten about the city's humble 
beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of building extravagant new projects, we should get businesses to 
come into the buildings that are already here," De Moss said. "None of them 
live in the central or south areas of the city, that's why I believe they have 
ignored these areas." 
</P>
<P>
 De Moss wants to freeze the salaries of the city manager, city attorney and 
all city department heads. She also believes in hiring more police officers and 
housing the homeless in vacant buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Fred Schwartz, a retired aerospace engineer, has several ideas to 
resolve the city's problems: He wants to start a benevolent youth gang, 
complete with matching jackets and caps, and a farming commune for homeless 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing would be to recreate a sort of Amish community for the homeless," 
Schwartz said. "A place where people help each other." A former actor with a 
local theatre troupe, Schwartz believes in halting nearly all development, and 
wants to generate city revenue by promoting tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-time candidate William Winter said he was surprised at how many votes 
he received when he ran for a council seat in 1992. He won less than 3% of the 
vote without spending anything on his campaign. So, he said, he has decided to 
give it another try. 
</P>
<P>
 A 38-year-old columnist for a San Diego-based newsletter on Filipino American 
issues, Winter said he considers his youthful age an important asset. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need young people on the council," Winter said. "Not a bunch of retired 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Winter believes in bringing business into Oxnard by forging relationships with 
movie companies and other large industries. He also wants to lure a theme park 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Lawrence Paul Stein said he saw an opportunity to win a council seat 
when Plisky announced his retirement from city politics. 
</P>
<P>
 An accountant who installs business computer systems, Stein said the council 
has ignored small business in favor of large industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not enough concern from the City Council about the longstanding 
small businesses in this community," Stein said. "They find themselves 
strangled by the permit process when they try to expand." 
</P>
<P>
 Stein supports the construction of high-rise buildings along the Ventura 
Freeway for low-income public housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say they would turn into high-rise slums, but it all depends on 
how they are kept up. I think they would work." Oxnard City Council 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven candidates are running for two seats in the Nov. 8 election. Councilman 
Tom Holden is the only incumbent seeking reelection. The other available seat 
is being abandoned by Councilman Michael A. Plisky, who is instead running for 
a seat on the Oxnard Harbor District. Manuel Lopez is running unopposed for his 
second term as mayor.

NO FRILLS FOR THE FLOCK; RELIGION: CHURCHES FIND THE PRICE IS RIGHT AND THE 
SPACE ABUNDANT IN NON-TRADITIONAL SETTING OF EAST CAMARILLO'S INDUSTRIAL AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Camarillo Jubilee Church doesn't have towers, minarets or steeples that 
reach toward the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
 From all outward appearances, the church looks more like a warehouse or an 
office complex for a high-tech company -- hard, angular lines, tinted windows 
and well-tended lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 But aside from the lack of some heavenly accouterments, the evangelical 
Jubilee Church and three other young religious organizations have found a home 
in east Camarillo's manufacturing and industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
 Crossroads Community Church, Vineyard Christian Fellowship, Camarillo Jubilee 
and Jewish Families of Camarillo all lease space in buildings in an area 
designated as a light-manufacturing zone. The area's boundaries are Flynn Road 
to the north, Adolfo Road to the west, Calle Tesoro to the east and Calleguas 
Creek to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 At Camarillo Jubilee, Associate Pastor Joseph Staley said his congregation of 
about 500 people occupies a building of about 26,000 square feet. Like churches 
in more traditional buildings, Camarillo Jubilee regularly offers programs and 
services during weekday evenings and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our church has always been more about the people who worship here than the 
building we're in," Staley said. "We don't like spending our money on cosmetic 
things. With this building, we have plenty of space. Our congregation is 
comfortable here." 
</P>
<P>
 After years of meeting in a bank's community conference room and even a pizza 
parlor, Jubilee officials say their warehouse at 1169 Calle Suerte is the 
perfect place for their organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Architects and planning officials say the churches that have settled into the 
manufacturing area seek two things: low rent and large amounts of space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We refer to them as incubator spaces," said Robert Burrow, Camarillo's senior 
planner. "Most of the organizations that lease spaces in this zone tend to be 
younger and are still growing." 
</P>
<P>
 Burrow said the Planning Commission only allows the churches to occupy space 
in the manufacturing zone by special permit. The city issues the churches 
permits on the condition that they may be forced to relocate if a company using 
hazardous materials moves in nearby. The permit also places limits on hours of 
operation and use of parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Heath, an industrial property specialist for Grubb & Ellis Co., said that 
rents for warehouses are on average two-thirds cheaper than other commercial or 
retail space. "Warehouse space leases for about 40 cents a square foot compared 
to $1.20 a square foot for office space," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heath, who has helped locate churches into the city's manufacturing area, said 
that prior to this year's Northridge earthquake a glut of warehouse space was 
available for particularly low lease rates. The rates have started to climb as 
quake-rattled industries have begun to relocate to Camarillo from cities closer 
to the quake's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Tom Brewer of Crossroads Community Church, 1221 Calle Suerte, said he 
is no stranger to leading his flock to unconventional locations. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, Brewer led a congregation that met every Sunday on the sand at Will 
Rogers State Beach in Santa Monica. After four years of Sundays at the beach, 
he moved his church to the confines of a YMCA. A short time later he leased a 
nearby warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our church has a very informal and very comfortable style," Brewer said. 
"We're not the kind of church that needs to create an atmosphere through 
architecture." 
</P>
<P>
 The newest religious group to move into the manufacturing area is Jewish 
Families of Camarillo. The group leased 2,310 square feet of space at 1320 
Flynn Road. City planning commissioners unanimously approved their occupation 
of warehouse space at a meeting last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeri Belzer, a member of Jewish Families' board of directors, said the 
organization is eagerly looking forward to occupying the Flynn Road address 
because the young group has been forced to meet in the homes of its members for 
the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Belzer said that the new building may serve as an interim site for 
events and religious meetings planned for Camarillo's Jewish families.

LAST MOVING EXPERIENCE; STAFF REACHES PLAZA LEVEL IN CITY HALL'S 3RD MOVE IN 5 
YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ed Johnduff paused in the lobby of Thousand Oaks' soon-to-be City Hall, took 
in the hustling workers and the flying sawdust and nodded nonchalantly. 
</P>
<P>
 The building was nearly finished, on time and under budget. Johnduff, as 
project manager, was responsible. But he allowed himself only the barest 
flicker of a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 "No sweat," he said and sauntered off. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnduff's low-key demeanor stood out as a rare calm spot amid the flurry. 
Decked out in jeans and T-shirts, city staffers scurried about in a mad dash, 
eager to settle into their new digs before Monday's 7 a.m. opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Here and there, they encountered a few glitches. The glass paneling was 
missing from one office. The electricity didn't seem to be working in another. 
And a small hole gaped in the carpet by the Finance Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a few gremlins and ghosts running around," acknowledged Gary Mintz, 
who handles the technical equipment for the Civic Arts Plaza's two theaters. "A 
crossed wire here or there. But it's all very minor stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the missing glass and the unresponsive light bulbs hardly fazed a 
soul. Speaking for her co-workers, media services coordinator Caroline Milton 
vowed: "We'll be ready, even if the building isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, scores of city employees planned to dedicate their weekend to the 
massive moving project. Downing apple juice and gobbling doughnuts for quick 
energy, they scurried about, looking for boxes and plants and photos. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, members of the city's Personal Computer Task Force roamed the 
gleaming halls, hooking up monitors and flicking on printers. And a hired 
cleaning crew wearing yellow hard hats zipped through the offices, wiping up 
thick layers of dust. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you can see, everyone gets their hands dirty," said treasury assistant 
Georgia Meyer, stacking folders in a friend's office. 
</P>
<P>
 At least they have plenty of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend's undertaking marked the third time in the past five years that 
city staffers have moved to a new government center. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first move, five years ago, city employees shifted a few blocks, from 
401 to 2150 Hillcrest Drive, abandoning the building affectionately called the 
"eyebrow on the hill" in favor of an austere beige office complex near Rancho 
Conejo Industrial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, the city sold the building at 2150 Hillcrest Drive to 
biotechnology giant Amgen and shipped belongings to 2400 Willow Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "The joke is, if we ever get laid off, we can just get jobs as movers," said 
one employee, who requested anonymity after divulging that she had found crusty 
old oatmeal glopped in the back of her file cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 The current move will cost about $100,000 -- paid for with funds from the 
Civic Arts Plaza's $63.8-million construction budget. And this time it's for 
real. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish people would stop saying this silliness that we have four city halls," 
Mayor Alex Fiore said. "We have one City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 The official ribbon-cutting ceremony for the government's lone permanent home 
is scheduled for Tuesday evening, when Fiore will inaugurate the oak and 
russet-colored council chambers. The grand opening for the performing arts 
center will take place separately, with a gala show Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 To liven up Tuesday's ceremony, a motorcade carrying Thousand Oaks Little 
League baseball players -- who won a world title in their age division this 
year -- will participate in the ribbon-cutting at 4:55 p.m. After a brief 
speech, Fiore will knock his gavel on the sleek black podium and open the first 
Civic Arts Plaza council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the chamber doubles as a theater -- "Man of La Mancha" opens there 
next weekend -- it looks a good deal more imposing than the conference room 
used for council meetings at 2400 Willow Lane. Council members will sit on the 
stage, at a dais equipped with television monitors, and address a roomful of 
spectators in plush, rust-colored seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be an interesting psychological change," theater director Tom Mitze 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the formal meeting hall, each council member will have a small 
office, with an unglamorous view of the parking garage. For the first time, 
council members will also enjoy individual phone lines and answering machines 
at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The $300,000 voice mail system hooks up to every extension in the building, so 
callers can leave messages for individual employees around the clock. "We think 
it will be a lot more efficient," Assistant City Manger MaryJane Lazz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the new phones, city staffers will enjoy a high-tech filing system 
designed to save space and time. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of stacking files side by side on metal shelves, managers can stash 
them on a carousel inside a locked cabinet. To pull up a particular folder, 
they need only punch a button, and the carousel will rotate until the necessary 
information sits conveniently in front of the cabinet door. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the phones, the $170,000 filing system is paid for with funds from the 
Civic Arts Plaza construction budget. 
</P>
<P>
 To match the snazzy technology, new furniture will fill most City Hall offices 
-- wooden bookcases, burgundy swivel chairs, gray cubicle partitions. Even the 
nicest accouterments, however, cannot make up for the drab views that several 
top managers have. 
</P>
<P>
 From his huge corner office, City Manager Grant Brimhall looks smack dab into 
the Yukon Belle bar and its parking lot full of motorcycles. It's not quite as 
glamorous as the view of distant hillsides and gorgeous sunsets that he enjoyed 
in the first City Hall. But he's found a way to make the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neat thing about my view is the renaissance you see occurring on the 
boulevard," Brimhall said. "It's not just a physical view -- it's almost a 
spiritual view. It transcends concrete and mortar, and it really talks about 
people, place, vision and opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Gazing out toward the freeway spiraling past the Civic Arts Plaza's shiny 
copper curtain, Brimhall added: "It's a future even more exciting than anyone 
can visualize." 
</P>
<P>
 FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a new address -- 2100 Thousand Oaks Blvd. -- City Hall will have 
new phone numbers starting Monday. The main switchboard will be 449-2100. To 
hear a recorded message on how to obtain marriage licenses, call 449-2155; for 
passport information, call 449-2161. Other offices: city clerk, 449-2151; city 
manager, 449-2121; city attorney, 449-2170; planning, 449-2300; public works, 
449-2400. For information about the new theaters, call 449-2700. To order 
tickets, call the box office at 449-2787.

ELECTIONS / THOUSAND OAKS CITY COUNCIL; VOTERS PRESS 16 CANDIDATES TO CHOOSE 
SIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 They liken their current city leaders to a pack of kids squabbling in a 
sandbox, or a bunch of jokers squandering tax dollars, or a passel of wonks 
drafting nit-picky rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet though they bash them, they can't wait to join them. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen challengers have set their sights on the much-maligned Thousand Oaks 
City Council this year. They will square off against incumbents Judy Lazar and 
Elois Zeanah in November as they vie for three open seats, including one left 
vacant by Mayor Alex Fiore's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 With campaigning that began even before the traditional Labor Day kickoff, the 
challengers are cooking up snappy slogans and tossing around political 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how many initiatives they propose, voters seem to nag them with 
one vexing question: Which side are you on? 
</P>
<P>
 After two years of watching the council split 3 to 2 on most major issues, 
voters seem to expect the candidates to line up behind one camp or another. And 
so they demand: Do you agree with the slow-growth views of Zeanah and 
Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski? Or do you support the more pro-development 
attitude of Fiore, Lazar and Councilman Frank Schillo? 
</P>
<P>
 Which side are you on? 
</P>
<P>
 Answers depend on campaign strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly half the candidates have chosen to hitch themselves to either the 
"3-side" or the "2-side." The rest hope to convince voters that they're true 
independents. 
</P>
<P>
 Lining up with the slow-growth faction are: David Hare, an environmental 
services manager for the city of West Hollywood; M. Ali Issari, a retired 
filmmaker who has been endorsed by Zeanah, and Irving Wasserman, who was 
appointed to the Planning Commission by Zeanah four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates in the other camp include: Marshall Dixon, a retired businessman 
who strongly defends developers' rights to build on their property; Jeannette 
Scovill, a public-access television producer and environmental activist, and 
Bill Williams, a mortgage broker who has criticized Zeanah and Zukowski as 
"reactionary." 
</P>
<P>
 Reluctant to be pinned down, the remaining candidates seek to portray 
themselves as neutral -- or at least unpredictable in their allegiances: 
dentist Gregory Cole, firefighter Andy Fox, finance manager Michael V. 
Friedman, engineer and former Councilman Lee Laxdal, police Detective Michael 
Markey, real estate salesman Chuck Morsa, telecommunications salesman Ekbal 
Quidwai and mobile carwash owner Lance Winslow. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Lazar, who has sided with her pro-development colleagues on most issues, 
has tried to slough off labels. "If anything," she said, "I'd like to be 
considered practical and reasonable. That means making adjustments, because you 
can't have it all your way." 
</P>
<P>
 That emphasis on negotiation and compromise is quickly becoming the most 
popular slogan in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every candidate has endorsed an "anti-bickering" platform, promising to 
put an end to the personal attacks and vicious arguments that have come to 
characterize the televised council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask, 'What makes you think you won't get embroiled in the same kind of 
controversy?' " said candidate Lee Laxdal, who served on the council from 1980 
to 1989. "The answer is, you vote issues, not people, and you treat everyone 
with respect." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To back up his claims, Laxdal points to his nine years of service on an 
often-divided but rarely rancorous council. Similarly, former Planning 
Commission members Andy Fox and Greg Cole tout themselves as experienced 
peacemakers with a proven ability to keep debates focused on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just rush off and say, 'No,' and you can't just rush off and say, 
'Yes,' " Cole said. "That's the problem with the current council -- they don't 
listen." 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth challenger with government experience, Planning Commissioner Irving 
Wasserman, also describes himself as a good negotiator and an all-around 
"people person." 
</P>
<P>
 While Cole, Dixon, Fox, Laxdal and Wasserman emphasize their experience within 
the Thousand Oaks bureaucracy, their foes seek support by positioning 
themselves as complete outsiders, with no allegiances and no agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hearing that voters would like to have young, new people on the council," 
said Michael Friedman, who's trying to spin his obscurity into an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 27, Friedman is the youngest council candidate; David Hare and Lance 
Winslow are also under 30. Three senior citizens are running as well: Dixon 
recently turned 69, and both Issari and Wasserman are 72. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with such wide age gaps and diverse backgrounds, the candidates worry 
that voters will find it tough to pick them from the crowded field. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure they stand out in voters' minds, most candidates plan on a lot of 
old-fashioned handshaking. Walking door to door, precinct by precinct, they 
will hand out brochures and flash sincere smiles. "I've got holes in my shoes 
already," said Winslow, who's been canvassing three hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 New shoe leather, however, will be a minor expense compared to the campaign 
budgets of most candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce President Steve Rubenstein estimates that it 
will take at least $25,000 to win election. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the incumbents say they expect to spend heavily. Although both Lazar and 
Zeanah enjoy widespread name recognition, they're not counting on automatic 
reelection. They well remember how voters booted out incumbents Bob Lewis in 
1992 and Larry Horner in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this is going to be a hard-waged campaign," Zeanah said. "I'm going to 
put all the energy I have into this election effort." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating the high costs, several candidates began amassing war chests 
months ago and are continuing to round up cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Most will continue to host the traditional, fund-raising barbecues, picnics 
and cocktail parties at $10 to $25 a plate. But Andy Fox, gunning for heftier 
contributions, has organized a golf tournament this fall with a $65 entry fee 
-- and the lure of a free car for any player who makes a hole in one. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other end of the scale, Lance Winslow hopes residents will pledge a few 
pennies for every car he washes in the Thousand Oaks Auto Mall and every mile 
he bikes in a trek across California planned for this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 With such competition for dollars, some candidates have all but given up 
fund-raising. "I'm not counting on getting too much money," Quidwai said, 
adding that he's prepared to spend up to $15,000 from his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus on money disappoints many candidates -- but they know it's vital. 
With 16 candidates, voters are bound to receive stacks of political mailers. 
Most likely, they'll pull out the glossiest, slickest brochures to thumb 
through first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope voters would be more impressed with the content of the message 
than the delivery," Marshall Dixon said. "But we realize a lot of voters may 
not want to sift through it all. We're all rolling the dice, wondering what we 
can say to push the hot button." 
</P>
<P>
 Like political hopefuls nationwide, Thousand Oaks candidates have settled on 
two hot buttons: crime and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighter Fox and Police Detective Michael Markey hope to capitalize on 
widespread concern about crime by emphasizing their years of dedication to 
public safety. "The fact that I'm a firefighter seems to be very important to 
people because I've already earned the public trust," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Markey agreed: "I'm already a public servant. I'm not a politician." 
</P>
<P>
 In his platform, Markey suggests expanding intervention programs for at-risk 
youths, including trying to scare them into straight living by giving them 
tours of jail cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox calls for setting up senior citizen patrols, enlisting reserve officers to 
help overworked sheriff's deputies and establishing a public safety committee 
to evaluate the city's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates also have proposed measures to keep Thousand Oaks safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Winslow has already set up a mobile crime watch, enlisting business 
people who drive around the city to report suspicious activity. Jeannette 
Scovill hopes to hold workshops to teach residents crime prevention tips. And 
Michael Friedman would donate his $9,180-a-year council salary to a special 
public safety fund. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the economy, Bill Williams would like to lure large, non-polluting 
companies to Thousand Oaks by offering financial incentives. And David Hare 
would seek to streamline government by giving bonuses to city employees who 
propose cost-saving strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most candidates have concentrated on crime, jobs and growth issues, a 
few have tried to distinguish themselves with offbeat proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Morsa, for example, would like to set up a tent city for homeless people 
on Fireworks Hill in the center of town. And M. Ali Issari would draft a 
Residents' Bill of Rights, in which politicians would pledge to uphold the 
quality of life in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a document that protects residents' rights and developers' rights and 
establishes the city's responsibility to protect our neighborhoods, our 
environment and our lifestyle," Issari said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how to go about protecting the Thousand Oaks lifestyle could become a 
topic of bitter debate, depending on the makeup of the next council. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Zeanah, the slow-growth faction aims to stop most development, 
especially dense affordable-housing projects and large shopping centers. They 
want Thousand Oaks to stay as it is, and they're desperate to preserve the 
city's "semirural" atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-development forces, however, argue that the city cannot stand still 
without suffering economically. Orderly development will bring in the revenue 
needed to maintain city services, they say. Without some growth, they argue, 
the city will have to cut back on everything from library services to police 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 With three seats up for grabs, the upcoming election will turn into a showdown 
between these two powerful factions. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the mudslinging has started. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very crucial election," Chamber President Rubenstein said. "There 
are emotional people (running for election), fanatics, people who want nothing 
in their back yards. But I think the good honest people in this community . . . 
will come forward and overpower the fanatics." 
</P>
<P>
 Those slow-growth "fanatics," naturally, take quite the opposite view. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are hundreds of livid Newbury Park residents who are going to work very 
hard," activist Michelle Koetke said. "It's time we had a council that listens 
to the residents, a council that wasn't owned and controlled by the same 
interests that have run this city for years -- the big-money interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about ousting the political Establishment alarms Mayor Fiore, who himself 
has been a fixture of city government for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key issue in this election," he said "is the retention or loss of our 
excellent staff," including the city manager, city attorney, city clerk and 
department heads. "I'm afraid if the wrong mix gets on (the council) we might 
lose all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to keep the council majority in hands he considers stable, Fiore has 
strongly endorsed Lazar and has praised a handful of like-minded candidates, 
including Cole, Dixon, Fox and Laxdal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the slow-growth advocates have put forth their own unofficial slate: Hare, 
Issari and Zeanah. And they're just as determined to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're seeing are the battle lines in this town," Koetke said. "It's 
war." Thousand Oaks City Council 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen candidates, including two incumbents, are running for three council 
seats. The race pits slow-growth candidates against those who favor more 
development. Concern about rising crime and gang activity will also be among 
the key issues. Gregory Cole  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 43 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: dentist 
</P>
<P>
 Education: bachelor's degree in biological sciences from USC, doctor of dental 
surgery degree from USC School of Dentistry 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Cole spent three years on the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission 
from 1987 to 1989 and has represented the city as a trustee of the Ventura 
County Community College District since 1989. He has also repeatedly been 
elected to both the county's Republican Central Committee and the state's party 
organization. Cole has served on seven city committees, studying traffic, the 
General Plan, affordable housing and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Cole intends to emphasize his experience as a small-business owner for 
15 years, his community involvement as a youth sports coach, and his concern 
for public safety. He supported a scaled-down version of the Dos Vientos 
project as a Planning Commission member, but says he is concerned that the 
dense development could disturb neighboring Broome Ranch parkland. He would 
like to set up more after-school recreation programs for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Dixon  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 69 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: retired businessman 
</P>
<P>
 Education: attended business and marketing classes at Northwestern University 
</P>
<P>
 Background: The retired general manager of an Illinois auto firm, Dixon moved 
to Thousand Oaks five years ago. He has served as chairman of the board of the 
Oaknoll Homeowners Assn. and has sat on the administrative board of the United 
Methodist Church of Westlake Village. He served overseas in the Marine Corps 
for 3 1/2 years during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: A pro-business candidate, Dixon attacks excessive regulation and 
considers the no-growth movement a usurpation of property rights. He wants to 
encourage moderate growth while sticking to city policies on ridgeline 
preservation and other development standards. Dixon says he would change the 
tenor of council meetings by ending the bickering and insisting on more 
decorum. He also calls for reinforcing the city's police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Fox  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 36 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Los Angeles city fire captain 
</P>
<P>
 Education: attended Pierce College and studied fire protection administration 
at Cal State Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Fox served on the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission from 1990 to 
1993 and has also sat on the city's housing issues committee and Arts 
Commission. He also served on the county supervisors' citizen advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Fox emphasizes public safety as his top priority. He wants to set up 
senior citizen patrols to help police officers spot crimes in progress. He 
would create a public safety committee to evaluate police services and 
community needs and report monthly to the council. Fox would also like to 
enlist reserves and cadets for foot patrols. On development issues, he calls 
for basing all land-use decisions strictly on city laws and the General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael V. Friedman  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 27 
</P>

 Background: A Thousand Oaks native, Friedman emphasizes his long ties with the 
city. He co-founded Financial Trust eight years ago and serves as its business 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Friedman has proposed abolishing council members' salaries and using 
the money to boost public safety budgets. He would like to focus on family 
issues, such as funding crossing guards, establishing more reading programs at 
the library and enhancing children's programming at the Civic Arts Plaza. 
Friedman also calls for installing street lights and sidewalks throughout 
Thousand Oaks, and sprucing up the central city neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hare  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 28 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: environmental services and city operations manager for West 
Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 Education: bachelor's degree in political economics, University of San Diego 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Hare grew up in Ventura County and settled in Thousand Oaks three 
years ago. He worked as a consultant in San Diego developing business promotion 
programs, then joined West Hollywood's government in 1991. He manages 
recycling, water, trash disposal, street sweeping and other programs for the 
city of 36,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Hare is running on a slow-growth, pro-environment platform, backed by 
some activists from the group Residents to Preserve Newbury Park. He would like 
to raise revenue for open space acquisition by streamlining city government and 
possibly imposing higher franchise fees on utilities and trash haulers. Hare 
suggests giving city employees bonuses for proposing cost-saving ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 M. Ali Issari  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 72 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: retired filmmaker and professor 
</P>
<P>
 Education: bachelor's degree in English literature from the University of 
Tehran, master's degree in cinema and doctorate in communications from USC 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Born in Iran, Issari came to the United States 32 years ago. He 
taught filmmaking for 12 years at Michigan State University, while producing 
several hundred documentary and educational films. Since moving to Thousand 
Oaks in 1988, he has served on the city's cable TV access committee and has 
called for more public-access educational programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Issari has been endorsed by Councilwoman Elois Zeanah and shares her 
slow-growth philosophy. He would like to write a Residents' Bill of Rights 
spelling out the city's responsibility to protect neighborhoods, the 
environment and overall quality of life. He wants to establish neighborhood 
committees to advise the council on land-use issues. He also hopes to fight 
crime with more police foot and bike patrols, and more after-school programs 
for youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Laxdal  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 60 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: engineer 
</P>
<P>
 Education: bachelor's degree in mathematics from Lewis & Clark College, 
master's degree in math from Oregon State College 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Laxdal served nine years on the Thousand Oaks City Council before 
leaving in 1989 to take a job in Australia. Although he authored the city's 
slow-growth ordinance, he has supported some major developments, including the 
Dos Vientos project (which he voted for after unsuccessfully urging his 
colleagues to reduce the number of homes). Laxdal also backed the Civic Arts 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Laxdal hopes to create a joint-powers district, pulling together the 
police, city, schools and parks to fight crime. He also wants to hold workshops 
to teach residents to crime-proof their homes, and he would like the city to 
subsidize security lights for low-income seniors. Laxdal is campaigning against 
political bickering, emphasizing the need for harmony on the council. He has 
called for regular informal town meetings between city officials and residents.

 Judy Lazar  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 52 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: councilwoman 
</P>
<P>
 Education: bachelor's degree in economics and political science from Albertus 
Magnus College, New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Lazar was elected to the council in 1990, after nearly two decades 
of community work, including four years on the Planning Commission and five 
years at the helm of Senior Concerns. She has also served on the board of the 
American Assn. of University Women and has advised the school district as a 
member of various committees. Lazar represents the city in the Air Quality 
Management District and the Conejo Open Space Conservation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Lazar describes herself as a negotiator and lists several 
accomplishments of her first term, including: spearheading the move to acquire 
Broome Ranch as open space, developing community policing strategies for the 
Las Casitas neighborhood and designing a compromise Auto Mall sign. She hopes 
to focus a second term on creating a special city team to help small 
businesses, drafting a master plan for Thousand Oaks Boulevard and building 
more community sports fields. Lazar also would work to ensure that the Civic 
Arts Plaza becomes financially self-supporting, requiring no city subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Markey  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 39 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Compton homicide detective 
</P>
<P>
 Education: studied public administration at Pepperdine University 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Markey, who ran unsuccessfully for City Council in 1990, has 
served on a city committee that distributes funds to social service groups. A 
Newbury Park resident since 1988, he has served on the Compton police force for 
17 years, including a three-year stint as head of the officers union. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Markey plans to emphasize public safety during his campaign. He 
proposes expanding intervention programs for at-risk youths, including giving 
teen-agers tours of jail cells and introducing them to inmates to show them the 
consequences of committing crimes. He would also like to establish a 
job-training center, where employers could set up teaching facilities to train 
prospective hires. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Morsa  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 58 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: self-employed real estate salesman 
</P>
<P>
 Education: high school diploma 
</P>
<P>
 Background: A Thousand Oaks resident for 26 years, Morsa has coached several 
local sports teams and was a member of the Optimists Club. Although never 
involved in local politics, he ran for governor of California in 1990 and for 
vice president of the United States in 1986, both times on the American 
Independent Party slate. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Morsa would like to create a tent city for homeless people on top of 
Fireworks Hill, and open the old City Hall at 401 Hillcrest Drive as a homeless 
shelter. A self-described "tax protester," he plans to ask for a grand jury 
investigation of the city's finances. Morsa objects to the Civic Arts Plaza and 
would like the city to spend more money fixing roads and setting up recreation 
programs, including a boxing club for youths. He would open each council 
meeting with a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ekbal Quidwai  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 43 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: self-employed salesman of telecommunication equipment

Pakistan, bachelor's in business management from Cal State Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Quidwai has attended nearly every council meeting for the past 
three years, testifying on many topics. He says he spends 20 hours a week 
researching issues and writing letters to city officials and local newspapers. 
A Pakistan native, Quidwai moved to Newbury Park in 1979, and became a U.S. 
citizen in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Quidwai would like to see the city divided into political districts, 
with a directly elected mayor instead of a rotating council chairmanship. He 
has criticized the city's plan to finance the Civic Arts Plaza with 
redevelopment money and internal loans. To bring in more money for the cultural 
center, he would aggressively market the adjacent land to a private developer. 
Quidwai would also abolish the $55 fee that non-residents must pay to use the 
Thousand Oaks Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette Scovill  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 48 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: public-access television producer 
</P>
<P>
 Education: training as a facilitator from the Institute for Cultural Affairs 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Scovill says she has learned about social service, health care and 
economic issues through her stints on the Ventura County Commission for Women 
and the Council on Economic Vitality. She produces a weekly half-hour cable 
show called Focus on the Environment and has organized several Earth Day 
celebrations. She also helped put together symposiums to teach business owners 
about environmental practices, from energy conservation to recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Scovill's platform blends a pro-business stance with environmental 
activism. She aims for sustainable development: designing buildings to be 
taller, for example, so they take up less land. She would like to see art and 
theater schools built next to the Civic Arts Plaza so students could work with 
professionals in the cultural center. And she hopes to set up crime-prevention 
workshops for local workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving Wasserman  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 72 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Planning Commission member, retired executive 
</P>
<P>
 Education: studied business management at City College of New York 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Wasserman moved to Thousand Oaks in 1968 to manage a direct-mail 
record club with 350 employees. He has served on nine city committees, 
analyzing issues from cable television to crime prevention. Most recently, he 
has served as a planning commissioner for four years. Wasserman served in the 
Air Force for more than three years during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Appointed to the Planning Commission by Elois Zeanah, Wasserman has 
voted against most major developments. As a councilman, he would press for 
strict adherence to the city's General Plan and would try to find money to buy 
more open space. He believes he could act as a negotiator on a divided council. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Williams  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 49 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: mortgage banker 
</P>
<P>
 Education: attended San Diego State College and Western State University 
College of Law 
</P>
<P>
 Background: A Thousand Oaks resident for 16 years, Williams works as a branch 
manager with the M-West Mortgage Corp. He is a veteran of the United States Air 
Force and is a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Williams would like the city to offer financial incentives to attract 
more big businesses and create jobs. He thinks small businesses are treated 
fairly well, but plans to propose some reforms later in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Winslow  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 29 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: owner of The Car Wash Guys 
</P>
<P>
 Education: attended business classes at Ventura and Oxnard community colleges 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Winslow founded his carwash business in 1990 and has opened 
franchises in several other states. He recently launched the Neighborhood 
Mobile Watch program, enlisting those who regularly drive through the city to 
call the police and report suspicious activity. Winslow has helped dozens of 
sports teams and charities with fund-raisers by donating his carwash service on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Winslow would like to cut regulations and red tape, especially for 
small businesses. He hopes to build a second city golf course to raise money 
for various programs, including a skateboard park to keep youngsters off the 
streets. He plans to set up a high-tech "information highway" with the Chamber 
of Commerce, which would allow all business owners to advertise and exchange 
information via computer links. 
</P>
<P>
 Elois Zeanah  
</P>
<P>
 Age: 52 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: councilwoman 
</P>
<P>
 Education: attended Shelton State Business College in Mississippi 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Before winning election to the council in 1990, Zeanah founded the 
Conejo League of Homeowners to push her slow-growth philosophy. As a 
councilwoman, Zeanah voted against most major developments and affordable 
housing complexes. She also organized a crime symposium to draft a strategy for 
keeping Thousand Oaks safe, and pushed a proposal to allow directory signs for 
businesses in hard-to-see strip malls on Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues: Zeanah will continue to campaign on her slow-growth platform. She is 
also calling for a lobbying law, which would require developers and their 
representatives to register with the city and report all meetings with city 
officials. Zeanah wants to strengthen the overcrowding ordinance she helped to 
draft and crack down on landlords who allow too many renters to live in a 
single dwelling. She also hopes to implement a stronger crime prevention 
program, based on the strategy drafted at this year's communitywide symposium.

POVERTY IS LATEST BATTLEFRONT FOR SOME MILITARY FAMILIES; ASSISTANCE: FOOD 
STAMPS, OTHER FEDERAL AID PROGRAMS AND SECOND JOBS HELP SOME SAILORS AT LOCAL 
BASES SUPPLEMENT THEIR LOW SALARIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By night, Airman James Long works in an aircraft hangar at the Point Mugu 
Naval Air Weapons Station, keeping precise maintenance records of F-14 Tomcat 
fighter jets. 
</P>
<P>
 By day, the 23-year-old sailor sells computers at a local department store to 
supplement his $1,300 monthly Navy salary. His wife, Lauri, is busy taking care 
of the couple's infant son and 4-year-old daughter. But she does what she can 
by clipping coupons and being a careful shopper at the base commissary. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his low rank and corresponding low pay, Long's family is qualified 
to collect about $80 a month in food coupons under the federal Women, Infants 
and Children program to ensure the good nutrition of their growing family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're budgeted down to the penny," Lauri Long said. "We tend to eat a lot of 
salad, chicken and leftovers. If I had to shop at a regular supermarket and not 
at the commissary, we'd be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 While better off than some, the Longs aren't alone with their financial 
hardships among military families. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, more than $63,000 in food stamps and $32,000 in WIC coupons 
were redeemed by local Navy families last year -- the lion's share at the Naval 
Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the armed services, more than $27 million in food stamps passed 
through military commissaries last year. The federal WIC program gave out about 
$15 million in coupons to military families in 1993, a $2.5-million increase 
from the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Navy officials at Port Hueneme or Point Mugu will not say exactly how 
many sailors were on food stamps, citing confidentiality laws, they estimated 
that as many as 15 families on the bases depend on food stamps to get by. 
</P>
<P>
 The low pay rates of enlisted personnel are beginning to draw the attention of 
top commanders who are concerned that money problems may distract soldiers or 
sailors from focusing completely on their jobs, said Pentagon spokesman Lt. 
Col. Doug Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very much a concern," Hart said. "You can't expect people to perform 
their jobs well if they're worried about what's going on at home. Some of the 
jobs we do can get you hurt real fast if you're not concentrating." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has also caught the attention of Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley), who last month introduced a bill that proposes a 16-member federal 
commission to study military pay rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more, the men and women who have agreed to potentially lay down 
their lives for their country are finding that along with the uniform may come 
a losing battle with poverty," Gallegly said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Navy families in Ventura County also seek financial aid from a Navy relief 
organization which provides free food, small loans and cash donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Dianne Kerekffy, executive director of the Navy/Marine Corps Relief Society 
that serves both Point Mugu and Port Hueneme, said local Navy families received 
more than $129,000 in short-term loans in 1993. An additional $23,400 in grants 
was handed out to needy sailors at both bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want them to become dependent on us to get by month to month," 
Kerekffy said. "But, at the same time, we're here for them as a resource." 
</P>
<P>
 Each month, truckloads of food are distributed through the society's food 
locker at Port Hueneme -- a service available to any service member in the 
county. Likewise, sailors are referred to community-based food pantries for 
help during tight times. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said he thinks it is unfair to pay some military personnel so poorly 
that they have to worry about feeding their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an issue of equity," Gallegly said. "These people shouldn't have to 
be on welfare. I'm not saying they all should be driving Corvettes, but they 
shouldn't have to worry about feeding their families either." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly's bill, if enacted, would give the commission $750,000 and six months 
time to prepare a report on the issue. That report could then be used by 
Congress and the President as a blueprint for military pay reform, he said. The 
legislation is awaiting a hearing date before the House Armed Services 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the issue of low pay is gaining momentum within the Department of 
Defense as military leaders become focused on improving the quality of life for 
enlisted personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message is that money is tight and we are choosing people over systems," 
Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch said during a press briefing late last 
month. "For example, if we must delay chemical lasers in space in favor of 
housing for our enlisted people, then (Secretary of Defense William) Perry and 
I will do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Congress earlier this year approved a 2.2% pay hike for the military 
and may approve a larger increase next year, the gap between military and 
civilian pay for comparable jobs is ever widening. Even with the 
congressionally sponsored pay increase, military salaries are not keeping pace 
with inflation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Living on base at Point Mugu, Airman Long and his wife, Lauri, said they would 
gladly accept food stamps if they could get them. But like so many others 
stationed at Port Hueneme or Point Mugu, they make too much money or have too 
many assets to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, local Navy financial counselors say, simply owning a car, 
receiving an off-base housing allowance or having a part-time civilian job can 
push Navy personnel into a higher-income category that prevents them from 
collecting food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenlyn Christenot, a financial educator and counselor at Point Mugu, said that 
perhaps as many as two to three times the number of Navy families that receive 
assistance could actually use food stamps if they qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Christenot said that to qualify for the federal food stamp program, families 
can have no more than $2,000 in personal assets. Owning vehicles worth more 
than $4,500 also disqualifies families from receiving aid. Likewise, if they 
live off base, their Navy housing allowance is normally sufficient to block 
them from receiving help. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way we would qualify," Long said. "Yet if we didn't have a car and 
I didn't work part time, we would be worse off than we are now. The food stamp 
qualifications don't make a lot sense in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal WIC program, which is initiated by a doctor's referral and which 
is generally easier to qualify for, pays out less per family. The WIC program 
is oriented toward helping younger, poorer families supplement their children's 
nutritional needs. 
</P>
<P>
 LeOra Stevenson, the Navy's family services director at the Port Hueneme 
Seabee base, said that younger Navy families stationed in this area have a 
tough time making their limited salaries stretch to accommodate the region's 
high cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to some of the places these people have been, Southern California is 
a very high-cost area," Stevenson said. "We try to teach them that they have to 
very, very carefully manage their money here." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the two family service centers at the bases, the Navy also offers 
financial counseling -- a program that Navy officials says is helping more 
sailors manage their money better. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials said most needy families depend on the incomes of a sailor 
ranked as a petty officer or lower. Very few officers need help, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the Longs, the stress of worrying about money exacts a high toll in 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong, I love what I do and I love serving my country," Long 
said. "But it's tough to make ends meet with a newborn. Lauri and I have found 
money to be a big source of our arguments, (but) I think we're going to make it 
though."

VOLUNTEERS LAY GROUNDWORK; CHARITY: UNITED WAY'S ANNUAL FUND-RAISING CAMPAIGN 
IS LAUNCHED WITH COMMUNITY PROJECTS DURING DAY OF CARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 600 volunteers fanned out across Ventura County on Saturday, kicking off 
United Way's 1994-95 fund-raising campaign with a series of community service 
projects designed to raise the spirit of giving. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, volunteers pulled weeds and spread mulch at an overgrown 
botanical garden. Near Westlake, they laid a new wheelchair ramp at a YMCA 
center tucked behind White Oak Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 From Oak Park to Oxnard, volunteers participated in dozens of urban renewal 
projects during the United Way's sixth annual Day of Caring. 
</P>
<P>
 "This event is really critical," said Bob Quist, administrator of Los Robles 
Regional Medical Center and chairman of the United Way's fund-raising campaign 
in the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people may not be in a position to donate money," added Quist, who 
traded in his coat and tie for a painter's cap Saturday morning. "But this 
gives them an opportunity to provide a few hours of service to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The United Way hopes to raise at least $5.35 million in Ventura County this 
year. Last year, the group fell about $200,000 short of that same goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the organization has embarked on a new strategy, tapping businesses that 
have relocated to the county as a result of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the goals we've had in the Conejo Valley is to get into those 
companies and make sure they are asked to participate in the United Way 
campaign," Quist said. "There is an awful lot of potential for growth in this 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Conejo Valley Botanic Garden in Thousand Oaks, nine members of Girl 
Scout Brownie Troop 117 were battling growth of another kind. They pulled weeds 
and spread mulch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to teach them you've got to get out there and help your 
community," said Sabra Bennett, co-leader of the troop.  
</P>
<P>
 At an elementary school near Westlake, county airports accountant Randy 
Taczynski added a fresh coat of paint to a faded trailer housing a YMCA center. 
He said he gave up a morning of watching college football and professional 
tennis to lend a helping hand to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to make some sacrifices," he said with a laugh. "All that other 
stuff has got to take a back seat."

VALLEY BRIEFING: JUSTICE 101; A COURTROOM PRIMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Smith, Broderick, Bobbit, and soon, live from Los Angeles, Menendez II and 
Simpson. A stream of televised, high profile trials over the past few years has 
brought the courtroom into the living room. Some viewers might grow bored as 
the cases bog down in the minutiae of real-world legal procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 So, let's pause for a brief civics lesson, and to consider the thousands of 
other cases that move through the courts of Los Angeles each year. Even without 
the glare of publicity, each follows the same tortuous path, often at a snail's 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The wheels of justice turn slowly for a reason. Although each case is 
different, bringing with it varying factual circumstances and legal issues, 
every criminal case follows certain steps. A simple case usually takes from six 
months to a year; a complex case can take years. This is especially true of 
murder cases in which the death penalty is sought. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson case, in comparison, can be said to be moving at the speed of 
light. A Criminal Case Goes To Trial 
</P>
<P>
 1) FILING or INDICTMENT: Police may arrest someone on suspicion of committing 
a crime, but only the district attorney or city attorney can file charges. The 
district attorney handles felonies, the city attorney misdemeanors. In some 
cases, prosecutors use the grand jury, which has the power to subpoena 
witnesses. If the grand jury issues an indictment, the case heads directly to 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 2) ARRAIGNMENT: The arraignment, or formal reading of the charges, occurs 
before a Municipal Court judge. The exception is grand jury cases, which bypass 
Municipal Court. Suspects must be arraigned within 48 hours of arrest, or 
within 72 hours if the arrest occurs over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 3) PRELIMINARY HEARING: The hearing is a mini-trial to determine whether the 
prosecution has brought enough evidence to show that a crime occurred and that 
the defendant probably committed it. If the Municipal Court judge agrees such 
evidence exists, the defendant is "bound over" for Superior Court trial. A 
defendant is entitled to the hearing within 10 days of arraignment, but it is 
usually postponed with the defendant's consent, known as "waiving time." 
</P>
<P>
 4) PLEA NEGOTIATIONS: Some charges are usually dismissed in exchange for the 
plea to other counts. Prosecutors and defense attorneys generally agree on the 
sentence, but their arrangement is not binding on a judge. After the plea, the 
probation department prepares a background report on the defendant and 
recommends a sentence. The judge is not bound by that report, either. The 
sentence can vary on a number of variables, including the seriousness of the 
crime and the defendant's history of past crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 5) SUPERIOR COURT: The journey through Superior Court again begins with an 
arraignment. A defendant has the right to a trial within 60 days, but most 
agree to "waive time." If a defendant pleads guilty or "no contest," a 
sentencing date is set. If the plea is not guilty, the judge will schedule 
dates to hear various legal motions, usually filed by the defense. The motions 
can challenge, for example, whether police obtained evidence legally. 
</P>
<P>
 6) TRIAL: There are two types of trials. A trial by a judge, sitting without a 
jury, is known as a "bench" or "court" trial. Most defendants opt for trial by 
jury. Each lawyer is given a certain number of "preemptory challenges," which 
they can use to strike a juror without explanation. After 12 jurors are chosen, 
two to six alternate jurors are chosen. Trial Issues 
</P>
<P>
 * BURDEN OF PROOF: Because defendants are presumed innocent, the prosecution 
has the burden of proof and presents its evidence first. If the case continues, 
the defense may present witnesses. The defendant is under no obligation to 
testify, and jurors are instructed not to consider it if he doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 * VERDICT: If the jurors can't agree on a verdict, a mistrial is declared and 
prosecutors will decide whether to retry the case or dismiss the charges. If 
the defendant is found guilty, a sentencing report is prepared by a probation 
officer and the judge imposes sentence, usually within three months after the 
verdict. The verdict may be appealed. Tough Sentences 
</P>
<P>
 California's state prison population is about 125,319. More than a third of 
them were sentenced in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Aug. 1, 1994: 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County - 37.3% 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego County - 8% 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County - 4.9% 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara County - 4.9% 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento County - 4.2% Volume of Cases 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties account for a third of all criminal 
cases and civil lawsuits filed in California. 
</P>
<P>
 1992-93 
</P>
<P>
 State Total: 1,017,798 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County: 291,203 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County: 77,136 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County: 21,311 Judicial Burden 
</P>
<P>
 Cases per judge in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties are about the 
same, but in sprawling Los Angeles County many more judges share the load.

 Judge Robert M. Letteau, supervising judge for the Van Nuys branch of the Los 
Angeles County Superior Court, says the 23 Van Nuys and 16 San Fernando judges 
are experimenting with ways to make the cases flow more smoothly. They fill for 
each other, and some Superior Court judges have agreed to take felony pleas in 
Municipal Court, clearing many cases before they can become backlogged. 
According to Letteau, there are about 65 cases outstanding per judicial 
position. The two courts have shared space since the San Fernando Courthouse 
was damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake.

STUDENTS MARCH FOR CLUB; PROTEST: DEMONSTRATORS DEMAND REINSTATEMENT OF MECHA, 
A CHICANO GROUP AT GOLDEN WEST COLLEGE. THEY MAKE DEMANDS LINKED TO A SIT-IN 
THAT LED TO ARRESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Carrying a makeshift coffin signifying the death of a Chicano club at Golden 
West College, about 100 demonstrators marched down Beach Boulevard and Edinger 
Avenue Saturday to rally community support for their banned organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers honked horns in support of the marchers as they walked two miles to 
the quadrangle on the college campus where administrators are refusing to 
recognize MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan) as an official 
student club. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because this is an assassination of MEChA, we're taking the corpse back to 
the institution that killed it," said Rodney Burge, 35, a former Golden West 
student and a MEChA member in the 1970s. "We will bring it back to life." 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters made nine demands of Golden West President Philip Westin, 
including a request that he drop all charges against four students arrested 
during a rally on campus earlier this month. They also called on Westin and 
Coast Community College District Chancellor William M. Vega, who oversees 
Golden West, to attend a town hall meeting later this month to address the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The demands, drafted by the four arrested students who call themselves Los 
Cuatro Justice Committee, also included an order for Westin to rescind all 
memoranda related to the suspension and probation of MEChA and to allow the 
banned club to organize a Chicano/Mexicano Day on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 They also want Westin to observe Mexican holidays, create a student advisory 
board to advise the administration on Chicano issues, establish a Chicano 
studies department and end alleged harassment and discrimination against MEChA 
members and advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Westin could not be reached for comment Saturday but has said he suspended the 
club last spring because it sponsored a fund-raiser where alcohol was allegedly 
used. Members said there was no alcohol at the fund-raiser. Westin has said he 
will not recognize MEChA as an official club on campus unless it chooses new 
officers and a new adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the demands presented Saturday were raised at the last rally held 
Sept. 1, when former MEChA President Lupe Lopez, 20, of Stanton; Ana Carbajal, 
28, of Garden Grove; and Claudia Rochin, 20, of Westminster chained their 
wrists and staged a sit-in in Westin's office. The three students were dragged 
away by police and taken to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 They were booked on suspicion of trespassing and disrupting campus business. 
Rochin also was booked on suspicion of felony assault on a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 David Rojas, 22, of Fullerton, was also arrested Sept. 1 as he walked down a 
hall outside Westin's office. He was booked on suspicion of prohibiting police 
activity and resisting arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's rally "was meant to let the community know about our cause," said 
MEChA President Luis Guizar, 19. "We're going to keep on fighting until our 
demands are met." 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration, which began at Westminster Cemetery at the corner of Bolsa 
Avenue and Beach Boulevard and ended at the college with speeches about 
injustices against Latinos throughout the country, was attended by community 
leaders, parents, students, high school, college and university MEChA clubs 
from Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 2 1/2-hour rally, demonstrators chanted "Long live MEChA!" in 
Spanish, and "MEChA si, Westin no!" 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Ortiz, 50, an activist from San Jose who fights for rights of 
incarcerated youths, called Westin's actions "shameful." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our right to have associations and organizations on college campuses so 
that our people are represented," she said. "What is happening here is 
shameful, and the community has to denounce it." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Brenda Soria, 19, a Mesa College student from San Diego: "We're here to 
support our brothers and sisters at Golden West, and we're not going to let 
(administrators) take MEChA away without a fight. Sometimes that's all we 
have."

BROWN OPENS HEADQUARTERS IN SANTA ANA; POLITICS: CANDIDATE EMPHASIZES UCI POLL 
INDICATING WILSON'S SUPPORT IN REPUBLICAN STRONGHOLD IS WANING. SHE STILL 
TRAILS HIM LOCALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Buoyed by a recent UC Irvine poll that indicates Gov. Pete Wilson's popularity 
in Orange County has stalled, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown came to town 
Saturday to open her local campaign headquarters before a crowd of more than 
100 supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown repeatedly assailed the governor's record on crime, education and the 
economy during a spirited 20-minute stump speech. The Democratic challenger 
said she is determined to have a strong showing in Republican-rich Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going after Republican votes, independent votes, Perot votes," Brown 
said to cheering supporters who crowded into the vacant law office downtown -- 
one of a dozen campaign offices Brown opened around the state Saturday. Orange 
County was the only one she visited. 
</P>
<P>
 A UC Irvine poll released last week showed that Wilson's voter support in 
Orange County is below the 2-to-1 ration he needs on Election Day to offset 
Democratic strongholds elsewhere in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson is leading Brown in Orange County by 18 points among all registered 
votes and by 22 points among likely voters, according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to cut down Pete Wilson's lead and to succeed in building a 
strong Democratic base (in Orange County)," Brown said in a brief interview 
after the rally. "That is the issue in this campaign. (Wilson) is weakest in 
his base." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur downplayed the significance of the poll 
Saturday night and called Brown "brave" for opening a campaign headquarters in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Brown has got to be the only candidate who is encouraged by a poll 
that shows she is 22 points behind," Schnur said. "We expect to win Orange 
County by a 2-to-1 margin." 
</P>
<P>
 During her speech, Brown mentioned a recent comment by Orange County 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, a Wilson supporter, who called the treasurer 
"gutsy" for coming to the county last month to campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am gutsy!" Brown said. "I'm going to be one gutsy gov!"  
</P>
<P>
 She urged supporters to "get in Pete Wilson's face. Be a gutsy Democrat in 
Orange County like Kathleen Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown later said she thinks the top three concerns of Orange County residents 
are "good jobs, good schools and a safe community. That's what Pete Wilson has 
taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was introduced by Santa Ana Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr., who stepped 
in at the last minute because state Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) had 
to leave before Brown arrived almost an hour late. 
</P>
<P>
 During a brief speech, Umberg, who is the Democratic nominee for state 
attorney general, urged supporters to register and educate voters, and to make 
sure to get the vote out on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is extraordinarily important," Umberg said. "It's very, very 
important that we do well right here in the belly of the beast."

GIRL, 6, HIT BY CAR, CRITICALLY HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 6-year-old girl was struck and critically injured by a car Saturday morning 
as she tried to cross the street in a quiet residential neighborhood, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was attempting to cross the street about 9 a.m. in the 10400 block of 
Debra Avenue when she was struck by a Nissan Maxima driven by Rozik Nazarian, 
52, of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured girl's 8-year-old brother watched from the sidewalk, police said. 
Police did not know whether the children were being supervised by an adult at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, whom police declined to identify, was flown to Children's Hospital 
in Hollywood and was in critical condition on a life-support system, a nursing 
supervisor said. Police said the child suffered severe head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girl crossed the street mid-block," said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Ben Lee. 
"The driver said she didn't see her until it was too late."  
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Nazarian was driving about 45 m.p.h., a speed that is not 
considered reckless, police said. Nazarian was not arrested, but the 
investigation will continue, Lee said.

2-YEAR-OLD BOY DROWNS IN JACUZZI; SWIMMING: POLICE SAY ANOTHER CHILD WAS 
WATCHING THE VICTIM, THOUGH HIS PARENTS WERE IN AN ADJACENT POOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 2-year-old boy drowned in a Jacuzzi just a few feet away from where his 
parents were swimming in the adjacent pool, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 6 p.m. Friday, the parents of Keith Bell found the toddler under 
water in the Jacuzzi at their home in the 10200 block of Plainview Avenue.The 
boy did not know how to swim, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently the boy was being attended to by another young child" in the 
Jacuzzi as his parents swam in the larger pool, said Los Angeles Police Officer 
Dennis Watkins. "They just turned their back momentarily and he was under 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said the Bell family had moved in about three months ago and used 
the swimming pool every weekend. They said they had never seen Keith in the 
pool unattended. 
</P>
<P>
 The toddler was pronounced dead at Verdugo Hills Hospital, according to Bob 
Collis, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The child abuse unit is investigating, which is routine, police said. Police 
are calling it an accident at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents were totally distraught," Watkins said.

CAMPAIGN '94: ISSUES AND ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two candidates are running in the Nov. 8 election to represent the 68th 
Assembly District. They are Democrat Irv Pickler, an Anaheim councilman, and 
Republican Curt Pringle, the incumbent, of Garden Grove. Here's how they stand 
on four issues. "Three Strikes" Crime Law 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler: "I support "three strikes" legislation. I am also strongly in favor 
of the recently approved "one strike" law that will jail child molesters and 
rapists. One offense is too many, and criminals such as these are normally 
repeat offenders who will commit the crime again and again if given the chance, 
and that is a chance that we simply cannot take." 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle: "I strongly favor, and voted for, the "three strikes" law. This law 
correctly focuses law enforcement efforts against the relatively few repeat 
offenders who commit a hugely disproportionate amount of crime. Additionally, 
contrary to opponents' rhetoric, I support the present "three strikes" law that 
puts criminals behind bars regardless of whether a third felony is violent or 
not. I do not believe we should wait for the individual to commit another 
violent felony against society before getting locked up for life." Measure to 
Curtail Benefits to Illegal Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler: "There's no question that something needs to be done to stem the tide 
of illegal immigration into this country. But most of our problems with 
immigration have much more to do with not enforcing existing laws than it does 
with passing new laws. Denying (non-emergency) medical care to non-citizens 
would instantly create an underclass of people that our communities would have 
to absorb one way or another, therefore putting a huge burden on our local 
resources. And at a time where we are cutting city budgets rather than adding 
to them, I wonder where we are going to find the money to deal with a problem 
that isn't going to disappear if this law is enacted, especially since our own 
governor has had to resort to suing the federal government for money we can't 
expect to see any time soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle: "Illegal immigration is one of the chief causes of the explosive 
growth in welfare programs that is bankrupting California. Our overburdened 
prison and public education systems are also strained by illegal immigration. 
Illegal is illegal, and the taxpayers of California cannot afford to pay for 
benefits to those here illegally. I have supported the proposal embodied in 
'Save Our State' when they were voted on in the Legislature, and I strongly 
support the SOS initiative. It is outrageous that the Legislature did not pass 
this law, forcing the public to sponsor this initiative to stop these 
benefits." Single-Payer Health Initiative 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler: "I support universal health care for all Americans. However, I would 
like to see what happens on the federal level in terms of health care reform 
before California votes on its own version of a single-payer plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle: "There are changes to be made in health care, but the single-payer 
initiative is definitely not the answer. It is full of massive increases in 
income and payroll taxes, and would turn all Californians' health care over to 
the government. Despite the huge tax increases in this initiative, studies show 
this system running a $30-billion deficit in just a few years. To lower costs 
and increase access to health care, I would support tort reform to lower legal 
costs and tax-deductible medical savings accounts to empower consumers to seek 
quality, private health care in the free market." Future Uses For El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler: "I have long favored converting El Toro into a commercial airport. We 
face the reality of base closures here in California, and that means we have to 
find ways to make use of the property to keep the economy strong. The first 
step is to ensure that the land is environmentally safe after the many years of 
military use; cleanup will be necessary. The payoff in terms of jobs is 
substantial -- around 20,000 for the county. Also, John Wayne Airport has 
become far too crowded to accommodate much more air traffic. In short, a 
commercial airport at El Toro makes sense for Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle: "I would support the development of a commercial airport at El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station if this proposal is economically feasible. This means 
I would like this airport to be financed, built and run at no cost to the 
taxpayers. Orange County needs additional airport capacity to support economic 
growth into the 21st Century. I believe that a privatized airport at El Toro 
would provide the airport needed for our economy without being a burden to the 
taxpayers."

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
COMPLAINTS? SAVE THEM FOR THE CANDIDATES WHO MAY SOON COME CALLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking for more police officers in your neighborhood? Are you angry with your 
state legislators for taking a pay raise? Or maybe you are trying to keep a 
regional airport out of your back yard? 
</P>
<P>
 Then get ready, because you may have a chance to register your complaints when 
your neighborhood candidate comes knocking on your door. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, folks. The post-Labor Day march toward the Nov. 8 election is 
underway. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the campaign signs start popping up along major roadways and your 
mailboxes are stuffed with political junk mail, you'll be able to spot the 
candidate a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbents--the ones who never returned your telephone calls--are the ones 
who now greet you warmly while trying to sell tickets to political 
fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the challengers--the ones wearing the larger name tags--may be working 
even harder because they are less known and usually have fewer campaign 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In political circles, it is the kingmakers who hold the keys to huge campaign 
war chests who are more popular than the politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mail box has been real full and I've had lots and lots of phone calls," 
says Santa Ana businessman Doy Henley, president of the conservative Lincoln 
Club of Orange County that has pledged at least $200,000 on local city council 
and state legislative races. 
</P>
<P>
 The slump in the economy has made fund raising more difficult, Henley adds, 
and that means that those doling out the money are having to say "no" more 
often than they used to. "We tell (those not getting money) that they are in 
our prayers," says Republican Assembly leader Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga), 
who was in town last week for a fund-raiser for Marilyn C. Brewer, the GOP 
nominee in the 70th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte and other Republican caucus leaders have agreed to spend $1.5 million 
to $2 million on 10 Assembly races statewide in an effort to increase their 
numbers in Sacramento from 33 to 36. 
</P>
<P>
 But with voter turnout at an all-time low in the June primary, and citizens 
showing more interest in ballot initiatives than in the candidates, those 
seeking office are going to have to do more than stand on their heads to get 
voters' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Mike Farber, for example, is using a cartoon to help build suspense 
in his campaign to beat (up on) Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) in the 
46th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrat is drawn as a muscular boxer, facing a smaller, scrawny-looking 
Dornan. "It's coming. . . . Fight for the 46th," the cartoon announces. "Join 
the team that will return sanity to Orange County politics." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with voter apathy was illustrated on the necktie Brulte wore 
during his recent visit here. It depicts a conversation between two cartoon 
characters. "So who did you vote for the last time, pal?" the first voter asks. 
"That happens to be very private information, pal," the second voter replies. 
"I didn't vote either," the first voter confesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So in case you hadn't noticed, Politics '94 offers a few telltale signs that 
the wild ride on this year's political roller coaster is rolling down the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ross Perot is coming to town. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot's speech Friday night at the Sequoia Conference Center in Buena Park 
will be his first in Orange County since the February, 1993, kickoff of his 
national political organization, United We Stand. Sharing the stage with Perot 
will be Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton), state Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy 
(R-Arcadia) and Tom McClintock, the Republican nominee for state controller. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gov. Wilson is likely to be in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has been spending a lot of time here, including his attendance last 
week at a news conference announcing more than 130 arrests in a Santa Ana drug 
sweep. Good timing too. A UC Irvine poll released the day before showed him 
with 50% support in Orange County, which the pollster said was not enough to 
offset Democratic strongholds in other counties and guarantee a statewide win 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
 * Even the Democrats are coming to town. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to demonstrate that Democrats will be competitive in GOP territory, 
members of the state Democratic Party Executive Committee will meet here next 
weekend and then fan out across central Orange County to knock on doors for 
their candidates. The usually underdog Democrats--they hold only one 
legislative seat in Orange County--also are setting up seven local campaign 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 * The fund-raisers seem endless. 
</P>
<P>
 Some offer all-star politicians, others serve up cuisine ranging from 
barbecues to Italian dinners. One for Laguna Beach Mayor Ann Christoph boasted 
the location: " . . . at the elegant and contemporary Marc Singer-designed home 
of Betsy and Gary Jenkins." 
</P>
<P>
 * Challengers are asking: "Where's the incumbent?" 
</P>
<P>
 When Assemblyman Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) was a no-show for a cable 
television taping on children's issues, his opponents--Democrat Lee Walker and 
Libertarian B. Wade Hostler--teamed up to criticize Morrow for "laying low." 
But the Morrow camp says two other candidate forums are already on his 
calendar. Registration Struggles 
</P>
<P>
 As the fall campaign season gets going, Democrats and Republicans will turn to 
registration drives to increase voter support. Four central Orange County 
districts with high minority populations will be the main battleground.

<P>
 Members of the Camarillo chapter of the Junior Chamber of Commerce are 
accepting nominations for outstanding young farmer in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the nonprofit group, also known as the Jaycees, said the only 
requirements are that the nominee be between 21 and 35 years old, live in the 
county and derive at least 50% of his or her income from the farming industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We judge each person on their ability to help out in the agriculture 
community, whether it be from working in the field, processing or anything else 
that has to do with the agriculture industry," said Walter Morris, a Jaycee who 
owns the Island Enterprises promotional firm in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll look at their contribution to their community as well as their own 
business and the industry itself," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The local winner will be submitted to the California Jaycees, which will honor 
its top five outstanding young farmers in the state at a reception in November. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Morris said, the state finalist will be named and submitted to 
the national competition for outstanding young farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nomination forms can be obtained by calling 389-5285. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CITY OFFICIAL TO TAKE JOB IN EL SEGUNDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley's economic development coordinator will leave the city later this 
month to start a similar program in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hansen, 48, has worked for Simi Valley as a deputy city manager in charge 
of economic development for about two years.His last day on the job will be 
Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to take the El Segundo job because it will allow him to help shape 
the redevelopment policy of a city plagued by downsizing in the aerospace 
industry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a real challenge with lots of room for creativity," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen's new post will take him from the bedroom community of Simi Valley, 
where half the 102,000 residents commute to work, to the work center of El 
Segundo, where 70,000 commuters a day flock to a city with a population of only 
about 18,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new post, Hansen will earn $77,200, up from the $73,000 he received 
working for Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 During his two years in Simi Valley, Hansen helped steer the city through 
tough economic times, devoting much of his efforts to securing a deal with 
Price Club for a new store on the city's west end. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Lin Koester praised Hansen's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim has done a good job coordinating our economic development agenda over the 
past two years," Koester said. "I wish him well." SARA CATANIA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; JANSS MALL MAKES NEW REQUEST FOR SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first public hearing in Thousand Oaks' brand-new City Hall on Tuesday 
might inspire a strong sense of deja vu . 
</P>
<P>
 Although the setting will be novel, the issue will be a retread: a developer's 
request to build monument signs bearing Mervyn's name outside the soon-to-be 
renovated Janss Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The council turned down the Janss Corp.'s application in a 2-2 vote last 
spring, with Mayor Alex Fiore absent. Mervyn's representatives will return to 
the council at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday to try again, hoping Fiore's tie-breaking vote 
will go their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore has said he sympathizes with the department store's need for visible 
signs and would support some attractive monuments identifying Mervyn's as a 
major mall tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski, who opposed the original request last spring, 
said she was not convinced the signs would help draw shoppers to Mervyn's. "If 
it can be demonstrated, after the project is complete, that large businesses in 
the mall are at a disadvantage, most certainly I could see that the city would 
want to assist them. But not right now," Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's public hearing, the Janss Corp. will request identification for 
both Mervyn's and Toys R Us on four walls to be built at mall entrances. The 
developer also seeks bigger letters spelling out Toys R Us on the store's 
exterior wall. STEPHANIE SIMON

YMCA AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM COMES UP SHORT; CHILD CARE: ORGANIZATION HAD APPLIED 
TO SUPERVISE 200 EXTRA YOUTHS THIS ACADEMIC YEAR BUT WAS DENIED. IT'S NOW 
ADDING MORE SLOTS TO ACCOMMODATE CHILDREN OF PARENTS WHO AREN'T AT HOME. 
</P>

 Parents in the Capistrano Unified School District who thought they had 
everything in place for the new school year received an unpleasant surprise 
this week when the YMCA told them there wasn't room for their children in the 
agency's extended day-care program. 
</P>
<P>
 The YMCA had asked the State Department of Social Services last March for 
permission to add almost 200 children to its South County morning and 
after-school child care programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But citing problems the state has had in the past with the Orange County YMCA 
-- including what it called inadequate child supervision, improper 
documentation of staff qualifications, and use of unsafe play areas -- the 
department on Aug. 23 denied the YMCA's request to care for a greater number of 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations continued, but nothing had been worked out by Thursday, the first 
day of school. 
</P>
<P>
 That left the parents of older children the YMCA wanted to move into more 
loosely supervised programs -- so it could get younger children in the 
structured day-care program -- in the lurch. 
</P>
<P>
 However, by Friday Social Services had approved a majority of the requested 
increases, reducing the number of children the YMCA could care for at other 
Orange County schools where demand for day care has dropped, and increasing the 
student limits at South County schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the issues worked out to get through the school year," said Art 
Wannlund, president of the Orange County YMCA. "I think we're going to take the 
time necessary to work with licensing to get this resolved on a longer-term 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Wannlund said Capistrano Unified's rapid population growth has complicated the 
YMCA's day-care plans at schools there. "What has made this unusual," he said, 
"is that Capistrano Unified opened five new schools and the elementary school 
boundaries were redefined. The system isn't set up to respond quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Social Services would not release the details of the agreement, saying the 
final legal touches on the document will be complete by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wannlund, the YMCA day-care programs at four Capistrano Unified 
elementary schools have received permission to have more students than they had 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo Vista in Rancho Santa Margarita will go from 96 to 144 slots, while 
Viejo in Mission Viejo will have 140 students, 44 more than last year. Reilly 
Elementary in Mission Viejo can accept 60 students, up 30 from last year, and 
White Elementary in Laguna Niguel will increase from 51 to 96 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, the state and the YMCA will discuss requested increases at Hidden 
Hills Elementary in Laguna Niguel and Barcelona Hills Elementary in Mission 
Viejo, Wannlund said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Working parents said they were happy that an agreement had finally been worked 
out, but said they hope that next time negotiations between the state and the 
YMCA are quicker and completed longer before the start of school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents and children are being manipulated by both sides in this issue," 
said Ken LeDuc, whose two children at Reilly Elementary had been asked by the 
YMCA to be in the more loosely supervised drop-in program, in which the 
children may come and go as they please. "We have issues with the state where 
they must change, but there are also places the Y has screwed up and not 
checked all the boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints by frustrated parents have even caught the eye of local 
legislators, who are considering co-authoring a bill to revamp the licensing 
process for extended day-care programs for elementary school-age children, said 
Betty Anderson, district coordinator for Assemblyman William Morrow 
(R-Oceanside). 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone enjoys being caught up in this mess," Anderson said. "We 
don't need more latchkey kids out there."

ALCOHOL-SALE STING RESULTS IN 8 CITATIONS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: POLICE CADET POSED 
AS AN UNDERAGE CUSTOMER AT 19 PLACES SELLING LIQUOR IN BREA AND YORBA LINDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight businesses have been cited for selling alcohol to minors in a sting 
organized to coincide with the beginning of the school year, police said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brea Police Department's Special Enforcement Detail enlisted a police 
cadet as an underage decoy to try to buy alcohol from 10 establishments in Brea 
and nine in Yorba Linda, including supermarkets, restaurants and convenience 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said eight businesses were cited, while two juveniles in Brea were 
detained at one store after they tried to get someone to buy alcohol for them. 
The juveniles were later released to their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 One man cited for selling alcohol to the decoy at a convenience store was also 
arrested on an outstanding warrant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before sending out the decoy, the department sent letters to all businesses 
with liquor licenses in the two cities, reminding them of the law involving 
alcohol sales to minors, and warning of routine undercover stings used by the 
department. Establishments that weren't cited will be sent follow-up letters 
letting them know the sting took place and that their employees followed the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a representative of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Department was 
involved in the sting and will consider further action against the 
establishments, including fines and license suspensions.

THREE PEOPLE WOUNDED BY GANG GUNFIRE IN SANTA ANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 25-year-old woman and two men were seriously injured early Saturday when 
they were caught in gang-related cross-fire from unknown assailants, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Corona was in critical condition at a Santa Ana hospital Saturday after 
being shot while sitting in a parked car in the 1300 block of West Pine Street, 
Police Sgt. Dennis Rios said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other victims, Charles Camacho, 18, and Gabriel Chairez, 23, also were 
being treated at local hospitals. Chairez was listed in critical condition and 
Camacho was in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men were driving with two other people about 2:15 a.m.. They turned 
onto Pine Street from South Bristol Street, when the occupants of car following 
them opened fire, Rios said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullets from a large-caliber gun struck both men several times in the upper 
body, while a stray bullet hit Corona, who as sitting in another car parked on 
the street, Rios said. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made and motive was not known. The department's gang 
detail was investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Don Robertson said the shootings took place about five blocks from where 
one of the city's toughest police crackdowns took place last week, leading to 
indictments against more than 100 people on drug and other charges. The sweep 
targeted the 6th Street gang members and associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson said that "at this point there appears to be no connection" between 
the sweep and Saturday's shooting, which is believed to have been committed by 
a different gang.

CHEFS SERVE UP TASTEFUL FUND-RAISER; BENEFIT: GOURMET DISHES AT MISSION COLLEGE 
FETE PLEASE PALATES OF 400 PATRONS SUPPORTING CULINARY PROGRAM.

 Natural grillade of venison, vanilla bean creme brulee and penne with roasted 
duck were just some of the delicacies on offer Saturday at the American 
Culinary Federation benefit held at Los Angeles Mission College. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival attracted 400 guests who paid $20 each for unlimited helpings of 
gourmet dishes and fine wine brought and prepared by a collection of chefs from 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just wonderful," said Mary Dahlsten of Sylmar, as she sat back in her 
chair with a slice of chocolate cake and a glass of Chardonnay. "People pay $20 
for a restaurant meal, and this is so much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Dahlsten, 78, said she sampled stuffed mushrooms, pecan pie and grilled 
venison. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all delightful," she said with a laugh, "but you just couldn't sample 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Chefs from Universal Studios, the Cheesecake Factory, Virginia Country Club 
and various catering establishments dished out their specialties alongside 
students from the culinary program at Mission College, which will receive a 
portion of the proceeds from the benefit. The remainder will be split among 
other culinary programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students really pulled together for this," said Rudy Garcia, Mission 
College executive chef and instructor. "They were nervous, but they came out 
and stood side by side with these chefs to watch and learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Culinary student Jay Jenkins, 46, said the benefit brought a little culture to 
a community not often exposed to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is great for the community to bring this culinary atmosphere to Sylmar," 
Jenkins said. "And it would be nice to be known for something besides 
earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins, an employee at Lockheed in Burbank for 28 years, said he returned to 
school and joined the culinary program to prepare for a new career. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are downsizing in the aerospace industry, and I thought I would go back 
to school and learn how to be a chef," Jenkins said as he served the quiche 
Lorraine, spinach quiche and honey-mustard chicken he prepared.

remnants of her samplings. "I can taste everything."

STATE DRUG AGENTS ARREST 5, DESTROY MARIJUANA FARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State narcotics agents destroyed a 4,000-plant marijuana farm Saturday in 
Diamond Bar that they said they discovered by accident while conducting aerial 
surveillance in an unrelated drug case. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents said they arrested five Mexican men, believed to be in this country 
illegally, who had been tending the farm.The men were living in several tents 
and lean-tos, equipped with kitchens and showers, on hilly, brushy and 
tree-shaded terrain just northwest of where Diamond Bar Boulevard crosses the 
Orange Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents said marijuana farms this big are unusual in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up in Northern California, we see this operation constantly," said Agent Walt 
Kaiser of the state Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement. "Basically, you have a 
financier in the background and he hires these people for $200 a week to take 
care of the garden. Their job is to water the plants and run off anyone who 
comes by." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the plants were in three distinct gardens along drainage ditches on 
the fringe of land that a major oil company leased to a local cattle rancher. 
Kaiser declined to identify the company or the rancher, saying neither was 
involved. The farm was hidden outside a fenced area where the rancher grazed 
his cattle, Kaiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent estimated the plants would have produced marijuana worth about $1.6 
million.

CYPRESS MAN SOUGHT IN TWO ROBBERIES ARRESTED AT AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old man suspected of committing two robberies and shooting a man in 
the head during one of them was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport 
Saturday as he stepped off a plane from Tucson, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Fidel Gutierrez of Cypress was arrested following a two-month 
investigation by La Palma police, said Sgt. Ed Ethell. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez, described by authorities as a member of a Hawaiian Gardens gang, is 
suspected of being one of two men who robbed a 7-Eleven on June 26 of an 
undisclosed amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethell said that as Gutierrez and his accomplice left the store, they fired a 
shot at the store clerk as he attempted to write down their license plate. The 
clerk was not hit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez is also a suspect in the Aug. 3 robbery of a Rockview Dairy located 
across the street from the convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
 During the second robbery, a man servicing a California Lottery machine inside 
the dairy was shot in the head but his injuries were not life-threatening, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both businesses are located at the intersection of Crescent and Moody streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez was being held at Buena Park City Jail on suspicion of attempted 
homicide and robbery, police said.

ONE CAN'T TURN AWAY FROM THE SCREAMS OF CHILD ABUSE; WRITER OF STORYBOOKS FOR 
YOUNG PEOPLE HAS A CHILLING ENCOUNTER WITH THE HORROR OF THE VIOLATION. SHE 
PLEDGES TO DEDICATE HERSELF TO HELPING THE HELPLESS.

 "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me." Of course 
the brave childhood comeback wasn't quite true. Other children's unkind words 
did hurt. But those hurts would usually pass. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the case with the injuries caused by taunts, sticks, stones, fists 
and other forms of violence used by some parents on their young. For a myriad 
of reasons, and all too often, some parents do hurt, some even torture and kill 
their young. We all know this. Its nothing new. Yet we continue to tolerate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, for me at least, child abuse was far away, like a make-believe 
horror story on television, a horror story one could never quite understand or 
bear to watch. I could always change the station. 
</P>
<P>
 I write children's storybooks created to elevate the ethics of the next 
generation, to teach tolerance and understanding. To me, the following true 
story seems to be more than a coincidence. It seems more like a message: Wake 
up and do something! 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago I installed a nationwide 800 number at our office in 
Northridge. People could telephone this number, ask questions and place orders 
directly with us for storybooks about real-life situations. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, an ominous series of calls was mixed in among the rest. 
Almost daily we would receive calls from people who had misdialed. They were 
trying to reach a hot line designed to prevent child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've dialed the wrong number," we would tell the caller, not knowing at the 
time what number they needed to dial. Yet, so often the caller only seemed to 
be half listening. Often one could hear the cries or screams of children in the 
background. Often I would find myself jolted from the complacency of my world 
and momentarily dropped into the terror of theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 We had all heard the stories, but here was reality. . . . A father who wanted 
my input on the potential harm if he were to rape his 4-month-old daughter 
lying naked next to him. The mother of a 9-month-old who was convinced the 
child was trying to "get her goat" by crying. In call after call after call, 
parents asked for the free brochure being offered by the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 And these were parents who recognized they had a problem! These were parents 
who were trying to get help, trying to somehow change or understand the 
dynamics of their situation. What about all of those who refused to even 
contemplate the evil of their action? 
</P>
<P>
 Abuse of children is all too commonplace and all too often excused, tolerated. 
"Mind your own business. Who are you to tell me how to raise my kid!" 
</P>
<P>
 I decided that the time had passed for turning my head away, that each of us 
has a responsibility to confront evil and protect the powerless, the helpless. 
</P>
<P>
 It is our business to help any child being abused by any adult. If we don't 
prevent abuse, we deserve the violent society we have come to see every day on 
our streets and on television. If we want our children to live in a less 
violent environment, we had better raise them in one and find a way to make 
sure our neighbors do too. 
</P>
<P>
 I changed my 800 number because I was asked to do so, so the callers could get 
the help they needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Those calls have been the catalyst for me. Though we have just released a book 
titled "Sarah," which focuses on childhood sexual abuse, the next one I will 
write will focus on other forms of child abuse. It will be called "Words and 
Stones and Bones." 
</P>
<P>
 I will fight to eliminate child abuse through the medium of the storybook. 
</P>
<P>
 What will you do?

SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM; CONTRARY TO THE WAY THE BETS ARE 
SHAPING UP, IT IS NOT SYBERT BUT BEILENSON WHOSE RECORD AND AGENDA ARE MOST IN 
TUNE WITH THE VOTERS OF THE 24TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. 
</P>

By MARC LITCHMAN, Political consultant Marc Litchman is a former chief of staff

City).

<TEXT>
<P>
 The most confounded clatter in all of politics is the din of conventional 
wisdom. Imagine going to the track and finding there were no long shots, no 
exactas -- everyone just walking in single file placing their bets on the 
favorite. That's congressional politics today, especially in California. And 
nowhere is that more true than in the 24th District, which stretches across the 
west San Fernando Valley and into eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish I had a buck for every Republican strategist who looked at the 
district's registration figures and mistakenly deduced that the incumbent is 
too liberal or that it should be represented by a Republican because the party 
enjoys a numerical edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats outnumber Republicans in the 24th, 46.46% to 39.91%. That's right, 
Democrats outnumber Republicans, but the Republicans have the edge. For many 
years the conventionally wise thought a district must be at least 55% 
Democratic to be "safe" for Democrats. That assumption makes Rep. Anthony 
Beilenson a sitting duck. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, as many as 20% of the Democrats in some districts have not 
been loyal voters in recent years. Registered Democrats voted for Reagan and 
Bush when presented with Mondale and Dukakis. Bobbi Fiedler, a Republican, 
defeated Congressman Jim Corman for a "safe" Democratic seat when busing 
locally and Reagan nationally pushed Democrats into the Republican camp. 
</P>
<P>
 In the L.A. area, Beilenson and South Bay Democrat Jane Harman hold seats that 
are "marginal" and were once thought to be the exclusive domain of the 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The old rules don't apply. The Reagan coalition is no more. The party is so 
fractured due to disagreement on critical issues like a woman's right to choose 
abortion, banning assault weapons and the radical right's intrusion into 
people's private lives. Will Rogers once said that he was not a member of an 
organized political party -- he was a Democrat. Today those words no doubt hit 
close to home for most Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the boat Beilenson's opponent, Richard Sybert, finds himself in: a 
fractured party, a carpetbagger background (in Sacramento he was an aide to 
Gov. Pete Wilson) and positions hopelessly on the wrong side of, or neutralized 
on, the issues that are most important to the district's voters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Had Sybert looked past the numbers in the 24th, he might have decided to run 
against the somnambulant Carlos Moorhead in his hometown of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Los Angeles County and eastern Ventura County are closer-knit than 
most places in the basin. Sybert offended his primary opponents and party when 
he set up shop and bought the primary with hundreds of thousands of his own 
dollars. His affiliation with Wilson's bumbling and tax hike no doubt didn't 
endear him to the more conservative wing of the party, which populates the 
Thousand Oaks/Westlake Village parts of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a disciple of Wilson's politics and buying a primary out without paying 
your dues don't get you invitations to Sunday dinner. To win, Sybert must hold 
his 39.91% and cut into Beilenson's 46.46%. He starts out in the hole because 
the local party may sit on its hands. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, he is going to lose a significant chunk of Republican 
women because of his position on abortion. This district is affluent and 
well-educated. By and large, women voters support a woman's right to choose. 
Sybert makes enemies of the hard right by supporting abortion, then alienates 
mainstream women by endorsing restrictions vehemently opposed by most major 
women's groups (and most women). 
</P>
<P>
 The 24th contains the open spaces of Malibu and Topanga stretching across the 
Santa Monica Mountains into eastern Ventura County. Sybert might hope to pick 
up some affluent Republican environmentalists (no, that's not an oxymoron; I've 
met a few) except that Beilenson has delivered the funds for nearly every piece 
of open space acquired in the Santa Monica Mountains. Ouch. That 39.91% is 
getting slipperier and slipperier. And Sybert still hasn't picked up any 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, for the past 10 years, Beilenson has been in the forefront of the 
effort to stop illegal immigration. He is co-author of a constitutional 
amendment to deny citizenship to children born to illegals. This is crippling 
for a Republican, because on the issues, Sybert can't chip away. 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom may have told him to run here in the 24th. A better 
strategy would have been to take the road less traveled and challenge Moorhead, 
an incumbent for whom term limits seem to have been designed. 
</P>
<P>
 At least Sybert wouldn't need the Thomas Guide to find his way around the 
district.

THE COST OF LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF AN OLD STOGIE; ENJOYING A FINE

 In June I got a call from my good friend Vincent. "How much is it going to 
cost us?" my wife asked as she handed me the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent only calls when he wants me to join him in a new and expensive hobby. 
In our 13-year friendship I have spend more than $1,000 on golf clubs and 
accessories, at least $2,000 on memberships to health clubs and more than 
$3,000 on ski equipment, ski vacations and subscriptions to ski magazines. 
Thanks, Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stan, don't worry," Vincent suggested as he dug deep into my pocket. "This 
isn't going to cost much." He said the new hobby would provide me with 
breathtaking moments of tranquillity. That's what he said when we took up golf, 
weight training and skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is it?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cigar smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cigar smoking? I thought those things went out with wearing suits and ties to 
baseball games. "Don't you have to be an old guy to smoke cigars?" I asked. He 
said, "No. A lot of guys our age are doing it." "Our age?" Oh, that's right. 
We're old now. 
</P>
<P>
 My father started smoking cigars in his mid-30s. My father also started losing 
his hair in his mid-30s. I figured I would try to keep one family tradition 
alive. I lost my hair in my 20s. And besides, cigars can't be that expensive. 
And they're trendy. 
</P>
<P>
 My spending began at the Cigar Warehouse on Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. 
Cost: 25 cents for parking. It advertises a "500-square-foot climate-controlled 
walk-in humidor." I had no idea what that was, but it sounded like it could 
make my hair grow. 
</P>
<P>
 I walked inside and inhaled a third stage smog alert. A couple of mustached 
old guys wearing suits and ties and smoking stogies eyed me as if to say, 
"You're new around here, aren't you?" One salesman sold me three cigars, none 
of which I could pronounce. Cost: $9.  
</P>
<P>
 I asked for some matches and scurried to leave. "You want me to cut that for 
you?" asked the salesman. Apparently before smoking a cigar you have to perform 
circumcision on the end with a tool called a guillotine cutter. For the faint 
of heart this operation can also be performed with a wedge cutter or a piercer. 
I chose the guillotine cutter. Cost: $10. Later I purchased a cigar ashtray. 
Cost: $5. And a lighter. Cost: $5.  
</P>
<P>
 Since I had my wallet out, I also purchased a copy of the magazine Cigar 
Aficionado. Initial cost: $4. Two-year subscription: $22.95. It had 190 glossy 
pages of cigar ads, cigar information, interviews with cigar smokers Fidel 
Castro and Red Auerbach and ads for expensive products made by Range Rover, 
Rolex and Louis Vuitton. There were blind taste tests on 56 cigars. The 
highest-rated cigar cost $1.70. Who can afford expensive cigars when you're 
driving a Range Rover? 
</P>
<P>
 Now that smoking is illegal every place including your own car, where do I 
smoke this thing? Jeez, I haven't said that since I was 17. My wife said I 
could not smoke it in the house. Funny, I hadn't heard that since I was 17. 
Everywhere you look there's a No Smoking sign. And even when smoking is allowed 
there is always an addendum: NO PIPE OR CIGAR SMOKING! You've gotta be pretty 
deadly when cigarette smokers don't want you around. Don't they realize the 
first word in cigarettes is cigar? 
</P>
<P>
 I once read a story about a guy who rented a public storage space that he 
visited every week to smoke his cigar and read the paper. And I thought I was 
married to Attila the Hon. I could venture back to the Cigar Warehouse and 
smoke it there, but then I'd have to inhale all that secondhand smoke. I 
decided to take a drive one night and smoke it in my car: a 1989 Honda. No 
Louis Vuitton luggage or Rolex wristwatch. Cost: $3 for gas; $3 for air 
freshener . 
</P>
<P>
 My cigar magazine reported about cigar-smoking nights held at various 
locations. I called around and located one put on by Vendome Wine and Spirits 
of Toluca Lake on July 28. For $25 you got dinner, coffee, dessert, cognac and 
cigars. I immediately called Vincent. Cost

OBJECTION TO WHITE TEACHER AT CSUN IS RACIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It seems that the Black Student Union at Cal State Northridge objects to a 
white woman's teaching Pan-African studies. They contend the issue is not race 
but whether she has the cultural background to teach the courses. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder how the union would feel about blacks' being denied the right to 
teach European history or English literature, and being told the question isn't 
one of race, but whether they have the cultural background? 
</P>
<P>
 BURT PRELUTSKY

</P>
<P>
 * If your Sept. 4 headline "Black Students Protest White Teacher's Hiring" had 
reversed the words "white" and "black," we would see the Cal State Northridge 
protesters for what they are: racists. 
</P>
<P>
 Why then the double standard? Because at some point the civil rights movement 
got sidetracked from its original, laudable goal of making race irrelevant. Now 
race has become so central to some people's identity that they can't get beyond 
it and simply be human. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a race issue," Leslie Small, one of the protesters, said of the 
teacher. "The issue is whether she has the cultural background." That a black 
spokesperson can invoke a special "black cultural background" shows how sadly 
the original civil rights movement has gone off the rails, for at one time only 
the most blatant white racists would have asserted that there was a special 
black way of thinking, living, knowing, talking or learning. Skin color, an 
accident of birth, was to have become as insignificant in daily life as eye 
color. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a race issue. Students who believe that race equals culture, and who 
then use race as a criterion for judging their instructor, are racists. Our 
inability to bypass racial differences will only result in more of these 
unpleasant, unproductive disputes.

DIAMOND GIRLS; LITTLE LEAGUE 'QUAKE KIDS' AREN'T THE ONLY INSPIRATION THIS 
SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By the time Northridge's "Earthquake Kids" had gotten around to tournament 
play this past summer, much had happened to inspire unusual interest in the 
Little League World Series. The baseball strike had firmly taken hold.That 
dumped untold millions of fans into early withdrawal symptoms, the depths of 
which we are only beginning to comprehend. Los Angeles was also desperate for 
something to cheer about. And the kids, after all, were from Northridge, the 
epicenter of the nation's costliest natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 For the boys, then, there were such anomalies as the "Umpcam," limousines, 
proclamations and even an appearance on the Leno show. 
</P>
<P>
 But the boys were hardly the only champions strutting their stuff on our 
region's diamonds. In fact, if the strike had occurred a few weeks earlier, a 
couple of girls teams from the Santa Clarita Valley might have been given a lot 
more notice. In some ways, their accomplishments were just as impressive, and 
as compelling, as that of the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 The William S. Hart softball team for girls 10 and under, managed by Sandy 
Parkes, earned honors as the ASA Western District champions and as the ASA 
Pacific Coast Region champions. They also went to the Kansas City National 
Invitational tournament and won there by a combined score of 62 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Scott Evans says that two members of his squad, the William S. Hart 
team for girls 12 and under, lost homes in the earthquake. Still, they managed 
to pull together to win their third consecutive Southwest Area national 
tournament, beating the best from California, Hawaii, Arizona, New Mexico, 
Nevada, Utah and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 In our quake-scarred and baseball-starved region, those were accomplishments 
worthy of applause.

MANY BUSINESSES ARE TO BLAME FOR OWN FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re: "Headaches for Small Business" (Aug. 30), one cannot be cavalier about 
the social, economic and geologic problems impacting regional businesses, 
particularly smaller ones. Nonetheless, Los Angeles remains an enormously 
bounteous place where initiative can be abundantly rewarded.It may be 
convenient to blame Congress, the earthquake, the economy, Reagan or Clinton 
for commercial failure, but a great part of blame rests with proprietors who 
tolerate inept and slovenly business practices. 
</P>
<P>
 As a customer, I will go elsewhere when I am treated with indifference, when 
posted business hours are not honored, or when my reasonable commercial needs 
are ignored. As a paying consumer I will spend money, but I will spend it 
selectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Many business failures are the sorrowful result of extenuating circumstances, 
but many result from lack of effort or motivation. For this second group, 
responsibility for failure rests on indifference and sheer incompetence rather 
than on a nebulous scapegoat. The outcome is appropriate and should surprise 
nobody.

REP. BEILENSON SHINES AS A POLITICAL LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In his otherwise laudable piece on Anthony Beilenson, "24th District Race 
for House Seat Promises to Be Interesting" (Aug. 28), Paul Clarke neglects to 
mention the most remarkable fact concerning Beilenson's political survival and 
continued effectiveness. According to Project Vote Smart, a nonpartisan voter 
education group, Beilenson is one of approximately 10 representatives who 
accept no political action committee money (and unlike several of them, 
Beilenson is not enormously wealthy). 
</P>
<P>
 In an era in which most Americans complain about their politicians being 
bought and sold, Beilenson is a shining example of what a political leader can 
and should be: thoughtful, caring and independent.

FIGHTING BACK AFTER MOLESTATION; DESIRAY BARTAK OF PALMDALE HAS SET AN EXAMPLE 
OF COURAGE AFTER CHILDHOOD SEXUAL TRAUMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even when police advise parents on how to protect their children from 
molesters, some important possibilities can be missed. For example, when the 
Los Angeles Police Department produced some tips and rules of thumb for our 
newspaper last December, much of the focus on avoiding problems involved 
examples of strangers as perpetrators. 
</P>
<P>
 It is arguably much more difficult for a child to be suspicious of the adults 
who hold a revered status in their lives, such as that of godparent. It is 
devastating enough to be a victim of child sexual abuse. The psychological and 
emotional damage is far greater when it is committed by a trusted and 
well-known adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts will tell you that some people suffer lifelong repercussions from 
early-age traumas, such as an inability to trust people with whom trust should 
come easily, such as a spouse or other loved one. 
</P>
<P>
 Many children are unable to cope with such incidents, will not report them, 
and will suppress the memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray Bartak, now aged 14, went through such an incident when she was 10 
years old and a resident of Palmdale. She was molested by her godfather, 
Richard Streate. (He has since changed his name to Kyle Hochstrasser.) 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has set a remarkable standard for strength, purpose and 
resilience. Hers is also an example of what can and should be done when 
molestation occurs. First, she reported the abuse, and saw the matter through 
to Streate/Hochstrasser's conviction and imprisonment. She even sued him 
successfully for $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, she will receive an award at the White House in Washington, D.C., 
honoring people who work for change. The ceremony should be regarded as an 
opportunity to cite Bartak as a national example of the problem of child 
molestation, and as an example of how children can fight their way back from 
it.

LANDLORD RESPONSIBLE FOR FIXING MALL DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re: "Mall Plays Waiting Game" (Aug. 26 Letters to the Editor). 
</P>
<P>
 The merchants of Laurel Plaza are right and the developer is wrong. As the 
landlord, Forest City is responsible for keeping the property in a safe and 
usable condition and should have repaired the mall immediately after the 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Greenberg and the other merchants of the Laurel Plaza Mall, North 
Hollywood, are finally finding out what kind of company Forest City Development 
really is. This company has no concern about the well-being of the merchants 
who were devastated in the January earthquake. If it did, it could have had the 
necessary repairs made in the mall and those businesses could have been open in 
seven to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Robinson-May building, which is connected to the damaged mall stores, 
suffered severe core damage and was repaired and reopened in less than one 
week. The repairs were started immediately and continued 24 hours a day, to the 
chagrin of the surrounding bedroom community, and opened for business to a 
fanfare of radio, TV and newspaper advertising, costing hundreds of thousands 
of dollars -- all the while the poor, small businesses of the mall were 
promised time and time again that they would be next to open. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't hold your breath, Mr. Greenberg. Our residents association and the 
people of this community have been fighting the Forest City developer for over 
eight years concerning the expansion of the Laurel Plaza Mall. Our fight has 
never been to stop the development of the plaza. We have fought exclusively to 
see a successful mall built that would blend into the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Our community is the oldest still-intact residential community in the San 
Fernando Valley. We have fought for a state-of-the-art security system, 
adequate parking, consistent traffic at the mall and the utmost regard for 
property setback lines in our community. We are fighting to keep the ice 
skating rink from being replaced by the developer's eight-screen movie theater 
that would keep our community up past midnight every day of the year. Our 
community already has 52 movie screens located within five miles. But the 
developer doesn't understand why someone would want an ice skating rink rather 
than another movie theater! 
</P>
<P>
 Our residents association is supported by the community, other local resident 
associations, the Los Angeles Police Department Neighborhood Watch groups and 
the Los Angeles City Planning Department in enforcing the above-mentioned 
needs. Councilman Joel Wachs has said he would not let a residential community 
be destroyed to make way for a commercial development and has worked with us in 
problem solving.

SUPPORT A TO Z PLAN TO RE-EXAMINE SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am writing to you concerning the bipartisan "A to Z" plan that is 
supported by Richard Sybert, who is running for Congress and is stationed in 
Woodland Hills, my home city. After further information was sent to me 
regarding the A to Z plan, I found it imperative to write to you to show that 
there is public concern regarding taxpayers' dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 With only 14 more signatures required, the A to Z plan would require at least 
56 hours of debate for dozens of as-yet unspecified spending cut amendments. 
What is original about this plan is that the overseeing of the debates would 
not be in the hands of the probable congressmen, but would be regulated by four 
junior House members. Another plus is that the plan was conceived with 
bipartisan roots. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a junior in high school and first began getting interested in "pork" 
through my speech and debate team, which emphasized many political topics. I 
strongly oppose the expenditure of taxpayers' money for personal political gain 
and for entitlement programs that at first glance seem fine but then add up to 
ridiculous figures that jack up our deficit. My high school has one 
air-conditioned building, ONE. 
</P>
<P>
 When there are 1.4 billion public dollars being spent on helium reserve funds 
and not enough adequate facilities for our future to study in, something is not 
right. Now we have a chance to re-examine the spending that occurs in the 
appropriations committee and with entitlement programs. It seems ridiculous not 
to support such a plan so that we can get money flowing in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 There are certain requisites that need to be fulfilled with the public's 
criteria as first priority. As of now, they are not. First things first. The 
mulberry bush run has to stop! As a concerned citizen, I demand your attention 
be brought to this A to Z plan.

KEEP LAUSD OUT OF WELL-RUN PARENT CENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I thought the article by Beth Shuster, "Unwelcome Support for Parent 
Centers" (Aug. 24), was well-written and told the LAUSD what they need to hear 
-- if they will listen. There already exists on LAUSD campuses help for people 
who know how to use the system.What the Parent Centers offer is a 
non-threatening way to introduce to the campus parents who might otherwise be 
intimidated by the system. Once they feel comfortable on the campus, they can 
avail themselves of the resources the school has to offer. If necessary, parent 
leaders can shepherd them through the system. 
</P>
<P>
 What is not needed is another layer of LAUSD bureaucracy, no matter how well 
meaning, to intimidate parents who are making their first steps toward relating 
to a system that in most cases is overwhelming. If the LAUSD wants to get 
involved with parents, it should support things like the PTA, which is for 
parents who want to get involved by interacting with teachers and the school 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parent Centers fulfill a different purpose -- namely providing a buffer or 
sometimes an acting as an ombudsman between parents and the school. Making it 
an LAUSD-run program defeats its whole purpose.

VALLEY RESIDENTS SHOULD ELECT A VALLEY CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In your article Aug. 20 regarding Mrs. Yaroslavsky's decision to run for her 
husband's vacated City Council seat, we Valleyites are once again presented 
with the lack of acknowledgement from the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The article reads as though the decision as to whom will fill the seat will be 
made by those residing on the Westside once they reconcile with their 
soul-searching for a candidate to serve their needs.There is no better argument 
than the discussion presented in the article as to why a council representative 
with constituents on both sides of the hill does not work. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley should be represented by someone who lives in the 
Valley and recognizes the needs of the Valley. I urge everyone living in the 
Valley to vote for the candidate who lives in, will work for and represents the 
Valley.

117-YEAR-OLD DYNAMITE FOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A box of dynamite believed to be from the 1800s was found near railroad tracks 
Saturday morning, but the explosives were deemed "too wet" by sheriff's 
detectives to be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-pound box of dynamite was found about 9:45 a.m. by a passerby about 20 
feet from the Metrolink railroad tracks at 7433 Soledad Canyon Road, said Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Spear.The dynamite was simply too old and 
"too wet to blow up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The markings on the box indicated that the explosives were over 100 years 
old," Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spear said the box had an 1877 date and a label from San Francisco. He said 
the explosives could have been used in clearing mountains for railroads. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosives technicians took the soggy box, which contained black powder 
and two sticks of dynamite, and disposed of them, Spear said.

JOE VS. STEVE; HISTORY INDICATES THERE IS SOMETHING PERSONAL AT STAKE TODAY FOR 
MONTANA, YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Montana and Steve Young both insist there's nothing personal at stake in 
their first on-the-field confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 The history and duration of their quarterback rivalry tells a different tale. 
</P>
<P>
 So with today's game between the San Francisco 49ers and Chiefs at Kansas City 
providing a compelling backdrop, look for Montana to throw a right and Young to 
respond with a left. It's their first -- and possibly only -- chance to play 
out years of simmering competitive tensions on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know they're both fired up but they can't let themselves be consumed about 
playing each other as opposed to running their teams," San Francisco tight end 
Brent Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's big, really big," Kansas City running back Marcus Allen added. "People 
want to try to downplay it, but it's important for both teams and it's a big 
thing in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's showdown has been a long time coming and one that never could have 
taken place while they were on the same team. But, Montana and Young insist, 
it's just one game, early in the year at that, and certainly won't make or 
break either team, regardless of the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be a fun an interesting experience," said Montana, downplaying any 
revenge factor. "I never imagined I would ever have to (play against the 49ers) 
but that's the way of the league now. The league is changing and I was part of 
those changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Young said he's approaching the game like he would any other. 
</P>
<P>
 "This week, as with all the weeks I've been here, I have to go out and 
perform," Young said. "I have a standard that has been set for me. It's not an 
easy standard." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Montana set it. In 10 years as the 49ers' starter, Montana led 
the club to four Super Bowl titles in the 1980s. In the process, he also 
established himself as one of the region's best-loved sports figures. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was knocked off stride by elbow problems and, in his mind, usurped by 
Young. Before the 1993 season, Montana was traded to Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-Niners president Carmen Policy likened the move to an emotional 
earthquake but also believed that the Montana-Young controversy had become so 
divisive and pronounced that the move had to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the relationship between Montana and Young had deteriorated from 
professional but strained to downright icy. The two barely spoke to each other 
during Montana's last season in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their relationship was doomed from the beginning," Policy said. "Steve Young 
hadn't come in as a draft choice to be an understudy. He came to the 49ers in a 
significant (1987) trade with the obvious intent of him becoming the starting 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a case where Steve was going to learn from the master. Joe saw him 
as a competitor for the starting position." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who chafed for more playing time in four years as Montana's understudy, 
has three straight passing titles since taking over his job. 
</P>
<P>
 But that championship season, the kind his predecessor accomplished with 
elegance and flair, has eluded him. Young took the 49ers to the brink of the 
Super Bowl only to lose NFC titles games to Dallas in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if any quarterback can really say, 'You did it all,' unless you 
take a team to the Super Bowl," Young said. "There's no doubt as I line up this 
year, that's the No. 1 thing I hope to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana grudgingly admits Young has performed well, but that's all he'll 
concede. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's proved that he's a good player in his own right," Montana said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Montana, who once said he regarded Young as the "opposition" while both 
played for the 49ers, made clear he was rankled by the way his career in San 
Francisco came to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I ever asked for was a fair shot at competing for the job," he said. "But 
they weren't going to open it up for competition. Everyone wants that 
opportunity, but I don't think I was in their plans. The big thing is that's 
over with now and I have to look to my future. I look back as little as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Young said if there was tension between himself and Montana it wasn't anything 
personal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always been very professional," Young said. "In any competitive 
situation it's just what it is. I don't think there's ever been an argument or 
harsh words or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Young said, he hopes to visit with Montana after the game. He figures 
he owes him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm a great quarterback or a good quarterback or a decent quarterback, a 
lot of it's because of Joe," Young said.

UCLA HAS HANDS FULL, BEATS SMU; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: SHAH'S TOUCHDOWN GIVES 
STRUGGLING BRUINS 17-10 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sharmon Shah rushed for 158 yards and scored the go-ahead touchdown early in 
the fourth quarter Saturday as 13th-ranked UCLA struggled to a 17-10 victory 
over Southern Methodist before 40,638 at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Shah's nine-yard run with 12:17 left capped a 79-yard, nine-play drive, which 
came right after SMU tied the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Shah, who carried 24 times, also caught six passes for 52 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs had a first-and-goal at the UCLA three with 1:45 remaining, but 
two running plays lost a yard each before Donnie Edwards sacked Ramon Flanigan 
for an 11-yard loss. Edwards was credited with 4 1/2 of UCLA's eight sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 After a delay-of-game penalty, Flanigan threw an incomplete pass, and UCLA 
then ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (2-0), favored by more than three touchdowns, blew several scoring 
chances and had their hands full containing Flanigan, who completed 22 of 34 
passes for a career-high 301 yards and his team's only touchdown, with one 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA played without All-American wide receiver J.J. Stokes, who sat out the 
game because of a bruised left thigh. Stokes is expected to return next 
Saturday when the Bruins face top-ranked Nebraska at Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs (0-2) tied the game, 10-10, on an 18-yard touchdown pass from 
Flanigan to Mick Rossley, son of SMU Coach Tom Rossley, with 1:09 remaining in 
the third quarter. SMU drove 68 yards on 10 plays after an interception of 
Wayne Cook's pass by Troy Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 After Shah's touchdown, UCLA missed a chance to extend its lead when Bjorn 
Merten missed a 44-yard field goal with 5:26 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA failed to score on its first four possessions and trailed, 3-0, before 
Cook threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Jordan with 4:08 left before 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 A 44-yard field goal by Ben Crosland with 11:11 remaining in the second 
quarter capped a 53-yard, 13-play drive and gave the Mustangs a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 On SMU's next possession, the Mustangs gained 62 yards on a shovel pass from 
Flanigan to Jacques Smith to reach UCLA's four, but Flanigan was sacked twice, 
and Crosland was wide left on a 39-yard field goal try. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins then got their offense in gear, moving 77 yards in 11 plays to take 
a 7-3 lead on the Cook-to-Jordan scoring pass, which came on a third-and-eight 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins extended the lead to 10-3 on Merten's 41-yard field goal on the 
final play of the first half. On the three previous plays, Cook completed 
passes of 16, 15 and 18 yards to Jordan, moving UCLA from its 28 to the SMU 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook completed 20 of 29 passes for 204 yards and one touchdown, with two 
interceptions. Jordan had seven catches for 83 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA lost two starters in the third quarter. Offensive right tackle Paul 
Kennedy sprained his right knee, and cornerback Carl Greenwood broke an ankle.

SMU MAKES UCLA HANG ON, 17-10; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: BRUINS NEED LATE GOAL-LINE 
STAND TO PRESERVE VICTORY AFTER SHAH'S TOUCHDOWN BREAKS 10-10 TIE.

 If it were a trout, you'd have to throw it back. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a 17-10 victory over Southern Methodist, and UCLA had worked too 
hard to catch it Saturday at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 13-ranked Bruins had to put together two goal-line stands, the last in 
the game's final two minutes, so they could go against No. 1 Nebraska next 
Saturday at Lincoln with a 2-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
 It shouldn't have been this tough against a team that has won 11 games in six 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't looking ahead to playing Nebraska, but we did come out flat," said 
UCLA quarterback Wayne Cook, who hit 20 of 29 passes for 204 yards, including a 
10-yard touchdown completion to Kevin Jordan, but who fumbled a center snap and 
threw two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think it would be any cakewalk," Coach Terry Donahue said, "but I 
obviously had a hard time convincing our team of that. We really didn't have as 
much enthusiasm or as much bounce in our step as we did a week ago, no question 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, highly touted Tennessee was the opponent, but this was SMU, still 
scratching and clawing after two seasons on the NCAA's Death Row. But the 
Mustangs had a 3-0 lead, then a 10-10 tie before UCLA could pull the game out 
on Sharmon Shah's nine-yard touchdown runwith 12:17 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 It was too early. On the Mustangs' final three series, they were stopped on 
fourth down at the UCLA 49, gave up an interception by Abdul McCullough, then 
moved to the UCLA three with 1:47 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had two stands, but obviously the last one was the more dramatic, because 
it was near the end of the game," said UCLA defensive coordinator Bob Field, 
who spent plenty of crunch time with his pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 That was because the Bruins were calling time out to protect the clock, the 
better to give their offense some extra seconds if SMU scored. During those 
timeouts, the defensive players got so excited, they began to mix up the 
alphabet and forget about the calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started talking about who would make the big play," McCullouch said. "We 
asked who would be the next Marvin Goodwin." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwin, now with the Philadelphia Eagles, made the interception that put UCLA 
in the Rose Bowl last season, but that was against USC, not SMU. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnie Edwards made the first play, a tackle of Mustang quarterback Ramon 
Flanigan for a yard loss with 1:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Time out. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Smith was sent into the line for a yard loss, with Phillip Ward and 
Rod Smalley stepping up. 
</P>
<P>
 Time out. 
</P>
<P>
 More Flanigan, who tormented the Bruins all day, but not on third and goal 
from the five with 58 seconds to play. He scrambled but was hemmed in by 
Edwards, who had 4 1/2 sacks, and Smalley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a mistake," SMU Coach Tom Rossley said. "We missed a block in front, 
and Ramon should have thrown the ball out of the end zone. It should have been 
fourth and goal from the five." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was fourth and game from the 16, then the 21 after a delay-of-game 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanigan's final pass, his 34th of the game, was across the field toward Donte 
Womack, who was covered by McCullough. The ball fell short, and so did the 
Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you play that hard and don't win, it feels like dying," Rossley said. 
"We expected to win. Every time we got the ball, we moved it. The players hurt 
real bad right now. Eventually, the players have to get rewarded for their 
efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 Those efforts generated a 44-yard field goal by Ben Crosland for a 3-0 
second-quarter lead that could have been 6-0 had he not missed a 39-yard try on 
SMU's next series. That drive to a missed opportunity included a 62-yard shovel 
pass from Flanigan to Smith to the UCLA four, with McCullough catching Smith 
from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 There followed UCLA's first goal-line stand, which included a sack by Ward, an 
incomplete pass and a sack by George Kase to make it fourth and goal from the 
22. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanigan completed 22 of 34 passes for 301 yards and ran 20 times, netting a 
minus three yards because he was sacked eight times for losses of 60 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Mustangs also were playing inspired defense and UCLA was struggling 
without injured All-American wide receiver J.J. Stokes, who was scratched 
Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not having him out on the field changes the way I play the game a little 
bit," Cook said. "When I come up to the line of scrimmage, I look and see where 
he will be first. (Not having him) makes me more of a fundamental quarterback. 
I have to go through the reads." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook finally read Jordan on a 10-yard touchdown pass with 4:08 left in the 
half for a 7-3 advantage, then read him again three times in a row for gains of 
16, 15 and 18 yards on a 62-yard drive to a 41-yard field goal by Bjorn Merten 
as the half ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanigan found Mick Rossley, the coach's son, on an 18-yard touchdown pass 
with 1:09 left in the third quarter for a 10-10 tie, which was broken less than 
four minutes later by Shah's touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Shah rushed for 158 yards in 24 carries and caught six passes for 52 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you don't turn it over, you're hard to beat," said Donahue, who bridled 
at implications that the Bruins should have walked away with an easy victory. 
"They only turned it over once, and we gave it right back. 
</P>
<P>
 "And our football team isn't any great, accomplished UCLA football squad. 
We're struggling. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Bruins are 2-0, but with diminished forces. Cornerback Carl 
Greenwood, UCLA's best pass defender, broke his right ankle, and right tackle 
Paul Kennedy suffered what might be knee ligament damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how many teams are 2-0 around the country," Donahue answered 
critics. "I guess a lot of them. I must be missing something. But if we're 2-0 
and haven't had a solid game, that must be good. I'm more concerned with the 
players we lost. We're not a deep football team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our football team had a real difficult time this week after beating 
Tennessee, which was obviously an emotional win. After that, it was real 
difficult to get the kids and the coaches to concentrate and focus the way you 
need to, because we keep hearing and reading about the fact that this is going 
to be an easy game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that's ironic about it is you all are the ones writing about it, 
and here you are asking me how come it was such a hard game. I find that 
ironic." 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, it was tough for Donahue to enjoy being undefeated, even if 
Nebraska, after looking at the film, gets overconfident. 
</P>
<P>
 * TROUBLE AHEAD: If his team produces a similarly uninspiring effort, UCLA 
Coach Terry Donahue fears the worst in next Saturday's game at Nebraska. C8

U.S. OPEN; N.Y. TOASTS AGASSI -- HE'LL PLAY STICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Super Saturday was pretty much an ordinary day for Andre Agassi and Michael 
Stich, routine winners of U.S. Open semifinals here. 
</P>
<P>
 On a day when the women's final stole the show, Agassi fashioned a workmanlike 
6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Todd Martin and Stich beat Karel Novacek, 7-5, 
6-3, 7-6 (7-4). In both matches, it was the expected outcome, even though 
Agassi entered this tournament unseeded. 
</P>
<P>
 By beating the ninth-seeded Martin, Agassi became the first unseeded player in 
the 114-year history of the U.S. men's singles championships to beat four 
seeded players in one year. And if he beats fourth-seeded Stich today, the 
24-year-old from Las Vegas will be the second player to beat five seeded 
players in one year. The last unseeded player to reach a final here was Jan 
Kodes of Czechoslovakia, who lost to Stan Smith in 1971, and the last unseeded 
player to win was Fred Stolle in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi, a top-10 player for five consecutive years before a wrist injury in 
1993 forced him down the rankings and into the 20s coming into this event, 
dominated Martin and made it look as if he could break the former Northwestern 
University star at will. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was definitely all business for me," Agassi said. "I did what I needed 
to do, from start to finish, and there is a good feeling in that." 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi also said that there was a good feeling in becoming the toast of the 
town in New York, a city where, most often, they'd rather just spill the glass 
on you. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe a lot to the New York fans. They got me through," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said, " . . . The greatest thing now is when you step out on that 
(Stadium Court), I feel like it is my arena." 
</P>
<P>
 In two weeks of this tournament, Agassi's celebrity, always huge, has 
exploded. Once a town car here, he is now a stretch limo. Well after his match, 
the path from the stadium to the players' locker room was lined five deep with 
people waiting to catch a glimpse of the man who plays in black socks and 
tennis shoes that look like spats, and wears his long bleached hair hanging 
down over a double-earring in his left ear and a single loop in his right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andre's coming, Andre's coming," was the whisper. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi, once not quite able to get a handle on all this, does much better now. 
When asked in a postmatch TV interview about his current girlfriend, actress 
Brooke Shields, who appeared to be in danger of falling out of her dress as she 
celebrated match point for all the strategically aimed television cameras 
Saturday, Agassi replied: "Oh, did she show up again today?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even Martin, the 6-foot-6 tower of tennis power from East Lansing, Mich., 
whose bland image fairly well parallels the reality, felt compelled to discuss 
Andre the idol. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy is a superstar," Martin said. "He can dress up in goofy clothes on TV 
and make commercials and people still like him. And you know, what I'm finding 
out, is that he's really not a bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Stich, Agassi's opponent today, feels the same way, mostly because of a 
possible edge it could give him in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am happy to be the underdog," he said. "Andre, I think now, everybody 
expects him to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Stich served 14 aces against Novacek, of the Czech Republic, and converted a 
62% first-serve mark and 49 of 74 successful net rushes into a 1-hour 49-minute 
cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael was playing his serve-and-volley," Novacek said, "so I didn't ever 
get a chance to get any kind of rhythm to my game. He would serve and I would 
hit maybe one, two shots and both were just reflexes on returns of big serves." 
</P>
<P>
 Stich ended the match fittingly by serving a 119-m.p.h. ace. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi ended his fittingly, pounding a forehand winner from the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, that is exactly how their match is expected to go. And if both are on 
their games, it could bring a final that turns out super, even if it's a day 
late for the TV hype. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Meilen Tu of Northridge, the 16-year-old from Granada Hills High, reached 
today's final of the junior girls' event here, scoring a 7-5, 6-4 victory over 
Kim de Weille of the Netherlands Saturday. Tu, who is seeded fourth, will play 
the much-discussed Martina Hinges of Switzerland, the top-seeded player. Hinges 
is a few months away from turning 14, but she already has an agent from IMG and 
a couple of endorsements from clothing companies. Hinges will turn pro as soon 
as she turns 14.

IT'S ALL OVER EARLY FOR USC, 38-14; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TROJANS ARE OVERPOWERED 
BY PENN STATE, WHICH SCORES ALMOST AT WILL IN TAKING A 35-0 HALFTIME LEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For USC's football team, all the optimism generated by a season-opening 
victory evaporated in the space of nine minutes Saturday in a place called 
Happy Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State 38, USC 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 96,463, Penn State knocked out the Trojans early, running off to a 21-0 
first-quarter lead and making it 35-0 at the half before Joe Paterno decided to 
take a look at his depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an overwhelming defeat -- a word USC Coach John Robinson would use 
afterward -- on an afternoon when the Trojans at no time mounted any form of 
offensive threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how bad it was for USC: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The game began at 3:33 p.m. By 3:42 p.m., it was 14-0, Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rob Johnson's Heisman Trophy hopes all but vanished. He completed 18 of 30 
passes for 221 yards and no touchdowns. He was sacked six times. 
</P>
<P>
 -- USC, which seemed to have revitalized its running game in a 24-17 victory 
over Washington last week, netted a mere 60 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Trojan defense, which a year ago couldn't stop the run against tough 
opponents, apparently can't do so this season, either. Penn State, playing the 
ground-based kind of football Robinson wants to play, gained 286 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were overwhelmed right off the bat," Robinson said of two early touchdown 
strikes by the Nittany Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose you could say they can't do that against everyone, but they've done 
it two weeks in a row now." 
</P>
<P>
 He referred to Penn State's 56-3 victory at Minnesota last week, also sparked 
by early touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans were hobbled offensively. Wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson didn't 
play (sore quadriceps) and Ed Hervey (shoulder, knee) didn't suit up. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State knocked out USC early with two-down football. It didn't need a 
third-down play until its third scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Ki-Jana Carter, said to be the fastest runner ever to play for Penn State, 
looked like it on the game's first touchdown. From USC's 32, he simply blew 
past the right side of the Trojan defense and scored untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 On USC's first possession, Johnson's first pass was knocked down by defensive 
end Jeff Perry, Shawn Walters gained nine and then USC center Jeremy Hogue and 
Johnson muffed the third-down snap and Penn State recovered at the Trojan 44. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerry Collins, a 6-foot-5, 235-pound senior quarterback who almost signed a 
baseball contract out of high school, went to work on USC's left cornerback, 
John Herpin and beat him with a bad pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins threw short to wide receiver Freddie Scott on Penn State's sideline, 
but Scott came back to the ball and outjumped Herpin to grab it and dance into 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 With 12:55 left in the first quarter, Penn State was ahead, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other score Paterno's team needed came with 7:09 left in the quarter, 
when Collins took the Nittany Lions 57 yards in nine plays, sending Jon Witman 
over from the seven. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was it. Penn State had rushed for 94 first-quarter yards compared to 
USC's 19. Carter, who finished with 119 yards, had 67 in the first quarter. 
Johnson was two for five and 21 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fumbled snap gave them good field position and they took advantage of it 
immediately," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was devastating, how quickly they were on top of us. Penn State is as good 
a team execution-wise at this stage of a season as any team I've seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not as bad as we looked. Two of our best players didn't play and we 
played about 20 very young players. We need to get healed up during (this 
week's) bye." 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the fumbled first-quarter snap, Johnson said: "I don't want to 
point any fingers. It was part my fault, part (Hogue's). 
</P>
<P>
 "We fell behind last year against teams and came back, and I wasn't really 
worried until they got it into the thirties. We weren't clicking. Robinson told 
us at the half to play like it was zero-zero, but we just couldn't get it 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, USC's best play was a defensive gem by cornerback Quincy 
Harrison. He picked off a Collins pass intended for Chris Campbell and returned 
it 68 yards for a third-quarter touchdown. But by then it already was 35-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan linebacker Jeff Kopp, who was in on a game-high 13 tackles, said Penn 
State was more mentally prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were ready to play and we weren't," he said. "On all their traps, we got 
blown out. The defense was out there a long time, but that was our fault. They 
were very good at holding their blocks -- we couldn't free up on them." 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked all summer to be more physical . . . and we got our butts kicked, 
and that's discouraging to me." 
</P>
<P>
 USC lost one player Saturday. Substitute center Jesse Gomez tore ligaments in 
his right knee and will require surgery that will end his season. 
</P>
<P>
 On the victors' side, not even Paterno could sandbag it this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're a pretty good football team," he said. "We couldn't do much 
better.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kerry Collins played a super first half, and our defense played a very 
strong, alert game." 
</P>
<P>
 * GATOR BAIT: No. 2 Florida makes a case for regaining the top spot in 
national polls, scoring at least 70 points for the second week in a row in a 
73-7 rout of Kentucky. C6 
</P>
<P>
 * AN OASIS: No. 5 Miami, winless in three bowl games played at Sun Devil 
Stadium, has no trouble this time with a 47-10 victory over Arizona State. C8 
</P>
<P>
 * CARDINAL ERROR: A missed field-goal attempt with 23 seconds remaining leaves 
No. 24 Stanford with a 41-41 tie against Northwestern. C9

TERRY BOWDEN HAS A TIGER IN HIS TANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY FREI, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than 72 hours before Auburn held on for a 22-17 road victory over 
Mississippi in the 1994 opener, Terry Bowden is wired up and waiting in an 
Auburn studio. Via satellite, he is about to do a live shot with WBMG-TV in 
Birmingham about 110 miles to the northwest. When the newscast goes to a 
commercial, Bowden greets sports director Doug Bell, and the news comes through 
Bowden's earpiece that Bell's 10-month-old son, Brooks, already is 28 inches 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden, the 38-year-old Auburn coach, brightens. Remember where you should 
send your son to play football, he says. "Who's going to be the football coach 
at Alabama in 16 years?" Bowden asks Bell. Bell's answer can't be heard in the 
studio, but after a pause, Bowden says: "I don't know, either. Now, who's going 
to be the football coach at Auburn in 16 years?" Another pause. "That's right. 
I am." 
</P>
<P>
 After the commercial, the interview lasts 10 minutes. A television news 
consultant would be horrified at that extravagance, but the passion for 
football in Alabama outstrips the need for a quick talk with a coach and then a 
cute segue into the Pet of the Week. The interview was a hastily arranged favor 
for the Birmingham station, so when he finishes, Bowden is late, and he is on 
the run. You aren't around him long before you figure out Bowden can seem on 
the run when he's sitting down. He's like a VCR with the PLAY and FAST FORWARD 
buttons engaged and the sound audible. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street from the studio, the Tigers' 15 seniors are waiting in 
vehicles outside the football offices. Bowden races through his office, grabs 
his briefcase and keys, jumps into his four-wheel drive that is 'Bama-red -- 
"My car dealer is in Birmingham, and he has a sense of humor," he says -- and 
pulls around to the front of the building to lead the caravan to his house. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, the seniors are filing past and looking down at their 
5-foot-6 coach, going through the double doors, into the new brick home 
designed by Bowden's wife, Shyrl. For the next 15 minutes, they get a tour, 
noticing such things as a copy of Bobby Bowden's book on the nightstand; the 
still-knotted Auburn blue and orange tie Terry wore throughout the 1993 season; 
coach-of-the-year awards from 1993; the fishing boat in the garage; and the 
combined big-screen TV, stereo and sound system that makes it seem as if we 
should have paid $7 at the door and $11.50 for popcorn and a Coke. 
</P>
<P>
 Out on the deck, overlooking a small man-made lake, the steaks are cooked and 
waiting. Bowden turns serious and talks to the seniors who have a bona fide 
shot at going undefeated in their final two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Just wanted to have you guys out here because you're the seniors, you've been 
the leaders, you're special. Not going to kid you, guys, you know we can have a 
better team than last season -- regardless of whether that means an 
everything-broke-right undefeated season can be repeated or whether we'll lose 
a game. Or two. But whatever happens, you're going to work hard. 
</P>
<P>
 A year into his tenure, Terry Bowden can say with considerable credibility 
that he expects to be at Auburn when that broadcaster's 10-month-old son is 
ready for college. He is winning people over in his efforts to revive the 
Tigers' program and improve its soiled image. More important, he is winning. 
The Tigers again have their sights on a national championship despite being on 
NCAA probation. And they have a solid chance to enter their Oct. 15 game 
against Florida (ranked No. 3 in this week's TSN poll) still undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden has a new, five-year contract with a provision for an annual rollover. 
It represents security in a tenuous business for a man who, after studying at 
Oxford (England, not Mississippi) and getting a law degree while serving as a 
graduate assistant at Florida State, seemingly had other options. ("I thought 
he'd be smart enough to go into something else," jokes his father, Florida 
State Coach Bobby Bowden.) He has received high marks for his offensive 
ingenuity, using the framework of Florida State's system. If he leaves, he -- 
or someone -- would have to buy out five years of his contract, so it has 
watered down speculation that he is in line to succeed his 64-year-old father 
at Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden has talked like an Auburn man of the past, present and future, and you 
get the feeling he has studied all those Auburn legends -- such as the alleged 
Civil War-related genesis of that famous "War Eagle" rallying call. He has hit 
on the gimmick of coming up with season slogans that include the school's 
initials, and thus Auburn is selling buttons by the thousands. (Last year, it 
was AttitUde; this season it is AU-dacity.) 
</P>
<P>
 After going 11-0 last season but sitting at home in the postseason because of 
the probation, the Tigers lost standout tackles Wayne Gandy and Anthony Redmon, 
quarterback Stan White and tailback James Bostic. Yet especially because 
Bostic's replacement, junior Stephen Davis, who rushed for 158 yards on 33 
carries against Ole Miss and probably will become one of the top runners in the 
country, the Tigers seem capable of at least threatening a repeat. They play 
their next four at home, beginning with Northeast Louisiana Saturday, and are 
likely to be 6-0 heading into the showdown with Florida in Gainesville. And 
because the Tigers remain ineligible for the Southeastern Conference 
championship game and a bowl berth and ranking in the CNN/USA Today coaches' 
poll, the national championship could get sticky if Auburn is perfect again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going 11-0 last year gives us a hunger to do it again," says junior 
quarterback Patrick Nix, who has taken over for the departed White and in the 
opener was a lackluster seven for 20 for 83 yards, as the Tigers did most of 
their damage on the ground (183 yards). "We have the confidence to do it again, 
but we know how hard it's going to be, how much work it's going to take." 
</P>
<P>
 The question of incentive keeps coming up. Last season, the undefeated record 
left the Tigers with nothing but rings that said: "Best in the Southeastern 
Conference." This season, Bowden says there are carrots to dangle -- as well as 
carats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the winningest team in the country," he says. "For another week, for 
another seven days, we're the winningest team in the country. Twelve in a row. 
If we do have the audacity to go 11-0 again, (the players) really believe the 
AP would vote them No. 1 this time." Auburn is ranked 12th in this week's 
Sporting News poll and, as in the AP poll, is eligible to finish the season No. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait. We're talking national championship possibilities, aren't we? It's easy 
to forget, especially for outsiders, that when Bowden took over as coach in 
December 1992, the program was a mess. The Tigers were coming off consecutive 
five-victory seasons under longtime coach Pat Dye and were awaiting the verdict 
of the NCAA in the wake of former cornerback Eric Ramsey's charges about being 
paid during his 1987-90 career. The choice of Bowden, then the coach at 
Division I-AA Samford in Birmingham after guiding the program up from Division 
III, seemed to contradict the university's stated goal of hiring a proven 
major-program coach. The administration had said nothing about getting credit 
for lineage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I've gotten in life is because of who my father is," Bowden says 
without embarrassment but with qualification. "The principles I have, the 
beliefs I have, the extensive training I have, are because I've sat around the 
breakfast table all my life with a head football coach. I've had so many 
coaches say, 'Gosh, I wish I could call and ask Paterno.' Well, I've been able 
to talk to Bobby Bowden every day of my life. So don't think I'm ever going to 
say I haven't gotten what I've gotten because my father is Bobby Bowden. On the 
other hand, I got the job at Salem (W.Va.) College (Now Salem-Teikyo 
University), which nobody wanted, because they fired the coach before me. I won 
more than anybody at Salem College. I went to Samford because they fired the 
coach before me for not winning, and we won and moved up." 
</P>
<P>
 He has the name, but he has paid his dues. 
</P>
<P>
 So here is Terry Bowden, still undefeated as a Division I-A head coach after 
the Tigers survived a scare at Oxford (Mississippi, not England) in the opener. 
Ole Miss, trailing by five, had a first-and-goal at the Auburn 9 in the final 
five minutes, but Scott Stacey sacked Rebels quarterback Josh Nelson at the 14 
on third down, and then an Ole Miss field-goal attempt was blocked. Although a 
five-point victory might not be compelling for poll voters, the fact is that 
Auburn scraped and scrambled all last season -- and never lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing I saw was that this team still wanted it so badly," Bowden said 
after the game. "That's the thing I saw that I needed to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the part of the probation that prevents Auburn from being on 
television is over, part of the nation finally got to see a Terry 
Bowden-coached team on live television. Yet the Tigers know their final game 
will be Nov. 19 against Alabama, and that they still can't go anywhere as a 
group after the regular season . . . other than the team awards banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 In Auburn, the drugstore on College Street still has the score of last 
season's 'Bama game -- 22-14 -- painted in the front window. Mention Eric 
Ramsey and you get reactions similar to how history books treat Benedict 
Arnold. ( On the streets of Auburn, guess which program's boosters are assumed 
to have "encouraged" Ramsey to, shall we say, roll out his charges like a tide? 
Which, now that former Alabama player Gene Jelks is making similar charges 
against the Crimson Tide, people in Tuscaloosa are getting suspicious.) 
</P>
<P>
 In this setting, where Auburn last season averaged home crowds of 81,062 in 
85,214-seat Jordan-Hare Stadium, where the athletic facilities reek of the 
financial pressures so common to high-profile programs, Bowden wants to do at 
least two things. Win. And be a part of a new regional game. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say you, and not Bowden, were given the Auburn job last year. You're 
aware that good coaches have been run off, or driven off, for going 8-3 and not 
genuflecting to the tradition of Bear Bryant or Frank Broyles. 
</P>
<P>
 You're coaching against, among others, Mississippi State's Jackie Sherrill and 
Arkansas' Danny Ford, who have run afoul of the NCAA at other schools but have 
been able to land other jobs because they won. Mississippi, Mississippi State 
and Alabama are under NCAA investigation for incidents in their past 
(Mississippi's investigation led to the firing of Coach Billy Brewer over the 
summer.) Even the virtually deified Bear Bryant, whose coaching disciples are 
spread throughout the South, admitted his rules and the NCAA's did not 
necessarily coincide. There are coaches in the National Football League, and on 
sabbatical, who established their coaching reputations by presiding over 
renegade college programs. Now, would you think you could run a clean program 
and flourish? 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden swears it's possible. And more important, given the fact the football 
program is on its fifth probation, albeit the first since 1980, it's more than 
possible. It's imperative.

RAIDERS ARE FINALLY HOME, FACE SEATTLE; PRO FOOTBALL: SO FAR, TEAM'S 
RECONSTRUCTION APPEARS TO BE LESS SUCCESSFUL THAN COLISEUM'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Shocking upset? 
</P>
<P>
 If the Seattle Seahawks were to beat the favored Raiders at the Coliseum this 
afternoon, that would be an upset. But the biggest upset of all is that the 
Seahawks and Raiders are at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 No one would have predicted that nearly eight months ago, when the Northridge 
earthquake left the 71-year-old L.A. Coliseum looking more like the 
1,900-year-old Rome Colosseum. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's amazing what a massive reconstruction project and $60 million can do. 
The Coliseum opened its gates on schedule last week for the USC home opener, 
the old, gray saucer looking sturdy and bright, the rubble cleared away and the 
cracks patched. Today, it's the Raiders' turn to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 They have taken a long and winding road to get back since their last Coliseum 
appearance, a 42-24 first-round playoff victory over the Denver Broncos early 
last January. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Raiders were eliminated from the playoffs in subzero weather in 
Buffalo, they have spent a long off-season listening to rumors that they were 
headed everywhere from Florida to Maryland to Oakland, have gone to training 
camp in Oxnard, have played an exhibition game in Barcelona, followed by 
exhibitions in Dallas, Pittsburgh, Anaheim and Houston, and have gone to San 
Francisco, where they were humiliated in their season opener last Monday night 
by the 49ers, 44-14. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've had some home cooking since January," Coach Art 
Shell said. "It's a chance not to have to get on an airplane and fly out of 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 If only the Raiders looked as good as their refurbished home . . . They, too, 
underwent an off-season reconstruction project, spending $29 million to patch 
up the holes and cracks so evident in their lineup last season. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Raiders' grand opening last week was nothing like that of the 
Coliseum's. The team's rebuilding project clearly failed its first inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 The running game, 26th in the 28-team NFL last season, didn't even look that 
good Monday night. The Raiders had signed fullback Tom Rathman, running back 
Harvey Williams and guard Kevin Gogan to take some of the pressure off 
quarterback Jeff Hostetler and give the offense more options. But against San 
Francisco, the Raiders gained only 34 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive linemen Scott Davis and Jerry Ball and defensive back Albert Lewis 
were supposed to shore up the defense. But the 44 points scored by the 49ers 
indicated that this defense still needs help. 
</P>
<P>
 If the past is any indicator, however, the Raiders should do better today. 
They have won their last four games at the Coliseum, playoffs included. They 
have won their last eight against Seattle, the last Seahawk victory having been 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Raider defensive line has been particularly devastating against 
Seattle. Before their last meeting, the Raiders had recorded 16 sacks in three 
previous games against the Seahawks. Nine of those 16 were credited to Anthony 
Smith, the defensive end who has been elevated to a starting role this season 
with the retirement of Howie Long and the release of Greg Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders got only two sacks against the 49ers Monday, Smith being blanked 
in that department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be fine this year," he said. "I'll be in double digits (in sacks). If 
you can't sack the quarterback in this league, you won't be playing for long." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacks have never been a problem for Smith, who has 36 in the last three 
seasons, even though he was hampered for the second half of last season by a 
lingering finger injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and his teammates, however, may find it tougher to rack up big numbers 
against Seattle this season. Once the league's offensive laughingstock, the 
Seahawks have become respectable with the development of quarterback Rick Mirer 
to complement running back Chris Warren. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Seattle scored 140 points, an NFL record for futility in a 
16-game season. But last season, with Mirer, the first-round draft choice from 
Notre Dame at the controls, the Seahawks doubled that total.  
</P>
<P>
 And last week, Seattle opened in impressive fashion against an admittedly weak 
Washington team, beating the Redskins, 28-7. Warren, a 1,000-yard rusher in 
each of the last two seasons, gained an even 100 yards and scored two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Seattle's first opening-day victory since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the Seahawks ready to make their imprint in the AFC West? 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask me again in a few more games," Coach Tom Flores said. "I think we're 
better. How much better we're going to be, that remains to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders aren't alone in making an emotional return to the Coliseum. On the 
other side of the ball, fullback Steve Smith, a Raider for seven years, will be 
coming back in a Seahawk uniform. The Raiders released him in the off-season 
because of salary-cap considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot more relaxed atmosphere (in Seattle)," Smith said. "You don't 
always feel like you're in a pressure cooker." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Raiders, considered Super Bowl contenders, don't turn things around 
today, they might welcome their next chance to get out of town.  
</P>
<P>
 Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Willie Broughton remains sidelined because of an elbow 
injury, but defensive backs Derrick Hoskins and Lionel Washington are both 
listed as probable. . . . For the Seahawks, defensive tackle Sam Adams, the 
club's top draft choice, is expected to delay his NFL debut for at least 
another week because of a knee injury. . . . The NFL Experience, the football 
theme park set up at the 1993 Super Bowl in Pasadena, will be open again this 
morning in Exposition Park, north of the Coliseum, from 9 to 11:30. Admission 
is by game ticket only.

MORNING BRIEFING: HOT ROD DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO BUY A TICKET

<P>
 Hot Rod Hundley, in "Tall Tales" by Terry Pluto, recalled the first time he 
ever played against Bob Cousy of the Boston Celtics:  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a thrill for me. He was my idol and when he said hello, it was as if 
my heart stopped beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that first game, he scored 20 points on me in the first half. George Mikan 
was my coach, and Mikan said: 'Hundley, I told you to watch Cousy, didn't I?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said: 'I did and he's great, isn't he?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Which NFL team has the current most consecutive losing seasons? 
</P>
<P>
 Getaway day: The Raiders play the Rams on Nov. 13, prompting Bernie Lincicome 
of the Chicago Tribune to write: "The winner gets to leave town first." 
</P>
<P>
 Countdown: LaVell Edwards, veteran Brigham Young football coach, on the 
Western Athletic Conference's expansion to 16 teams:  
</P>
<P>
 "I won't live long enough for us to play everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Bet on it: Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle wonders: "When 
freshman quarterback Monte Christo calls the signals for Nebraska some day, 
will they call his cadence, 'The count of . . . ?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Faulk's vault: Marshall Faulk, rookie running back with the Indianapolis 
Colts, kept all three footballs after his three touchdowns last Sunday against 
the Houston Oilers and said he will keep the ball from every touchdown he 
scores in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good thing Faulk isn't a jockey," writes Woody Woodburn of the Ventura 
Star-Free Press. "He'd need a barn instead of a trophy case." 
</P>
<P>
 Task force: The security-conscious San Francisco 49ers took out permits from 
the Kansas City, Mo., public works department to have what amounts to a short 
parade for their game with the Kansas City Chiefs today. 
</P>
<P>
 The distance from the team hotel to Arrowhead Stadium is less than a mile. 
Yet, the 49ers requested 10 police officers, at a cost to the team of about 
$3,000, for extra security. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what they're going to do with 10 officers," one Kansas City 
policeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold back the crowd? 
</P>
<P>
 Holdouts: Gene Collier, writing in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: "Only four 
National Football League teams among the 28 have no retired uniform numbers: 
the Buffalo Bills, Raiders, Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers. Guess none 
of those franchises ever had any real good players." 
</P>
<P>
 Field day: Statistician Bud Goode notes the impact of NFL kickoffs from the 
30-yard line instead of the 35. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first week of play, points scored went from an average of 18.7 in 1993 
to 23.3 because of improved field position on kickoffs. Moreover, plays per 
touchdown were reduced from 37 to 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, with 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Randall (Tex) Cobb, former heavyweight boxing contender: "People 
always ask me if success is going to change me, and I tell them I sure hope 
so." MAL FLORENCE

COMMENTARY; MILKING AN EXPENSIVE CASH COW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAL BOCK, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winning the U.S. Open is worth $550,000 on the spot and much more than that 
later on in endorsement and commercial income. 
</P>
<P>
 Those payoffs make up the major portion of $9,360,100 in prize money offered 
in this final Grand Slam event of the tennis year. Just making the field of 128 
is worth $8,150, a tidy payoff for what is just one day's work for 64 of them. 
And if a player who happens to get there is a qualifier, add another $3,000 on 
to that. 
</P>
<P>
 For the USTA, though, all of that is nothing more than petty cash. The Open is 
a license to print money, a task the organizers and their corporate partners go 
about with great zest and efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsorships for this final Grand Slam event run from $200,000 to $2 million. 
"It's never been more expensive to participate in the U.S. Open," said Seena 
Hamilton, who operates her own sports marketing company. Evidence of that is 
all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no accident that every time CBS or USA Network shows a player serving, 
the word "Heineken" is peeking over their shoulder, plastered on the back wall. 
</P>
<P>
 This is called signage and is an important part the National Tennis Center, 
where, by the way, you can buy the official brew at $4.50 a cup. That's not 
because Heineken is an official sponsor but rather because it cut a separate 
deal with Restaurant Associates, which owns the food and drink concession at 
the Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Every event at the Open has a corporate sponsor and all of them have signs in 
prominent places, just in case the audience forgets. The glamour ones -- the 
men's and women's singles -- carry the names of Infiniti, which supplies 
courtesy cars for the players, and Elizabeth Arden. You won't see Arden's sign 
on CBS, though, because Chanel has an exclusive deal with the network. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior singles and doubles are underwritten by MassMutuel. Prudential 
Securities and Chase Manhattan have the men's and women's doubles. Fujifilm 
bought the mixed doubles, while General Foods, NYNEX, Redbook Magazine and VF 
Corporation purchased other doubles events. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, like the men's and women's singles sponsors, the tab is about $2 
million each. For others like K-Swiss, which became the official shoe of the 
Open at the last moment when Reebok pulled out, the price was a bargain 
basement $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 For that, the company got an eight-seat box but no signs in the stadium and 
not even exclusivity in the booth area outside the courts, where equipment and 
accessories are sold at a frenzied pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Booth space is a separate deal, so shoppers can pay $88 for the most expensive 
K-Swiss sneaker, or stop two booths down where Nike has a $135 model on 
display. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizen is the official watch of the Open, winning a bidding war and paying a 
cool $750,000 for the privilege. Seiko was paying $350,000-$400,000 for that 
honor last year and a decade ago, Omega paid $205,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The official ice cream of the Open is Haagen Dasz. Price for the designation: 
$200,000. Price for a cup of the product: $3.50. If you prefer a jumbo waffle 
cone -- which looks suspiciously like an ordinary waffle cone -- it goes to 
$4.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroll through the food market, and a wallet can thin out in a hurry, even if 
a waistline won't. 
</P>
<P>
 A large bucket of Cajun French fries costs $6 and a foot-long hot dog is $4. 
The cholesterol is included at no extra charge. Wash it down with lemonade at 
$2.50 a cup. That's for the regular. The premium fresh-squeezed is a fancier 
$4.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Prefer something stronger? Pina colodas and daiquiris go for $7. Prefer 
something softer? Bottled water is $2. 
</P>
<P>
 Want an official U.S. Open thermal mug? That'll be $7. If you're willing to 
settle for the non-thermal variety, why that will chop a full 50 cents off the 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 Cold? Get a sweat shirt for just $40. If you want more protection, there are 
jackets for $115 and whole sweat suits for $220. At that price, you might not 
want to sweat in them, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun in your eyes? A visor costs only $10. If you want the rest of the cap, the 
price goes to $16 -- and up. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, though, all of this stuff does carry the official U.S. Open 1994 
logo. Next year, the merchants will all be back peddling '95 logo gear, 
because, after all, no one would want to be seen with last year's stuff.

COMMENATARY / MIKE LUPICA; MEGGETT FILLS IN THE HOLES FOR THE GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Phil Simms was out of the way at Giants Stadium and Lawrence Taylor was out of 
the way and there was a new quarterback for the Giants and a brand-new defense. 
And out of the recent past came a tough little champion named Dave Meggett. 
Maybe it was because Simms and Taylor were gone. Maybe that is why Meggett 
looked bigger than he ever had Sunday. Maybe that is why he played as if he had 
the run of Giants Stadium and the place suddenly belonged to him. Meggett was 
something marvelously old Sunday, on a day when everything was supposed to be 
so new. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Brown did just fine Sunday against the Eagles in his first start as 
Simms' replacement. The secondary, which is supposed to have more leaks in it 
than the Los Angeles district attorney's office, managed to cover enough of 
Randall Cunningham's receivers. There were just enough important plays on 
defense every time the Eagles got near the Giants' end zone, including one huge 
sack from Mike Strahan when the Eagles were trying to make it 28-20 early in 
the fourth quarter. But on a day when no one knew what to expect from the 
Giants, it was Meggett who ran away with the first Sunday afternoon in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Meggett recovered a fumbled Eagles' punt. He ran 68 yards with a punt return 
of his own, the fifth punt-return touchdown of his Giants' career. Then, in the 
third quarter, he took a handoff from Brown and once more this Sunday afternoon 
was wide-open for Meggett. There was a block from Lance Smith and another one 
from Jumbo Elliott. One new Giant, one old. Meggett was in the clear with 
Thomas Lewis, another new Giant, in front of him. He ran 26 yards for a 
touchdown, and the Giants had 28 points, which was going to be enough to make 
them 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like the oldest guy on the whole team sometimes," Meggett was saying 
afterward. He had showered and dressed fast. He does everything fast, including 
talk. He wore a white cap that said "No BS" on it and khaki shorts and a navy 
sweatshirt with a picture of the Seven Dwarfs on the front. Meggett is 5-7 and 
doesn't care who knows it. He is in the last year of his Giants contract, and 
it is going to cost plenty to keep him. If this was the beginning of an ending 
at Giants Stadium, Meggett made sure everybody knew he was in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Meggett said, "I feel like the Last of the Mohicans around here, and I've only 
been in the league six years." He was at the door to the interview room now, 
waiting for Dan Reeves to finish talking. "So many of your buddies leave, and 
you get to feeling like an old man in this game when you aren't an old man at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe DeCamillis, the Giants' special-teams coach, came by and handed Meggett a 
ball. Meggett smiled. "My touchdown ball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't just Simms and Taylor who were gone from the Giants Sunday. A lot of 
other people had left with them. Mark Collins was gone from the secondary and 
so was Greg Jackson, and Bob Kratch had gone to New England to play for Bill 
Parcells, and Bart Oates, who snapped the ball a thousand times to Simms, was 
in San Francisco. No one knew what to expect from Brown or anybody else Sunday. 
And Meggett handed the Giants 14 points and changed the whole day. So at least 
Meggett had not changed at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 He made his fumble recovery first. There was a punt from Mike Horan and the 
Eagles let it bounce. Then Willie Beamon, one of the new defensive backs, got 
to Jeff Sydner of the Eagles the same time the ball did. Beamon hit Sydner so 
hard you thought he had rearranged some of the letters in Sydner's name. Dave 
Meggett, flying down the field from the fullback position in the punt 
formation, ended up with the ball. The Giants got a touchdown a few plays 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Meggett was asked in the locker room about making a defensive play like that, 
in addition to the other big plays he made for the Giants Sunday. Sometimes 
Meggett looks like Thurman Thomas, only shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's this salary cap," he said. "Cap's changed everything. Cap makes them 
maximize somebody like me. Maximize the hell out of me. Don't be surprised to 
see me out there at safety one of these days." 
</P>
<P>
 He is only at safety as a punt returner. The Eagles kicked him the ball before 
the first quarter was over. Meggett got the ball a couple of strides in front 
of the Giants' 30. "Saw a wall I liked," he said. He got around the corner and 
did not look old at all, looked as fresh as anybody in the game, and finally 
there was just the Eagles' punter, Mitch Berger, on the sideline between 
Meggett and a touchdown. Meggett ran right at Berger. Berger tried to tackle 
him high, or as high as you can go on Meggett, and it was like trying to tackle 
the Giants Stadium wind. Meggett bounced off him and spun away and ran into the 
end zone, and the Giants were ahead two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always visualized that move," he said. "Jumping and spinning." 
</P>
<P>
 He has done a lot of that. He has returned punts for touchdowns and kickoffs 
for touchdown. He has caught as many as 50 passes in a season and been one of 
the great third-down players in the whole game. When the Giants needed him to 
get nearly 50 rushing yards on top of Ottis Anderson's rushing yards in the 
Super Bowl in Tampa, Meggett was right there for them. He can get lost, and not 
just because he is 5-7. He may get lost after this season. But Meggett has been 
one of the big players at Giants Stadium since he showed up there. He finished 
up his big day Sunday with the touchdown run from scrimmage that made it 28-13. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got into Jumbo Elliott's pocket," Meggett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Giants went into Soldier Field and beat the Bears on the first 
Sunday. Simms took them down the field at the end. This time, the season 
started with Brown, who completed 10 of 20 passes for 171 yards and one 
touchdown. Brown said he talked to Simms Friday night and was offered "Phil 
Simms' Golden Rule." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just win the game," Simms told Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown won a game Sunday by doing what Simms did a lot. He watched Dave Meggett 
run down the field with a punt. Later, Brown gave the ball to Meggett and just 
watched him go. There were holes at Giants Stadium Sunday, left by the people 
who were gone. Dave Meggett, who is still here, ran through them.

 North Carolina State knocked off No. 22 Clemson, 29-12, Saturday in an 
Atlantic Coast Conference game at Clemson, S.C., the worst home loss for the 
Tigers in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina State, 2-0 overall and 1-0 in the ACC, piled up 493 yards and 
held Clemson (1-1, 0-1) to 183 yards and one offensive score -- a 13-yard 
touchdown reception by freshman Kenya Crooks with three minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Goines set a school record with his 15th and 16th touchdown receptions, 
one on a 76-yard play, and finished with three catches for 108 yards.

 Georgia Tech 45, Western Carolina 26 -- Tommy Luginbill, the son of former San 
Diego State coach Al Luginbill, threw four second-half touchdown passes -- two 
to Derrick Steagall -- and the Yellow Jackets held off the stubborn Division 
I-AA Catamounts at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Luginbill, a junior college transfer from Palomar, completed 19 of 37 passes 
for 280 yards. After going seven of 20 for 62 yards in the first half, he 
connected on 12 of 17 for 218 in the second.

 A bad snap on a punt set up the winning field goal for Duke in a 13-10 
nonconference victory over East Carolina at Durham, N.C. East Carolina, after 
missing on third-and-eight at its 47, was going to punt, but the snap sailed 
over the head of punter Matt Levine, who downed the ball at the Pirate 15. Duke 
moved to the 10, from where Tom Cochran kicked a 28-yard field goal. . . . Mike 
Groh, making his first college start, threw three touchdown passes to Tyrone 
Davis and ran for another score to lead Virginia (1-1) to a 47-10 nonconference 
victory over Navy at Annapolis.

 Rutgers 17, West Virginia 12 -- The Mountaineers, 11-0 in the regular season 
last year, fell to 1-2 by losing to the Scarlet Knights at Piscataway, N.J. 
Rutgers (2-0) scored twice within a six-second span in the third quarter, first 
on a four-yard touchdown pass from Ray Lucas to backup tight end Jason Curry 
and then on a 24-yard interception return by Alcides Catanho.

 Backup Billy West, who came into the game in the second quarter, rushed for 
226 yards and a touchdown in 26 carries to lead Pittsburgh (1-1) to a 30-16 
nonconference victory over Ohio University at Pittsburgh. West, who is from 
Ohio, replaced Curtis Martin, who suffered a slightly sprained ankle in the 
second quarter. West had to leave the game in the fourth quarter when he was 
shaken up. Martin gained 251 yards in Pitt's season-opening loss to Texas. Pitt 
ended a 10-game home-field losing streak. . . . Army had 382 yards rushing and 
442 overall against overmatched Division I-AA Holy Cross and won, 49-3, at West

receptions for 174. He had a 49-yard touchdown catch and receptions of 41 and 
60 yards that led to touchdowns for the Tigers (1-1), who scored 21 points in 
the third quarter after trailing 18-7 at halftime. . . . Jason Cooper ran for

 Texas Christian 44, New Mexico 29 -- Junior halfback Andre Davis ran for 325 
yards, including a school record 87-yard touchdown, to lead the Horned Frogs in 
a nonconference game at Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 The 325 yards in 31 carries by Davis is the most ever against New Mexico, 
surpassing the 316 yards that Emmitt Smith gained against the Lobos for Florida 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' big night also was the second best in TCU history, just short of the 
343 yards by Tony Jeffrey against Tulane in 1986.

DEAN HELPS FLORIDA MAKE A CASE, 73-7; SEC: QUARTERBACK HAS FOUR TOUCHDOWN 
PASSES FOR NO. 2-RANKED GATORS IN ROUT OF KENTUCKY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Steve Spurrier of No. 2-ranked Florida isn't eager to join a debate over 
who should be No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Gators made a powerful statement for returning to the top spot 
with a 73-7 Southeastern Conference victory over Kentucky on Saturday, Spurrier 
said he's more concerned about next week's game at Tennessee than with the 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seriously, Nebraska deserved to be up there as much as we did," said 
Spurrier, whose team slipped behind the Cornhuskers last week despite beating 
New Mexico State by 49 points in its first game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were honored to be up there in the preseason, but we really hadn't done 
all that much. We won one game we should have won. . . . We'll be tested a lot 
more when we play Tennessee." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gators, who needed a last-minute touchdown to beat the Wildcats a year 
ago, scored on five of their first six possessions en route to a 31-7 halftime 
lead on Saturday. They improved to 2-0 overall and 1-0 in the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September at Lexington, Ky., Terry Dean had four passes intercepted and 
was yanked twice before backup Danny Wuerffel rescued the Gators. This time, 
Dean was nearly flawless. 
</P>
<P>
 After tying an NCAA record with seven touchdown passes in the first half of 
Florida's 70-21 victory over New Mexico State, Dean had four more against 
Kentucky (1-1, 0-1), which trailed, 21-0, before it managed to make a first 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean left the game late in the third quarter, finishing with 15 completions in 
22 attempts for 201 yards. In five quarters this season, he has 11 touchdown 
passes and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 After Dean tossed a perfect spiral to Reidel Anthony on a 65-yard scoring play 
in the third quarter, the Florida Field crowd of 85,238 began to chant "We're 
No. 1!" 
</P>
<P>
 The roar continued when Xavier McCray picked up Daymon Carter's fumble on the 
ensuing kickoff and ran it back 33 yards for a 52-7 lead.

SEMINOLES, OFF SLOW, RACE TO 52-20 VICTORY; ACC: AFTER TRAILING AT HALFTIME, 
NO. 4 FLORIDA STATE SCORES 35 CONSECUTIVE POINTS AGAINST MARYLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden figured the game wouldn't be pretty. He was 
right -- sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Kanell had another sensational performance against Maryland and the 
fourth-ranked Seminoles rebounded from a stunning halftime deficit with 35 
consecutive points in a 52-20 Atlantic Coast Conference victory Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland was coming off a 33-point loss to Duke but led the Seminoles early in 
the second quarter, 13-3, and at halftime, 20-17. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw the Duke game, I thought this game might get ugly," Bowden said. 
"The only ugly thing was us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kanell: "We came in here hoping for a shutout and hoping to score 60 
points. Maybe we overlooked them a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Kanell, in a performance reminiscent of his effort against Maryland last 
season, directed the Seminoles on two third-quarter scoring drives that put the 
defending national champions in command. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanell completed 28 of 44 passes for 417 yards and a touchdown. A year ago, he 
started against Maryland for injured Charlie Ward and completed 28 passes for 
341 yards as Florida State pulled away in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday's game, Zack Crockett and Rock Preston each scored twice and the 
Seminoles, 2-0 overall and 2-0 in the ACC, amassed 731 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden attributed the second-half blitz to superior depth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maryland just gave it everything they had but they ran out of gas," he said. 
"It was a hot day and we played twice as many players as they did. I thought it 
had an effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland's Scott Milanovich completed 17 of 34 passes for 188 yards and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we gained a lot of confidence today," Maryland Coach Mark Duffner 
said. "Now we need what they have: depth." 
</P>
<P>
 After generating 185 yards of offense in the first half, Maryland (0-2, 0-2) 
fizzled in the second.

SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE; ALABAMA TAKES ADVANTAGE OF TURNOVERS, BEATS 
VANDERBILT, 17-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No. 11 Alabama used strong defense and turnover-free offense to get past 
Vanderbilt, 17-7, Saturday in a Southeastern Conference game at Tuscaloosa, 
Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama's defense forced four turnovers, setting up both touchdowns, and the 
plodding offense had trouble moving the ball but never gave it away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Vanderbilt played extremely tough," said Alabama Coach Gene 
Stallings. "But when we really had to have it, we got a couple of interceptions 
and a fumble and turned the game around." 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama has dominated Vanderbilt over the past quarter-century, winning 24 of 
the past 25 meetings, but didn't look very dominating Saturday. In fact, the 
offense managed only two drives of more than 23 yards and quarterback Jay 
Barker was sacked seven times. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt even had a chance to go ahead when Steve Yenner lined up for a 
37-yard field goal attempt with the score tied 7-7 late in the third quarter. 
But Shannon Brown broke right up the middle and blocked the kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a lot of momentum on their side. Everybody was looking for someone 
to make the plays," said Brown, who did just that and cut his lip in the 
process. "The field goal is not a rest play. We go out and practice it every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 The Crimson Tide, 2-0 overall and 1-0 in the SEC, managed only 151 yards in 
the first three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were a lot more physical than last year," Alabama offensive lineman Joey 
Harville said. "It was much harder for us to wear them down." 
</P>
<P>
 But wear the Commodores down they did. "To win in the SEC, you can't play just 
three quarters," Harville pointed out. "You've got to play 60 minutes of ball." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a lesson Vandy (1-1, 0-1) still must learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't play like that in the second half and win a football game," Coach 
Gerry DiNardo said. "Momentum is something we have to learn. It changes the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Dameian Jeffries made Alabama's first big defensive play from his end 
position, trailing the play to pick off a first-quarter pass that bounced off 
Vandy receiver Gabe Banks. Displaying the skills that made him an all-state 
tight end in high school, the 278-pound senior broke a tackle and cut back 
across the field on a 24-yard return to the Tide 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "Running with the ball reminded me of my tight end days," Jeffries said. "It 
felt good." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Jeffries should have stayed on the field with the offense. It took seven 
plays for Alabama to reach the end zone, scoring on Barker's eight-yard pass to 
Curtis Brown with 6:26 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be the Tide's only score for more than three quarters. Michael 
Proctor, who missed a 40-yard field goal in the third quarter, put the Tide 
ahead for good on a 31-yarder with 6:04 remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama then sealed the victory when Vandy quarterback Ronny Gordon, trying to 
scramble for a first down, fumbled and Ralph Staten recovered at the Commodore 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking no chances, Alabama ran Sherman Williams three straight plays to the 
two before freshman Curtis Alexander went over with 2:59 remaining. Williams 
finished with 125 yards in 26 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama continued its domination of Vandy going back to 1970. Not only has the 
Tide won 24 of the last 25 meetings, including 10 in a row, and it now leads 
the series, 50-18-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodores defense couldn't be faulted for the loss, however. Anchored by 
linemen James Manley and Jay Stallworth and linebackers Gerald Collins and 
Jamie Duncan, Vandy gave up only 222 yards and won the statistical battle 
against the Tide's more vaunted defense, which allowed 279. Duncan had 16 
tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vandy offense, which has relied almost solely on the run since DiNardo 
arrived three years ago, continued to show more balance. In a season-opening 
victory over Wake Forest, the Commodores threw their first touchdown pass since 
1992. Against Alabama, Gordon completed nine of 17 passes for 131 yards but was 
intercepted three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderbilt scored its only touchdown on a seven-play, 72-yard drive that was 
more impressive than anything Alabama put together. Gordon threw a 21-yard pass 
to Kenny Simon, and Cliff Deese followed with a 25-yard touchdown run with 3:47 
to go in the half.

 North Carolina State knocked off No. 22 Clemson, 29-12, Saturday at Clemson, 
S.C., the worst home loss for the Tigers in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 NC State wide receiver Eddie Goines, who caught two touchdown passes, 
including one on a 76-yard play, said the Wolfpack learned a lot in a loss to 
Clemson last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Down 20-0 in the fourth quarter of that game, the Wolfpack scored two 
touchdowns and had a desperation drive stopped at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we came out very flat. We didn't play with any emotion the first 
three quarters," he said. "But then, when we put it all together, the emotion 
and the effort, we were able to play well the last three quarters. That let us 
know that we could beat Clemson at Death Valley or wherever." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, North Carolina State (2-0, 1-0) piled up 493 yards and held 
Clemson (1-1, 0-1) to 183 yards and one offensive score -- a 13-yard touchdown 
reception by freshman Kenya Crooks with three minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Goines set a school record with his 15th and 16th career touchdown receptions. 
He finished with three catches for 108 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Harvey completed 12 of 17 passes for 167 yards and two touchdowns for 
North Carolina State, which handed Clemson its most lopsided defeat at Death 
Valley since a 34-17 loss to Duke in 1980.

 Georgia Tech 45, Western Carolina 26 -- Tommy Luginbill, the son of former San 
Diego State coach Al Luginbill, threw four second-half touchdown passes -- two 
to Derrick Steagall -- and the Yellow Jackets held off the stubborn Division 
I-AA Catamounts at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Luginbill, a junior college transfer from Palomar, completed 19 of 37 passes 
for 280 yards. After going seven of 20 for 62 yards in the first half, he 
connected on 12 of 17 for 218 in the second.

<P>
 Tech (1-1) overcame five turnovers and missed field goals of 30 and 38 yards 
by Phil Shirley. 
</P>
<P>
 Tech put the game away on David Hendrix's 65-yard interception with 3:19 left.

 Western Carolina of the Southern Conference fell to 1-1. EAST

 Rutgers 17, West Virginia 12 -- The Mountaineers, 11-0 in the regular season 
last year, fell to 1-2 by losing to the Scarlet Knights at Piscataway, N.J.

 Rutgers (2-0) scored twice within a six-second span in the third quarter, 
first on a four-yard touchdown pass from Ray Lucas to backup tight end Jason 
Curry and then on a 24-yard interception return by Alcides Catanho. 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia, hurt by turnovers, had numerous scoring opportunities but 
managed only two first-half field goals and a late touchdown dive by Jimmy 
Gary. 
</P>
<P>
 Army 49, Holy Cross 3 -- The Cadets had 382 yards rushing and 442 overall

<P>
 Rick Roper, one of Army's two quarterbacks, is out for the season after 
tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee on the sixth play from 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 Army's Kevin Vaughn turned in the game's biggest play, a 60-yard touchdown run 
with 4:38 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Army scored touchdowns on its first two possessions of the second half to pull 
away. WESTERN ATHLETIC 
</P>
<P>
 Brigham Young 45, Air Force 21 -- The Cougars' running game, which had 
disappeared, returned for this Western Athletic Conference game at Air Force 
Academy, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 After rushing for just 74 yards in their opener and averaging only 106 yards 
per game on the ground throughout 1993, the Cougars (2-0, 2-0) generated 280 
yards rushing against the Falcons (0-2, 0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Willis ran for 151 yards and three touchdowns and John Walsh passed for 
three more scores in BYU's 12th consecutive victory over Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people were thinking that our running game was lost," Willis said. 
"Everyone knows now that we've still got it. I feel we can run the ball on any 
team. If we can mix up the run and pass, we'll be hard to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach LaVell Edwards: "The long-awaited running attack that we keep 
talking about finally came through. That was a big plus for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a couple of really good runs on those first two drives in the second 
half, and that was a key. Then we were able to throw some quick outs. The fact 
that we were able to get the running game going really was the (reason for the) 
victory." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars scored the first 21 points of each half in handing Edwards his 
199th career coaching victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh completed 23 of 35 passes for 315 yards as the Cougars amassed 604 total 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made some adjustments in the second half," Walsh said. "They were coming 
after us and they were playing deep with their corners and safeties. So all we 
did was take what they would give us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jamal is a great running back. I've told him from the beginning of the season 
he had to get back to the form he had a few years ago. He's picking it up. This 
is what we expect of him every week." BIG WEST 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada 18, Arkansas State 0 -- Ken Minor ran for 171 yards and scored two 
touchdowns to led the Wolf Pack over the Indians at Reno in the Big West 
Conference opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada (2-0, 1-0) capitalized on four fumbles lost by Arkansas State (0-2, 
0-1). Two bad snaps from center set up a touchdown and accounted for a safety. 
SOUTHLAND 
</P>
<P>
 La Verne 42, Menlo 38 -- Anthony Rice caught nine passes for 211 yards and two 
touchdowns to lead the Leopards (1-0) over the Oaks (0-2) at La Verne.

MANY HAPPY RETURNS IN OREGON STATE VICTORY; NONCONFERENCE: TONGUE RUNS BACK TWO 
INTERCEPTIONS FOR TOUCHDOWNS TO HELP DEFEAT WYOMING, 44-31.

<P>
 Reggie Tongue returned two of his three interceptions for touchdowns Saturday, 
helping Oregon State to a 44-31 victory over Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Tongue's 36-yard interception return for a score with 1:24 to play clinched 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Tongue, who also returned an interception for a touchdown in a victory last 
season at Wyoming, grabbed John Gustin's soft toss over the middle before 
reversing his field twice on the way to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Tongue had two interceptions in Oregon State's 21-point first quarter, 
returning one 46 yards for a score and setting up a touchdown with the other. 
His two interception returns for scores tied a school record set by Paul Snider 
in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
 Shayzar Hawkins' 10-yard touchdown run after a crucial spot of the ball by the 
officials on a fourth-down try gave Oregon State (1-1) the lead for good at 
38-31 with 5:06 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 On fourth and inches just outside the 10, Beaver quarterback Rahim Muhammad 
kept the ball on an option play and was wrapped up at the line of scrimmage. 
But officials spotted the ball just over the line and Oregon State picked up 
the first down by about two inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyoming (1-1) came back from deficits of 21-7 and 31-21 to tie the score, the 
last at 31-31 on Cory Sorenson's 21-yard field goal with 10:47 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments earlier, Wyoming halfback Sharay Ratliffe completed a 44-yard scoring 
pass to Marcus Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustin threw four interceptions, two in the final 4 1/2 minutes.

WASHINGTON STATE ROLLS AFTER INEFFECTIVE START; NONCONFERENCE: DAVIS PASSES FOR 
TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN 24-3 VICTORY OVER FRESNO STATE AFTER FIRST THREE POSSESSIONS 
END IN TURNOVERS.

 Chad Davis passed for two touchdowns Saturday as Washington State overcame a 
poor start to defeat Fresno State, 24-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring strikes to Jay Dumas and Albert Kennedy were the first passing 
touchdowns this season for Davis, a redshirt sophomore transfer from Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State (2-0) held Fresno State (1-2) to 34 yards rushing. Bulldog 
quarterback Adrian Claiborne had two passes intercepted and was sacked five 
times. He completed 15 of 33 passes for 189 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis completed 18 of 27 passes for 236 yards, with three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Cougars' first three drives were ended by two fumbles and an 
interception, Davis and Dumas combined on a 29-yard screen pass to put 
Washington State up for good, 7-3, with 25 seconds to play in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Madu broke a tackle and dashed 21 yards to score, capping an 80-yard 
drive to start the third quarter and give Washington State a 14-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Truant kicked a 38-yard field goal to begin the fourth quarter, and Davis 
found Kennedy in the back of the end zone with a 25-yard touchdown pass to 
complete the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State scored first on a 30-yard field goal by Johan Lyssand midway 
through the first quarter, getting the opportunity when Washington State 
fumbled a snap at the Fresno 39. Lyssand later missed a 31-yarder and had 
another kick blocked.

SOUTHWEST ROUNDUP; TEXAS DEFEATS LOUISVILLE, IS 2-0 FIRST TIME SINCE '85

<P>
 It took a week, but 20th-ranked Texas has found its defense. 
</P>
<P>
 After giving up 489 yards, including 251 to one running back, in a 
season-opening victory against Pittsburgh, the Longhorns figured out how to 
stop the run Saturday and defeated Louisville, 30-16, at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas, a once-powerful program that has struggled the past decade, is 2-0 for 
the first time since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week, we came out nervous and tense and didn't play up to our 
potential," linebacker Kevin Watler said. "This week, we knew we had to come 
out and show what we were capable of." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense produced three interceptions, one for a touchdown, and had four 
sacks against the Cardinals (0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Tulane 15, Rice 13 -- Bart Baldwin kicked the last of his school-record five 
field goals, a 47-yarder, as time expired at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin, who missed four field-goal attempts against Southern Mississippi last 
week, broke the record of four field goals set by Dan Guirl against Louisville 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed a chance at a record fifth when he failed on a 45-yarder with 3:34 
to play. But Tulane (1-1) gave him another chance, driving 42 yards in eight 
plays, spurred by a 12-yard, third-down pass from Craig Randell to Jerold 
Sowell.

IT'S PAYBACK TIME FOR TEXAS A&M; NONCONFERENCE: AGGIES ROLL OVER OKLAHOMA, 
36-14, TO AVENGE 30-POINT LOSS TO SOONERS LAST SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Corey Pullig passed for two touchdowns and Rodney Thomas scored twice Saturday 
as 16th-ranked Texas A&M avenged a 30-point blowout by Oklahoma last season 
with a 36-14 victory over the No. 15 Sooners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies (2-0), who lost to Oklahoma last season, 44-14, had been pointing 
to the rematch against the Sooners (1-1), who beat Syracuse last week, 30-29. 
</P>
<P>
 It paid off with an impressive victory, their 21st in a row at home, before a 
nonconference record crowd of 72,577 at Kyle Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sooners stopped Texas A&M's vaunted running game, but Pullig completed 
touchdown passes of 12 and two yards to keep Oklahoma off balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M put the game away late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With Oklahoma trailing by five points, James Allen fumbled to Larry Brown at 
the Sooner eight. Three plays later, Pullig connected with tight end James 
McKeehan on a two-yard touchdown pass with 5:13 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Sooner fumble led to a 26-yard field goal by Kyle Bryant, his third of 
the game. Then Ray Mickens intercepted Garrick McGee's pass and returned it 38 
yards for a touchdown to the delight of the Aggies, who believed the Sooners 
ran up the score last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the same thing that happened to us last year," said A&M defensive 
back Ray Mickens. "We waited a whole year for this and we let it all out. It's 
a great feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Oklahoma Coach Gary Gibbs: "What happened to us in the fourth quarter is 
what happened to A&M last year. What looked like an exciting finish ended up in 
a blowout." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas scored his second touchdown on a one-yard run to give the Aggies a 19-7 
lead midway through the third quarter. Dennis Allen's interception put the 
Aggies on the Sooner 32 and Thomas ripped off runs of 10, eight, one and one 
yards on the brief scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a bad bounce for Texas A&M that gave Oklahoma life. Leeland McElroy 
bobbled a crazily caroming punt and Oklahoma's Tim Denton recovered at the 
Aggie 15. Three plays later, McGee connected with Allen on a four-yard 
touchdown pass that cut Oklahoma's deficit to 19-14.

 Ontiwaun Carter ran for two touchdowns and Richard Dice caught two touchdown 
passes Saturday night as ninth-ranked Arizona scored 31 first-half points and 
went on to rout New Mexico State, 44-0. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State made it across midfield only twice in each half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies threatened only once, driving to Arizona's six-yard line on its 
final possession after quarterback Cody Ledbetter completed passes of 34 and 38 
yards. But Ledbetter's fourth-and-goal pass into the end zone was broken up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies missed on their only other scoring opportunity, a 47-yard 
field-goal attempt by Bubba Culin shortly before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (2-0), the nation's leading team in 1993 against the run, gave up 83 
yards rushing and 231 total. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's 561 yards on offense, including 334 rushing, surpassed its 1993 
season best of 477 against Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who carried 18 times for 149 yards to move into third on Arizona's 
all-time rushing list with 2,594 yards, ran for 131 in the first half. He 
scored touchdowns on runs of five and seven yards as the Wildcats opened a 24-0 
lead. His longest run was a 45-yard cutback in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona scored on its first possession, with Dice converting a pass from Dan 
White into a 57-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Dice caught four passes for 122 yards in the first half, his last a 38-yard 
touchdown at the right flag 21 seconds before intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona gained 339 yards in the half -- 153 on White's passing -- as New 
Mexico State (0-2) fell behind, 31-0.

HOLT HELPS AZTECS END PAC-10 FUTILITY; NONCONFERENCE: LAST-SECOND FIELD GOAL 
GIVES SAN DIEGO STATE A 22-20 VICTORY OVER CALIFORNIA.

 Peter Holt kicked a 32-yard field goal as time expired Saturday night, lifting 
San Diego State to a 22-20 victory over California that ended the Aztecs' 
17-game winless streak against Pacific 10 Conference schools. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State (2-0) of the Western Athletic Conference had been 0-16-1 
against Pac-10 teams since beating Stanford in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the season opener for Cal, which beat San Diego State at Berkeley 
last season, 45-25. 
</P>
<P>
 California had gone ahead, 20-19, when Dave Barr, whose pass was intercepted 
on the previous drive at the Golden Bear eight, completed a 10-yard scoring 
pass to tight end Marc Vera with 5:04 to play. The conversion pass to Tyrone 
Edwards was incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears could have padded the lead, but a 34-yard field-goal attempt by Ryan 
Longwell was wide left with 3:22 to play. The Aztecs started their winning 
drive from the 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest play of the drive, a 27-yard pass from Tim Gutierrez to Marc 
Ziegler, moved the Aztecs to the Cal 18. After two running plays gained four 
yards, Holt connected. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez completed 25 of 43 passes for 314 yards and two touchdowns, with one 
interception. Barr completed 21 of 34 passes for 242 yards and two touchdowns, 
with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs, outgained in the first quarter, 84 yards to two, dominated in the 
third quarter as the defense held Cal on three consecutive drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Holt kicked field goals of 22 and 21 yards, and Gutierrez connected with Will 
Blackwell on a 65-yard touchdown pass play with 2:26 to play in the quarter for 
a 19-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The long touchdown pass capped an 82-yard, four-play drive that took only 46 
seconds. On second and 10 from the San Diego State 35, Blackwell outjumped 
cornerback Artis Houston for Gutierrez's pass at the Cal 40 and raced into the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 A conversion pass from Gutierrez to Curtis Shearer failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal led at halftime, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal's Ryan Longwell kicked a 42-yard field goal for the only scoring in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State got a quick change of luck to take the lead early in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gutierrez in the shotgun formation on third and 13 from the Cal 44, the 
ball was snapped over his head for a 23-yard loss. Cal's Matt Clizbe fumbled 
the ensuing punt, with San Diego State's Eric Sutton recovering at the Cal 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Five plays later, Gutierrez connected with sophomore running back Ken Overby 
on a two-yard touchdown pass for a 7-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal then scored on consecutive possessions.

COSTA, MIAMI CRUISE PAST ARIZONA STATE; NONCONFERENCE: QUARTERBACK PASSES FOR 
295 YARDS AND FOUR TOUCHDOWNS IN 47-10 VICTORY.

<P>
 Frank Costa passed for a career-high 295 yards and four touchdowns Saturday 
night and fifth-ranked Miami feasted on first-half turnovers to run away from 
Arizona State, 47-10. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams had never met, but Miami had struck out in three previous trips to 
Sun Devil Stadium.The Hurricanes (2-0) lost in the 1985, 1987 and 1994 Fiesta 
Bowls, absorbing a stinging 29-0 defeat at the hands of Arizona last New Year's 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 That defeat raised questions whether the proud dynasty was in decline and 
prompted Coach Dennis Erickson to guarantee a victory over Arizona State. His 
Hurricanes wasted little time making good, taking advantage of three fumble 
recoveries and two interceptions to build a 33-10 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa completed nine passes in last week's 56-0 victory over Georgia Southern, 
and the Hurricanes scored six touchdowns on the ground. Against a stronger 
opponent, Costa went to a modest passing game that featured short passes, which 
his receivers stretched into long scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Jammi German scored from 56 and 49 yards out on a play called the "middle 
screen," a slant inside to the wide receiver about five yards downfield. German 
put Miami ahead, 6-3, with his first catch, turning outside to beat covering 
linebackers and cutting back inside to outrun the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
 His second touchdown made the score 40-10 with 8:41 to play in the third 
quarter, and Erickson pulled Costa. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa also completed touchdown passes of 10 yards to Chris T. Jones and 53 
yards to tailback Jonathan Harris, who caught Arizona State in a blitz and 
raced to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 James Stewart scored on nine- and one-yard runs, and Danyell Ferguson made a 
three-yard touchdown run.

 Illinois' defense held Missouri to one first down Saturday in a 42-0 victory.

 Missouri (0-2) has lost 17 consecutive road games, dating to the final game of

also had 30 first downs. Missouri's only first down came with 3:39 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been around a lot of great defenses but I've never gone that far into a

Stanford into scoring position in the final seconds, but Eric Abrams missed a 
23-yard field-goal attempt with three seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams, a left-footed kicker, said he would have preferred kicking from the 
left hashmark instead of the right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I kicked the ball I knew there was a problem. I didn't do a good job 
of adjusting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford Coach Bill Walsh was unforgiving. "We missed poorly on the kick," he 
said. "There was no excuse for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern (0-1-1), scoring the most points since a 41-14 victory over Wake 
Forest in 1991, took advantage of three fumble recoveries, two by nose guard 
Bill Koziel, for three scores and a 31-27 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern could have had a bigger lead. Stanford's Mike Michell was 
credited with a seven-yard touchdown run by the game officials even though 
television replays showed the ball was fumbled away at the two. 
</P>
<P>
 A touchdown wasn't signaled on the play, which ended with Northwestern 
recovering in the end zone for an apparent touchback. It was only after the 
officials conferred among themselves that Martin was given a touchdown to give 
Stanford a 13-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, Sam Valenzisi kicked a 47-yard field goal, the longest 
of his career, to give Northwestern a 34-27 lead. But Stanford came right back 
with an 11-yard touchdown pass from Stenstrom to Justin Armour to tie the score 
at 34-34. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur, who replaced ineffective starting quarterback Tim Hughes, connected 
with Michael Senters on a five-yard pass to put the Wildcats ahead, 41-34, in 
the opening seconds of the fourth quarter. But on the next series, Stenstrom 
scored his second touchdown on a one-yard run.

WASHINGTON ROLLS BEHIND KAUFMAN; NONCONFERENCE: TAILBACK RUNS FOR 211 YARDS IN 
25-16 VICTORY OVER OHIO STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Napoleon Kaufman passed up the NFL draft in April to rewrite the Washington 
Huskies' record book. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the senior tailback from Lompoc ran for a career-best 211 yards 
and scored a touchdown to lead the No. 25 Huskies to a 25-16 victory over 
18th-ranked Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman is only 78 yards from becoming the Huskies' all-time leading rusher. 
Joe Steele set the record of 3,091 from 1976-79. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I had to do today is run and run fast," Kaufman said. "Any time you can 
break off a long run, it gets the other team thinking. But I hope nobody thinks 
I'm going to run for 80 yards every play." 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State limited Kaufman to 51 yards in 18 carries during a 21-12 victory on 
grass last season at Columbus, Ohio. Kaufman shredded the Buckeyes this time on 
an artificial surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you rely on quickness like he does, obviously you're going to be more 
effective on turf," Ohio State Coach John Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington (1-1) scored three touchdowns to build a 19-0 first-quarter lead 
before hanging on to beat the Buckeyes (1-1) before a crowd of 70,861. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring its second touchdown and second two-point conversion with 1:43 
to play, Ohio State got another chance when Alex Rodriguez recovered an onside 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Hoying connected with D.J. Jones on a 44-yard pass to the Washington 
nine. But Hoying threw three incomplete passes and then was sacked at the 17 
with 53 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's defense sacked Hoying six times. Husky linebacker Richie Chambers 
had 3 1/2 sacks and 14 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were kind of shellshocked after the first quarter," Ohio State's Matt 
Finkes said. "Then we realized we weren't out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State, with star receiver Joey Galloway suspended for one game, trailed 
at halftime, 22-0. The Buckeyes got a 24-yard touchdown run from Eddie George 
in the third quarter and Hoying passed 13 yards to Buster Gillman with 1:43 
left for the second touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State converted both of its two-point conversion attempts on passes by 
Hoying.

BIG TEN ROUNDUP; WISCONSIN OPENS WITH A 56-0 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tailback Brent Moss, the nation's leading returning rusher, ran for 129 yards 
and three touchdowns Saturday as 10th-ranked Wisconsin opened its season with a 
56-0 victory over Eastern Michigan at Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow senior tailback Terrell Fletcher added 100 yards and three touchdowns 
in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 With star wide receiver Lee DeRamus in the hospital after suffering a broken 
left leg in practice on Thursday, Badger Coach Barry Alvarez turned to his 
reliable tailback tandem. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the two became the best rushing duo in Big Ten history when Moss 
(1,637) and Fletcher (996) combined for 2,633 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Each ran for two scores in the first half as Wisconsin, coming off the 
winningest season in the school's 105-year history, built a 35-0 halftime lead 
over the outclassed Eagles (0-2) of the Mid-American Conference before a 
sellout crowd of 77,745 at Camp Randall Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Badgers returned 14 starters from last year's 10-1-1 squad that shared the 
Big Ten title with Ohio State and defeated UCLA, 21-16, in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss, who extended his streak of 100-yard rushing games to 12, showed he 
hasn't lost a step since winning most valuable player honors in the Rose Bowl 
and Fletcher again showed that he should not be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the two-a-days and practices in the hot sun from Jan. 2 until today, 
it seemed like an eternity," Fletcher said. "Yesterday, we weren't saying, 
'It's game time!' We were saying, 'It's about time!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 35, Miami (Ohio) 14 -- Redshirt freshman Alex Smith rushed for 157 
yards in the first half and finished with 191 as the Hoosiers romped at 
Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who had 152 yards in 23 carries in his collegiate debut last week, 
carried 26 times in the first half and sat out the fourth quarter as Indiana 
(2-0) took command. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana rushed for 314 yards against the Redskins (0-2), breaking the game 
open in the second half with a pair of 80-yard drives and a Memorial 
Stadium-record 97-yard return of an intercepted pass by Alfonzo Thurman. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa 37, Iowa State 9 -- The Hawkeyes turned third-quarter fumbles by Cyclone 
quarterbacks Todd Doxzon and Robby Duncan into 17 points and won easily at Iowa 
City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature on the field was 102 degrees at game time and both teams were 
sloppy. Iowa (2-0) committed three turnovers, including Ryan Terry's fumble 
into the end zone, and Iowa State (0-2) had four turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa State mistakes were the more costly and Iowa stretched its winning streak 
against the Cyclones to 12 games, earning its most lopsided victory in the 
series since 1987, when it won, 48-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading at halftime, 13-3, Iowa broke the game open after Doxzon fumbled on 
Iowa State's first two plays from scrimmage in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas 17, Michigan State 10 -- Asheiki Preston directed two long scoring 
drives to lead the mistake-prone Jayhawks before 48,100 at Lawrence, Kan., the 
biggest crowd ever to see a Kansas home opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas (2-0) had three turnovers in the first half as Michigan State opened a 
10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jayhawks went ahead for the first time at 14-10 with a 12-play, 74-yard 
drive on their first possession of the second half. Preston, who left the game 
in the fourth quarter because of a head injury, carried seven times for 36 
yards in the go-ahead march. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior quarterback scored the winning touchdown on a one-yard sneak. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 33, Pacific 7 -- Chris Darkins ran for a career-high 179 yards in 33 
carries and scored two touchdowns at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Scott Eckers nor Tim Schade excelled in splitting time at quarterback 
but each passed for a touchdown as Minnesota rebounded from a 56-3 opening-game 
loss to Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Chalberg tied a school record with four field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific (1-1) wasn't able to duplicate its 1986 upset of Minnesota, the Big 
West school's only victory ever over a Big Ten team. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue 51, Toledo 17 -- Corey Rogers rushed for 129 yards and three touchdowns 
and Joe Hagins, a starter on defense, ran for two other touchdowns at West 
Lafayette, Ind., as Purdue ended a 10-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boilermakers (1-0), whose 1-10 record last season was the school's worst 
in almost 90 years, spotted the Rockets (1-1) a 17-7 lead in the second quarter 
before starting their comeback with a 12-yard fumble return for a touchdown by 
Derrick Brown.

<P>
 The temperature on the field was 102 degrees at game time and both teams were

</P>
<P>
 Iowa State mistakes were the more costly and Iowa stretched its winning streak 
against the Cyclones to 12 games, earning its most lopsided victory in the 
series since 1987, when it won, 48-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading at halftime, 13-3, Iowa broke the game open after Doxzon fumbled on 
Iowa State's first two plays from scrimmage in the third quarter. Chris Webb 
recovered the first fumble at the Iowa State 33, setting up Todd Romano's 
33-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Bickham pounced on Doxzon's second fumble at the Iowa State 22 and Kent 
Kahl scored on a one-yard run four plays later, making the score 23-3 less than 
five minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan then replaced Doxzon and, on his second series, missed connections on a 
handoff to Graston Norris. Freshman defensive back Kerry Cooks picked up the 
ball at his 49 and ran unmolested 51 yards for a touchdown, stretching the lead 
to 30-3 with 5:14 to play in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With Iowa State's defense tiring, No. 3 tailback Tavian Banks ran 38 yards for 
Iowa's final touchdown with 10:50 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa State's triple-option offense, which produced the nation's 11th-best 
rushing attack last season, stalled for the second consecutive game. The 
Cyclones managed only 249 yards in a season-opening loss to Division I-AA 
Northern Iowa and were held to 233 against Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Doxzon scored Iowa State's only touchdown on a one-yard run with 7:48 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa, getting 106 yards in 19 carries from Sedrick Shaw, moved the ball from 
the start. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first series of the game, the Hawkeyes marched from their 34 to the 
Iowa State two on 10 running plays, only to give the ball up when Terry fumbled 
as he was about to score. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hawkeyes scored on two of the next three possessions, Shaw running one 
yard to cap a 13-play, 61-yard drive and quarterback Ryan Driscoll scoring on a 
four-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa State's Ty Stewart kicked a 23-yard field goal in the final minute of the 
half.

TENNIS MAY BE WHEEZING, BUT IT'S NOT DEAD YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED LIEF, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They buzz around the grounds of the U.S. Open, lining up for grilled chicken 
and white wine. They wander past booths selling $20 T-shirts and $220 purple 
warmup suits. And, like all good fans, they wait outside the players' lounge, 
hoping for a glimpse of Andre Agassi or Gabriela Sabatini. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis, like many sports these days, faces serious trouble. But if it's dying, 
as some insist, a death certificate could not be produced after two weeks of 
play at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian Alan King, a longtime tennis patron, is wearing a straw hat and 
standing in a walkway behind the Open's stadium court. He acknowledges the game 
is going through a rough stretch -- few rivalries, weakened TV ratings, poor 
equipment sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But dying? He's heard that talk before. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean like the death of Broadway?" he says. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the diminished rivalries fans feel most acutely. The heyday of tennis in 
the late 1970s offered Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg. There was 
Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova, as peerless a rivalry as any in sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the headline acts are gone. Evert concentrates on motherhood. Navratilova 
makes her farewell tour. Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati remain on 
sabbatical. Steffi Graf awaits her equal. 
</P>
<P>
 The electricity on the men's side is generated by the likes of Agassi and 
Boris Becker. But Becker is too often mired in a brooding, philosophical funk, 
and Agassi simply has not won enough come the Grand Slams. 
</P>
<P>
 So it didn't take much for this U.S. Open to become Agassi's tournament. He 
was not even among the 16 seeds, but he was there for the final weekend. As for 
the top seeds, they became practically an extinct species. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the eight men's quarterfinalists, only three were seeded. At one point, 
deep into the tournament, a possible final loomed between Jonas Bjorkman and 
Bernd Karbacher. 
</P>
<P>
 This absence of glamour may account for one scalper's woes on the boardwalk 
leading to the stadium. He takes a fistful of tickets from his pocket, 
promising good seats, whatever the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, man," he says. "Last year at this time I was up $5,000. Now I'm down a G. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market's not what it's supposed to be," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the gates of the National Tennis Center, where cellular phones chirp 
like crickets in the night, business is better. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson tent is one of four stalls selling rackets on the grounds. Jon 
O'Kelley, a promotions manager, says Wilson is holding its own in racket sales 
at the Open. But, he adds, the industry is slumping. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Watase, a sales representative for Yonex, says he's selling more rackets 
than last year at his Open booth. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are grabbing rackets," he says. "The interest is there." 
</P>
<P>
 Vicki Kiger is interested. She's over on Court 22, eating lunch while watching 
a doubles match. Kiger is a marketing director for a video chain and made the 
trip from Virginia to watch tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 She misses the dazzle of Connors and McEnroe, but insists Agassi will do quite 
nicely. She says tennis needs more of Luke and Murphy Jensen, the 
doubles-playing brothers who bring a bungee-jumping sensibility to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a show," Kiger says, "and everything in sports now has to be a show." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jensens are one of the best shows going in tennis. At a recent match at 
the Open, they packed an outside court while Sabatini played to empty seats in 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jensens wear star-spangled shirts. They touch rackets on good shots, like 
basketball players slapping palms. Given the chance during a rain delay, 
they'll whack a ball with a kid from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Luke Jensen, with shoulder-length blond hair and different colored socks, is 
ambidextrous. He'll switch from one hand to the other when serving. It makes no 
difference to the crowd that the Jensens, the 1993 French Open champions, were 
unseeded at the Open. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers want players' names on shirts and coaches on the court. They want 
splashy introductions like at an NBA game. And, of course, lots of music. They 
want the game's aristocratic baggage put away for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tennis has an attitude problem," says Luke Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's game is it anyway?" asks Murphy Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Carillo, the former player and commentator, thinks the Jensens are good 
for the sport. She calls tennis a "fractured entity" and "in denial." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's dying," she says from the concrete steps behind the CBS 
booth. "But," she adds, in her best Jewish grandmother's voice, "it's got a 
headache like you wouldn't believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Jensens, she thinks music would pump life into tournaments. More 
important, she would like to see tour schedules reduced and the players assume 
greater responsibility toward fans, sponsors and the media. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Howard (Bumpy) Frazer, the outgoing president of the U.S. Tennis Assn., 
wants change as well, but scoffs at pronouncements of tennis' imminent death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolute baloney," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 From his seat at a patio table, Frazer talks of the great skills of the 
players and the near-record crowds at the Open. He acknowledges the structure 
of tennis is in need of streamlining, and he wishes matches at the Open didn't 
run past midnight. But he insists tennis is doing fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not looking at this through rose-colored glasses," he said. "We're going 
to get it back. It's not a crisis. It's a bit of a downturn. I've never seen 
anything in life that didn't have a few ups and downs." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Stich, the German star who lasted to the final weekend, calls the drop 
in popularity, in Europe as well as the United States, inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had a very, very good 15 years of tennis," he says. "We had great 
players, great tennis. The economy, all the business, went with the growing 
perspective of tennis. And now you just can't keep going like this. It's just a 
normal thing."

 Mark McCumber shot a five-under-par 67 to take a one-stroke lead Saturday over 
desperately scrambling Nick Price in the third round of the Bell Canadian Open 
at Oakville, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 Price's various adventures on the Glen Abbey course included: Two shots that 
hit trees, two balls in the water, four bogeys, one of which was saved on a 
20-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also made eight birdies and escaped with a 68 that left him one back of 
McCumber's leading 54-hole total of 206.

 Coach: Rich Medellin (fifth year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: Empire League champions; undefeated in league dual meets; runners-up at 
the Orange County Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Carrie Caulkins, Sr.; Katie De Freise, So.; Courtney Pugmire, 
Sr.; Chantelle Rodrigues, Sr.; Crystal Smith, Jr.; Jenny Titus, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Joanna Ho, So.; Inshirah Jones, Sr.; Heather Perrin, Jr.; 
Jennifer Walters, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The Aztecs are on a mission this season, having lost the Orange 
County Championships title to Edison on the sixth-runner rule last year, then 
failing to advance as a team to the CIF State finals. Medellin has one of the 
state's strongest trio leading the way again. Caulkins, Pugmire and Titus each 
advanced to the State Division I finals last season. Caulkins, who finished 
fourth at the county meet, earned Times Orange County first-team honors. 
Pugmire and Titus, who finished ninth and 11th at the county race, garnered 
second-team honors. Perrin was the Aztecs' leading 400-meter runner in track 
last spring.

 Coach: Ron Buchheim (11th year). 
</P>
<P>
 1993: South Coast League champions; third at the Southern Section Division 
I-AA finals; fifth at the Orange County Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Kim Beck, Sr.; Bree Denison, Jr.; Laura Kroninger, So.; Sidney 
Leonard, So.; Jordi Manley, Sr.; Kristin More, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Casey Bray, So; Heidi Peterson, Jr.; Kelly Reed, Jr.; Kelly 
Spears, So. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: With the top six runners returning from last season's team, the 
Dolphins are ready to move up to the state's elite level. Leonard finished 
among the top 20 at the Orange County Championships last year, while Beck 
placed 30th. In the South Coast League finals, Kroninger, Denison and More 
finished 5-6-7 to help secure the championship. More also complimented that 
finish with an 11th place in the section race. Manley complements one of the 
county's deepest teams, and Buchheim has a wealth of talent from which to 
choose to fill the one remaining spot. "I've had a real run of talent over the 
last few years, so that's helping matters a lot," said Buchheim, who is in his 
third year at the Dana Hills helm after a three-year hiatus.

Ginny Skogman, Fr.; Megan Weber, Fr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The Vanguards won the Southern Section Division II-A title last year, 
but remained relatively anonymous throughout the regular season. This fall will 
mark their emergence in a big way, with the strongest freshman class of any 
school in the county combined with a talented group of returning runners. Five 
new faces for the Vanguards will assist co-coaches Weber and Ahern. Tara 
Whitfield finished 10th at the State Division II finals last fall, and Kennedy 
and Kaylee Whitfield were fifth and 10th, respectively, at the Century League 
finals. Dahlberg and Burton appear to be the standouts among the incoming 
freshmen.

 Key newcomers: Helen Chang, Sr.; Jennifer Crobbe, So.; Kelle Pangborn, So.; 
Rachelle Weber, Sr.; Keri Wright, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: It's going to be hard for the Chargers to top their accomplishments 
of last season, but with five of their top eight runners returning, a repeat 
performance does not appear to be an impossible mission. McGihon's leaders are 
the Formosa twins, Jeannie and Jennifer. Jennifer finished 15th overall at the 
Orange County Championships, just ahead of O'Bric (18th) and sister Jeannie 
(25th). Homberger rejoined the team late last season, just in time to help it 
to its title run. Wright had a stellar track season and will be more than ready 
for the transition to varsity cross-country. Chang, Crobbe, Pangborn and Weber 
will battle for the remaining spots.

Dresden Howell, Sr.; Brooke Meek, Sr.; Charlise Tiee, Sr.Key newcomers: Laurel 
Hafer, So.; Brooke Robinson, Fr. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: The Sea Kings have the potential to be one of the State's finest 
teams, assuming five of their top seven runners can produce on the same day. 
Clark was the most consistent of the group last fall, finishing fourth at the 
league finals and sixth at the Orange County Championships. Howell was fifth in 
both races, then chose to skip the track season. Meek, who came on strong at 
the end of the cross-country season, was a standout 800- and 1,600-meter runner 
during the spring. Cummins was a consistent performer last season and Conover 
was also a varsity member. Tiee saw limited action among the Sea Kings' top 
seven last season and should have her responsibilities increased this fall. 
Hafer and Robinson appear to be the best hopes as far as new faces go.

 Outlook: Can Irvine carry on the fairy tale that it began at the end of last 
season? The Vaqueros won the State Division I (large schools) title after 
finishing a dismal eighth at the Orange County Championships just a month 
earlier. Rossi's troops are led by one of the State's finest in Corbin, the 
defending Sea View League champion. Corbin passed on the track season to play 
softball, but apparently hasn't missed a beat. McMullen had a fine track 
season, advancing to the section finals in the 1,600 meters, and Livermore was 
one of the county's most consistent performers last fall. Niemi is a foreign 
exchange student from Finland who comes in with some impressive credentials, 
having run 5:05 for 1,500 meters.

BRETHREN CHRISTIAN COMES BACK TO EDGE MURPHY, 13-12 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brethren Christian took advantage of two fourth-quarter turnovers for a 13-12 
come-from-behind victory over Los Angeles Murphy Saturday night at St. Bernard 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first-half offense was flat," Warrior Coach Ken Sharrar said."The 
question for the second half was, 'Do you have excitement?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Brethren Christian fell behind on the opening drive when running back Ronald 
Eadie scored on a two-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nobles (0-1), who controlled the ball for most of the first half, 
threatened to score on their next possession, reaching the Warriors' 19-yard 
line. A sack by Rob Dejong and an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty pushed Murphy 
out of scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Brethren Christian fumble on their 26-yard line, the Nobles scored on 
an eight-yard touchdown run by Danny Ragsdale with 9 minutes 16 seconds left in 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Brethren Christian (1-0) had a chance to score late in the second quarter. 
After driving to the Murphy 17, Brethren Christian fell short on a fourth-down 
pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 "At halftime," Sharrar said, "we made some adjustments to contain their option 
and give our quarterback some time to pass." 
</P>
<P>
 A fumble recovery by Dejong in the fourth quarter set up Brethren Christian's 
first score. While scrambling, Ryan Babcock threw a 30-yard touchdown pass to 
Mike Harriman. 
</P>
<P>
 Brethren Christian's defensive changes put enough pressure on Ragsdale to 
force an interception by Theo Dennis at the Warriors' 41-yard line. John 
Dingman then scored on a 13-yard touchdown run with 1:52 remaining. JASON HILL

that covered 17 and 19 yards. The Eagles' offensive line beat down the 
Panthers, providing Kruse with ample time to locate his downfield receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The stingy Eagle defense allowed only 13 passing yards on three receptions, 
and had numerous gang tackles against the Panthers behind the line of 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 The game broke open in the second quarter when the Eagles, who had scored on 
an Echan three-yard touchdown run, recovered their own kickoff at the Panthers' 
19-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Kruse only one play to find wide receiver Aaron Fountain, who made a 
diving reception in the corner of the end zone. The two-point conversion 
attempt was successful as Echan caught Kruse's pass to give the Eagles a 21-0 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruse threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Echan in the third quarter to seal the 
victory. RICHARD MELKONIAN

WHITTIER CHRISTIAN'S 6-2 VICTORY MORE THAN SATISFYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Whittier Christian Heralds (0-9-1 last season) ventured into East Los 
Angeles Saturday night, hungry for the taste of victory that had escaped them 
for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 After a defensive struggle with host Salesian, the Heralds were able to 
satisfy their hunger, when junior fullback Josh Loera scored on a one-year 
plunge, giving Whittier Christian a 6-2 victory at Roosevelt High School. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first half, the Heralds broke through on a 10-play, 75-yard 
drive that featured a 30-yard pass completion from senior quarterback Andrei 
Roudenko to senior wide-out Jason McCleary. 
</P>
<P>
 McCleary's catch put the ball at the Mustangs' 45-yard line. Senior Nick 
Valdez then went to work, carrying the ball six times for 39 yards. Valdez, who 
had 106 yards in 23 carries Saturday night, narrowly missed scoring when the 
Mustangs stopped him at the one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs scored a safety with 6:53 remaining, when senior linebacker Jose 
Esparza tackled Loera in the end zone. Salesian was without running back Andre 
Benavidez, who re-injured himself in practice. He rushed for 600 yards in six 
games before getting hurt last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Tom Caffrey credited his defense, which held Salesian to 66 yards total 
offense -- 18 in the first half. The Heralds recorded six sacks for minus 29 
yards. Junior linebacker Karl Duffy had four sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Caffrey said, "It's a win and the first win is always hard to get."

KNIGHTS GRAB PLAYOFF GAME, FIELD ADVANTAGE FROM SPLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The postgame quotes were laced with expletives, the sign of disgust Splash 
players expressed after their 10-4 playoff loss Saturday night to the 
Sacramento Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a . . . disgrace," said Rod Castro, who had two goals and one assist. 
"We (were terrible). We went out thinking we could just walk on the field and 
win, like we have the last 10 . . . games." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash had won nine of its last 12 and lost to Sacramento, which had lost 
six consecutive road games and five of the last seven. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash also lost the home-field advantage in the best-of-three, 
first-round Continental Indoor Soccer League series, which continues Monday in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wanted to be the hero," Splash Coach George Fernandez said, "and 
now everyone is the goat." 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics say the Splash should have won the playoff game, but it wasn't 
even close in front of 8,665 at The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Splash is 10-1 in home games in which it has out-shot opponents, and it 
had a 41-30 edge over Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Splash is 4-0 in home games it trails after three quarters, and it 
trailed, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Splash is down a game against the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything we did was wrong," Fernandez said. "We got frustrated and we 
started going after the refs, we made stupid fouls and we started yelling at 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento scored three times in the first 9 minutes 3 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were kind of shellshocked that that could happen," Dale Ervine 
said. "It's not supposed to happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash got goals from Ralph Black and when Castro scored two consecutive 
goals, it was 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Valdivia made it 6-4 with six minutes to play and the Splash went to a 
sixth attacker after Gerell Elliott's third goal made it 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights scored two more goals against the sixth attacker, and finished the 
job on Mark Thomas' third goal at 13:17. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Dowler had 15 saves for Sacramento, and the Splash had four shots hit the 
post or crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento lost its third-leading scorer, Shawn Blakeman, 11:29 into the game. 
Blakeman was hit with holding and misconduct penalties, and then received a red 
card for his tirade from the penalty box.

PREP CROSS-COUNTRY ROUNDUP; ANOTHER GARRITSON MAKES MARK FOR BUENA PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Picking up where her older sister, Carrie Garritson, left off, Buena Park's 
Heather Garritson ran away from the pack, turning in the fastest time of the 
day on the three-mile course in the Laguna Hills Invitational cross-country 
meet Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Running in the Division III freshman race, Garritson broke free from the field 
early, just as her sister had done, finishing in 17 minutes 41 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sort of trying to go for the course record, but I haven't run this 
course before," said Garritson, who won her race by 2:06. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to run it twice to get the feel of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Garritson did break the freshman course record, becoming the first 
ninth-grader to run faster than 18 minutes. The previous record of 18:18 was 
set in 1990 by Woodbridge freshman Kay Nekota. 
</P>
<P>
 The Division I girls' junior/senior race was anything but a blowout, as 
Esperanza narrowly escaped El Toro, edging the Chargers, 53-54. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers and the Aztecs each had three runners break the 20-minute 
barrier, the only teams to accomplish the feat. But senior Courtney Pugmire 
enabled the newest members of the Sunset League to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Pugmire finished third in 18:45, behind winner Eliaser Estrada of Santa Ana 
Valley (18:16) and Fallbrook's Jinna Rohde (18:16). 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' senior races in divisions I, II and III, the final three events 
scheduled to be contested, were canceled because of the strenuous demands on 
the paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The paramedics are totally overwhelmed. (They have) six people in serious 
condition," said Kevin Dempsey, Laguna Hills coach and meet director. 
Race-related injuries contributed to the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "He simply will not let us run one more race." 
</P>
<P>
 Said race starter Dave Kurrle: "This has nothing to do with the temperature. 
They just simply shut us down because (the paramedics) have no one left to help 
us." MATT FARMER

NORTHRIDGE LOSES OPENER, 40-19; BOISE STATE SCORES PIVOTAL TOUCHDOWNS IN FOURTH 
QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge tight end Travis Hall waved his left hand at the 
scoreboard, then his right. 
</P>
<P>
 Disbelief was the emotion of the moment, mainly because the officials had held 
both hands overhead a few times too often in the fateful fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the right score," Hall said, motioning repeatedly toward the 
glowing lights of the scoreboard. "It's our game with 10 minutes left. We had 
'em." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors had Boise State right where they wanted, but didn't finish things 
off as the Broncos broke open a tie with three touchdowns in the fourth quarter 
to win, 40-19, Saturday night in a nonconference game before 19,489 at Bronco 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 For Northridge, playing its opener, the game was marked by a frighteningly 
quick turn of events in the opening stages of the final quarter. Momentum came 
and went as fast as the stadium scoreboard operator could punch up the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge trailed throughout the game, seemingly awaiting the big play. It 
finally came when defensive back Joseph Vaughn intercepted a badly overthrown 
pass by Bronco quarterback Tony Hilde and raced 30 yards to tie the score, 
19-19, with 14 minutes 41 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Boise State (2-0) began moving backward almost immediately.  
</P>
<P>
 On the ensuing possession, Hilde, who completed 18 of 32 for 252 yards, 
tripped over an official while taking a deep drop and lost 20 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos, in fact, were faced with a third-and-29 play from their 16 and 
everything seemed right with the Matador world. The offense was salivating on 
the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was ready to get out on the field, that's for sure," said Northridge 
quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin, who completed 28 of 44 passes for 313 yards. "Then 
they bust it. An incredible play, but they busted it." 
</P>
<P>
 On the pivotal play of the game, despite facing four Matador defensive backs 
in deep coverage, Hilde connected with receiver Jarett Hausske on an 84-yard 
pass play for a 26-19 lead with 13:18 left.  
</P>
<P>
 A bevy of tacklers had shots at Hausske before he even reached the first-down 
marker, but failed. 
</P>
<P>
 How absurd was it? The 84-yard scoring pass completed a three-play, 65-yard 
drive. Just like that, the Matador momentum was history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the game right there," said Hall, who caught six passes for 92 yards. 
"All we had to do was contain them. Third and 29. . . . The only word I can 
think of is 'shocking.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So was what followed. Northridge's next possession stalled after three plays, 
yet punter Richard Pesti unloaded a 52-yard kick to the Boise State 21. 
</P>
<P>
 K.C. Adams, the Broncos' starting tailback, caught the punt and bolted 79 
yards for the game-breaking score, shaking off a handful of Matadors in the 
process as Boise State moved in front, 33-19. 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter of 3:13, the teams scored three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We beat ourselves, basically," Vaughn said. "We've got to learn from it. 
Things like that change momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 Boise State added another touchdown with 2:38 left when reserve back Willie 
Bowens scored from 19 yards for a 40-19 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams rushed for a game-high 131 yards in 24 carries while the Northridge 
ground game all but disappeared.  
</P>
<P>
 Tailbacks Mark Harper and Darren Walton combined for only 42 yards in 15 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge didn't exactly have trouble moving the ball, though.  
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors rolled up 389 yards, but surrendered 418, which didn't include 
Adams' punt return. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half was frustrating for Northridge, which demonstrated the ability 
to move the ball effectively -- but generally in the middle of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors drove to the Boise State 15-yard line on their second possession, 
but fullback Shaun Coleman was stopped cold on a fourth-and-one run through the 
middle to end the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 On Boise State's next possession, Hilde found Lee Schrak in the back of the 
end zone from 13 yards for the game's first score.  
</P>
<P>
 Hilde mishandled the snap on the point-after kick, scrambled, and while 
backpedaling near the 20-yard line, somehow connected with kicker Greg Erickson 
for the two-point conversion.

ARELLANES PASSES VALLEY BY SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As debuts go, the one quarterback Jim Arellanes had Saturday night for Valley 
College was a banger. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes, a transfer from Northern Arizona, completed 28 of 40 passes for 402 
yards and three touchdowns to lead the Monarchs to a 41-24 victory over Santa 
Barbara in a Western State Conference opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes, a 6-foot-4, strong-armed sophomore from El Rancho High, was 
practically unstoppable after opening the game with three incomplete passes. 
</P>
<P>
 He had touchdown passes of 30, 15 and three yards to wide receiver Brian Comer 
and completed nine consecutive attempts during one stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth victory for Valley against the Vaqueros in their six-game 
series. Valley beat Santa Barbara, 27-17, in the last game between the teams in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The main beneficiary of Arellanes' passing was Comer, who had 12 receptions 
for 194 yards. He now ranks third in career receptions for Valley with 68 
catches. Comer could have added another touchdown but dropped a pass from 
Arellanes in the end zone late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley extended a 21-17 halftime lead with two touchdowns and two field goals 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes capped the scoring with an eight-yard run with 3:26 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams traded touchdowns midway through the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara scored first on a two-yard blast by running back Chad Marsalek 
that capped a 12-play, 60-yard drive with 8:03 to play in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs tied the score moments later when Arellanes connected with Comer 
on a 30-yard pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 After a four-yard touchdown run by Marsalek early in the second quarter that 
gave the Vaqueros a 14-7 lead, Valley answered with two touchdowns for a 21-14 
edge with 5:19 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The first score came on a 15-yard pass from Arellanes to Comer, who was all 
alone in the right corner of the end zone. Running back Steve Brenes scored the 
second touchdown on a two-yard run. Brenes finished with 103 yards in 27 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaquero quarterback Jarrod DeGeorgia, who led the WSC in passing last season, 
completed 24 of 39 for 242 yards. He had one pass intercepted, by Deandross 
Long in the fourth quarter, and was sacked twice -- by Mike Steussie and 
Hillsdale Hufanga. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley quarterback Davis Delmatoff, a transfer from Pierce, did not play 
because he was nursing a foot injury.

SEASIDE CROSS-COUNTRY INVITATIONAL; THOUSAND OAKS, MISSING TOP 2 BOYS, OUT OF 
ITS DEPTH AND FINISHES 4TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Farrell wasn't lying. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach of Thousand Oaks High's highly regarded boys' cross-country team 
said a lack of depth would be a problem for the Lancers this season if one of 
their top five runners was unable to race because of illness or injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The proof came Saturday when the defending state Division I champions finished 
fourth in the Seaside Invitational on the bicycle path at San Buenaventura 
State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 With Jeff Fischer sick and Kevin Marsden sidelined because of a back injury, 
Thousand Oaks' cumulative team time for its top five runners was 79 minutes 30 
seconds, nearly four minutes slower than its course-record performance (75:37) 
of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, led by individual winner Brett Strahan, placed first with a time of 
77:29, followed by Palmdale (78:03) and Newport Harbor (79:16). 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks senior Keith O'Doherty had the second-fastest time of the meet 
-- running 14:35 over the flat three-mile course, but without Fischer, the 
third-place finisher in last year's state meet, and Marsden (fifth), the 
Lancers lacked the horsepower to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Juniors Todd Disney (15:19) and Josh Carolan (15:34) were Thousand Oaks' Nos. 
2 and 3 runners, but there was a big gap to senior Tony Smith (16:27) and 
sophomore Eric Stoutenberg (17:35). 
</P>
<P>
 If Fischer and Marsden had been in the race and run as fast as expected, the 
Lancers probably would have broken their course record, but O'Doherty didn't 
seem disappointed about the missed opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff's been sick and Kevin has had a small problem with his back," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing serious with Kevin, but he didn't want to take a chance on 
injuring it more by (running on a hard asphalt) course like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Saturday's meet was a temporary setback for Thousand Oaks, the No. 
2-ranked team in the The Harrier magazine's national poll, it was a big 
breakthrough for O'Doherty and re-established Strahan as one of the state's top 
runners. 
</P>
<P>
 Strahan had finished second in last year's Southern Section Division I 
championships, but a lung infection limited him to a 21st-place finish in the 
state championships and forced him to drop out of the Foot Locker West 
regional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was crushed when that happened," he said. "It's like I have one more shot 
this year and I want to show people that what happened was a fluke." 
</P>
<P>
 Strahan led at the mile mark in 4:42, with Antonio Arce of Palmdale and John 
Greene of Agoura next at 4:45. At two miles (9:43), Strahan had a seven-second 
advantage over Arce, Greene, O'Doherty and Francisco Sandoval of Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Doherty shaved a couple of seconds off Strahan's lead in the last mile, but 
the Indian senior timed 14:30 to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval finished third in 14:45, followed by Arce (14:46) and Greene (14:58). 
</P>
<P>
 There were few surprises in the girls' meet as Amy Skieresz of Agoura won the 
individual title and Thousand Oaks took the team championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz, the defending state Division I cross-country champion, did not run 
track last season in order to concentrate on her studies, but the competitive 
layoff did not appear to hurt her as she cruised to a 17:21 clocking and a 
59-second margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks was without top runner Kim Mortensen -- who was attending a 
church function -- but the Lancers (96:49) edged Agoura (96:53), Saugus (96:57) 
and Hart (97:04) in a tight team race.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / MIKE HISERMAN: HART MAKES A RUN AT BALANCED ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a normal year, playing tailback for Hart High would be a good place for a 
young man involved in a witness protection program. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the team's strong, silent types -- the linemen -- often receive more 
notice. The quarterbacks are the marquee players, the receivers their 
supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, there is little run in Hart's run-and-shoot offense. The backs are 
kept around to grab an occasional swing pass, or to punch in a touchdown or two 
from close range when the pass catchers get winded. 
</P>
<P>
 This might not be a normal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Check these numbers from Friday night: 
</P>
<P>
 Hart quarterback Steve McKeon completed seven of 16 passes for 111 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian running back Ted Iacenda rushed for 120 yards and four touchdowns in 
nine carries and caught four passes for 74 yards and another score. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first varsity start, after nine consecutive years in which Hart 
quarterbacks garnered All-Southern Section honors, McKeon passed for yardage 
many of his predecessors accounted for in a decent quarter. His spotlight was 
stolen by a bit player. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny thing is, he didn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ted was making everything work," said McKeon, a former Hart water boy. "It 
didn't bother me at all. I was real happy for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart defeated San Fernando, 41-18, and that, according to the Indians' 
quarterback, is his bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad we won," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda, whose brother, Andy, also carried the ball with some success for Hart 
several years ago, echoed McKeon's sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever we do is fine, as long as we win," he said. "You're still going to 
be hearing a lot about McKeon." 
</P>
<P>
 And quite possibly more about Iacenda, too. He did, after all, score 20 
touchdowns last season as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty hyped-up about the five in one game, though," Iacenda said. "It 
hasn't really hit me yet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Hawkins finds himself in an enviable quandary. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do for an encore? 
</P>
<P>
 Against Fillmore on Friday, the Nordhoff High senior scored the first time he 
touched the ball, racing 82 yards with the opening kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 He was just warming up. On the final play of the first half, Hawkins converted 
on a play that spanned the length of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 With four seconds left, Nordhoff punted from its end zone. Fillmore's Felipe 
Ordaz caught the kick near midfield, but Hawkins, the first man down on 
defense, stripped him of the ball, recovered the fumble, and sprinted 50 yards 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 At tailback, Hawkins rushed for two more touchdowns and 158 yards in 16 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 His next act? Nordhoff would surely settle for a repeat rendition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins' kickoff and fumble returns were merely blips on the radar screen in a 
night of big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 In games involving teams from the region, there were 34 scoring plays of 50 
yards or more. Nine were kickoff returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The longest play was a 96-yard dash by Taft running back Jerry Brown against 
Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
 There were six plays covering at least 90 yards, including two in one game -- 
a 91-yard fumble return by Jess Laue of Channel Islands and a 91-yard kickoff 
return by Charles Boch of Rio Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As debuts go, Larry Mohr's was right up there with the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sank fast. After things looked so promising on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first game replacing the venerable Harry Welch as Canyon High coach, 
Mohr and the Cowboys faced Righetti, which had lost 12 games in a row dating 
back to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Righetti has a one-game winning streak. Canyon lost, 37-22. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ugly, a tough night," Mohr said. "We weren't a very good football 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team has a lot to learn. For one thing, we're not going to show up and 
beat people just because we're the Cowboys." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially not next week. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who might think things can't get worse for Mohr, think again. Next 
on the schedule is Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mohr isn't the only coach who tripped coming out of the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe's Fred Cuccia, Rio Mesa's George Contreras, Agoura's Charlie Wegher, 
Hueneme's Larry Miller, Fillmore's John Wilbur, Poly's Tim Feeley, Glendale's 
Ted Clarke and Santa Clara co-coaches Dan Dolby and Dick Weber all lost in 
their debuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of first-time winners is much shorter: John Hazelton at Burbank, 
Robert dos Remedios at Burroughs, Tom Harp at Granada Hills and co-coaches Bob 
Ganssle and Rick Hayashida at El Camino Real. Harp qualifies as a rookie even 
though he is in his 10th season at Granada Hills. Prior to this season, he 
shared duties with the now-retired Darryl Stroh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands' 20-7 victory over Rio Mesa ended an 18-game losing streak 
dating back to the second game of the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Hernandez's 33-yard field goal in the fourth quarter gave Sylmar a 
16-14 victory over Kennedy and saved Spartan tailback Durell Price from earning 
the week's Phi Beta Kappa award. 
</P>
<P>
 With Sylmar trailing, 14-13, Price drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for 
doing a duck walk to celebrate a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Price perhaps failed to notice that several yellow flags were littering the 
ground before he started to strut. Sylmar had been called for holding on the 
play, negating the score long before Price went into his waddle. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty cost Sylmar 10 yards. Price's premature victory dance tacked on an 
additional 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Guys, guys, guys. Just hand the ball to the official. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Paul was ready to leave Moorpark after last season before reports of his 
possible transfer to Thousand Oaks hit the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Paul probably would be playing for Thousand Oaks this season if the 
Southern Section let him. Instead, he stayed at Moorpark and both team and 
player are happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul, a junior who believed he was forever stuck behind Tyler Dritz, the 
quarterback who led Moorpark to a Frontier League title last season, passed for 
206 yards in a 26-12 victory over El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 Dritz, as fate would have it, can't play quarterback while recovering from an 
arm injury. He has been moved to wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything worked out," Paul said. "I always liked my coaches. (The possible 
transfer) had nothing to do with that. I was just looking for a place I could 
play, basically." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all people, it was Dritz who provided Paul with a cushion early. He 
returned the opening kickoff 78 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like having him around," Paul said. "He's good wherever you play him." 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference a year makes.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROUNDUP; MT. SAN ANTONIO, FULLERTON END GAME IN TIE, 39-39 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mt. San Antonio scored a touchdown with no time left on the clock, then missed 
the conversion kick as it tied Fullerton College, 39-39, in a nonconference 
game Saturday night at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Campbell caught a 22-yard pass from Cody Smith, but Rodrigo Vera's 
point-after attempt was wide left. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc O'Brien scored on a two-yard bootleg run with 44 seconds left and Tony 
Draft caught a two-point conversion pass from O'Brien, giving Fullerton a 39-33 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's ensuing squib kick went out of bounds, giving Mt. San Antonio, the 
preseason top-ranked community college team in the nation, the ball on its 35. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien completed 17 of 22 passes for 275 yards, with two touchdowns and no 
interceptions in his first college start. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Alex Molnar returned a kick 93 yards for a Fullerton touchdown in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 In other nonconference games: 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena 27, Orange Coast 25 -- Christian Emerson kicked a 27-yard field goal 
with two seconds remaining to give Pasadena the victory and spoil an Orange 
Coast comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 After trailing, 24-0, at halftime the Pirates scored 25 points, including 19 
in the fourth quarter, capped by a nine-yard run by Jeff Clayton with 3:08 
remaining.  
</P>
<P>
 But a 26-yard pass from Joe Phears to Z Hodges on third and six with less than 
30 seconds remaining set up the game-winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino 55, Rancho Santiago 28 -- Steve Sarkisian threw for 434 yards and 
five touchdowns for El Camino, which passed for 452 yards, the most allowed by 
a Rancho Santiago team. Leandrew Childs had five catches for 146 yards and two 
touchdowns and he scored another touchdown on a 12-yard run for El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Wilson led Rancho Santiago with two touchdowns, one on a 65-yard run 
and the other on a 95-yard kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Diego Mesa water polo tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Grossmont 17, Orange Coast 8 -- Nick Wagner had four goals, Kevin Bobzien and 
David Kasa each had two goals and Kaj Sturdivant recorded six saves for 
visiting Orange Coast (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Bobzien scored six goals and Kasa added five in the Pirates' 18-4 victory over 
Palomar and Shad Wicker had seven goals and Kasa had added five to lead Orange 
Coast to a 20-5 victory over San Diego Mesa.

GOLDEN WEST FALLS SHORT IN OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What was already a long week for the Golden West football team got worse in a 
hurry Saturday, when the Rustlers opened the season here against Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach scored four first-half touchdowns to win, 35-14, in the 
season-opener for both teams at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, things started to get difficult for Golden West when it was 
announced that Coach Ray Shackleford, in his 29th season, would not be 
returning after this season. The Golden West administration, and not 
Shackleford, made the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The distraction didn't help Golden West prepare for Long Beach, which was 9-2 
last season. Long Beach was No. 16 in the J.C. Grid-Wire's preseason rankings 
this year. Golden West, 4-6 last season, was unranked. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, Golden West allowed Long Beach to build a 28-0 lead in the first 
half. The Rustlers fumbled six times, losing four. Long Beach turned three 
Rustler fumbles into drives that produced touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Things didn't improve much in the second half when a Golden West punt was 
blocked to set up another Long Beach touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West, returning six starters, figured to have a strong defense. But 
Long Beach, led by quarterback Neo Aoga, had little trouble moving the ball 
early. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoga completed 16 of 30 passes for 209 yards. He also ran for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Norris, playing about three quarters, rushed for 95 yards in 15 
carries. He scored on runs of one and 22 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The news wasn't all terrible for Golden West, which plays Pasadena at Orange 
Coast next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense did a much better job in the second half and quarterback Brian 
Schneider, a redshirt freshman, became comfortable in the second half.

GLENDALE SQUEEZES BY CITRUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale College saved the game, and probably its sanity, when a two-point 
conversion attempt by Citrus failed, preserving a 28-26 victory for the 
Vaqueros Saturday at Citrus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 That was one of the few times the Citrus passing combination of Gabe Agredano 
and J.J. Johnson did not connect, following a 28-yard touchdown catch by 
Johnson that narrowed Glendale's lead to two points with 2:38 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 On the conversion attempt, Glendale defensive back Erik Martin knocked the 
ball away from Johnson to prevent the tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Agredano and Johnson virtually had their way with the Vaquero 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Agredano completed 15 of 28 passes for 333 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson caught both of those touchdowns, including a 75-yarder late in the 
first quarter. He had 12 catches for 234 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Citrus led, 20-14, before Glendale took the lead on a 22-yard pass from Eddie 
Michel to Tim Hilton to make it 21-20 seven seconds into the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ensuing possession, Glendale linebacker Victor Huezo recovered a fumble 
off a high snap on a punt attempt, giving the Vaqueros the ball on the Citrus 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 Five plays later, Jerry Sims, who led all rushers with 62 yards in 16 carries, 
ran eight yards to make it 28-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale got on the board first after linebacker Neal Sowter recovered Ron 
Sanders' fumble on the Citrus 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian O'Toole eventually scored on a three-yard run to make it 7-0 with 8 
minutes 48 seconds left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Citrus, however, didn't need much time to even things up as Agredano's 67-yard 
pass play to Sanders made it 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Agredano hooked up on their 75-yarder to make it 14-7 with 2:27 
left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, a 40-yard pass play -- from Jose Delgado to Tim Hilton -- set 
up the tying score for Glendale, a nine-yard pass from Delgado to Hector 
Valencia.

CHAFFEY TAKES WHAT MOORPARK IS GIVING TO GET A 19-13 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark College Coach Jim Bittner brought out the shoehorn Saturday night and 
tried to find someone to fill the big cleats of departed stars Todd Preston and 
Gil Carrillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Bittner is still looking for adequate replacements after watching all three of 
his quarterbacks throw interceptions in a 19-13 nonconference loss to Chaffey 
at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Damian Delfino nor Josh Buck nor Jeremie Watkins seemed to be the 
answer to Preston, All-Western State Conference North Division quarterback last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Delfino, the starter, completed four of five for 37 yards with an interception 
that Reggie Cornish took 57 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck completed four of 13 for 59 yards and his fumble was returned for a 
touchdown. Watkins was three of nine for 31 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider running back Corey Bowen wasn't exactly the second coming of Carrillo, 
the two-time All-WSC North Division offensive player of the year. Bowen 
finished with 59 yards in 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Moorpark nearly pulled out a victory, despite making five turnovers and 
allowing four sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins scored on a one-yard bootleg and Steve Sabbe added the extra point to 
make it 19-13 early in the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark got one last chance by blocking Josh Boies' punt. Linebacker Robert 
Webb scooped up the ball and rumbled 28 yards to the Chaffey 13 with 15 seconds 
remaining. A pass-interference penalty moved the ball to the two, and Buck 
tried to scramble into the end zone on the next play but fell a yard short as 
time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffey used three big plays -- two of them by the Panther defense -- to take 
a 19-6 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornish picked off a Delfino pass and went 57 yards for a touchdown in the 
first quarter, and Thaddeus Variance took a short pass from Zach Brennan and 
raced 63 for a score later in the quarter to give Chaffey a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark cut into the deficit when Delfino connected with Isaiah Mustafa for a 
13-yard touchdown early in the second quarter. The conversion snap foiled the 
extra point attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffey's defense scored again when Buck was sacked and fumbled. Walter 
Williams took the ball and ran 38 yards for a touchdown.

SWIMMING / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; EVANS IS PUSHED BUT REPEATS AS WINNER OF THE 
800 FREESTYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With one leg remaining in the 800-meter freestyle, Janet Evans usually is so 
far ahead of her closest pursuers that she could relax in a deck chair for a 
moment or two before returning to the pool to win. But when she made the turn 
to start the final 50 meters Saturday night in swimming's World Championships, 
she realized she was being gained on. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it by her age? After all, she recently turned 23 in a sport in which many 
of the women are no more than girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Or was it by the rest of the world? Such as the Chinese, who won two more 
races Saturday night and set two more world records. Or the improving 
Australians? Or even the young Americans, such as the one in her event, 
14-year-old Brooke Bennett? 
</P>
<P>
 Those are questions that Evans no doubt will ponder this fall when she returns 
to her role as an assistant coach at USC. But while she was attempting to 
summon every ounce of speed in her tiring body so that she would be the first 
one to reach the other end of the Foro Italico pool, all she was concerned 
about was the fast-approaching Australian, Hayley Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans held her off, winning the 800 meters for the 21st consecutive time in a 
major competition since 1987 and adding a second world championship to the two 
Olympic gold medals she holds in the event. 
</P>
<P>
 But her time of 8:29.85, more than 13 seconds off her world record, beat 
Lewis' 8:29.94 by only nine-hundredths of a second. The slimmest margin of 
victory previously for Evans was the 1.79-second difference between her and 
East Germany's Astrid Strauss in the 1988 Summer Olympics. When Evans repeated 
as the Olympic champion four years later, she beat silver-medalist Lewis by 
almost five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 So, even if no one else is gaining on Evans, the 20-year-old Australian 
believes she is, predicting a victory in next summer's Pan Pacific 
Championships in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Janet has been that elusive person in my mind," Lewis said. "But this is the 
closest I've come to her. I'll definitely beat her at the Pan Pacs. I'll get 
her there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett is not so bold, even after her surprising third-place finish Saturday 
night in a personal best 8:31.30, but already she is known within the U.S. 
swimming community as "The Next Janet." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, however, proved that all comers still have to deal with the current 
Janet, although that did not seem so certain after her fifth-place finish 
Wednesday in the 400 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 She thought a lot about that performance over the next three days before 
deciding to blame it on the Chinese. That is not because she competed against 
the one who won the 400 freestyle, but because she watched the two who went 
under the previous world record in the first event, the 100 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to think about my swimming and concentrate on me," she said. "I think 
a lot of people saw those two swimmers in the 100 free and started thinking, 
'How can I compete against that?' They started concentrating more on (the 
Chinese), myself included, in the 400 free." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that the Chinese women have been at the center of 
everyone's thoughts here after winning nine gold medals in 13 events and 
setting four world and seven meet records. 
</P>
<P>
 And just when it seemed that their success was so routine that they no longer 
were capable of astonishing, they swam a 400-meter medley relay that was filled 
with superlatives. 
</P>
<P>
 That should have been predictable after the morning qualifications, in which 
their anchor, Shan Ying, swam the second-fastest 100 freestyle split of all 
time, 54.19. 
</P>
<P>
 Shan, however, was not fast enough to earn a berth on China's team for the 
final because of the presence of 100-meter world record-holder Le Jingyi, who 
proceeded to become the first woman to break 54 seconds, finishing in 53.81. 
</P>
<P>
 She had to do something to top teammate He Cihong, who swam the 100 backstroke 
in 1:00.16. As that was the leadoff leg, it counts as an open record, beating 
the previous mark of 1:00.31 set in 1991 by Hungary's Krisztina Egerszegi. 
</P>
<P>
 As a unit, the Chinese finished the relay in 4:01.67, shattering the old world 
record of 4:02.54 held by the U.S. 1992 Olympic team. This U.S. team was almost 
five seconds behind the Chinese with a second-place time of 4:06.53. 
</P>
<P>
 It is those kinds of performances that have caused coaches from other 
countries to join in a chorus of complaints about alleged drug use by the 
Chinese. On Saturday night, the Chinese struck back when their assistant coach, 
Zhou Ming, angrily addressed the controversy at an impromptu news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Insisting that the Chinese success is a result of superior training methods 
and not banned substances, he said: "In the sports world, it is always the 
domain of the Western people. They just can't take it, Asian people being good 
in sports. We are very angry about this." 
</P>
<P>
 He also warned that Chinese men, who have yet to even reach a final here, will 
be as dominant as the women before the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when you said the Chinese women were not as good in 
long-distance swimming," he said. "Now, we beat Evans, and nobody can say 
anything about that any more. It will be the same thing with the Chinese men." 
</P>
<P>
 He was only half right. Although a Chinese women did beat Evans in the 400, 
their best finish in the 800 was Luo Ping's fifth in 8:33.09. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, with one day remaining, Evans' gold was only the third for the U.S. 
team, the first for the women. The Americans, however, did have their best 
night, winning six medals. In addition to Evans' gold and Bennett's bronze in 
the 400 freestyle and the silver by the women's relay team, silvers were won by 
Gary Hall in the 50 freestyle, Allison Wagner in the 200 individual medley and 
Jeff Rouse in the 100 backstroke.

ANTELOPE VALLEY GETS MORE OF THE SAME IN 36-7 SETBACK

 If Coach Brent Carder listed Arizona as his least-favorite place to vacation, 
who could blame him? 
</P>
<P>
 Teams from the Grand Canyon state have made a habit of beating Carder's 
Antelope Valley College football teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night's season opener was no different as Mesa buried the Marauders, 
36-7, to drop Carder's record to 1-6 against Arizona teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesa, the No. 17-ranked team in the nation by the J.C. Grid-Wire, jumped to an 
early 10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley had five yards of total offense in the first half and did not 
register a first down until 32 seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We posed our own problems tonight," Carder said. "We were in a daze in the 
first half and we couldn't overcome it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mesa led, 33-0, when Antelope Valley running back Domino Gibson scored on a 
one-yard run early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thunderbirds had 406 yards in offense while holding Antelope Valley to 73. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marauders committed four turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesa's Mike Schroeder completed 20 of 36 passes for 265 yards and Chris Estes 
kicked five field goals.

VENTURA HITS HIGH-WATER MARK IN FIRST GAME, 38-0 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura Coach George Rosales received a water-dousing after the first game of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 And for good reason. The Pirates ended an 11-game losing streak, surpassing 
their point total for the 1993 season in a 38-0 Western State Conference 
Interdivision victory over West L.A. Saturday night at Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 John Patton rushed for 91 yards in three carries, including a 58-yard 
touchdown for Ventura, which finished 0-10 last season and scored only 36 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura jumped to a 14-0 first-quarter lead on Patton's run, and a four-yard 
scoring run by Gordy Abellera that was set up by a minus-five-yard punt by West 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Johnson scored on an eight-yard run and a 36-yard pass play from McLane 
Hansen on a fake punt that gave the Pirates a 38-0 lead with 10 minutes to 
play. Hansen added a 31-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Gutierrez had two sacks and Noah Walsh had two interceptions for Ventura. 
Ivan McCrae added 45 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 West L.A. running back Michael Black, a former Kilpatrick standout who rushed 
for 1,336 yards as a freshman last season, was limited to 65 yards in 22 
carries.

PALOMAR OFFENSE PIERCING IN 58-24 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The quarterback and the coach have changed, but the result was the same for 
defending national champion Palomar College in its opener Saturday night 
against Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 Palomar overcame a sluggish start to run away with a 58-24 victory over the 
Brahmas in a nonconference game.It was the 20th consecutive victory for the 
Comets over three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 With Thom Kaumeyer making his debut as coach and Greg Wilbur playing his first 
game at quarterback, the Comets didn't record a first down until early in the 
second quarter. Once they did, there was no stopping them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comets scored 49 consecutive points to make it a rout by the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce led, 8-2, late in the first quarter on an 11-yard touchdown pass from 
David Muir to Jibri Hodge and a two-point conversion run by Rodney Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when Wilbur and the Palomar passing attack assumed control. Wilbur 
was asked to replace Tommy Luginbill, who passed for 3,701 yards last season 
and has become the starting quarterback at Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed 24 of 34 passes for 371 yards and four touchdowns, all of the 
scores coming in the second quarter when Palomar scored 29 points for a 31-8 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilbur threw two of his touchdown passes to Shane Cartwright and the others 
went to receivers Chris Baker and Thomas Gamelin. 
</P>
<P>
 Palomar extended its lead to 51-8 in the third quarter before Pierce made it a 
little closer with two touchdowns in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce struggled in its first game with Muir at quarterback. This time, he 
completed 15 of 29 for 115 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas had 207 total yards, only 15 rushing.

 In front of a sellout crowd of 6,308, NASCAR debuted its newest attraction at 
Saugus Speedway Saturday night, showing off the new SuperTrucks in what turned 
out to be a 15-lap exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Collins, the son of Mesa Marin Speedway owner Marion Collins, earned his 
second victory when officials decided to cut five laps from the race after P.J. 
Jones backed his Ford F-150 into the wall between turns 3 and 4 while running 
second to Collins' Ford.

UNSUITED FOR VICTORY, ST. FRANCIS AND HARVARD SETTLE FOR THE TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They can't say they didn't have their chances.  
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake and St. Francis highs each turned the ball over in the waning 
minutes of their game Saturday and had to settle for an 18-18 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard kicker Greg Nortman connected on a 27-yard field goal with 3 minutes 
22 seconds left to tie it. But each team had one last chance to pull out a 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays after the field goal, St. Francis quarterback Brian Rucker hooked up 
with Jason Vandercook on a screen pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball was stripped from Vandercook after he gained 18 yards, and Harvard's 
Phil Saferstein recovered the fumble at the St. Francis 38 with just under two 
minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, John Torosian intercepted Derek Lemkin's pass to give St. 
Francis one more chance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Golden Knights' drive stalled at their 41 when Rucker's desperation 
pass was intercepted by Kadar Lewis as time expired. Rucker completed 14 of 21 
for 168 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Both defenses recovered from a first half dominated by big plays and sustained 
offensive drives.  
</P>
<P>
 St. Francis took the opening kickoff and drove 80 yards in 18 plays, 
culminating in a one-yard run by tailback Brian Maxwell. Maxwell gained 61 
yards in the Golden Knights' drive and finished with 66 yards in 22 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Francis missed the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second quarter, Lemkin scored on a three-yard run and Nortman's 
extra point gave the Wolverines a 7-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandercook took the ensuing kickoff and raced 90 yards for a touchdown. Again, 
the two-point conversion failed, leaving St. Francis with a precarious 12-7 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 One minute later, Harvard took a 13-12 lead on a 23-yard pass from Lemkin 
(seven of 14, 107 yards) to Kevin Goldfein. The Wolverines failed on a 
two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the third quarter, Vandercook, who led all receivers with six 
receptions for 109 yards, scored on a 53-yard screen pass. But for the third 
consecutive time, the Golden Knights failed to convert a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard cut the lead to 18-15 midway through the final period when the ball 
was snapped over the head of the St. Francis punter and into the end zone for a 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Abed Abusaleh led the Wolverines with 79 yards in 17 carries.

 Tailback Jason Funk rushed for 127 yards in 24 carries, including three 
touchdowns, to lead Village Christian High to a 21-9 victory over Santa Paula 
in the season opener for both teams Saturday night at Kennedy High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crusaders scored the only points of the first half on a two-yard run by 
Funk late in the second quarter.The score was set up by a 15-yard pass from 
Chris Coleman to Tony Yousif. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula threatened to score when a fumbled punt gave the Cardinals 
possession in Village Christian territory, but could not convert as time ran 
out in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Village Christian scored on a seven-yard run by Funk to give the Crusaders a 
14-0 lead midway through the third quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 Later in the quarter, Santa Paula came back when Jeremy Johnson ran an Ignacio 
Brache punt 70 yards for a touchdown.

 Call it a measure of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Rosamond High found itself trailing L.A. Baptist by 41 points at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, running back Jamar Day sliced through L.A. Baptist's defense 
for 166 yards in 22 carries and led the Roadrunners to a 12-7 nonleague victory 
Saturday against the defending Southern Section Division X champion in a season 
opener at Alemany High. 
</P>
<P>
 Day scored the winning touchdown on a five-yard run with 19 seconds remaining 
in the game. it was his second score of the night and capped a nine-play, 
66-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 It also answered L.A. Baptist's go-ahead touchdown with 2:48 left. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Baptist, which went undefeated in 1993, finished with 60 yards rushing in 
23 carries and 114 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their shortcomings offensively, the Knights almost pulled it out. 
Trailing, 6-0, L.A. Baptist recovered Day's fumble on the Rosamond 19-yard-line 
with under five minutes remaining. Four plays later, Joe Romero barreled into 
the end zone from 11 yards out for a 7-6 lead.

 Ron Allen passed for two touchdowns and ran for another to lead Oak Park High 
to a 42-14 nonleague victory over St. Genevieve at Birmingham High on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who rushed for 78 yards in the game, eluded three tacklers behind the

to buy the building when the owner decided to sell. Under the Emergency Low 
Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987, the owner was required to first offer 
the complex to the tenant association and did so, asking $5.4 million. The 
total cost for purchase and rehabilitation is estimated at $8.4 million. In 
addition to the city loan, the association is getting other loans, grants and 
tax-exempt bonds from a variety of sources. The Housing Department loan will be 
repaid with 5% interest over a 40-year period. Passed 12 to 0. Voting yes:

CITY ARTS: PICTURE SHOW

<P>
 Offering a glimpse into almost a century of Korean history in the United 
States, "Generations: The Korean American Experience," a black-and-white 
photographic exhibit, is on display at Koreatown Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Korean American Museum, the exhibit is divided into 
"Gateways," which offers a historical perspective on Korean American culture; 
"Activism and Leadership," which includes photographs from the U.S. movement 
for Korean independence from Japan as well as modern-day community activism, 
and "Generations," which looks into everyday Korean American family life. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition also features videotaped interviews of first-generation Korean 
immigrants, conducted by their second-generation Korean American children. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the photos have been donated from private family collections, said 
Susan Yang, executive secretary of the museum. Yang said Koreans have been 
settling in this country since as early as 1902. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most haunting images in the exhibit involve the deportation of 
Korean immigrants early in this century when strict immigration laws were 
applied to Asians, Yang said. A 1938 newspaper photo captures the deportation 
of a 4-year-old boy who was being sent to Korea because of his father's 
immigrant status. The boy's Brooklyn-born mother consequently opted to forfeit 
her U.S. citizenship and moved to Korea to live with her husband and son. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my parents came here in the late '50s, they were tested for literacy and 
could only bring $300 with them," Yang said. "Immigration laws became more 
lenient after the mid '60s." 
</P>
<P>
 "Generations: The Korean American Experience," Koreatown Plaza, 928 S. Western 
Ave.; through Sept. 23; 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Sunday; free; (213) 388-4229 LESLIE BERESTEIN

CITY TIMES VOICE: LABORING SEARCH; ERICA WASHINGTON'S LONG QUEST FOR A JOB HAS 
BEEN A LESSON IN LIFE, AND IN POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERICA WASHINGTON, Erica Washington, 22, lives in Hyde Park with her 
23-month-old son, Damani. A graduate of Washington High School, she has held a 
variety of jobs but is now unemployed. When she is not caring for her son or 
seeking a job, she is studying to become a journalist. She once scorned women 
on welfare as lazy and irresponsible, but sees things differently now that she 
has been forced to depend on welfare to help support her and her son. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I spent nine months in 1993 searching for employment. The job I found, in a 
large downtown department store, was considered "seasonal" and thus only lasted 
six weeks. Being a recipient of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, I was 
hoping the job would be permanent so I could be rid of public aid. But, alas, 
it was not to be. Not this time, anyway. So, since January, I have been in 
search of ever-elusive permanent employment.  
</P>
<P>
 Since I tend to spend four to six hours a day riding buses from interview to 
interview, I have plenty of time to think. Most of my musings concern welfare 
politics, public opinion and how these things have affected my life. And of 
course, there is always a healthy dose of reality that injects itself into my 
thoughts, not only to keep things even, but also to bolster my ever waning 
sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, I used to make fun of people on welfare. I just thought they were 
all a bunch of lazy, irresponsible women who were content to live off the 
government. Then, in a couple of ironic twists of fate, I became one of the 
women I found so humorously pathetic. I had been working at a video-rental 
company, but at the time the relationship with the baby's father had gotten so 
abusive it carried over into my work life. So much so that it forced me either 
to resign or be fired from my job. So I resigned and have since been unable to 
find steady work. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only then, when I had to go on welfare, that I found that a lot of the 
things that I heard and read were not all true. This is where welfare politics 
and public opinion come in. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians base their entire campaigns and sometimes entire political careers 
on public opinion. Public opinion, of course, is shaped by the media (which is 
where I got my ideas about what welfare was and the people who accepted it). 
So, if those who want to govern can make those who are on welfare look worse 
than they really are, they in turn can talk big about "policy" and look tough: 
Public opinion is turned, and they get elected. 
</P>
<P>
 But ahh, the sweet intrusion: reality. There are a lot of women on welfare who 
are serious about getting off the rolls. They have searched long and hard for 
inexpensive child care (or bargained, traded or begged for it), dusted off 
their business attire, put together as professional a resume as possible, and 
stepped bravely into the world, praying every day that they won't come home 
empty-handed. There is also a recession on, and everyone from multi-degreed 
executives to middle managers to regular clerks are out of work as well as 
welfare recipients. And since jobs are scarce, and applicants plentiful, 
employers know they are free to pick and choose at will.  
</P>
<P>
 So it's not as if the jobs are not out there. I know. I have given out enough 
resumes to wallpaper a house. And it's not as if no one is hiring. They are. 
They're just not hiring me. Not right now, anyway. But I have hope. Things will 
change. But they won't change overnight. And therein lies the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a segment of the general population that wishes women would get off 
welfare yesterday. I know, I'm one of them. But since there are so many people 
out of work, we cannot reasonably expect to jump over everyone else and land 
jobs. As the economy picks up, so will employment. But it's going to take time. 
 
</P>
<P>
 That means that politicians, the voting, tax-paying public and ever-searching 
recipients are going to have to learn to be patient. It could be a long wait.

CITY TIMES VOICE: IN LOVING MEMORY; WORLD WAR II VETERAN'S EFFORTS TO REFURBISH 
A PLAQUE AT GARFIELD HIGH HONORING HIS BROTHER AND OTHERS LEAD TO PLANS FOR 
ANNUAL CEREMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YSIDRO RAMIREZ, Ysidro Ramirez, 68, is a 1945 Garfield High graduate and 
World War II veteran who led a campaign to refurbish a memorial plaque at his 
alma mater honoring 49 students, including his older brother, and a teacher who 
were all killed in World War II. The 44-year-old bronze plaque, located in the 
school's foyer, was rededicated in July in a ceremony that included a 21-gun 
salute by a U.S. Marine Corps color guard and was attended by a dozen World War 
II veterans from Garfield. Ramirez, a retired butcher who now lives in 
Montebello, was interviewed by Kirby Lee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In June, around the time President Clinton was in Normandy (France) for the 
50th anniversary of D-day, my sister reminded me of a plaque they had at 
Garfield with all the students and one teacher who died in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't remember the plaque, so I decided to go down there and take a look. I 
walked into the lobby and the plaque looked awful. It was dirty and cruddy and 
you couldn't even read the soldiers' names. It was just stuck on the wall with 
no decoration. I thought, "God almighty, nobody cares these people died for 
their country." 
</P>
<P>
 I wrote a letter to the assistant principal at Garfield, Greg Vallone. The 
school asked the metal shop teacher if he knew how to remove the corrosion. 
Several students with toothbrushes and solvent helped clean the plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I went to meet Mr. Vallone and that's when he told me: "We're going to 
have a ceremony. We're going to have the ROTC. We're going to have the band and 
we're going to have the Marines." He said, "From now on we're going to have the 
ceremony every year." 
</P>
<P>
 All I wanted them to do was keep the plaque clean, fix it up and put a little 
vase for flowers. This was more than I ever expected. Friends say, "You know, 
you have done something great," but I'm just a regular Joe. It's about time 
somebody took the initiative to do something about it. They deserve it. 
</P>
<P>
 I only knew about five of the students who died because they were older than 
me. But everybody was affected. Families were a lot closer back then. 
</P>
<P>
 My brother Ralph graduated from Garfield in 1943 and was gone only 10 months 
when my family got the letter that he had died at Normandy. He was only 19. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the worst times of our lives. I don't know how much longer it was when 
they brought his body back and we had to go through the same turmoil again. Oh, 
God, everybody broke loose again and started crying. I think they should have 
left him there right where he fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes at night, I hope the guy didn't suffer. I hope he just got it quick. 
You couldn't go back because the ocean was behind you. You couldn't go forward 
because those guys were shooting at you from the top of the cliff and spraying 
the beach. One of these days, I pray to get enough money to go to Normandy. 
They have tours and somehow I'm going to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 I fly the American flag outside my house all the month of August in memory of 
my brother's birthday. I don't like to go to the cemetery. It's hard. There's 
just a stone there with his name on it and a lot of other close friends of the 
family who died in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 When you were 18 you had no choice, the armed forces took you away. Guys who 
weren't old enough were volunteering because they didn't want to get left 
behind. I got drafted and was going overseas when Japan surrendered. I was one 
of the lucky ones; I encountered only small fire. We were ordered not to shoot 
back. I was fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody wins in war. I don't know who starts war but how can you not be angry 
when you lose your brother? About eight of our friends on the block we used to 
live on Mednik Avenue either died or were crippled. There's one guy who has his 
legs all shot up and I think he has a wooden leg. 
</P>
<P>
 My brother had a lot of friends. Everybody liked him. I never really got to 
know him because he was with his friends and they didn't hang around with me. 
</P>
<P>
 When we were kids, guys used to put on boxing gloves and punch around each 
other. They put me against my brother. He was never violent or anything. I was 
pretty good with my dukes and I beat him up. 
</P>
<P>
 When he left and I heard that he got killed, I said to myself: "I never 
apologized to him." I wanted to somehow apologize to him for the beating that I 
gave him. Taking care of the plaque is sort of an apology.

 Franklin 27, Roosevelt 14--It's no wonder Coach Armando Gonzalez is "glad to 
be back" in the game he says he missed and with the team he last coached in 
1989. His senior quarterback Jeff Deno tossed four touchdown passes, going 10 
for 14 and throwing for 239 yards while senior wide receiver Johnnie Sanders 
caught four passes for 128 yards and two touchdowns in a nonleague game.One 
came on Franklin's first offensive play when he turned a short pass into an 
80-yard score, breaking several tackles before sprinting away from the 
Roughriders. 
</P>
<P>
 Small but tough, the Roughriders came back behind sophomore quarterback 
Fernando Delgadillo, who carried for two second-quarter touchdowns to give 
Roosevelt a 14-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers opened the second half with a nine-play, 65-yard drive but 
trailed 14-13 when the point-after kick sailed wide. On successive possessions, 
Deno hit sophomore running back Oscar Canela for scoring passes of 30 and five 
yards to put the game away.

 Garfield 23, Lincoln 8--Garfield quarterback Eddie Hermoso threw for 137 yards 
and two touchdowns to lead the Bulldogs at Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a fumble recovery on the opening kickoff, wide receiver David 
Gonzalez caught a 20-yard touchdown pass on Hermoso's first attempt on third 
down and six.Lincoln then drove to the Garfield 40, but defensive back Jesse 
Villalobos intercepted Hermoso's pass to stop the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hermoso, after connecting with Rudy Burruel on a 29-yard pass play, threw a 
37-yard touchdown on the second play of the third quarter to give Garfield a 
13-0 lead. Hermoso finished with eight completions in 13 attempts. Lincoln's 
lone score came on Ronnie Cardiel's eight-yard pass to Hiram Andrade one play 
after an 84-yard kickoff return.

 Bell 14, Bell Gardens 7--The difference between Bell and Bell Gardens in their 
season opener was in the number of weapons employed. The Eagles had too many 
for the flailing Lancers to handle in the intersectional game. 
</P>
<P>
 With virtually no pass protection, Lancerquarterback Guillermo Alvarez was 
sacked six times, four in the second half. Meanwhile, Bell quarterback Gus 
Valenzuela completed 11 of 19 passes for 131 yards and one touchdown.  
</P>
<P>
 Running back David York rushed for 63 yards in 16 carries, including the 
Lancers' only touchdown. York's one-yard touchdown run was set up by wide 
receiver Tideo Gonzales, who caught a 61-yard pass from Alvarez.

PREP FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; LOYOLA BEATS FOUNTAIN VALLEY WITH 3 SCORES IN 5 MINUTES

<P>
 Loyola rallied for three touchdowns in the fourth quarter to beat Fountain 
Valley, 21-7, in a nonleague football game Friday at Huntington Beach High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs (1-0) scored three touchdowns in a span of just more than five 
minutes in the final quarter to come from behind against the Barons (0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley scored its touchdown when Joey Rozek caught a 25-yard pass 
from quarterback Chris Ponchak with 6:20 left in the third quarter. Ponchak, a 
standout pitcher for Fountain Valley last spring, was 12 for 25 passing for 136 
yards and threw two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola went up, 14-7, when quarterback Dyle Spielbuhler narrowly avoided a 
sack and then completed a 52-yard touchdown pass to Dan Farmer with 8:30 left 
in the game.  
</P>
<P>
 Spielbuhler was 8 for 16 passing for 120 yards and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley fumbled on its next possession. Ponchak was hit while 
scrambling and Loyola's Bryan Dunn recovered the ball at the Fountain Valley 
20. 
</P>
<P>
 Four plays later, Mike Vanis scored on a one-yard run off tackle to put the 
Cubs ahead, 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola tied it, 7-7, on its first possession of the fourth quarter. Mike 
Ellison broke away for a 41-yard scoring run down the left sideline with 11:16 
left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half featured three missed field goal attempts. Loyola's Mark 
McDonald missed a 32-yard try on the final play of the half. The Cubs 
mishandled the snap on an earlier try. 
</P>
<P>
 Devin O'Day had two interceptions for Fountain Valley.

DORSEY SPRINTS AWAY FROM JEFFERSON, 44-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jefferson High's football team did its best to contain Dorsey. But somebody 
left the backdoor open and Don tailback Bervick Deculus II was the first to run 
loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Deculus, a seldom-used tailback last season, ran for 168 yards and three 
touchdowns as Dorsey shut out Jefferson, 44-0, in a nonleague game Friday at 
Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Deculus scored on touchdown runs of 14, 23 and 70 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey (1-0) was concerned about replacing tailbacks Che Johnson and Chris 
Phillips, who each rushed for more than 1,000 yards in 1993. The Dons, however, 
have two linemen who can clear a wide enough path for even the most 
inexperienced runner. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Bankouadagba, a 6-2, 300-pound guard of Nigerian descent, and Chris King, 
a 6-2, 280-pound transfer tackle from Texas, manhandled Jefferson's defensive 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The line produced well and it was easy to explode and go for the goal line," 
Deculus said. "I tried to keep my composure and not get big-headed out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Deculus followed one of King's blocks and scored on a 14-yard touchdown to 
give Dorsey a 7-0 lead on the second play of the second quarter. On fourth-and 
eight, Bankouadagba knocked over a defender and Deculus ran through the opening 
for a 23-yard touchdown 1:07 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the turning point came right before the half," Jefferson Coach Hank 
Johnson said. "We hoped to keep them out of the end zone and boom they're gone. 
Then came the second half kickoff." 
</P>
<P>
 If Deculus' second touchdown was the turning point, Wilson's score was the 
breaking point. Wilson took the second-half kickoff and ran a serpentine route 
through Jefferson's coverage for an 85-yard touchdown. Dorsey ran only 16 plays 
from scrimmage in the second half, but scored 33 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons also scored touchdowns on an 85-yard kickoff return by Antwain 
Wilson, on an 11-yard run by Raymont Skaggs, and on a 15-yard return of a 
blocked punt by Reginald Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats haven't lost this badly since Walter Mondale ran for president 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Menjivar also kicked five extra points, which is a first for a Dorsey 
football team under Coach Paul Knox. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main concern is playing physical football," Knox said. "Once a team wears 
down and they get tired, it's tough to contain us." 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson (0-1) did have its chance. Stevie Williams took the opening kickoff 
and ran to Dorsey's 27-yard line. But on the first play from scrimmage, Jimmy 
Ray Brown's pass was intercepted in the end zone. Brown, a 5-9, 160-pound 
sophomore, completed one of 15 passes with an interception, but he wasn't to be 
blamed. Two very catchable passes were dropped in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Brown played an outstanding game," Johnson said. "But we're a young 
team. We have young players who don't know much about football." 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac Hatley, Jefferson's talented tailback, was held to 33 yards in 11 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 D--Deculus 14 run (Menjivar kick)

NARBONNE FIELD GOAL SPOILS BROWN'S JORDAN DEBUT, 21-19 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Harris, Jordan's senior quarterback, made a vow late Friday afternoon 
regarding the Bulldogs' longest-in-the-City losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to end this year," he said with assurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few minutes earlier, the streak had reached 27 games when Ryan Medrano 
kicked a 27-yard field goal with only 14 seconds to play, giving Narbonne a 
21-19 victory over Jordan at Narbonne. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came close here," said Harris, who scored Jordan's first two touchdowns on 
a pair of one-yard runs and directed a Bulldog offense that outgained 
Narbonne's, 228 yards to 158. "But we couldn't grab it." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss spoiled the debut of Jordan Coach Willie Brown, a three-time Super 
Bowl winner as a player and assistant with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good game, really, from my point of view," said Brown, who was the 
head coach at Long Beach State for one season before the school dropped its 
football program after the 1991 season. "It was the first game of the season 
and the kids played hard. It came down to a field goal, and that's pretty good 
for the first game. Naturally, we would like to have won it, but that's the way 
it goes sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, which has not won since 1991, overcame an 18-12 deficit midway through 
the fourth quarter when Nate Turner intercepted a pass by Narbonne quarterback 
Marcos Ramirez and returned it 20 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Cabreles' extra point gave Jordan a 19-18 lead with 7:08 to play and the 
Bulldog defense, which had limited Narbonne to fewer than 100 yards to that 
point, forced a punt on Narbonne's next possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, however, Jordan's Marcus Garbutt fumbled. Aaron Warren 
recovered for Narbonne with 3:55 remaining and the Gauchos, who earlier had 
taken advantage of great field position as Jordan averaged less than seven 
yards per punt, put together their longest drive of the game, moving 57 yards 
to Jordan's 10-yard line in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "We woke up and came to life," Coach LeRoy Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two passes fell incomplete before Medrano, who had shanked a conversion 
attempt earlier, kicked his game-winning field goal on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first game of the year, that was a hell of a kick," Wilson said. 
"There's a lot of pressure on the kicker and the snapper and the holder. That 
was a fantastic deal that they sucked it up and did that." 
</P>
<P>
 For Jordan, of course, it was another disappointing finish, but the Bulldogs 
could take heart in putting up a mighty struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made some mistakes that cost them," Wilson said. "But they're better 
than they were last season. They're going to win a few games."

U.S. OPEN; SANCHEZ VICARIO VICTORIOUS; TENNIS: AFTER LOSING FIRST SET, 6-1, SHE 
SCRAMBLES BACK TO BEAT TOP-SEEDED GRAF AND BECOME FIRST SPANISH WOMAN TO WIN 
U.S. OPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario hurried left and hurried right and scurried her way to 
the U.S. Open women's singles championship here Saturday, tarnishing in the 
process Steffi Graf's image of invincibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario became the first woman from Spain to win this title in its 
108-year history. She did it with a 1-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4 victory over No. 
1-ranked-and-seeded Graf, the German player so dominant this year that she 
carried a 57-4 record and seven titles into Saturday's match on a sold-out 
Stadium Court before 21,045. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory brought Sanchez Vicario her third Grand Slam title, adding to her 
1989 and 1994 French Open championships. Graf, who keeps track of such things 
with a pocket calculator, missed making this her fourth title here and missed 
making her Grand Slam championship total a sweet 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Sanchez Vicario has won two Grand Slam events this year, to Graf's one 
in the Australian Open, there has been much discussion that Sanchez Vicario 
deserves to be boosted a notch to No. 1 player, a status that the tour computer 
will accord to Graf even after Saturday's result. But Sanchez Vicario, soothed 
by a $550,000 paycheck, didn't seem to care much about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I am very proud what I did," she said, in her delightful broken 
English, "and maybe you (in the press) can say better." 
</P>
<P>
 She deserved to be proud of what she did, especially after Graf hit her like a 
freight train in a 22-minute first set. But Sanchez Vicario took it like a 
glancing blow and did as she always does -- and says dozens of times in each of 
her postmatch interviews: "I just keep fighting, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 After her opening-set blitz, Graf even went up a break at 2-1 and had a break 
point at 4-4. But one point after netting a service return to bring that game 
back to deuce, Graf chased down a wide forehand, netted it and stopped in the 
backcourt to bend over and touch her toes. Immediately, a buzz went through the 
crowd, since most tennis fans are aware that she has, despite her successful 
season, played the last few months with a bad back -- and has been forced to 
wear a back brace the last four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 When she lost that game, she asked for some painkillers, and said later that 
while her back pained her for two or three games, it wasn't why she lost. "I 
don't like to talk about my back when I lose," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf fought off three break points in her next service game, then got herself 
into prime position to win the tiebreaker, having two serves at 3-2. But she 
missed two forehands for 3-4, then flew another long and netted yet another to 
bring the serve back to her at 3-6. With Sanchez Vicario holding three set 
points, Graf netted yet another forehand to, almost literally, hand the second 
set to Sanchez Vicario. After two sets, the player who has been noted for her 
powerful forehand, had made 18 unforced forehand errors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third set, Sanchez Vicario, never needing much of a jump start anyway, 
really started to play like something hooked up to cables. She started hitting 
deeper, getting into the net on almost every short ball Graf offered and kept 
chasing down everything. She was a tennis roadrunner. Everywhere Graf hit it, 
Sanchez Vicario was. Beep beep. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, a stunned Graf was serving at 4-5 and 15-40, and when her second serve 
sprayed way long for a costly and embarrassing double fault, all Sanchez 
Vicario had to do was serve it out. Two break points and two match points 
later, she kicked in a 74-m.p.h. first serve, and Graf floated a backhand 
return long to end it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the ball, you know, going out, and I said, 'Well, I did it,' " Sanchez 
Vicario said. "I just, you know, threw the racket and looked upstairs and said 
thank you. I was real excited and now my dream come real." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario, whose brothers Emilio and Javier are also pro tennis players, 
travels with her mother and two dogs. Afterward, she didn't comment on how her 
dogs reacted to her great moment in the tennis limelight, but she said her 
mother was among the first to greet her, and the meeting was highly emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario said: "She didn't have words. Same as me." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor, Sanchez Vicario said, was she able to say much when they handed her the 
$550,000 check. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't, you know, hold my surprise," she said. "My face was kind of 
'Wow!' " 
</P>
<P>
 After her press interview, she scurried back out to play a women's doubles 
semifinal, in which she and Jana Novotna won their way into today's final and a 
shot at splitting $200,000. Then she hurried back to the hotel to see her dogs, 
whose names, most likely, are Hustle and Bustle.

JIM MURRAY: ROSY FUTURE ON HIS SIDE OF THE TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Horatio Alger Jr. was a writer of the American Dream. He might have invented 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 His stories were always upbeat. Inspirational. Their titles were always "Luck 
and Pluck," "Bound to Rise." The heroes were always Ragged Dick, Ronald 
Goodheart, Peter Pluck, Dick Daring. They were usually orphans who rose above 
their surroundings. They were newsboys, bootblacks, errand boys who by hard 
work and high morals rose to the top through a morass of misfortune overcome by 
goodness of heart and strength of character. It was a time when it was still 
possible to believe in such things. 
</P>
<P>
 The heroes often got their big break by saving a damsel in distress from a 
team of runaway horses, and she often turned out to be the daughter of the 
town's biggest banker. Or they saved a child from drowning and his father 
turned out to be Daddy Warbucks. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were stories of another era. They were predictable, heart-warming, 
and they always had a happy ending and a whole generation grew up reading and 
believing them. But we thought it was another time. Only in America but no 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, there is Ron McAnally. Horatio Alger would have loved Ron McAnally. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron never saved anyone from drowning or stopped a span of runaway horses. But 
he had the kind of Dickensian childhood of the penny dreadful novels. 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally is one of the great horse trainers of all time. His horses have won 
hundreds of millions. He has won three Eclipse Awards. He is in the horsemen's 
Hall of Fame. There is nothing about a thoroughbred racehorse he doesn't know, 
probably better than anyone else. He doesn't need a clock to tell him when a 
great horse goes by. He can almost smell them, tell them by the almond shape to 
their eyes, the fluid motion of their stride, even the way they return his 
gaze. 
</P>
<P>
 But back in the Depression '30s, McAnally had as lost a childhood as any Alger 
hero ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Mom died of tuberculosis. She was 23 years old. She had five children. Ron was 
the second-oldest of three brothers and two sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 The father, out of work in those hard-times days in Kentucky, put the family 
in an orphanage -- an "orphan asylum," it was called in those benighted days. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron stayed there 10 years. Adoption was not really an option. Father never 
really got it going and he, too, died young (49). 
</P>
<P>
 The family stayed together, but it was hard. Ron still does not talk about it 
easily but it was, after all, an institution. Children adapt, but they do not 
understand. Common belief is, they've done something wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Discipline was harsh but, as Ron recalls it, fair. You got beaten with a birch 
branch for misbehavior. They said the first six months Ron used to sit in the 
window looking for his mother. He was almost catatonic with despair. But later, 
as the oldest boy, he became the patriarch of the family. "They came to me with 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 An uncle came to the rescue when Ron was 15. Reggie Cornell was a horse 
trainer of note who had the legendary Silky Sullivan in his stable, the most 
spectacular come-from-behind horse in history. It was nothing for him to trail 
by 40 lengths or fractions of miles only to overtake with a late rush. Ron 
thinks he knows why. "When we trained him he was so much faster than the other 
2-year-olds, we used to give them a head start in the works. Silky got the idea 
that was what he was supposed to do -- let the others go by and then catch up 
to them and pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron walked hots, he rubbed down horses, he went for coffee, he slept on straw. 
When he went in the Air Force, it was like a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to college (Cincinnati) to study electrical engineering, but it was 
boring compared to afternoons of stretch duels in the sun. He returned to the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 Although life had been hard and rules rigid at the orphanage, Ron is far from 
bitter; he is almost appreciative. "There is too little discipline in the world 
today. I discovered there is almost pleasure in hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 He was a workaholic around the track. McAnally's days were 16 hours. The young 
boy who had run the dishwashing chores for 200 orphans found caring for a few 
horses a day a stroll in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 You become a good trainer with bad horses. Anyone can win with Man O' War. Ron 
had to learn going to the post with the riffraff of the track, horses he'd just 
claimed for $3,500 and was trying to get them to help pay the rent, not win 
Eclipse Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, he was sitting in a box at the Oak Tree meeting when he got a call 
from a man who introduced himself as Sam Rubin, a bicycle dealer from Brooklyn. 
"He said he had this nice kind of horse nominated for a race out there and 
(trainer) Lefty Nickerson had recommended me." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's how Ron McAnally got custody of one of the most famous runners in 
track history -- John Henry. 
</P>
<P>
 John Henry was an indifferently bred gelding, cantankerous and willful. "He 
had this big jug head, he wasn't conformed classically but he had this way of 
looking at you that said 'You're faded!' "McAnally recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 John Henry arrived at LAX at 4 in the morning and, at 5 that night he ran 
second in the Carleton F. Burke Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally related to John Henry at once because they both overcame deprived 
backgrounds. "He was a pro," Ron McAnally recalls," the most professional horse 
I ever had. You never had to tell him what to do, where to go on a racetrack. 
He knew . He'd outrun you and outsmart you." If he were a ballplayer, he'd be 
DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
 He began in claimers but he was to win 26 races for McAnally including the 
Santa Anita Handicap (twice) the Belmont Jockey Club Gold Cup, the Arlington 
Million, San Juan Capistrano, Sunset Handicap -- and $2,336,650. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's a gap in the McAnally resume, it is the area of his own home state, 
Kentucky. Where once he lived as a ragged orphan, Ron would like to return one 
day as the toast of the Blue Grass -- win the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 It is maddeningly elusive for California trainers. Even the great Charlie 
Whittingham did not win it until he was 74. And McAnally has sent good to 
outstanding runners back to try. None even got in the money. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has two precocious sophomores for the Del Mar Futurity (which has 
produced two Kentucky Derby winners) next Wednesday -- Mr. Purple and On 
Target, both unbeaten, both clockbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 But both are well-bred. Both come from the right side of the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Ron looks out there and would like to see, so to speak, someone who had 
to make his bed every morning, rake the leaves, bring in the firewood, run the 
dishwasher, sweep the floor, get to bed every night at 10 and get caned if he 
gets caught fighting over the hash in the mess hall. Someone who didn't arrive 
by chauffeur. Someone who, you might say, would get off a plane at 4 a.m. and 
finish second by 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone who asked no quarter from life but took the hand he was dealt and 
built it into a royal flush. Someone who, like Ron, was 50-1 on the morning 
line but spends all his time in a winners' circle today.

RAMS TRY TO MUFFLE FALCONS; PRO FOOTBALL: RECENT RECORD, HOWEVER, INDICATES 
RISON'S 'GUARANTEE' OF VICTORY MAY BE VALID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arizona Coach Buddy Ryan's tough talk provided the bulletin-board material 
last week for the Rams, who lead the NFL in over-sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Rams' motivational fodder for today's game against the Atlanta Falcons 
was delivered last Sunday when somebody stuck a microphone in front of Falcon 
wide receiver Andre Rison. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off a 31-28 overtime loss to the Lions at Detroit, Rison guaranteed a 
victory over the Rams, adding: "You can print that straight to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 "He forgets we still have to play a game," Ram free safety Anthony Newman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Jessie Hester wondered: "Has Andre retracted any of that 
statement yet?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the Rams are 1-0 and talking tough after beating Arizona, 14-12, last 
Sunday and spoiling Ryan's debut as Cardinal coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Rams have a chance to be 2-0 for the first time in six years, 
their recent history against the Falcons does little to invalidate Rison's 
prediction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have lost six of their last seven games against the Falcons and 
haven't won in Atlanta since the 1989 opener, when Chris Miller, now the Rams' 
starting quarterback, was with the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller returns to the Georgia Dome for the first time since signing a 
three-year deal with the Rams in the off-season. One of his biggest concerns is 
the Georgia Dome's artificial turf, on which he twice injured his left knee, 
each time requiring surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real sticky surface, like Velcro," Miller said. "It just doesn't get 
worn down much. The first time I hurt it (against the Rams in 1992) I was just 
running from Newman, trying to make a little cut, and when I planted, my knee 
popped." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing on Anaheim Stadium's natural grass last Sunday, Miller and the Ram 
offense produced only one touchdown and failed to move the ball in the third 
quarter, when they could have pulled away from the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller completed six of 16 passes for 131 yards and has yet to throw a 
touchdown pass in a Ram uniform. Tailback Jerome Bettis, who set a goal of 
2,000 yards before the season, gained only 52 against the Cardinals. And has 
anybody sent out a search party for tight end Troy Drayton? 
</P>
<P>
 But there was good news for the Ram offense last weekend: Detroit gained 352 
yards in total offense, and tailback Barry Sanders rushed for 120 of that 
total. It would appear that the Falcon defense is vulnerable.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say I was concerned about the offense just this week," Ram Coach 
Chuck Knox said. "I was concerned about it back in the preseason, trying to 
find the right mix on the offensive line. We need to get it fixed in a hurry. 
You can't leave your defense out there as long as we did last week." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram defense was on the field for 76 plays and 38 minutes against Arizona, 
but held a pathetic Cardinal offense to 230 yards. Defensive end Robert Young 
had two of the Rams' five sacks, and the pass rush expects to be a key factor 
against the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will have to make adjustments to contend with Atlanta quarterback 
Jeff George and the Falcons' run-and-shoot offense. They will probably replace 
middle linebacker Shane Conlan with cornerback Robert Bailey, giving them an 
extra defensive back for pass coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to be patient because they're going to get their yards," 
said Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head coach. "We're going to have to limit their 
star players' productivity." 
</P>
<P>
 That won't be easy considering that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rison has scored eight touchdowns and averaged 17.5 yards a catch in eight 
games against the Rams, and had two touchdown catches in last year's 30-24 
victory in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tailback Erric Pegram averaged 156 yards rushing and receiving in two games 
against the Rams last season. The Ram coaches and players thought enough of 
Pegram to vote for him in Pro Bowl balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 -- George, acquired from Indianapolis in an off-season trade, completed 29 of 
37 passes for 281 yards and three touchdowns against Detroit. He has thrown 239 
consecutive passes without an interception, the best current streak among 
active players and third-best all time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff has a Dan Marino-like release and is very accurate," Vitt said. "He can 
slide and move in the pocket to buy time and can get the ball in some real 
short areas. He's the only quarterback in the league who has so many throws 
(overhead, sidearm) in his arm as he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Rison was George's main target in the loss to the Lions, catching 14 passes 
for 193 yards and two touchdowns. The Falcons lost free-agent receiver Michael 
Haynes to New Orleans and Mike Pritchard to Denver in the off-season, making 
Rison even more of a threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've made a smooth transition with the receivers they do have (from) the 
ones they've lost," Vitt said. "But there's no question they're featuring Rison 
and Pegram."

ABSENT DAVIS LEAVES RAIDERS IN LURCH FOR HOME OPENER; PRO FOOTBALL: SEAHAWKS 
ARRIVE TODAY AS SUDDENLY THIN LINE GETS JUGGLED WITHOUT DEFENSIVE END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So where is Scott Davis? 
</P>
<P>
 Not at practice Saturday, the fourth consecutive day he had missed. And not on 
the field for the Raider home opener this afternoon against the Seattle 
Seahawks at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, the Raiders' starting left defensive end, has not been seen at the 
team's El Segundo training headquarters since Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been in contact with Coach Art Shell, citing "personal problems" as the 
reason for his disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Davis' last day on the job, he got into a brawl with teammate Greg 
Biekert, but people who know Davis, both inside and outside the organization, 
discount the fight as the cause of his absence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fight may be a symptom," said a close friend who asked not to be 
identified, "but I don't think anybody gets into a fight and leaves. In all my 
football experience, I've never heard of that. He may have a problem with 
teammates or his coaches, but I have a hard time believing a guy gets into a 
fight and says he's not going to play anymore. Maybe he's just had it with 
football. He has never really been focused on whether he wants to play or not." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third time Davis has left the sport unexpectedly. After his first 
season at the University of Illinois, he took a year off, saying he was "burned 
out." After starting every game for the Raiders in the 1990 and '91 seasons, he 
retired for two years before coming back this summer at age 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Biekert, still wearing a bandage on his nose from the fight, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys have fights all the time," said another Raider teammate. "Then they're 
hugging each other the next day. I think it's some other things. We're not down 
on him. We just want him to play." 
</P>
<P>
 If Davis doesn't play, serious questions will arise over the four-year, 
$4.35-million contract he signed to rejoin the Raiders this season, a contract 
that includes a signing bonus of a little over $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Of more immediate concern is the suddenly thin Raider defensive line. With 
Howie Long retired, with Greg Townsend in Philadelphia, with Willie Broughton 
still at least a week away from playing because of an elbow injury, the Raiders 
will move Nolan Harrison to end, start Jerry Ball at tackle and are down to 
veteran Aundray Bruce, converted tight end John Duff and rookie Austin Robbins 
for reserve strength. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's hot at the Coliseum, there might be some heavy breathing on that line 
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if the Seahawks were to beat the favored Raiders today, that would be 
considered an upset. But the biggest upset of all is that the Seahawks and 
Raiders are at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 No one would have predicted that nearly eight months ago, when the Northridge 
earthquake left the 71-year-old L.A. Coliseum looking more like the 
1,900-year-old Rome Colosseum. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's amazing what a massive reconstruction project and $60 million can do. 
The Coliseum opened its gates on schedule last week for the USC home opener, 
the old, gray saucer looking sturdy and bright, the rubble cleared away and the 
cracks patched. Today, it's the Raiders' turn to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 They have taken a long and winding road to get back since their last Coliseum 
appearance, a 42-24 first-round playoff victory over the Denver Broncos early 
last January. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Raiders were eliminated from the playoffs in subzero weather in 
Buffalo, they have spent a long off-season listening to rumors that they were 
headed everywhere from Florida to Maryland to Oakland, have gone to training 
camp in Oxnard, have played an exhibition game in Barcelona, followed by 
exhibitions in Dallas, Pittsburgh, Anaheim and Houston, and have gone to San 
Francisco, where they were humiliated in their season opener Monday night by 
the 49ers, 44-14. 
</P>
<P>
 If only the Raiders looked as good as their refurbished home. . . . They, too, 
underwent an off-season reconstruction project, spending $29 million to patch 
up the holes and cracks so evident in their lineup last season. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Raiders' grand opening last week was nothing like that of the 
Coliseum's.  
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have won their last four games at the Coliseum, playoffs included. 
They have won their last eight against Seattle, the last Seahawk victory coming 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Things may be different this year, however. Once the league's offensive 
laughingstock, the Seahawks have become respectable with the development of 
quarterback Rick Mirer to complement running back Chris Warren. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Seattle scored 140 points, an NFL record for futility in a 
16-game season. But last season, with Mirer, the first-round draft choice from 
Notre Dame at the controls, the Seahawks doubled that total. 
</P>
<P>
 And last week, Seattle opened impressively against an admittedly weak 
Washington team, beating the Redskins, 28-7. It was Seattle's first opening-day 
victory since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 To stop the Seahawks, the Raiders must stop Mirer. Their chances would be a 
lot better if Davis were to show up at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't figure to happen today. Will it ever happen? Only one man knows 
and he's not around to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive backs Derrick Hoskins and Lionel Washington are both listed as 
probable. . . . For the Seahawks, defensive tackle Sam Adams, the club's top 
draft choice, is expected to delay his NFL debut for at least another week 
because of a knee injury. . . . The NFL Experience, the football theme park set 
up at the 1993 Super Bowl in Pasadena, will be open again this morning in 
Exposition Park, north of the Coliseum, from 9 to 11:30. Admission is by game 
ticket only.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; CHAOS WINS IF SEASON IS CALLED OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If the remainder of the 1994 season is canceled, as appeared even more likely 
Saturday, the Fall Classic is certain to be replaced by a fall, winter, spring 
and perhaps summer of chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Utter chaos," Donald Fehr, executive director of the players' union, said of 
the expected reaction to the owners' anticipated decision to unilaterally 
implement a salary cap that would eliminate arbitration and restrict free 
agency, besides putting a ceiling on payrolls. "It's new territory, so anyone 
who says they know what would happen should take a cold shower, but we would 
take every legal step at our disposal. It would be resisted by the players, 
individually and collectively, any way they can." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't imagine the players playing under a salary cap they went on 
strike to resist." 
</P>
<P>
 The salary cap was still there Saturday, still the drum beat John Harrington, 
the Boston Red Sox CEO, and Stan Kasten, president of the Atlanta Braves, were 
marching to during a morning meeting with union officials pertaining to revenue 
sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 That was expected to be the topic, at least, but it always gets back to the 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "They reassured us of two things," Fehr said. "They need the cap and they were 
in the process of leaving town. Clearly, the owners have no desire to reach an 
agreement and never have. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every signal I've received from ownership is that they don't intend to play 
ball again this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting commissioner Bud Selig is expected to make that announcement Monday or 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brewer owner was in Milwaukee on Saturday, and it was uncertain whether he 
would return to New York to deliver his season-ending benediction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bud has made it clear he wants to sit on the mountaintop and pass judgments, 
assuming Milwaukee is a mountaintop," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, Bud really likes the job and the gravity he feels and he wants 
everyone to know the weight he has on his shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 The burden will only become heavier if the owners implement the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one union lawyer: "It will spawn so much litigation that only the lawyers 
and accountants will make any money." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another: "I wouldn't be surprised if the 1995 season didn't start until 
June, and by then there may be only 22 or 23 clubs because a few of them may 
not survive April and May (considering the revenue they already have lost as a 
result of a players strike that began on Aug. 12)." 
</P>
<P>
 If the rest of the season goes down, including playoffs and the World Series, 
the union estimates that the 28 clubs will have lost between $600 million and 
$800 million in gross revenue because of the strike, and between $400 million 
and $500 million after the savings on salaries is deducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Those losses will be compounded by a continuation of the strike in 1995, one 
of the almost certain responses to unilateral implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only would the viability of some clubs be threatened, the value of several 
others up for sale would be significantly diminished because of the industry's 
overall uncertainty, union lawyers believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Jackie Autry thought she could still get $150 million for the Angels, 
she'd be sadly mistaken," a union lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the likelihood of the strike resuming in 1995, the union has 
other options. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It can complain to the National Labor Relations Board that the owners 
failed to negotiate in good faith, initiating a long and complex process that 
ultimately could lead to an administrative law judge who would have authority 
to overturn the salary-cap system and compensate the union financially. 
</P>
<P>
 The union acknowledges that it is difficult to prove bad faith, but believes 
its potential case was enhanced when the owners failed to supply complete data 
on their revenue-sharing plan until the strike was in its fourth week. The 
owners also never made even one alteration to their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could file a default grievance aimed at making every player a free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could help underwrite a new league through $200 million in licensing 
revenue. A new league, of course, is far from the most viable of options, but 
it already is being used by the union as leverage. Said Dodger center fielder 
Brett Butler, a member of the union's negotiating committee: "Players would be 
more willing to start a new league than to play with a salary cap." 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could hope that Congress reacts to cancellation of the World Series by 
removing the owners' antitrust exemption, broadening their legal options. The 
House Judiciary Committee has scheduled new hearings on the exemption for Sept. 
22, and Fehr said: "Sooner or later legislators have to understand that as long 
as they tolerate cartels, sooner or later those cartels will do the things 
cartels do. The owners would not have a snowball's chance in hell of 
implementing the cap if the exemption was removed." 
</P>
<P>
 Would it be reward enough if the strike resulted in the exemption's removal? 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr shook his head and said, "You do what you have to do in the context of 
bargaining. You don't go on strike to get the exemption lifted. You go on 
strike in the hope of reaching an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, you also go on strike because it's your only economic leverage 
against unilateral implementation, a step the owners can take at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no negotiating sessions scheduled today, and no owners remained in 
town Saturday after Harrington and Kasten left. The union's executive board, 
comprising the 28 player representatives, will meet here Monday to review its 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said he would apprise the board that "spring training appears to be in 
jeopardy" and, if Selig brings down the season, it becomes even more obvious 
that the owners "intent is to break the union, to keep the children from 
playing. It's old-fashioned union busting." 
</P>
<P>
 All of that is the stuff of chaos, but there's more: Do the players sign 
contracts if the owners implement? Under what system do the 192 players 
eligible for free agency operate, along with the 182 eligible for arbitration? 
Would the clubs attempt to use minor leaguers as replacement players in '95? Do 
the complexities of the salary-cap proposal, compounded by 1994 revenue and 
payroll yardsticks, make immediate implementation impossible because too many 
clubs would be over the cap? 
</P>
<P>
 The initial plan was to phase in the system over four seasons. Management 
sources insisted Saturday that a decision on implementation has yet to be 
reached. Fehr scoffed at that, saying it's a foregone conclusion. Asked if he 
was surprised that the eighth stoppage since 1972 has gone this far and come to 
this, he again shook his head and said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since the owners fired Fay Vincent (as commissioner), I've heard Jerry 
Reinsdorf (Chicago White Sox owner) talk about going to war with the players, 
so I'm not surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither is Vincent. He predicted that these would be the "Bud and Jerry Ice 
Cream Wars." PACKAGE DEAL 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Cubs will pay the Minnesota Twins $350,000 and a player -- 
possibly left-handed hitting first baseman Brooks Kieschnick, their No. 1 draft 
choice of 1993 -- as compensation for hiring general manager Andy MacPhail as 
president and CEO of the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 MacPhail shook hands on a five-year deal that will pay him $600,000 a year, 
with incentives that could take it to $900,000. He will receive memberships in 
a country club and private club, along with stock options and benefit plans 
through the parent Chicago Tribune Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Himes will be fired as the Cubs' general manager, having never really 
recovered from the departure of Greg Maddux as a free agent. MacPhail may fill 
the GM role, too, rather than hire a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 His handsome deal with the Cubs was floated past union leader Fehr, who smiled 
and said, "Obviously, salary caps only apply to players."

MIKE DOWNEY: LOSING TO RAMS MIGHT BE TOO HOT FOR ANDRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Downey's California: 
</P>
<P>
 * Question: What do Darryl Henley and the Rams have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: They're both a threat to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once upon a time, an unhappy rapper got sore at her boyfriend Andre Rison 
and burned down his house. Andre is also the football player who "guaranteed" 
that his team would defeat the Rams in today's game at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 All I want to say here is, I have no idea what Andre did to get his girlfriend 
hot enough to burn his house down, but whatever it was, wouldn't losing to the 
Rams be worse? 
</P>
<P>
 * Speaking of guys named Andre, this is just a hunch on my part, but I'm 
betting Brooke Shields has never burned down Andre Agassi's house and never 
will. 
</P>
<P>
 * Q.: What do Muhammad Ali and Napoleon McCallum have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 A.: They both got clobbered by Ken Norton. 
</P>
<P>
 * Welcome to today's football game at the Coliseum, L.A.'s $60-million 
fixer-upper. 
</P>
<P>
 * It's the Seattle Seahawks, whose roof caved in, against the Raiders, whose 
floor caved in. Players will be penalized 15 yards for standing in a doorway. 
</P>
<P>
 * The concession stands could make a fortune selling popcorn, hot dogs and 
life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 * People complained that the Coliseum looks exactly the same as before. What 
did you expect, shag carpeting? 
</P>
<P>
 * Everybody's talking about the big quarterback battle on TV today. 
Personally, I didn't feel Chris Miller vs. Jeff George was that big a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * The bad news is that Fox TV is blacking out Joe Montana and Kansas City vs. 
Steve Young and San Francisco today in the Los Angeles area. The good news is 
that they're running "The Best of NFL on Fox," with highlights of every 
football game televised on Fox to date. 
</P>
<P>
 * I'm predicting 49ers 24, Chiefs 23 on a pass by Young to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hank Williams, Jr. asked before last Monday night's NFL game: "Are you ready 
for some football?" Yeah, Hank. I still am. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trivia question: Name six Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hot rumor is that Fox management is demanding that Jimmy Johnson, Terry 
Bradshaw and Howie Long settle on one hairstyle and, dammit, stick with it. 
</P>
<P>
 * My biggest fear is that the Buffalo Bills go 0-16 this season and still make 
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 * Too bad Sterling Sharpe of the Green Bay Packers isn't speaking to the 
press. There are so many things I want to ask him. 
</P>
<P>
 * With their final offer, the baseball owners told the players that what they 
want most is 1. a salary cap; 2. owner trading cards; 3. visitation rights with 
any player in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boy, I really miss the Dodgers. Tell me their names again. 
</P>
<P>
 * I'm planning to watch all of Ken Burns' baseball documentary on PBS except 
for the first nine hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vision in my mind: George Steinbrenner, Jerry Reinsdorf and Gene Autry on a 
picket line, carrying a sign: WILL OWN FOR FOOD. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sportswriters don't have a salary cap. With us, it's more like a salary 
beanie. 
</P>
<P>
 * The NCAA penalizes football players for celebrating after a touchdown. The 
NCAA would penalize children for finding eggs on Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trivia answer: I'm sorry, nobody can name six Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 * George Foreman is thinking about a big John Daly fight for next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * If we ask real nice, maybe Fox will black out that O.J. Simpson movie in our 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hey, first time I ever looked at a USC-Penn State game as a Rose Bowl 
preview. 
</P>
<P>
 * I went to see that movie "Andre." Turned out it was about a tennis-playing 
seal whose girlfriend burned down his aquarium.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL SPOTHLIGHT; OPPONENTS WISH THEY COULD SAY 'NO MOSS'

 Coach Barry Alvarez directed the Wisconsin sports information staff not to 
bother producing a slick campaign pushing tailback Brent Moss for the Heisman 
Trophy this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Brent skipped the NFL draft (after last season), I told him our No. 1 
goal is not to win him the Heisman this year," Alvarez said. "If he has a year 
like last year and so do we, then he'll be in the hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 So might the Badgers. Moss ran 18 times for 129 yards and three touchdowns and 
the Badgers rolled over Eastern Michigan, 56-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Eagle Coach Ron Cooper: "There's no doubt that that team is not just Big 
Ten champion caliber, they have a chance to do some things nationally, no doubt 
about it. Don't be surprised if they go 11-0." MAYBE NEXT WEEK THEY'LL WANT TO 
GIVE HIM THE BOOT 
</P>
<P>
 After kicking his fourth field goal Saturday, a 42-yard game-winner with two 
seconds remaining to give Michigan a 26-24 victory over Notre Dame, Remy 
Hamilton was happy, but he was careful not to get too carried away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every kicker thinks about making a winning field goal," said Hamilton, who 
had attempted only one field goal in his career before Saturday. "I'm a hero 
now. I could be a goat next week." 
</P>
<P>
 If he wants to know how that feels he should ask Stanford kicker Eric Abrams, 
who missed a 23-yard field goal with three seconds left that would have won the 
game for the Cardinal, which tied Northwestern, 41-41. AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, 
HE'S STILL ALL THUMBS 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was more surprised than former USC quarterback Troy Winslow when Trojan 
radio announcer Pete Arbogast informed listeners last week, during the Trojans' 
opener against Washington, that Winslow was "resting comfortably after having 
his thumb bitten off by a mountain lion." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Tim Tessalone, USC sports information director, Winslow called 
him after the game to make a correction. "He called and said, 'Tell your radio 
guy that I still have both my thumbs. I'm looking at them right now,' " 
Tessalone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems it was another Troy Winslow who, along with another man, helped wrestle 
a cougar off a woman attacked last month near the Northern California town of 
Dos Rios. The cougar was eventually stabbed to death. HE GOT A THUMB UP ON 
FIELD AS A PLAYER 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow, the quarterback, guided the Trojan offense in 1965 and '66. He ranks 
12th on the team's career passing list, having completed 163 of 276 passes for 
2,075 yards. He was at the helm when tailback Mike Garrett won the Heisman 
Trophy in 1965. IT WAS FAR TOO LATE TO START SOMETHING BIG 
</P>
<P>
 After USC's Quincy Harrison intercepted a pass by Penn State quarterback Kerry 
Collins and ran it back for a touchdown in the third quarter to cut the 
Trojans' deficit to 35-7, Arbogast said, "The comeback is on!" Final score: 
Penn State 38, USC 14. SMITH'S TIGERS NO MATCH FOR LIONS, TROJANS WERE 
</P>
<P>
 In his first year as coach of Missouri, Larry Smith isn't faring too well. His 
team hasn't won a road game in nearly four years and it didn't come close 
Saturday against Illinois, managing only one first down during a 42-0 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 It probably won't make him feel any better, but Smith, fired by the Trojans 
after the 1992 season, accomplished something USC Coach John Robinson has yet 
to accomplish -- he beat Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Robinson, the Trojans were beaten by Penn State in the Fiesta Bowl, 
26-10, on Jan. 1, 1981. Last year, during Robinson's first year back as coach, 
the Trojans fell to the Nittany Lions, 21-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's teams beat Penn State in 1990 and '91. HARD FOR THE TOUGH TO GET GOING 
ON ARMY'S TURF 
</P>
<P>
 The artificial turf at Army's Michie Stadium is again taking its toll. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest victim is quarterback Rick Roper, who was to split time with Mike 
Makovec. On Army's sixth play from scrimmage against Holy Cross, Roper tore a 
ligament in his left knee on a run up the middle. Roper, who appeared to catch 
his cleats as he made his cut, is expected to miss the remainder of his senior 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, fullback Akili King, the Cadets' leading rusher last 
season, left the game because of a twisted right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Army lost eight players, including Makovec, to non-contact, 
season-ending knee injuries on the artificial turf. AN ENCORE PERFORMANCE FEW 
COULD HAVE EXPECTED 
</P>
<P>
 Alcorn State quarterback Steve McNair, who passed for 534 yards and five 
touchdowns last week against Grambling, followed that with an eight-touchdown 
day Saturday in a 54-28 victory over Tennessee Chattanooga. 
</P>
<P>
 McNair threw for 491 yards and rushed for 156 and his 647 total yards set a 
Division I-AA record, topping the 643 yards Weber State quarterback Jamie 
Martin gained against Idaho State on Nov. 23, 1991. Martin threw for 624 yards 
and ran for 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Grambling, McNair amassed 633 total yards.  
</P>
<P>
 Against Tennessee Chattanooga he had touchdown passes, in order, of 62, 12, 
81, 12, 15, 14, 19 and 60 yards. HE MUST HAVE BEEN TALKING TONGUE IN CHEEK 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Tongue intercepted three passes to play a key role in Oregon's 44-31 
victory over Wyoming.  
</P>
<P>
 But Tongue kept his in check after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I played that well," he said. "I made a couple of bad plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Even his 36-yard interception return for a touchdown that clinched the victory 
with 1:24 to play didn't impress Tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was beat on that last play, actually," he said. "He just underthrew it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tongue's two interception returns for touchdowns tied a school record set by 
Paul Snider against Gonzaga in 1926. Tongue's 103 interception return yards 
broke the record of 101 set by Snider in the same game. SMALL SCHOOLS, BUT NO 
SMALL FEATS 
</P>
<P>
 Chris George of West Virginia's Glenville State had 12 receptions in a 53-28 
victory over California University of Pennsylvania, giving him 315 receptions 
in four seasons, five more than the San Francisco 49ers' Jerry Rice had while 
attending Mississippi Valley State. 
</P>
<P>
 George becomes the leading receiver in college football history. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenville State has an enrollment of 2,500. Mississippi Valley State's 
enrollment is 1,794. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Napoleon Kaufman rushed for a career-high 211 yards on 32 carries to lead 
Washington past Ohio State, 25-16. Kaufman became the first running back to 
gain 200 yards against the Buckeyes since Jamie Morris of Michigan gained 210 
yards against them in 1986. . . . Wisconsin's Moss extended his streak of 
100-yard rushing games to 12 during the Badgers' 56-0 victory over Eastern 
Michigan. It was also Wisconsin's first shutout in 114 games. . . . Notre Dame 
had only 10 turnovers in 12 games last year. Saturday against Michigan the 
Irish had three. . . . Auburn defeated Northeast Louisiana, 44-12, extending 
the nation's longest winning streak to 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State amassed 731 yards in its 52-20 victory over Maryland. . . . 
Seminole quarterback Danny Kanell completed 28 of 44 passes for 417 yards and a 
touchdown. Despite the victory, it was the second consecutive week the 
Seminoles allowed an opponent to score on the first possession. It didn't 
happen last season. . . . Stanford hasn't won its opening game since beating 
Texas Tech, 31-20, in 1986. . . . Andre Davis ran for 325 yards, including a 
school-record 87-yard touchdown, to lead Texas Christian to a 44-29 victory 
over New Mexico. . . . Former Servite High and Fullerton College quarterback 
Josh Nelson passed for two touchdowns and ran for one as Mississippi rolled up 
539 yards to overwhelm Division I-AA Southern Illinois, 59-3. . . . Georgia 
Tech quarterback Tommy Luginbill, son of former San Diego State coach Al 
Luginbill, threw four second-half touchdowns to lead the Yellow Jackets to a 
45-26 victory over Division I-AA Western Carolina. QUOTEWORTHY

<P>
 "Revenge is a bad emotion, but respect is a much more positive emotion and we 
had respect for Oklahoma because they beat us convincingly last year. I think 
we have just scratched the surface with this team on how good we can be."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Texas A&M Coach R.C. Slocum, after the Aggies avenged last year's 30-point 
loss to Oklahoma with a 36-14 victory over the 15th-ranked Sooners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping they would line up and run at us and they did. But they ran 
right through us."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Missouri's Smith, after the Tigers lost to Illinois, 42-0.

<P>
 "When I saw the Duke game (a 49-16 rout over Maryland last Saturday), I 
thought this game might get ugly. The only ugly thing was us."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden, referring to the Seminoles' play in the 
first half against the Terrapins. They trailed, 20-17, before pulling away in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not exactly a record you want to set."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Roger Fleenor of Pacific, who punted 14 times in the Tigers' 33-7 loss to 
Minnesota, breaking by two a 25-year-old school record. HOW THE TOP 25 FARED

IT COULD BE UGLY IN LINCOLN; NONCONFERENCE: DONAHUE SAYS BRUINS CAN'T PLAY 
NEBRASKA THE SAME WAY THEY PLAYED SMU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's the latest on the UCLA football team for all you Bruin fans out there, 
including the guy in the UCLA shirt Saturday in the first row of the stands at 
the Rose Bowl, the guy shouting, "Nebraska is going to murder you!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Bruins beat Southern Methodist for the first time. This is kind of a 
tricky item because UCLA was playing SMU for the first time since 1947, when 
Terry Donahue was 3. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Bruins looked hugely underwhelming doing it. The whole thing was enough 
to age Donahue quicker than you can say Tommie Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Saturday, it's on to Lincoln, Neb., for UCLA, and Donahue knows exactly 
what will happen if the Bruins play the same way they did against SMU. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll get slaughtered," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the guy in the first row will be right. Oh, well, at least UCLA is 2-0, 
and nobody is going to put an asterisk next to the Bruins' 17-10 slogfest over 
the lightly regarded Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
 It shouldn't have been that hard to throw a saddle on these Ponies and ride 
them straight into the corral. SMU is 11-44-2 since restarting its football 
program in 1989 after receiving the NCAA's so-called "death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA nose tackle George Kase said the Bruins might already have been packing 
for Lincoln when they should have been spending more time worrying about SMU. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to play better than this," Kase said. "We were looking forward to 
Nebraska. But, you know, this is a pretty disappointing game to win by seven 
points." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins were favored by 25 points, but they probably were pretty fortunate 
that they won at all. Coach Bob Field's defense saved UCLA from a major 
embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two minutes of the game, SMU had a first down at UCLA's three, 
then ran out of downs at the 21 when Bruin safety Abdul McCullough broke up the 
pass at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 There was another UCLA defensive stand in the second quarter after shifty SMU 
quarterback Ramon Flanigan guided the Ponies to a first down at the Bruin four. 
SMU lost 19 yards in three plays and came away with nothing when Ben Crosland 
missed a 39-yard field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a good day for the Bruin offense. The Ponies ran more plays than 
UCLA as Flanigan passed for 301 yards, and UCLA quarterback Wayne Cook, who 
committed three turnovers, had big trouble keeping the offense on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was scary, but we got the victory," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is true. Cook was one of the first players in the Bruin locker room after 
the game. He took up a post at the door and shook the hand of each UCLA 
defensive player as he came in. 
</P>
<P>
 "They saved my butt a few times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just came out flat," he said. "I think we got better, but it wasn't easy. 
There was something in the back of your head saying we're going to kill these 
guys. But we're not going to let this get us down." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanigan said he didn't think UCLA respected SMU, at least at first, but 
predicts a better effort against Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I'm sure they'll be a lot more jacked up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for how UCLA stacks up against other teams that SMU plays, Flanigan said 
the Bruins are fast, but not very pushy, adding: "They're not nearly as 
physical as Texas A&M or Baylor or Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 This may be bad news, because next Saturday UCLA has got to be at least as 
physical as Nebraska. And it's going to have to be that way without two 
starters who probably were lost for the season Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Right offensive tackle Paul Kennedy injured his right knee, and the Bruins 
suspect he has torn ligaments. Cornerback Carl Greenwood, UCLA's top defensive 
back, broke his right ankle, which means that a team that isn't very deep just 
got shallower. 
</P>
<P>
 And it all happened against little old SMU. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't say we played bad, but. . . . " McCullough said. "We might have taken 
them lightly, their being SMU and all, but they showed us something." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Nebraska, Cook said: "Well, we're not going to play like we did today. 
Know why? They'll kill us if we do." 
</P>
<P>
 This seems like a good incentive.

MOTORCYCLES; DOOHAN IS SET TO WIN FOR AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mick Doohan of Queensland, Australia, has already clinched the world 500cc 
motorcycle road racing championship, so what's his incentive in today's United 
States Grand Prix at Laguna Seca Raceway? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pay-back time," he said with a grin. "Americans won the last two 
Australian GPs, so it's up to me to pay them back." 
</P>
<P>
 John Kocinski, defending USGP champion from Little Rock, Ark., won this year's 
season-opener in Australia and Kevin Schwantz of Paige, Tex., won last year en 
route to the world championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwantz, runner-up to Doohan this season, fell during morning practice 
Saturday and will miss the rest of the season, including today's race. The 
fall, which came at low speed in Laguna Seca's famed corkscrew corner, 
dislocated his left hip and broke his right wrist. Schwantz was already riding 
with a cast on his ailing left wrist, which had been broken twice earlier in 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not making the start of my home Grand Prix is a big disappointment," Schwantz 
said after having his hip popped back in place and returning to the track. "It 
seems like this place just doesn't like me." 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to have immediate surgery on the left wrist so it will have time to 
strengthen before next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Doohan gave an indication of his resolve when he stole the No. 1 qualifying 
position from Kocinski on his final lap of the 2.214-mile hillside circuit. His 
lap of 91.893 m.p.h. was just 0.008 seconds quicker than the defending 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Luca Cadalora of Italy, riding for Kenny Roberts' Marlboro Yamaha team, was 
third, followed by Shinichi Itoh of Japan and Doug Chandler, Kocinski's Cagiva 
teammate from Salinas, who moved up to fifth when Schwantz withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a close race, the same as last year," Doohan said. "It's the nature 
of the track. The thing is that it's all stop and start, which makes it 
difficult to make up an advantage on anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Kocinski also said he expected a repeat of last year's battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning at home meant a lot of me," Kocinski said. "I feel good about 
Sunday's race, but you have to ride within the limits of your motorcycle, and 
so far we've not been able to get around here as quick as Doohan. I think it 
will go down to me, Mick and Cadalora." 
</P>
<P>
 Doohan, 29, is on target to equal Giacomo Agostini of Italy as the winningest 
single-season rider in Grand Prix history. With eight victories in the year's 
11 races to date, Doohan needs to win today and also in Argentina and Spain to 
equal Agostini's 1972 record of 11 victories on his factory MV Agusta. 
</P>
<P>
 Doohan appeared to have the title won in 1992 after winning five of the first 
seven races, but a leg injury from a crash during practice for the Dutch GP 
caused him to miss enough races that Rainey caught and passed him in the final 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 The leg, which apparently was not set properly, caused him problems all last 
season before he underwent another operation to repair the earlier damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost quit after the 1993 season because I didn't have the strength to 
ride the way I needed to ride to win," Doohan said. "Like here at Laguna Seca. 
I was leading late in the race when I fell. It was because I lacked the 
strength to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 Doohan was leading with only seven laps remaining last year when he fell and 
gave the lead and the victory to Kocinski.

KINGS AND MIGHTY DUCKS OPEN EXHIBITION PLAY IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD and LISA DILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Kings, a skilled team that tried to add toughness this summer, and the 
Mighty Ducks, a tough team that tried to add skill, open the exhibition season 
against each other tonight at 6 p.m. at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky and newly drafted goalie Jamie Storr are scheduled to play for 
the Kings, but Duck Coach Ron Wilson plans to hold out rookies Paul Kariya and 
Oleg Tverdovsky -- in part because he expects a physical game between the rival 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's been the Kings' game plan all summer, to be more physical, and I think 
that's a response to us," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get in line," Coach Barry Melrose of the Kings said. "Florida punished us 
physically, the Ducks punished us, and Dallas punished us. Those days are 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, the Canadian national team star who signed a three-year, $6.5-million 
contract on Aug. 31, has been the star of the Ducks' camp, showing his speed 
and passing flair on a line with Anatoli Semenov and rookie Valeri Karpov. He 
is scheduled to make his debut Tuesday in an exhibition game at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Storr, the seventh draft pick in June, is considered a potential franchise 
goalie within a few years, and the Kings want to take a good look at him to 
decide if he is ready to be an NHL backup in his first season. He will split 
tonight's game with Robb Stauber. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhail Shtalenkov and John Tanner will be the Duck goalies. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Don McSween, 30, a journeyman who was making $75,000 in the minor 
leagues when he won a job because of injuries last season, has re-signed with 
the Ducks, agreeing to a three-year deal that will pay him $300,000 this season 
if he appears in at least 30 NHL games. . . . King minor league wing Keith 
Redmond, who has not been in camp because of personal problems, will report to 
Phoenix in three weeks. ROBYN NORWOOD and LISA DILLMAN

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; TALKS RESUME, BUT A LOCKOUT LOOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Collective bargaining talks between the NHL and its players' association are 
to resume this week amid whispers that a lockout is so likely to delay the Oct. 
1 season opener, the league has already drawn up a 50-game contingency schedule 
with a January starting date. 
</P>
<P>
 King defenseman Marty McSorley, a member of the NHL Player Assn.'s five-man 
negotiating committee, painted a gloomy picture of the talks. While he clings 
to the hope that "there are a lot of owners who are hockey fans . . . and come 
Oct. 1 they're going to want the season to start," he sees a wide gulf between 
the sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman's rollback of training camp meal money, his 
declaration that players must pay their own expenses to camp -- a ruling that 
kept four of the Buffalo Sabres' draft choices home -- and the league's bluff 
about a training camp lockout widened that gap, McSorley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I don't believe owners believed a lockout would take place before 
training camp would open," he said. "They believed training camp would open and 
they'd get revenues (from exhibition games) and if there'd be a lockout, it 
would be when the players start to make money." 
</P>
<P>
 The players' first pay period is Oct. 1-15. They are not paid during camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it stands right now, I don't think the season will start," said Bob 
Corkum, the Mighty Ducks' player representative. "Of course, I could be wrong, 
but my gut feeling is the owners will lock us out. . . . We're going to stick 
to our guns on this. We're very unified and solid and we're not going to budge. 
It's very important for us to (have the right to) shop ourselves on an open 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley said: "There's been a lot of talk. Whether there's been a lot of area 
closed between the two parties, I'm not sure. I know the union would like to 
get everything closed up, but at the same time, you can't sell the farm." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For players, selling the farm means (1) rejecting Bettman's proposal that game 
rosters be cut by one to 17 skaters and two goalies and (2) refusing any form 
of salary-revenue links, even those applying only to first-year players. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put a cancer on your finger, you put a cancer on your toe, you still have 
cancer," McSorley said. "We have to be careful about any form of salary cap. 
How can we get a true idea of what their revenues are? Some teams are owned by 
corporations, like the New York Rangers (owned by Viacom, which is selling them 
to ITT-Sheraton and Cablevision). With corporations of that size, what exactly 
are they determining as revenue?" 
</P>
<P>
 He also cited the imbalance between the revenues of small-market teams, such 
as Winnipeg and Quebec, and teams in larger cities. "I'm not saying we're not 
sensitive to (small-market teams) but before you can ask players to accept the 
burden of helping small-market teams, you have to ask if the big-market teams 
are doing their share," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Areas of potential compromise are few. What's negotiable and what's not? 
</P>
<P>
 Arbitration, perhaps? "It's in the mix, but we have so few players move," 
McSorley said. "You can count on one hand the number of players who move 
(through free agency)." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tony Tavares, president of the Mighty Ducks: "Everything is negotiable, 
but you have to look at what the entire package is. And you have to remember 
agreements of this nature, you make in small steps. You don't take one major 
issue and make the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The encouraging thing is the talks are going on. Nobody is staring at 20 
paces and saying, 'We won't talk because of this or that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The only agreement is that a lockout would halt the NHL's growth spurt. "Last 
year was probably the best the NHL has ever had," said Rob Blake, the Kings' 
player representative, "and this is a big year for hockey. With the baseball 
strike (continuing), fans might turn to other sports." 
</P>
<P>

MCCALLUM PAYS A VISIT TO TEAMMATES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Napoleon McCallum returned to the Raiders on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days after suffering a season-ending, career-threatening leg injury, 
McCallum showed up at the Raiders' El Segundo headquarters in a wheelchair to 
visit his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all right," the fullback said. "I just came by to say hi and tell 
everybody I'm fine." 
</P>
<P>
 McCallum ruptured an artery in his left leg and dislocated his kneecap on a 
tackle by San Francisco linebacker Ken Norton in Monday night's Raider-49er 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on his deep religious faith and his unwavering optimism, McCallum is 
ready to deal with his uncertain future. But he's not ready to talk about the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the injury, McCallum paused, then said, "I knew something was bad, 
but I don't want to relive it or have to read about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the play occurred on national television, McCallum has received a 
tremendous outpouring of concern and sympathy from fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the things I've heard have been really touching," he said. "But I'm 
not ready to get sentimental. I just want to get right, get ready and get 
fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the Lord has got something for me, has got a plan, and I'm just 
following it the best I can." STEVE SPRINGER

<P>
 San Francisco at Kansas City 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one thing could make this game more appealing: Playing it in San 
Francisco. It should be all that is expected, but the 49ers have the potential 
to dominate. Much depends on how well Joe Montana can keep his former defense 
off balance. That defense has some new looks that looked mean Monday night: Ken 
Norton Jr., Richard Dent and Rickey Jackson. Also, the Chiefs can be had 
through the air. Chief Coach Marty Schottenheimer has never beaten the 49ers. 
But with Marcus Allen and Montana, he has a team that can rise to the occasion. 
Miami vs. Green Bay 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Marino will get a better test against the Packers at Milwaukee. His five 
touchdown passes in a comeback victory over the Patriots shouldn't be taken 
lightly, but the Patriots don't have anyone like the Packers' Reggie White or 
Sean Jones. Look for Miami to run traps and delays that were effective in the 
exhibition game between these teams. The Packers do have injuries on defense 
which Marino will try to exploit. Brett Favre can be one of the best 
quarterbacks in the NFC when he has time to throw. He probably will. Miami's 
defense will be better on a dry field, but it still will be another 
high-scoring game. That's why Miami is pursuing Deion Sanders and Vaughan 
Johnson -- a former Pro Bowl linebacker with the Saints. Houston at Dallas 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe some Texas pride can save the Oilers in this one, but don't count on it. 
The Cowboys devoured the Steelers last week. The Oilers were run over by 
Marshall Faulk and the Colts. If they couldn't stop Faulk, how are they going 
to stop Emmitt Smith? Of course nobody has really solved that. The Oilers have 
plenty of questions that won't be answered today. Oiler quarterback Cody 
Carlson is listed as questionable because of a sore shoulder. In a sense, that 
could be true of the whole offense. Houston's three turnovers turned into three 
touchdowns for the Colts. If Carlson can't play, Bucky Richardson will step in. 
Who is Bucky Richardson? Exactly. Indianapolis at Tampa Bay 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Faulk left. Marshall Faulk right. If something works, you go with it. 
Last week the Colts went with Faulk's 143 yards and three touchdowns and 
humiliated the Oilers. Faulk's running allowed quarterback Jim Harbaugh to be 
effective -- he completed nine of 12 passes with three touchdowns. The 
Buccaneers need to develop consistency. The Buccaneers' offense has proven 
big-play quality, but it had only three field goals against the Bears. The 
defense has great potential but needs to gel with seven new starters. Faulk was 
a blur to Houston on the artificial turf, and he could be slowed on the Tampa 
grass -- especially if rain makes the field slick. AMERICAN CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
 Denver at N.Y. Jets 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets were impressive in their victory over Buffalo last week. The defense 
shut down a good offense and the offense put together time-consuming drives. It 
was quite a contrast to last year's no-huddle offense and an injury-plagued 
defense. The Broncos proved they can score fast and often, but can they keep a 
lead? Not yet. Still, as long as John Elway is in the game and there is time on 
the clock, the other team's lead isn't safe either. Shannon Sharpe, who caught 
nine passes for 97 yards and a touchdown, will miss the game because of a knee 
injury. For the Jets, running back Brad Baxter has an injured foot and could 
miss up to three weeks. Buffalo at new England 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 This game should tell if the Bills have really slipped. Chances are they will 
bounce back if only because it seems impossible that Thurman Thomas can be held 
to five yards (in seven carries) again. Jim Kelly might not have the same kind 
of day that Marino did against the Patriots, but he will see their cracks on 
the film. Drew Bledsoe looked positively Marino-esque against the Dolphins, but 
it's hard to imagine Coach Bill Parcells not trying to establish more of a 
running game this week. Pittsburgh at Cleveland 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Steelers' last trip to Cleveland, Eric Metcalf returned two punts for 
touchdowns to lead the Browns to victory. Last week, Metcalf was at it again, 
returning one for a touchdown as the Browns beat the Bengals. There might not 
be a more exciting running back in the game. Pittsburgh's defense was toyed 
with by the Cowboys last week. Not many teams could have stopped the Cowboys 
that day, so expect a rebound of sorts. On offense, the Steelers need to get 
the ball to their big guys: Barry Foster and Eric Green. Cincinnati at San 
Diego 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals' defense might keep them in a few games. Rookie tackle Dan 
Wilkinson had only two tackles, but drew enough attention to free up others. 
The Bengals' offense is never all there. Quarterback David Klingler gets hit 
too often and does not hit his receivers enough. Despite quality backs, the 
Bengals do not have a reliable running game. After spotting Denver an 18-point 
halftime lead, the Chargers bolted back to win the game. Stan Humphries led the 
charge with three touchdown passes and Natrone Means pounded out 96 yards 
rushing. Linebacker Junior Seau is San Diego's defense. NATIONAL CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit at Minnesota 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings' offense was a big disappointment against the Packers last week. 
Warren Moon watched two of his passes go off the hands of receivers for 
interceptions and running back Terry Allen found little room to run in his 
return from a knee injury. The Lions' formula of 
give-Barry-Sanders-the-ball-and-enjoy worked like a charm again. Sanders had 
120 yards rushing. New quarterback Scott Mitchell looked good and former Viking 
receiver Anthony Carter caught two touchdown passes. N.Y. Giants at Arizona 
</P>
<P>
 TV: TNT, 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant quarterback Dave Brown's first start was solid enough, but this week he 
will face a defense specifically designed to stop the quarterback. The Rams 
beat the Cardinals by trying to run the ball, with marginal effectiveness. No 
doubt, the Giants will try to do that with Rodney Hampton and Dave Meggett, but 
both need room to run. The Cardinals' offense didn't do anything well against 
the Rams. Hey Buddy, maybe the run-and-shoot wasn't so bad after all. 
Washington at New Orleans 
</P>
<P>
 Time: 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams should be able to fix their poor running games: The Redskins are 
27th against the run in the NFL and the Saints 24th. The Redskins' Reggie 
Brooks will find bigger holes despite an inconsistent offensive line. Derek 
Brown and Mario Bates should fare better for the Saints. John Friesz will again 
start at quarterback for Washington. New Orleans quarterback Jim Everett is 
regaining confidence and -- with the help of Michael Haynes -- showed he can 
move the offense when the running game fails. It could happen again. ARA

DEL MAR; LEAST LIKELY FRANKEL HORSE WINS PALOMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Bobby Frankel had three horses entered in Saturday's $100,000 Palomar 
Handicap. The seeming best of them, the one with graded stakes credentials, was 
Skimble. She was scratched, leaving Nidd and Shir Dar, neither of whom had run 
a stakes race since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the Frankel survivors, Shir Dar was the longshot. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, Shir Dar was the winner. Jockey Corey Nakatani steered her through 
a hole in mid-stretch and got her home ahead of Baby Diamonds, who paid $20.40 
to place. Shir Dar paid $13.40 to win. Prying finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 Shir Dar had placed in five of her six starts this year, all at the allowance 
level, but nothing suggested she was ready to handle a Grade II race seemingly 
full of speed over 1 1/16th-miles. Of course, the absence of Skimble did not 
hurt her chances, nor anyone else's. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened was that the speed did not manifest itself. Jockey Walter Guerra 
took Baby Diamonds, 23-1 on the toteboard, to the lead and set crawling 
fractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wanted the lead," Guerra said, "so I took it. I slowed it down as best 
as I could and tried to take advantage of her light weight (110 pounds)." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani, meanwhile, took Shir Dar to the back of the pack and settled into a 
patient pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "She placed herself well," Nakatani said. "She was nice and relaxed. I moved 
her up on the backside and moved her into position on the turn. All I needed 
was a play to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Valenzuela had Vinista on the rail with Baby Diamonds holding the lead 
on the outside of her. When Baby Diamonds drifted out, Nakatani had the opening 
he needed to hit the accelerator. He moved her through and won by 
three-quarters of a length. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been that kind of a meet for Nakatani, who is closing in on his first 
riding title. He had two winners Saturday and his 46 victories leads Gary 
Stevens by eight. The Palomar was his fifth stakes victory here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 D'hallevant, who figures on the pace of today's $200,000 Del Mar Budweiser 
Breeders' Cup, is the 2-1 morning line favorite in the one-mile race for 
3-year-olds and up. He went wire-to-wire under Corey Nakatani, today's rider, 
in the seven-furlong Pat O'Brien Handicap and it's a matter of whether he can 
hang on for that last furlong. 
</P>
<P>
 Second choice, at 5-2, is Kingdom Found, another winner at this meet. Kingdom 
Found, ridden by Chris McCarron, won the San Diego Handicap on July 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The most celebrated entrant, however, is Brocco, a 3-year-old who has not run 
since finishing fourth in the Kentucky Derby. He won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile 
championship last year and figured to be a factor in the Triple Crown races. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to get him fit enough for some big races down the road," said 
Randy Winick, Brocco's trainer, alluding to Breeders' Cup racing on Nov. 5. "I 
would like to have given him one more good mile blowout had the meet been one 
week longer, but we'll work with what we've got." 
</P>
<P>
 Brocco, who will be ridden by Gary Stevens, is listed at 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The other entries are Lykatill Hil, 4-1, Eddie Delahoussaye; Tossofthecoin, 
8-1, Laffit Pincay Jr.; and Stuka, 8-1, Kent Desormeaux. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The second race on the program, the $60,000 Live the Dream, was more 
interesting than most minor stakes races because of the presence of the mare 
User Friendly. She was the European horse of the year in 1993 and made her U.S. 
debut with an allowance victory here in July. She then finished last in the 
Beverly D two weeks ago at Chicago. Indeed, trainer Rodney Rash thought so 
highly of her that he would have run her in the Arlington Million had she drawn 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 User Friendly may have been the horse with the reputation, but the hot horse 
coming into the 1 3/8-mile turf race was another import. Sandpit, a Brazilian 
import with one allowance race here, went off as the favorite and rallied in 
the stretch to post his first U.S. victory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All of the jockeys were applauded after the sixth race on the card, a 
circumstance which might have been unusual if it was REALLY the sixth race. The 
Rocking Chair Derby, featuring retired jockeys, was revived for the first time 
since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The real comeback among the comebacks was 50-year-old Danny Velasquez, who 
rallied Zee Bee around the final turn and defeated Rudy Campas and Electro by 
three-quarters of a length. Frank Olivares, riding Bettys Big Boy, finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no betting on the race, but there was a $20,000 purse and all horses 
ran with a $32,000 claiming tag. What's more, the pace was equal to any on the 
card with fractions of 21 4/5 and 45 2/5. The retired jocks may not be as fast 
as they used to be, but they can still go along for a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 A.J. Jett, a 2-year-old from Canada, took a rather roundabout route to Del Mar 
for Wednesday's Del Mar Futurity. He was vanned from Vancouver to Seattle, 
flown to Ohio and then back to Los Angeles for another van ride. He has won 
five of six starts. . . .Eddie Delahoussaye's return from injuries suffered a 
week ago was delayed until today. . . .Phone Chatter, a winner in a comeback 
race here on Aug. 25, makes another start Monday in the Vieille Vigne Handicap.

ON THE RECORD: THE SKILLFUL, DURABLE SCHREIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert Glass, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the games we in this business play is to make little lists of favorite 
record ings -- desert-island discs for a well-equipped last resort -- that have 
not as yet turned up on CD and may never, we like to think, so we can both 
grumble and feed our nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this favorite recording, often resorted to in darkest hours: a 
collection of the hugely underrated songs of Felix Mendelssohn in the 
ever-fresh interpretations of tenor Peter Schreier, recorded in 1972 and issued 
then on the Deutsche Grammophon label. 
</P>
<P>
 It unexpectedly arrived on CD recently amid a batch of new releases on the 
Berlin Classics label (BC 1107). What joy! 
</P>
<P>
 Placing the immaculate little silver disc rather than the worn and noisy LP or 
the cassette tape, with its limited range, on the carousel resulted in sheer 
pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 The order of songs had been changed. Big deal. But there were a couple of 
extra songs in the CD version and the piano sound was even more lifelike than 
on the LP, a rare positive side effect of digitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely, some of the tempos were ever so slightly different: not a logical 
concomitant of changing technology. A glance at the printed material showed 
that the pianist's name had changed, too, from Walter Olbertz to Karl Engel. An 
even less likely result of a change in format. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, you smart-bottoms: It was a new recording by the same singer and a 
different, at least equally skilled, pianist. This was Peter Schreier 20 years 
later, as effortless in delivery, as sweet and pressureless in tone, as 
attentive to verbal nuances as ever: by no means common occurrences in our age 
of premature vocal burnout. 
</P>
<P>
 Schreier -- a misnomer if ever there was one, the German word translating into 
the English screamer -- recorded these two-dozen gems in Cologne a year ago, 
aged 58, with voice and instincts virtually indistinguishable from the young 
but artistically mature artist of 37. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs that make up the core of Mendelssohn's song output, and rank among 
the simplest and most sublime pleasures the German art-song has to offer, are 
of course here: "Schilflied," "Der Mond," "Gruss," "Venezianisches Gondellied," 
"Neue Liebe," "Hexenlied and "Auf Flugeln des Gesanges." And there isn't a dud 
among the considerable remainder, nor a performance by Schreier that doesn't 
penetrate to the essence of score and text. The wonder of it, now as then, is 
that the singer hardly seems to be working at all. Everything just flows, but 
never merely with surface-skimming graciousness. Engel's accompaniments are 
similarly models of gentle assertiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Schreier seems ageless, the result above all of never forcing his light, 
lyric instrument into repertory to which it isn't naturally suited. He remains 
an incomparable recitalist and a master of 18th-Century sacred music and opera, 
with only rare incursions into later, but still barely heavier material. 
</P>
<P>
 T he astonishing durability of Schreier's instrument is fur ther evidenced in 
a new recording of Schubert's "Winterreise" cycle (London 436 122). 
</P>
<P>
 Schreier, in his previous recording (for Philips) of "Winterreise" in which, 
as in the present instance, all the songs are sung in their original -- high -- 
keys, had to contend with the formidably aloof pianistic presence of Sviatoslav 
Richter. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, the pianist is Andras Schiff, a much better listener. He 
forges with Schreier's lovesick wanderer a powerfully communicative, moving 
union. The dominant personality that emerges is Schubert's. 
</P>
<P>
 We are further in Berlin Classics' debt for reissuing -- these really are the 
Schreier originals from the 1970s -- four volumes of lieder by Robert Schumann, 
including the major song cycles and a few dozen individual treasures to texts 
of Heine, Lenau, Ruckert, Eichendorff and Hans Christian Andersen. Norman 
Shetler is the sympathetic, resourceful pianist throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 Just try "Meine Rose" (on BC 2113) or "Die Lotosblume" (BC 2110) and you're 
likely to be hooked. Schreier's performances are heartbreakingly lovely. 
</P>
<P>
 Now please, Berlin Classics, give us also Schreier's 1970s Schubert, and for 
once with English translations of the German texts. These are, after all, 
full-priced CDs.*

POP EYE: STREISAND, PURE AND UNSWEETENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You might not be surprised by what you hear on Barbra Streisand's upcoming 
live two-CD set, "Barbra: The Concert." After all, the recent tour that it 
documents is one of the most publicized pop treks ever -- not to mention one of 
the highest-grossing. 
</P>
<P>
 But you might be surprised by what you don't hear: overdubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the performances are as they happened," says Jay Landers, who co-produced 
the album with Streisand.  
</P>
<P>
 It's always been standard for so-called "live" albums to be, um, improved in 
the studio, and Streisand is one of show biz's most notorious perfectionists. 
Her manager, Marty Erlichman, says that she was still fiddling with her recent 
HBO special an hour before it was telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing with Barbra is ever just handed in," Erlichman says. "On these 
recordings there were 64 musicians and it takes a lot of mixing and editing to 
make it really sound live." 
</P>
<P>
 But Landers says that it was Streisand's very perfectionism in planning and 
performing the concerts that made overdubs unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, in this particular situation it was sort of a matter of being 
able to choose -- and I don't want to sound too effusive -- be tween great and 
greater performances of particular songs," Landers says. "We spent a 
considerable amount of time listening and relistening to all the shows we 
recorded." 
</P>
<P>
 The album, which will be in stores Sept. 27 and will sell for about $30 in CD, 
was compiled from four shows at New York's Madison Square Garden, with a bonus 
of a Disney medley ("Once Upon a Dream," "When You Wish Upon a Star" and 
"Someday My Prince Will Come") that Streisand only performed in Las Vegas. A 
"companion" home video being released the same day is identical to the HBO 
special, documenting the Anaheim Pond concert that closed the tour. The 
exception is that videos sold at Blockbuster video and music stores will have 
an extra song: "What Are You Doing for the Rest of Your Life?" 
</P>
<P>
 The two CDs are presented as Act I and Act II of the show, starting with the 
Marvin Hamlisch-led orchestra's overture and Streisand's opener, "As If We 
Never Said Goodbye" from "Sunset Boulevard." Other selections include "Lover 
Man," "On a Clear Day (You Can See Forever)," "Evergreen," "The Way We Were" 
and a 10-minute medley from "Yentl."  
</P>
<P>
 The album features Streisand's full concert of 27 songs, plus much of the 
monologue material she used to introduce or link the numbers. Several other 
non-musical elements were included to underscore a sense of spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Landers: "One evening the composer Jule Styne, who did 'Funny Girl,' was 
in the audience, front row center, and Barbra dedicated 'People' to him and the 
New York audience went berserk, so we wanted to have that. And on the closing 
night (of the New York run), Barbra's image was projected on the Jumbotron in 
Times Square where there were tens of thousands of people, and Barbra shouted 
out 'Hello, Times Square!' and we wanted to preserve that moment." Steve 
Hochman

 ** 1/2 Gravediggaz, "6 Feet Deep," Gee Street/Island. This New York foursome 
is much like Onyx, whose frenetic, testosterone-laden rap breathed new life 
into the genre in '92. "6 Feet Deep" is less explosive than Onyx's album but 
exceptions include such grim raps as "1-800-Suicide" and "Diary of a Madman," 
which push hard-core into an entirely new realm -- call it gore-core. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 *** Jim Lauderdale, "Pretty Close to the Truth," Atlantic. The L.A.-based 
singer's second album is intriguingly enigmatic, much more so than his 
instantly accessible '91 solo debut.Lyrically, this one sides more with poetic 
folk probing than heart-on-sleeve country emotionalism. As he sings in the 
title tune: "I believe in the long, long trail of clues that after a while lead 
pretty close to the truth." Accurately put.

 *** 1/2; ERIC CLAPTON, "From the Cradle" ( Duck/Reprise ) 
</P>
<P>
 There's gold in them thar roots, as Clapton discovered when his blues-steeped 
"Unplugged" album sold more than 14 million copies worldwide and triggered his 
big night at the Grammys in '92. 
</P>
<P>
 But this superior follow-up is no cynical, plugged-in sequel.You can't even 
dismiss it as a middle-aged rocker's fashionable return to the music of his 
lost youth. As he moves through 16 nuggets from Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters and 
other icons, Clapton is simply too comfortable, too alive within the electric 
blues medium for anyone to mistake this for a mere visit for sentimental 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Clapton recognizes that the blues is foremost a form of storytelling, and he 
succeeds at almost every turn in embodying characters who express sincere 
regret, ironic mirth or full-on rage as the moment requires. There is potential 
pop appeal in an acoustic reading of "Motherless Child," while the solo on 
"Groaning the Blues" qualifies the erstwhile guitar god as an archangel, at 
least. After too many mediocre albums over the past decade, the only 
disappointment is that Clapton didn't do this sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

RECORD RACK: TWO SIDES OF SINEAD IN 'UNIVERSAL MOTHER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Willman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ** 1/2; SINEAD O'CONNOR, "Universal Mother" ( Chrysalis ) 
</P>
<P>
 When O'Connor released her last album of original material, 1990's "I Do Not 
Want What I Haven't Got," her breathy tirades and tear-stained broadsides had 
such a harrowing combination of anger and pathos that she almost seemed to be 
refiguring the whole confessional genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she really has reinvented it -- unfortunately, not in music but in 
the world-media confessional, where each new statement about child abuse and 
Catholicism or revelation of suicide attempts and substance abuse finally 
battered even her believers into concluding that some disturbances are best 
dealt with in therapy, not art. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other reasons to dread "Universal Mother" more than anticipate it: 
the fact that the new album opens with a brief speech excerpt from author 
Germaine Greer suggesting that men are at the root of all society's ills, or 
the telling inclusion of Kurt Cobain's "All Apologies," a churlish, benignly 
defiant non-apology if ever there were one. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor is still playing a game of defense, still finding blame almost 
everywhere but in her own heart. And yet the album is far more tender and less 
accusatorythan anyone might have imagined. The matriarchy-deifying tone in 
several songs might be a bit much for non-womyn, but the concern of a mother 
and the ache of a neglected child are both essayed with more emotion than 
sensationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 At times -- as in "A Perfect Indian," she's so heartbreakingly spot-on and 
surprisingly wise in her song craft that she lets you see through the 
childishness to the child, no small feat at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 At other times, she's the Sinead so many love to hate, as with "Famine," a 
political treatise claiming that the English invented the Irish famine that's 
done as, ulp, a brogue-accented rap number. Overall, though, this mostly quiet, 
mostly understated album offers reason to believe that O'Connor will emerge 
from her turmoils as a mature recording artist, not the self-obsessed 
agitpropper TV viewers and magazine readers have known and feared. Chris 
Willman

 ** 1/2; VARIOUS ARTISTS, "Red Hot + Country" ( Mercury ) 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth entry in the "Red Hot" series of AIDS benefit albums is a sort of 
square-dance mosh pit, with a colliding cast of commercial hotshots (Billy Ray 
Cyrus, Brooks & Dunn), all-timers (Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton), cult figures 
(Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Nanci Griffith) and sub-cult names (Wilco, the successor 
of the admired indie duo Uncle Tupelo). 
</P>
<P>
 While inconsistent, the album keeps coming through with memorable moments, 
such as Gilmore's outing with Willie Nelson on the latter's "Crazy," and Carl 
Perkins' collaboration with the Mavericks and Duane Eddy on a rambunctious 
"Matchbox." The most notable comments on AIDS: Project spearhead Kathy Mattea's 
duet with Jackson Browne on his "Rock Me on the Water," and Mary Chapin 
Carpenter's reading of John Jennings' "Willie Short." Richard Cromelin

 ** David Gates, "Love Is Always Seventeen," Discovery. The former Bread head 
is now a cattle rancher, hence the mild country-pop slant to his first album 
since 1980.Hummable melodies still come to Gates as easily as in the '70s; his 
lyrics remain simplistically romantic, as the title suggests. As with Bread, 
Gates' music is more Wonder than manna.

 *** 1/2; THE JESUS AND MARY CHAIN, "Stoned & Dethroned" ( American ) 
</P>
<P>
 The Jesus and Mary Chain has dropped the feedback and distortion, the grinding 
and the clattering, from its sound. That certainly gets your attention, the way 
the sudden silencing of a passing airplane would get your attention. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as if the Reid brothers have removed a screen that through five albums 
obscured the scope of the despair behind their music. These outpourings of 
self-loathing, desperation and defeat are delivered with a blues-like economy 
and in a musical setting whose intimacy lures the listener right into their 
withered heart. 
</P>
<P>
 There are exceptions to the prevailing mood, most notably "Sometimes Always," 
an oddly charming exchange in which Jim Reid and Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval 
emerge as the Sonny & Cher of the Prozac generation. 
</P>
<P>
 The album's mainly acoustic, folk-pop music moves the Reids' unflinching 
sentiments along at a purposeful stride and retains the emotional tug and 
soaring majesty the band has trademarked. Desolation hasn't sounded this 
beautiful since Joy Division prowled the soul's darkest corners. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 MORE STREISAND?: Erlichman and Landers both say that the tour, Streisand's 
first in nearly three decades, "reconnected" the star with her audience. But 
they say that she seems set on sticking to her vow never to tour again. 
</P>
<P>
 Erlichman acknowledged that he did get a h-u-g-e offer for shows in Japan, but 
turned them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand is now shifting gears back to the movie world, doing pre-production 
work for two films she plans to direct and co-star in: "The Normal Heart" for 
Columbia Pictures and "The Mirror Has Two Faces" for TriStar. And there's also 
more music on the horizon for her. Landers says that he and Streisand have been 
discussing several potential concepts for her next album. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to wait to see which one she chooses to pursue," he says. Steve 
Hochman

 DRUM JAM: Drummer Dave Abbruzzese's exit from Pearl Jam renewed rumors that 
Nirvana's Dave Grohl would join the band. A computer on-line posting attributed 
to Courtney Love last Sunday even said it was a fact and, in her typically 
strong language, lambasted Grohl for the move to the rival Seattle band. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pearl Jam manager Kelly Curtis insists that it's not true. "I don't think 
the band's even talked to Grohl about the opening," he says. "They're in no 
hurry. They're going to jam around with some friends for now and see what 
happens, and no, they're not doing auditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbruzzese did all the drumming on the "Vitalogy" album, which is due next 
month, and no replacement will be needed for the band's only scheduled concert 
appearance -- Neil Young's Bridge School benefit on Oct. 1 at the Shoreline 
Amphitheatre in Mountain View. It's an all-acoustic show. Steve Hochman

 The semi-Zeppelin reunion of Jimmy Page and Robert Plant for the MTV 
"Unledded" special and companion album will include not only material from 
their past recorded at two recent London TV studio performances, but two new 
songs taped in Morocco and radical reworkings of "Nobody's Fault but Mine and 
"When the Levee Breaks" recorded in Wales. The MTV show debuts Oct. 12 and the 
album, titled "No Quarter -- Jimmy Page & Robert Plant -- Unledded," is due in 
stores Nov. 8. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dre's past has been collected -- without the rapper-producer's 
participation -- on "Concrete Roots," an anthology that runs from mid-'80s 
sessions when he was a member of the World Class Wreckin' Cru' to late-'80s 
work with N.W.A. Also featured are Dre productions for the D.O.C. and 
Michel'le. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dead Can Dance is set to release a live CD and film, both titled "Toward the 
Within," on Oct. 25. The music was recorded last year at the Mayfair Theatre in 
Santa Monica, with interview segments also added for the film, which will be 
screened Sept. 27, 29 and 30 at the Center Green Theatre as part of 4AD 
Records' "All Virgos Are Mad" festival. The festival also features performances 
by such 4AD acts as Throwing Muses, Kristin Hersh, Kendra Smith and His Name Is 
Alive at McCabe's (acoustic) and the Troubadour (electric). 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled for November is the latest from rapper Too Short, who, judging by 
the title (which we are unable to print), is still trading in raunchy sexual 
boasts. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pre-punk alternative-pop legend Big Star is set to make its first-ever L.A. 
appearance at the House of Blues on Nov. 1, following a homecoming show in 
Memphis on Oct. 29 and a performance on the "Tonight Show" on Oct. 30 -- making 
up for a date that was canceled in June due to band illness. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Rhino Records has acquired all of Robyn Hitchcock's pre-A&M solo catalogue, 
and will begin releasing it with three albums in November. "You and Oblivion," 
a collection of rarities and unreleased tracks, is also planned. . . . Matthew 
Sweet will begin working this month in Atlanta with producer Brendan O'Brien, 
best known for his work with Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots. The album is 
due in February.

 BRIDGING THE GAP: The Bridge benefit, the eighth annual affair organized by 
Young to support the school for physically challenged and severely 
speech-impaired children, will also feature Tom Petty, Mazzy Star and the 
Indigo Girls. 
</P>
<P>
 But the presence of Young and Pearl Jam gives it extra significance since 
Young has said he won't tour this year due to the intensely personal nature of 
his new "Sleeps With Angels" album, and Pearl Jam has been not scheduled a tour 
because of its feud with Ticketmaster over surcharges. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the show go on sale today through the Bay Area-based BASS firm, 
which does add a surcharge to the $25 tickets (a $3.65 or $3.75 surcharge if 
bought at BASS outlets, a $4.50 surcharge for phone orders). But Sherry 
Wasserman, vice president of promoter Bill Graham Presents, which is producing 
the concert, says the tickets are available at face value at the box office. 
Southern Californians who want tickets can order them through BASS' phone 
service at (510) 762-2277. Steve Hochman

 LONDON REPORT: Former Sugarcubes singer Bjork is not only set to release an 
"MTV Unplugged" album in November, but is lining up collaborations for her next 
studio album. Among those set to work with the Icelandic singer, who teamed 
with former Soul II Soul member Nelle Hooper on last year's "Debut," are Graham 
Massey of the techno-dance group 808 State, London-based avant-garde ambient 
trio Black Dog and the classical percussionist and harpist who appeared on the 
"Unplugged" session. 
</P>
<P>
 Most tantalizing are hints from Bjork that she may hook up with Polly Jean 
Harvey, with whom she dueted on "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" at this year's 
Brit Awards ceremony. "We've been flirting around the idea a lot in our 
postcards to each other," Bjork said after a recent invitation-only screening 
of her new long-form video, "Vessel." 
</P>
<P>
 Bjork also said that she turned down an offer of a role in "Tank Girl," an 
upcoming feature film based on the cult British cartoon strip. Among those who 
will be appearing in the movie is Ice-T, who is to play the anarchic title 
heroine's "boyfriend" -- a kangaroo named Booga. Dave Jennings, from London

 ** 1/2; VARIOUS ARTISTS, "If I Were a Carpenter" ( A&M ) 
</P>
<P>
 Earnest, guileless affection for these songs provides a thread through 
performances of Carpenters hits by artists as disparate as Sonic Youth, 
Cracker, 4 Non Blondes and Sheryl Crow. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonic Youth's postmodern pop-culture irony is perfect for "Superstar," Redd 
Kross' un-ironic love for '70s kitsch fills "Yesterday Once More" with heart, 
and the Cranberries' Dolores O'Riordan's Irish pronunciations renew the 
love-struck innocence of "Close to You." 
</P>
<P>
 And nearly all the tracks revel in the Carpenters' undeniable song-craft -- 
save for Babes in Toyland's flat "Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft," 
an obscure, Klaatu-originated number that was just a Carpenters novelty to 
begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this all comes up just short of the concept's promise in that there aren't 
really any revelations about the songs or performers. Only in Grant Lee 
Buffalo's closing "We've Only Just Begun" -- with sweet Beach Boys-ish vocals 
-- does an act push beyond its own expected approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there may be enough feeling here to turn a new generation on to a body 
of work that has survived some of the strongest ridicule ever in the pop world. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

MIKE PENNER: FOR THE RAMS, RISON'S TALK ISN'T CHEAP

 Andre Rison has guaranteed a victory today over the Rams, which means the game 
film of Steve Israel must have arrived on schedule. Almost as compelling as 
Rison's bold words were the Rams' reactions to them. First, Chuck Knox ordered 
a videotape copy of Rison popping off, intending to use it as motivational 
grist. Then, suspecting Rison probably has a point, the Rams reopened the 
unsightly Darryl Henley file, agreeing to post a $2-million bond so that an 
alleged cocaine-ring kingpin might be able to step in and bolster their nickel 
coverage. (Do the Rams now call it their nickel-bag coverage?) No comment from 
the Rams on whether they'd be posting the same bond for Henley had he happened 
to be a third-string offensive tackle, rather than a Pro Bowl-caliber 
cornerback.

 KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- San Francisco versus The Old 49er is the billing, and all 
of the Bay Area is abuzz over the chance to watch David Whitmore play again. In 
another matchup, Joe Montana and Steve Young will start at quarterback for 
opposing sides, prompting legions of 49er fans to switch allegiance to the 
Chiefs for one day and Jerry Rice to announce he hopes Montana throws him a 
pass during warm-ups. (Amazingly, Rice consented to accept three touchdown 
passes from Young in a 44-14 victory over the Raiders last Monday.) Bay Area 
sports bars are offering complimentary jars of wide receiver's stickum to 
patrons today, so that the Branch Montanians may be able to get a grip.

 LOS ANGELES -- The Raiders play host to the Seattle Seahawks six days after 
losing to San Francisco in a Monday night game advertised as a "Super Bowl 
preview." And, yes, it truly was -- the NFC team beat the AFC team by 30 
points. Last week, Seattle's Chris Warren outrushed all Raider running backs, 
100 yards to 34, partly because Harvey Williams, who couldn't beat out Marcus 
Allen in Kansas City, now can't beat out Ty Montgomery in Los Angeles. Williams 
now plans to join the expansion Jacksonville Jaguars in 1995, on the hope that 
the Jaguars draft no other running backs.

 SAN DIEGO -- Still in shock over their 37-34 victory over the Broncos in 
Denver, the San Diego Chargers fail to show for today's home opener against 
Cincinnati. The Bengals get the ball on their own 20, David Klingler throws 
three incompletions, the Bengals punt and the game ends there.

 MILWAUKEE -- Expecting a high-scoring bombfest against Dan Marino and the 
Miami Dolphins, Green Bay Packer Coach Mike Holmgren has installed a trick play 
for today's game: Sterling Sharpe trots off the field, leaves the stadium, 
contemplates sitting out the season, circles back, streaks down the sideline 
and catches the winning touchdown from Brett Favre.

 EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- The Denver Broncos trail the New York Jets, 37-34, in 
the waning seconds, but the Broncos are threatening. John Elway drops back and 
looks for Shannon Sharpe in the end zone. Unfortunately, Sharpe has a sprained 
knee and is in street clothes. Elway looks and looks and finally gives up, 
tossing the ball straight up in the air. Ronnie Lott intercepts and the Jets 
hang on for a stunning victory.

 FOXBORO, Mass. -- Upstart New England takes on the Super Bowl-Or-Bust Buffalo 
Bills, who, after four years of persistent pleading by football fans from 49 
states and greater New York, have finally agreed to try option B this season. 
Marv Levy's controversial decision to replace the no-huddle offense with the 
no-touchdown offense resulted in a 23-3 loss to the Jets last week, during 
which Thurman Thomas netted seven yards in five carries, causing thousands of 
wives across the country to talk their fantasy football-playing husbands off 
the edge of the roof, begging them to think of the children.

 MINNEAPOLIS -- One week after passing for three touchdowns and becoming the 
first Detroit quarterback to win his debut since Eric Hipple in 1981, Scott 
Mitchell leads the Lions against NFC Central-rival Minnesota. Lions Coach Wayne 
Fontes announces the signing of Andre Ware, the promotion of Chuck Long and 
says he will alternate the three quarterbacks all season, just for old times' 
sake.

 TAMPA -- Indianapolis' Marshall Faulk and Tampa Bay's Errict Rhett face off in

Tampa Bay bench slightly harder than Ram bench.

 NEW ORLEANS -- Five years after leading the Rams to the NFC championship game, 
Jim Everett and Henry Ellard meet again, only in very strange uniforms. Last 
week, Everett passed for 326 yards and two touchdowns for the New Orleans 
Saints and Ellard caught seven passes for 105 yards for the Washingtom 
Redskins. If they had done that last year, they would still be Rams.

MIGHTY DUCKS NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; CORKUM, DOLLAS SEEK MORE MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Corkum and Bobby Dollas were the Mighty Ducks' 2-for-1 bargain last 
season: Two key players whose two salaries combined were less than the $523,000 
NHL average. 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum, who scored 51 points and was the team's best two-way player, made 
$260,000 -- a mere $5,100 for every goal or assist. Dollas, the team's 
defensive backbone, had a plus-minus of 20 -- unheard of on an expansion team 
-- and made $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks knew they'd gotten a good deal and offered to renegotiate at the end 
of the season -- offering more dollars in exchange for longer contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dollars offered are nowhere near what Corkum and Dollas want, and now 
the young franchise has its first real salary grumblings. And though it's not 
necessarily personal, don't think it has nothing to do with the $2.166 million 
Paul Kariya will average or the $1.4 million Oleg Tverdovsky will average per 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard the first offer, I told my agent he shouldn't have called me," 
Dollas said. "He upset me for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Dollas, 29, says he was offered about $375,000 for this season. General 
Manager Jack Ferreira says the most recent offer was $400,000. In any case, 
it's nowhere near the NHL average Dollas thinks he is due. He expects to play 
this season under his old contract, then play hardball before he enters his 
option year next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait another year and then it's payday," he said. "The price gets higher 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The key, of course, is that those players need to duplicate their success -- 
or else they're throwing away money by not taking the offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum, 26, who was offered a deal that would pay him in the neighborhood of 
$400,000 a year, is less disgruntled but still thinks he deserves a better 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess (Ferreira's) ground is I'm a 20-goal scorer, but I've only done it 
once," he said. "I think if I have another good year, then I'll be a two-time 
20-goal scorer, and I should make $600,000 to $700,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira wants it understood that he was under no obligation to renegotiate: 
Both players are under contract for two more seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made an offer and right now they'd like something different," he said. "We 
really haven't discussed it further." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, with labor tensions already high, players are less shy to say what 
they think they deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got me paired with Oleg, wanting me to break him in, when he's making 
five or six times what I'm making," Dollas said. "He's probably going to make 
mistakes that I'll have to cover up for, and every two weeks he'll be looking 
at his pay check and looking down at me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One player who isn't disappointed in his contract is defenseman Don McSween. 
This time last year he expected to make $75,000 playing for San Diego in the 
International Hockey League and figured he might have had his last chance at 
making the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he has signed a three-year contract that will pay him $300,000 this year 
if he appears in at least 30 NHL games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy to be playing," said McSween, 30, who turned what he expected 
to be a short-term injury call-up into a regular spot on the roster last 
season. "Getting paid to play hockey is a pretty good life." 
</P>

 Darren Van Impe, a minor league defenseman recently acquired from the New York 
Islanders, is neither the son nor nephew of Ed Van Impe, who played on two 
Stanley Cup teams with the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1970s. "Dad's cousin," 
Van Impe said. "People ask all the time."

1994 PREP PREVIEW / GIRLS' CROSS-COUNTRY; IRVINE'S CORBIN JUST WANTS TO HAVE 
FUN WHEN SHE RUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starring in two sports is not unusual, but Jessica Corbin's combination is. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, she helped lead the Irvine cross-country team to the State Division 
I championship. In the spring, she played on the Vaqueros' softball team, which 
shared the Sea View League title and reached the second round of the Southern 
Section Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 A unique combination indeed, especially considering the number of training 
miles put in by most successful distance runners in the off-season. But Corbin 
has chosen to take her time, accepting successes one at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a real fear of burning out," said Corbin, the county's fastest 
sophomore girl cross-country runner last year. "I don't want to lose the fun in 
running. I see a lot of girls who take it too seriously and it just brought 
them down in the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Rossi, coach at Irvine, said of Corbin: "She's really adamant that she 
has to enjoy running, and because of the kind of kid she is, I have to respect 
that. The worst thing I could ever do is pressure her into anything." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rossi said he hasn't always practiced what he preaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the softball coaches when she was a freshman and told them, 'I 
don't want to influence you, but if she is no good, will you please just cut 
her?' " Rossi said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Irvine's softball coaches saw in Corbin the same diamond in the rough 
Rossi witnessed during cross-country season. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin's rise to prominence on the Irvine campus began when she was a freshman 
in the Woodbridge Invitational, her first high school race. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin gave spectators a preview of things to come through the race's first 
mile as she ran with with the leaders. But then she began to fade badly, and 
finally paramedics in attendance asked her to stop at the two-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
 During that season, she fluctuated between being the Vaqueros' third or fifth 
runner, eventually helping Irvine to a surprising runner-up finish at the State 
Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of her freshman year, she started for the junior varsity 
softball team, playing mostly center field. 
</P>
<P>
 So far in her high school career, her success on cross-country paths has 
overshadowed her softball prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sophomore, Corbin saved her best run for last by finishing third at 
Fresno's Woodward Park and leading the Vaqueros to the State Division I title. 
Irvine edged national powerhouses Palos Verdes Peninsula and Agoura in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin's season ended at the State meet, though. She decided against racing 
the same 3.1-mile course at the next week's Foot Locker Western Regional 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just flat out told me 'I don't want to run without my teammates,' " Rossi 
said. "How can I not respect that? I think it is a very admirable thing." 
</P>
<P>
 That mature attitude has helped Corbin blossom into one of the county's 
leading runners. 
</P>
<P>
 Her emergence can be marked to one race last season: the Sea View League 
finals at Irvine Regional Park. Going into the competition "not really having a 
plan," Corbin said, she just stayed with the leaders in the early going. 
</P>
<P>
 She took off in the middle of the race, eventually winning in 17 minutes 5 
seconds 34 seconds ahead of runner-up Amy Gomez of Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "She made it look effortless," Rossi said. "Although that's never the case 
when you run that fast." 
</P>
<P>
 After that race Rossi noticed that his leading runner had undergone a major 
change. Corbin went on to finish second in the Southern Section Division I-A 
race and third at State. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leap forward that I saw at that point last year was mental," Rossi said. 
"She went into races very confident with goals rather than expectations, and 
responded in every way." 
</P>
<P>
 Corbin has surrounded herself with success. In addition to what Rossi calls 
"very supportive parents," Corbin's older brother Ryan was a basketball and 
baseball standout at Irvine. Her grandfather is entertainer Pat Boone. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's definitely a people person," Rossi said. "She is just very good around 
others. When she finds her passion, whatever it may be, she will stand out at 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rossi can only hope that passion has something to do with running. Girls'

<P>
 Notes: Just when Edison thought it would catch a break with Ocean View moving 
to the Golden West League, Esperanza and Los Alamitos move in, keeping the 
Sunset League race an interesting one. . . . South county powers Trabuco Hills 
and El Toro have an abundance of talent and will be a factor by season's end, 
and Tustin returns a number of runners.

SALSA TO PLAY SOUNDERS IN FINAL TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The top two teams and the leading four goal scorers in the American 
Professional Soccer League will be at Titan Field today when the Salsa takes on 
the Seattle Sounders at 6:05 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa's Paulinho leads the league in scoring with 23 points (10 goals and 
three assists) with three weeks remaining in the regular season. His teammate, 
Paul Wright, and Sounder players Jason Dunn and Chance Fry also are contending 
for the scoring championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulinho won the scoring title and was the APSL most valuable player last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the third meeting between the two teams this season. The Salsa 
won at home, 2-1, in July, but the Sounders won by the same score Aug. 27 in 
the Tacoma Dome. The Salsa is 9-7 for the season, and has won five of its last 
seven games. Seattle was 10-6 after a 3-2 loss in overtime Friday to Ft. 
Lauderdale.

RETURNING TO TRADE; COMMERCE: VIETNAMESE EMIGRANTS ARE RETURNING TO THEIR 
HOMELAND AS EXPECTANT CAPITALISTS -- AND FINDING BOTH OPPORTUNITY AND 
FRUSTRATION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In District 3, just north of the center of town, an upscale boutique stands 
out among the battered stores, sidewalk bicycle repairmen and pushcart vendors 
selling noodles with pungent-smelling meats and sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 Squeaky-clean windows and doors give way to freshly painted walls, racks of 
silk and linen dresses and a row of wooden dressing rooms. The sign atop the 
store, one of three in the former Saigon owned by a pair of 33-year-old 
Americans, reads "Dung/Joyce U.S.A Fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners Tony Vuong, a women's clothing designer with outlets in Orange and Los 
Angeles counties, and Danny Trinh, a former resident of Alhambra who has moved 
to Ho Chi Minh City, are among a vanguard of emigres leading a drive by U.S. 
business to take advantage of the new freedom to trade and invest in Vietnam. 
They opened the store in February, the same month President Clinton lifted the 
nearly 20-year-old ban on commerce with America's wartime foe. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, Vietnam -- which has been trying since 1986 to re-enter world 
markets after years of isolation -- is the latest business frontier. It seems 
to offer limitless opportunities, not to mention low labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever a communist country opens up, its economy can only go up year after 
year," Vuong said here recently. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, international trade and investment in Vietnam -- where foreign 
employers are required to offer a minimum wage of just $35 a month -- is 
expected to total about $9 billion, according to Virginia Foote, president of 
the United States-Vietnam Trade Council in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But while some U.S. businesses -- among them many small businesses owned by 
Vietnamese Americans -- welcome the chance to catch up with competitors who 
haven't been kept out of Vietnam by economic embargoes, most are still 
cautious. The ban, they note, was lifted only seven months ago, so many firms 
are still researching opportunities in this nation of 70 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Business people also warn that commerce in Vietnam can be a nightmare of 
frustrating bureaucracy, incompetent or greedy officials and uncertain business 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a country has been closed for 20 years like this, there has to be a time 
in between with lots of problems before it gets better," Vuong said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no business court you can go to to if contracts are broken. It takes 
forever to get licenses to do anything, and corruption here is worse than 
ever," said the designer, who owns Cerlini boutiques in Westminster's Little 
Saigon and in Alhambra. "But we're here because we're looking to the future in 
this market." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Foote, between February and early July, 15 projects with a total 
value of $141.9 million had been awarded to U.S. companies -- big ones such as 
Coca-Cola Co. and smaller ones such as Dung/Joyce. 
</P>
<P>
 That placed the United States 15th among nations doing business with Vietnam, 
but the ranking should rise soon, analysts say, because hundreds of Americans 
are now in Vietnam closing deals or developing relationships with entrepreneurs 
and investors. 
</P>
<P>
 A good example is American Rice Inc., a subsidiary of Los Angeles-based Erly 
Industries Inc., which recently set up a joint venture with Vietnam's ministry 
of agricuture to begin producing rice for export to the U.S. and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's first shipment of rice to the United States left Vietnam in 
April, said Richard McCombs, American Rice's chief financial officer, and the 
company hopes that is only the beginning. Vietnam's cheap labor and other low 
costs attracted his company's interest, he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The arrival of foreign capital is good news to Vietnamese government 
officials, who estimate that more than $40 billion will be needed through 2000 
to keep their nation's economy growing at 8% to 10% a year. (Economic expansion 
was 8.3% in 1992, according to the General Statistics Office.) 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism and exports -- of crude oil, rice, seafood, coffee, coal and rubber -- 
helped to feed that rise, but the nation is dependent on imported fuel, 
construction equipment, cars and fertilizers, as well as consumer goods such as 
clothing and computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we need everything, because we're starting from the bottom," said 
Tran Thien Cuong, speaking for the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Hanoi readily acknowledge the difficulties of doing business in 
their country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still new at this, so we're making up laws to fit our uses as we go 
along, and that can be inconvenient for Americans, we know," Cuong said. 
"Americans like everything to be clearly defined: Water is water; fire is fire. 
But this is the time when fortunes are made. After the rules are written 
clearly, the big opportunities will be gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides trying to straighten out commercial law, officials are trying to clean 
up extortion and other improprieties among government administrators and 
employees, he said. Violators include license regulators, police officers and 
airport customs clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corruption is our biggest misfortune. The hard economic times have created 
this very ugly industry, but we're determined to solve this problem," Cuong 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the crackdown on illegal business practices actually hurt a deal 
that another Vietnamese American was developing. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Phong Tran, the 29-year-old president of Tymes International Inc., 
a Westminster investment company, was to sign a contract in April to import 
clothing made by Legamax, a major Vietnamese garment maker with plants in Hanoi 
and Ho Chi Minh City. The company is partly owned by the Hanoi government. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days after Tran arrived in Ho Chi Minh City, however, federal 
officials fired Legamax's chairwoman. An audit of the company's books accused 
her of applying for too many loans from international banks, according to the 
Vietnam Investment Review newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials put off Tran's negotiations indefinitely as they conducted further 
audits of the management of the 8,000-employee company. Since then, the 
government has replaced most of the firm's executives, Tran said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be very unpredictable here," he said. "That's the risk you take." 
</P>
<P>
 Though not yet 30, Tran is a seasoned businessman who has been working on 
deals here since the late 1980s. His father and older brother brought him along 
on business trips to Vietnam, then helped him start his own company. On his 
own, he scouted investment opportunities and waited for the United States to 
lift the trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Legamax deal fell through, Tran used the time to set up a branch 
office. He also met with potential Vietnamese partners in the banking, seafood 
and travel industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran, who left Saigon at 13 and later graduated from UCLA, typifies the young 
Vietnamese American business professionals who have few memories of their 
birthplace but are now visiting it several times a year to wheel and deal. 
</P>
<P>
 They can be seen riding around the major cities of Vietnam in hired cars or 
zipping around on Honda motorbikes. They are never without cellular phones. 
Some, like Tran, spend several weeks on each trip; others stay for long-term 
assignments as corporate managers.  
</P>
<P>
 Ideologically, they are distant from many of their expatriated elders, who 
frown on renewed ties with the Communist regime that forced 2 million 
Vietnamese into exile with the fall of South Vietnam in 1975. Nearly half the 
emigres now live in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the past was horrible, but it's still the past," Tran said. "We, the 
young people, are trying to go on. We are the future, and we're trying to work 
for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Each time he lands at Tan Son Nhut Airport in Ho Chi Minh City, Tran said, he 
still feels angry that his native land is so poor compared to many of its Asian 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get upset when I see foreign businessmen in Vietnam making fun of our 
people or the lack of conveniences," Tran said. "I ask myself why it has to be 
that way. I want to help Vietnam improve. I want to create jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 About 3% of the 70 million people of Vietnam are jobless, according to Cuong, 
the official with Vietnam's commerce group. The average annual income of a 
Vietnamese worker is about $300, but that figure belies the true buying power 
of Vietnamese citizens: Hundreds of thousands of families here receive money 
from relatives and friends living abroad. Their annual contribution is 
estimated at $500 million or more, Cuong said. 
</P>
<P>
 But consumers have few choices. That's where Vuong and Trinh see opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 On a visit last year to Ho Chi Minh City, they said, they noticed women from 
abroad coming to Vietnam to work, more foreign companies hiring local women and 
more local women opening their own businesses. Yet there were few shops 
offering professional dress suits for women. 
</P>
<P>
 After conducting interviews, the partners estimated that about 5% of Ho Chi 
Minh City's 4 million to 5 million residents were adult women able to afford 
designer clothes. They opened their first boutique in Ho Chi Minh City in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 Their hunch proved correct, and customers scooped up $80 suits and $100 
dresses -- prices comparable to those in the United States. So Vuong and Trinh 
opened two more shops in Ho Chi Minh City. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at a small percentage of the city's women, the customer base "is still 
more than the same target market in Orange County, where there are only about 
100,000 Vietnamese," Trinh said. "We're ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the original Dung/Joyce boutique in District 3, where the partners 
have their headquarters in an upstairs office, the searing afternoon heat was 
pierced by the sounds of roaring motorbikes, scooters and cars. But the 
air-conditioned shop was comfortable and the city noises could barely be heard 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Dang Thi Minh Ngan, a 21-year-old saleswoman, said customers realize that they 
need to catch up with international fashions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The newer the styles, the more they like and buy," she said, standing among 
the business suits and dresses. "We actually teach them how to dress." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the color black -- which had been considered impractical for the warm 
climate here and unfashionable because it is associated with death in 
Vietnamese culture -- is starting to come into vogue, Ngan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Explained Trinh: "We tell them it's sophisticated and that it's very popular 
in the West." 
</P>
<P>
 The partners plan to open their own clothing manufacturing plant in Ho Chi 
Minh City by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows? Maybe after that, we open a store in Hanoi," Vuong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another consumer product in short supply in Vietnam is computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vietnam is starting from ground zero," said David J. Drinkard, a 
representative for Maynard, Mass.-based Digital Equipment Corp. "And as its 
market takes off, it will help (Digital) worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
 Digital executives have hired eight Vietnamese salespeople to promote their 
products, opened an office in Hanoi and want to open another in Ho Chi Minh 
City, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Drinkard said he likes being a pioneer in the nation's computer market, 
he called Vietnam "a hardship post." 
</P>
<P>
 "What could be taken care of anywhere else with a phone call or a fax requires 
a meeting here," said Drinkard, a native of St. Louis. "Things take longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's because of the lack of exposure to international business practices," he 
said. "I do a lot of training here to get people used to the nature of 
business, like marketing and keeping up with new technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese workers are learning quickly and have the reputation of being easy 
to train, Drinkard added. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam's General Statistics Office estimates that the nation's work force 
totals more than 30 million people and that the literacy rate is nearly 90%. 
More than 10,000 Vietnamese have earned doctorates, mostly in social and 
technological subjects, from universities in the former Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 To Jeannie Wey, who represents Vision Air Expedition Inc., a Los Angeles-based 
wholesale broker of airline tickets, the biggest obstruction to doing business 
in Vietnam is the language barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to find somebody good who can speak Vietnamese to work for you, 
someone who has to know the system and which official to go to for what," Wey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She chose Tran of Tymes International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Wey met after his travel agency, a division of the investment firm, 
became one of Vision Air's clients several years ago. Now the two are building 
relationships with Vietnam's two airlines to prepare for the day when, they 
believe, the United States will open direct routes to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's another problem Wey is glad to handle herself: Most of Vietnam's 
investors and traders are men -- and most still aren't used to negotiating with 
professional women. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're usually taken aback by me," she said, smiling. "But I just go ahead 
and stick my hand out. They're still trying to get used to shaking hands with a 
woman." Vietnam's Economy Blooming 
</P>
<P>
 Economic growth in Vietnam is advancing at an impressive rate. In 1985, 
imports and exports were valued at just $1.4 billion. Seven years later, the 
most recent year for which information is available, the comparable figure was 
$5 billion. As American investment increases, growth will doubtless accelerate. 
Import-Export Trend 
</P>
<P>
 The value of Vietnam's exports increased almost 400% between 1985 and 1992, 
nearly matching the value of all imports. Amounts in millions of dollars: 
</P>
<P>
 Imports (1992): $2,535 
</P>
<P>
 Exports (1992): $2,475 Petroleum's Place 
</P>
<P>
 Petroleum figures prominently in Vietnamese trade. Refined petroleum products 
ranked as the second-largest group of imports in 1992, while crude oil had by 
far the largest share of total exports: 
</P>
<P>
 Imports: 
</P>
<P>
 Capital goods*: 37% 
</P>
<P>

 Taiwanese interests were the top investors in Vietnam for the period 1987 
through July, 1994. U.S. investors rank behind those in 14 other nations, 
having faced a trade embargo until February. Top foreign investments by

</P>
<P>
 Some unresolved issues and steps in U.S.-Vietnamese trade that will be 
addressed or completed in the near future: 
</P>
<P>
 Liaison offices: The two governments are expected to open political liaison 
offices in Hanoi and Washington by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomatic relations: Though trade has been resumed, the United States has yet 
to fully normalize diplomatic relations with Vietnam. This step hinges on 
Hanoi's cooperation on the MIA--POW issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Government investment: Although U.S. firms are free to invest in Vietnam, 
government-funded investments are not yet allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade status: The Vietnam government will seek most-favored nation status with 
the United States.

JAMES FLANIGAN: WHY THE LATEST INFLATION FIGURES ARE A PAPER TIGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 News was bad on the inflation front Friday morning. The Labor Department said 
wholesale prices of raw materials -- wheat for bread, oil for gasoline, lumber 
for houses, newsprint for the newspaper you hold in your hand -- posted a sharp 
rise in August. Stock and bond markets trembled at the prospect of higher 
inflation and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates once again to slow the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing will happen immediately. The Fed will watch such wholesale figures -- 
Friday's numbers indicated a 5% to 6% annual inflation rate -- to see if they 
lead to a broad rise in consumer prices and wages, explains economist Daniel 
Sichel of Washington's Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 But what else is new? Markets are always trembling, and Fed officials 
continually ponder inflation barometers. The problem with such news is that it 
really gives you no information at all. 
</P>
<P>
 For understanding, we need to go behind the news -- to note, for example, that 
it was short-term considerations that caused some prices to rise. A big wheat 
sale to Russia pushed up grain prices, but wheat prices are already falling 
back; lumber prices rose on threats of a strike in Canada, then fell on news of 
labor peace. 
</P>
<P>
 And for a deeper understanding, we might look through the prism of the paper 
business, a vast industry of more than $100 billion in revenues spread among 
more than 30 major companies in the United States, which leads the world in 
paper production and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Paper prices, whether linerboard for corrugated boxes or market pulp for 
facial tissues or newsprint, are going up faster than at any time in 50 years. 
Why? Recovery from a four-year depression in which prices fell and paper mills 
closed, for one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The big reason prices are going up right now is added demand from the rapidly 
developing countries of Asia, where millions are reading newspapers and using 
computer printout and fax paper for the first time. Their demand, added to 
traditional business in the strong U.S. economy and recovering Europe and 
Japan, explains why U.S. and Canadian paper plants are operating at 95% of 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 But does that warrant a hike in interest rates that could stall expansion, 
cost jobs and further hike mortgage rates. No, not necessarily. Supplying new 
customers is not inflationary, especially if new plants are built to increase 
production. And new plants are always going up in the paper industry, which 
right now is building recycling plants in response to other pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sawmills, for example, have gotten more efficient at converting timber to 
lumber for housing. "More efficient" means they leave fewer wood chips, the raw 
material for pulp from which paper is made. Also, one company found a way to 
use wood chips for building materials. "Wood fiber has become more expensive 
and harder to get," says analyst Richard Keletas of McLean McCarthy, a Canadian 
investment firm. All this adds up to higher prices for newsprint and other 
paper grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the shift to recycling of old newspaper and office waste paper, which is 
the way all new plants are going to make paper. That's why the old newspapers 
collected at your church or community center have risen in value lately, from 
$10 a ton to $70 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
 Recycling plants are not cheap -- a de-inking machine costs $100 million, and 
a recovery boiler another $100 million. But this is an industry that has always 
spent big, throwing up a dozen $1-billion mills every year even in bad times. 
</P>
<P>
 It is because paper plants are expensive that paper prices go through cycles, 
falling when there is overcapacity and rising when supply and demand come into 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
 What lies ahead now? Repeat of the normal cycle, say analysts. New plants will 
increase supply; economies will slow, reducing demand; prices will fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But a couple of longer term perspectives should be noted. 
</P>
<P>
 One is that paper continues to be in demand, despite the spread of electronic 
media and talk of information highways. Analyst Mark Rogers of Prudential 
Securities reports production of printing paper and many other grades is at 
near-record levels right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Another perspective is that a more permanent increase in demand for paper and 
other raw materials will occur in the late 1990s, says David Shulman, chief 
investment strategist for Salomon Brothers. As Asian and Latin American 
countries reach full development, "that will take demand and production and 
possibly prices onto a higher plane altogether," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if predictions were undeniable facts, that would not be an argument 
for imposing higher interest rates on U.S. business now, as it invests in new 
plant and equipment to be ready for the expanded world economy. The Commerce 
Department last week reported that all U.S. industry is increasing capital 
investment 9.4% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And one should always keep in mind that economies run on human ingenuity, not 
on numbers. The paper industry has seen the likes of Owen Cheatham, who saw 
that Southern pine could be used for paper and lumber as well as Pacific 
Northwest timber. Cheatham, who died in 1970 at age 67, borrowed money, bought 
trees in his native South and built Georgia-Pacific -- and the Southern forest 
products industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Vision sometimes needs timing. Roger Stone, chairman of Stone Container, 
foresaw today's rising use of paper and packaging by developing countries. He 
borrowed billions to make acquisitions of linerboard manufacturers. But he 
plunged in too soon. Chicago-based Stone Container has lost money four years 
running, eaten up by interest on its debts. Still, Roger Stone, 59, may yet see 
his vision fulfilled as packaging grows worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a hot company in the industry right now is Riverwood International, 
an Atlanta-based supplier of printed cardboard cases for soft drinks and beer 
and of the machinery that makes the packages. Riverwood is following Coke and 
Pepsi around the world, supplying the packages as more countries come into the 
supermarket age and customers carry home 12-packs of soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paper is an industry based on brains, not on trees; Brazil has trees, but 
burns them to clear land. Years ago, Harry Merlo, chairman of Louisiana-Pacific 
Corp., developed a way to use wood chips for a particle board that was cheaper 
than plywood. His company has thrived on that development. 
</P>
<P>
 But that use of wood chips and other factors make wood fiber expensive. So the 
paper industry is responding by recycling old newspapers for its raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Such adaptability is why predictions or fears about prices and markets tend to 
be folly -- and why one should always look for the story behind the numbers.

DEALS / ALLAN SLOAN: INSIGHT; PLAN TO REGAIN CONTROL OF BANKRUPT COMPANY IS 
CLASSIC VICTOR POSNER PLOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a financial columnist for Newsday in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victor Posner is proof that you can't keep a bad man down. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's example involves NVF Co., the once-proud plastics and fiber 
manufacturer that staggered into bankruptcy last year after decades of 
plundering by Posner. Now, having gutted NVF, Posner is trying to pervert the 
bankruptcy process to settle NVF's debts at a discount, snatch the company away 
from the creditors who aren't part of his game, and at the same time get an 
ultra-cheap release from a dandy lawsuit NVF's public bondholders filed against 
him in June.  
</P>
<P>
 The suit, a classic, lays out in telling detail how Posner diverted millions 
to himself through excessive salaries and perks, and how he siphoned additional 
millions to support the rest of his now-collapsed empire. Posner, who has a 
huge private fortune, proposes to settle the suit for $4 million, which is a 
joke. "This plan gives Posner the whole upside, and releases him from our claim 
of $180 million or more," said Joanne Wills, the creditors' lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named in the suit is American Financial Corp., run by old-time corporate 
raider Carl Lindner. Profiting from Posner's pain, American Financial and some 
of its executives cut sweet deals for financing Posner. They and Posner would 
own the post-bankruptcy NVF. Think of the Lindnerites as piranhas stripping 
flesh from a drowning man. 
</P>
<P>
 Posner is even trying to use the bankruptcy process to end-run federal 
regulators. This plan would make NVF a private company, freeing Posner to 
control it again. Posner was forced out of NVF, whose stock and bonds are 
publicly traded, because of the marvelous decision last year by U.S. District 
Judge Milton Pollack granting the Securities and Exchange Commission's request 
to bar Posner from influencing any public company. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this plan, there would be no public NVF securities, so Posner could 
retake control. I keep calling it Posner's plan, even though it's being 
submitted by NVF rather than by Posner. Under bankruptcy law, only NVF can file 
a plan as things stand now.  
</P>
<P>
 Pollack was too smart to let me draw him into a conversation about whether 
Posner's converting NVF to a private company from a public company is covered 
by his decision. Pollack referred me to George Heyman Jr., whom he appointed as 
trustee for Posner's stakes in public companies. Heyman, who hasn't been active 
in the NVF bankruptcy, didn't return my call. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Goldsmith, the SEC lawyer who led the charge against Posner, said in an 
interview that Posner's NVF maneuverings aren't covered by Pollack's order as 
long as Posner doesn't control NVF. The fact that Posner's old, handpicked 
board controls NVF doesn't seem to count. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith said if Posner's plan gets the necessary approvals from creditors, 
the SEC, which is a party in the case, will ask the bankruptcy judge to refuse 
to approve the plan because of Posner's long history of financial misdeeds.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wonderful. But likely to be too late. Stopping a bankruptcy reorganization at 
that point is like stepping onto railroad tracks to stop a locomotive. You're 
much more likely to get splattered all over the landscape than to stop the 
train. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan submitted by the Posner-picked NVF board is cleverly drawn. Even 
though the public bondholders, with $60 million of claims, are suing Posner and 
fighting him tooth and nail, the plan is structured so that two 
Lindner-controlled classes, totaling $10 million of secured NVF bonds, can 
force the plan down the public bondholders' throats. It's too complicated to 
explain; just trust me. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would NVF's directors be supporting this outrage -- especially when 
there's an alternative plan that offers everyone but Lindner and Posner a 
better deal? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's because even though Posner is gone, his board remains. Or because 
those board members will be released from the bondholders' lawsuit if Posner's 
plan is approved, but will still be liable if it's not. In any event, the 
company's attorney did not respond to my questions. 
</P>
<P>
 And guess what? According to Mark Feldman, an adviser to NVF's public 
bondholders (and, you should know, a friend of mine), Posner is being 
represented by Donald Glazer, a long-time associate. Feldman says Glazer 
advised NVF early in the bankruptcy, then changed clients. Funny how that 
works. I can't give you Glazer's side, because he wouldn't talk to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to Posner's rival for NVF -- Richard Beltzhoover, an 
Indianapolis insulation salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Beltzhoover, 56, says he's been selling NVF's vulcanized fiber for 24 years, 
the last 20 of them through his company, Insulation Representatives. 
Beltzhoover said he's afraid NVF will go out of business if Posner regains 
control and resumes looting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to put my mouth where my money is," Beltzhoover said in an 
interview. "I'm very interested in keeping this company alive."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite his aw-shucks affectations, Beltzhoover put together an investor 
group, and has just reduced his offer to NVF's bondholders, though it's still 
better than Posner's. In any event, Beltzhoover is way behind in the 
maneuvering, and can't catch up unless Posner's plan is tossed out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's a hearing scheduled this week on whether to release the Posner -- 
oops, NVF -- plan so creditors can vote on it. The plan allows someone to top 
Posner's bid, but the terms are stacked in Posner's favor. Not nice, but 
clever. 
</P>
<P>
 Posner, 76, is said to be still recovering from the ruptured aorta he suffered 
in July. But as NVF shows, whatever ails Posner, it's certainly not a shortage 
of gall.

FROM PEAK IN '93, COUNTRYWIDE COMES UNEASILY BACK TO EARTH; FINANCE: RISING 
MORTGAGE RATES HAVE LED TO LAYOFFS AT THE PASADENA-BASED LENDER, DAMAGING 
MORALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the fall of 1992, when mortgage banker Countrywide Funding set an in-house 
record by closing $3 billion in loans in a single month, management threw a 
lavish party for hundreds of employees at the firm's sparkling headquarters 
building in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the "Everything's Coming Up Roses" reception by its public relations 
department, the occasion was also marked by Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo's 
announcement that the company would be sponsoring its first float in the 
upcoming Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of the party was prophetic. Less than a year later, a refinancing 
boom triggered by falling mortgage rates -- combined with an aggressive staff 
of bonus-driven loan agents who could undercut the competition and build market 
share -- had nearly doubled the company's business for the second time and 
cemented its position as the biggest provider of home loans in the nation. Its 
stock price doubled too. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, the steady run-up in interest rates appears to have knocked the bloom 
off Countrywide's rose. Its loan production has plunged nearly 60% since the 
start of the year and about 30% of its 4,800-member work force -- including 40% 
of its loan staff -- has been fired. The firm's stock, which hit a record $23 a 
share in 1993, now sells for less than $15. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a rude episode that has not only stirred up naysayers on Wall Street 
but has shaken morale at a company whose culture, forged by Mozilo, places a 
high premium on employee loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Mozilo -- a straight-talking Bronx native who started in the business at the 
age of 14, running errands for a Manhattan banking firm -- insists that his 
ambitious plans to begin offering mutual funds and other services to 
Countrywide's 812,000 borrowers will help it weather the downturn in the 
mortgage lending business. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the same Wall Street analysts who were touting the company just a 
year ago aren't so sure. They say that Countrywide -- despite being the largest 
mortgage banker in the country -- could even be swallowed up by another 
financial institution as the industry continues to consolidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The refinancing wave that Countrywide rode to the top has crashed, and now 
the company is being crushed by it," said Jonathan Gray, a Sanford C. Bernstein 
& Co. analyst in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Countrywide is probably the best-run mortgage banker in the country, but 
anybody could have made money (in the business) over the past few years because 
interest rates were dropping," Gray said. "The outlook isn't so great now, 
because rates have gone up. And since Countrywide is so big, it's got the most 
to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Like party-goers nursing a hangover on New Year's Day, mortgage bankers across 
the nation have been suffering from a yearlong rise in interest rates after 
enjoying record profits in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A record 5.3 million homeowners refinanced about $556 billion in loans last 
year to take advantage of the lowest rates in a quarter of a century. Mortgage 
bankers specializing in fixed-rate loans were the biggest beneficiaries of the 
borrowing binge. 
</P>
<P>
 But refinancings dropped to near zero after rates began marching upward this 
spring, while tepid home sales have limited demand for "purchase" loans to buy 
new houses. As a result, the number of mortgage bankers and brokers in the 
country has declined about 5% from a peak of 258,000 last April, according to 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Some say layoffs in the mortgage banking 
industry alone could hit 20% to 40% by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have to let people go, you should just do it and get it over with," 
Mozilo said in a recent interview in his mahogany-drenched office. "There's no 
reason to lie by telling them that everything will be OK, because they know 
when you're lying. It's less painful for everyone if you just get it over with 
quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Such fearless cost cutting makes analysts and shareholders happy. But insiders 
say it has seriously damaged morale among workers who still have jobs at 
Countrywide, a company whose success has been largely attributed to the sense 
of responsibility and "team spirit" that Mozilo and other corporate executives 
have tried to instill. 
</P>
<P>
 Department managers at Countrywide drill some new clerks, who earn about $10 
an hour, to treat every document they touch as if it were a $1,000 bill, 
because that's what it would cost the company to replace, say, a lost grant 
deed. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees who take part in the company-sponsored retirement plan can invest 
their own cash in a variety of mutual funds, but Countrywide's matching 
contribution comes in only one form -- its own stock. "We want our employees to 
feel like they have a stake in the company," Mozilo said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with business down and layoffs rampant, some Countrywide employees 
complain that for Mozilo, loyalty is a one-way street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made more than $50 million in loans for that company over the last few 
years and -- wham! -- I was laid off without a minute's notice," said one 
ex-loan agent who is still looking for work. "They handed me a check for the 
rest of the day's pay and told me to clear out my stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody there is trained to be loyal to Mozilo (and) to Countrywide. Now 
it's become the Jonestown of the business." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, though, workers who have lost their jobs could not have been 
expecting lifetime employment: All employees are required to sign a statement 
in which they acknowledge that mortgage banking is "cyclical" and their jobs 
could be eliminated at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 But while they're there, top-producing Countrywide loan officers can collect 
bonuses making them among the highest-paid in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Countrywide's produce-or-perish corporate image is a direct reflection 
of Mozilo, the streetwise son of an Italian butcher who graduated with degrees 
in marketing and philosophy from Fordham University in 1960 and co-founded 
Countrywide in 1969 after spending more than a decade in banking on the East 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 A tireless worker, Mozilo has always expected his employees to work as hard as 
he does. They are also expected to dress for success; Mozilo himself is fond of 
expensive suits and has even modeled executive wear for magazines. Some 
longtime employees say they have never seen him loosen his tie, and jokingly 
wonder if he's got an Adam's apple. 
</P>
<P>
 As the company grew, so did Mozilo's reputation as an aggressive marketer and 
industry leader. His status as mantle bearer of the business was cemented when 
he was named the 1992 president of the Mortgage Bankers Assn., the industry's 
largest and most influential trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of his predecessors had treated their one-year presidential 
stints with the association as a part-time ceremonial position, Mozilo used the 
post as a bully pulpit to call for changes in federal laws and industrywide 
practices that he felt discouraged lending to the poor and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 As the trade group's chief spokesman, he caustically criticized Jack Kemp -- 
then secretary of Housing and Urban Development -- for scaling back parts of 
the agency's popular FHA loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a lousy secretary. He's the worst person who could have possibly been 
put in that position," Mozilo fumed at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess quarterbacking gave him all the background he needed" to run HUD, 
Mozilo added sarcastically, referring to Kemp's days as a star for the Buffalo 
Bills. "They must have talked about housing a lot in those huddles." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mozilo's term as president of the trade association is over, he 
remains on its board and is still happy to share his views on any issue 
remotely connected to the lending industry. 
</P>
<P>
 He also speaks frankly about the problems his company now faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The refinancing business is dead, and it's not coming back for years," says 
Mozilo. He says he made the layoffs with lightning speed to keep Countrywide 
competitive in a toughening market and to keep earnings from slipping even 
faster. But, he admits, "employee morale in this type of environment stinks." 
</P>
<P>
 Mozilo, who earned more than $3 million in salary and bonuses last year, is 
banking on an array of new services that Countrywide will soon offer to offset 
at least some of the revenue lost by the sharp decline in mortgage lending. 
</P>
<P>
 Countrywide already operates an insurance brokerage unit, and makes money by 
distributing credit cards issued by Bank of New York. It recently opened a 
title insurance and escrow company, and it will start collecting stock 
brokerage fees when it begins offering a family of mutual funds later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is Countrywide's vast pool of existing mortgages that Mozilo and 
analysts alike say is the key to the company's salvation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Countrywide quickly sells off every loan it makes to investors on the 
nation's vast secondary market, those investors also pay the company an ongoing 
"servicing" fee for processing monthly loan payments and handling borrowers' 
complaints. Countrywide collects those fees, month in and month out, until the 
mortgage debt is retired. 
</P>
<P>
 The refinancing boom in 1993 cut sharply into the company's fee income, 
because so many of its outstanding loans were paid off. But now, Countrywide's 
fee income is soaring because the refinancing binge is over and few borrowers 
are paying off their mortgages. A year ago, these fees accounted for a fifth of 
the company's pretax income. In the latest quarter, fee income surged nearly 
threefold and accounted for nearly 60% of pretax income. 
</P>
<P>
 By next year, Mozilo and most analysts say, that higher fee income -- combined 
with the firm's cost-cutting efforts -- will largely offset the decline in 
Countrywide's new-loan production. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doomsayers don't realize how important those servicing fees are," Mozilo 
said. "Those fees are our trump card." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of what may lie ahead for Countrywide and its employees, one thing 
is clear: The company's fate won't hinge on California's fledgling recovery. 
Most of the company's expansion over the last few years has come in other 
states where real estate markets have been hotter and local economies stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 California accounts for only about 35% of Countrywide's business today, down 
from more than 80% in the 1980s. And although many experts say the market here 
is rebounding, Mozilo isn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm perfectly happy with one-third of our business coming from California and 
the rest coming from somewhere else," Mozilo said. "There's no question that 
real estate is a poor investment in California right now." Countrywide's

 Countrywide Funding set a mortgage-banking record when it made more than $5.02 
billion in loans last December, shortly after interest rates had bottomed out. 
But rising rates have pummeled the company this year, cutting its loan volume 
in half. Loans originated in billions of dollars:

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: SOME CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS JUST PLAIN FALSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One challenging aspect to investing is that the ground rules seem to change 
soon after you master them. Just when you think you have the principles and 
theories figured out, somebody comes along and upsets the conventional-wisdom 
apple cart. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems as if studies, surveys and statistics are always coming out to 
question the consensus view on this or that aspect of mutual fund investing. 
Presented below are four conventional-wisdom tidbits that have come under 
recent scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid high-turnover funds. Turnover is the rate at which fund managers buy 
and sell stocks or bonds for their portfolios. A rate of 100% would imply that 
each security is replaced once a year on average, while 200% would indicate the 
entire portfolio gets revamped every six months or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Many financial advisers recommend that investors steer clear of funds with 
turnover rates of 150% to 200% or higher, because such heavy trading activity 
would tend to drive up costs to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Value Line Mutual Fund Survey came to a somewhat different conclusion 
after studying the performance of more than 500 domestic stock portfolios 
during the last five years, with emphasis given to the 1990 bear market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contrary to popular belief, high turnover can be a positive trait in an 
aggressive equity fund," argues the New York publication. One explanation 
suggested by Value Line is that high turnover managers are able to react more 
quickly to changing investment climates. 
</P>
<P>
 But Value Line also found that low turnover managers enjoyed the edge when it 
came to more conservative types of stock funds. (Bond portfolios were not 
studied.) In support of the conventional wisdom, the publication cautioned 
investors to view turnover as a secondary rather than primary consideration 
when choosing among mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * The rush of bank customers and other novice investors into mutual funds will 
destabilize the financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 This notion has become widespread recently in the wake of the fund industry's 
rapid growth. Particularly worrisome was a January report from the North 
American Securities Administrators Assn. and the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons that found that the "vast majority" of bank customers fail to realize 
that mutual funds sold at banks do not carry federal insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Donald P. Morgan, senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas 
City, has found little evidence to suggest that the markets have become more 
volatile, even with a larger mutual fund presence. Nor should Americans be 
considered such investment novices, he maintains. 
</P>
<P>
 While the ownership of stock and bond mutual funds has surged, direct 
ownership of securities has declined. The net result: Households now hold about 
the same share of their financial assets in stock and bond investments as in 
the 1950s and '60s, Morgan wrote in a recent report. 
</P>
<P>
 He dismisses the idea that investors are fickle and will flee the markets 
during a downturn. Instead, the recent shift into stock and bond funds is 
primarily explained by demographic trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The share of household assets in stocks and bonds follows very closely the 
share of workers aged 35 or older," Morgan argues. "As workers age and begin to 
contemplate retiring, they save more and their investment horizon stretches." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed by the need to build up a retirement nest egg, investors are willing 
to accept greater short-term risks in exchange for superior long-term returns, 
which explains the shift toward stock and bond funds and away from traditional 
bank products. 
</P>
<P>
 * No-load investors are less likely to hang tough in rough markets than people 
working with a broker or financial planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Because do-it-yourself investors don't receive hand-holding from a financial 
professional, they're less inclined to ride out storms, the theory goes. A 
correlating and more cynical argument is that investors in load funds stay put 
because they recently paid a commission or would face one to redeem shares. 
</P>
<P>
 There is truth to these notions, yet no-load investors hardly abandoned ship 
during the rough first half of 1994, when domestic stock funds tumbled 5.8% and 
bond funds fell 3.5% on average. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "direct-marketed" funds, which are primarily commission-free 
products, have gained about one percentage point in market share at the expense 
of their load rivals over the past year, according to data compiled by the 
Investment Company Institute in Washington. They've gained four points of 
market share over the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 More telling from a tough-times standpoint, direct-marketed funds accounted 
for 44.6% of total sales (excluding reinvested dividends) during the first half 
of 1994 but only 41.5% of redemptions. By contrast, funds marketed by 
commissioned salespeople accounted for 55.4% of first-half sales but 58.5% of 
redemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months of poor results might not be a sufficiently long period to scare 
investors into the arms of brokers. Yet these numbers also suggest that the 
commission-free share of the business is growing -- and that do-it-yourself 
investors are more resilient than skeptics think. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid new mutual funds. One compelling reason to shun upstarts is that there 
are plenty of proven portfolios out there, so why take chances? A second 
rationale involves cost: If a new fund is unable to attract many investors, its 
pro rata expenses will stay fairly high, eating into shareholder returns. 
</P>
<P>
 But a separate Value Line study found some evidence to suggest that avoiding 
new funds might not always be a wise policy. The publication determined that 
new stock portfolios have a "strong tendency" to outperform their 
more-established peers during the first full calendar year of a fund's 
existence. 
</P>
<P>
 The explanation is that new and thus smaller funds might be better able to 
take advantage of attractive initial stock offerings. In support of this view, 
Value Line discovered that the first-year edge is most pronounced among mutual 
funds that invest in small companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot of this study is that investors should keep an open mind toward new 
stock funds, especially those run by established portfolio managers, according 
to Value Line. 
</P>
<P>
 But the publication found little evidence to suggest that new bond funds were 
bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It might be a case of putting the cart before the horse, but the Templeton 
Vietnam Opportunities Fund is scheduled to open for business this week. The 
fund, a closed-end portfolio, has been in the process of raising up to $120 
million in a stock offering. Its shares will start trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 However, investors may have to wait a while to benefit from any increase in 
trade or production in the Southeast Asian country, one of the world's poorest. 
"There exist only a limited number of Vietnam companies available to the fund 
for investment," says its prospectus. "Securities markets are in the process of 
being established." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, lead manager J. Mark Mobius has leeway to invest in 
non-Vietnamese companies likely to benefit from their participation in the 
development of the country's economy. Eventually, the fund will have at least 
65% of its assets in local stocks and bonds.

 T. Rowe Price Associates of Baltimore ((800) 638-5660) has unveiled a series 
of asset-allocation funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most aggressive is the Personal Strategy Growth Fund, which will normally 
maintain an 80% weighting in stocks, with the rest in bonds and cash. Most 
conservative is Personal Strategy Income, with 40% stocks, 40% bonds and 20% 
cash. Straddling the middle ground is Personal Strategy Balanced, with 60% 
stocks, 30% bonds and the rest in cash.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: NEWLYWEDS NEED TO AGREE ON MONEY MATTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sandy and Tom got married last summer in a beautiful garden ceremony that set 
them back more than $7,000. They paid for the wedding themselves, so they spent 
considerable time examining and whittling down expenditures. They were proud to 
report that the wedding went off without a hitch -- and on budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Things didn't go as smoothly when they returned to their jobs, bills and debts 
after the honeymoon. Sandy wanted to pay off their loans immediately. Tom was 
willing to pay more than the minimum payments, but not so much that it would 
hamper their lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although generally happy together, they argued about bills, credit balances 
and continued spending until they finally sought financial counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy and Tom, who asked that their full names not be used, are not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Few couples talk about money before the marriage," says Robin Leonard, author 
of "Money Troubles: Legal Strategies to Cope With Your Debts." "Often -- even 
if the couple has been living together -- they don't even know if the other 
person has credit card bills or a huge tax debt. Many people keep all this 
private until after the wedding." 
</P>
<P>
 Partly as a result, financial friction is common among newlyweds, experts say. 
Indeed, in past surveys, more than half of divorced couples cited money 
problems as a significant factor in their split. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that it's never too late to get your joint economic life 
together, says Kathleen Stepp, a Kansas City-based financial planner who heads 
Citibank MasterCard and Visa's Money Matters for Newlyweds education program. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as roughly 500,000 summer newlyweds are settling into their married 
lives, is a good time to start. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you do it? The keys are communication and compromise, Stepp and others 
say. Newlyweds need to sit down and open their checkbooks, tax returns, billing 
statements and brokerage accounts and talk over what they have and what they 
want. Here are a few tips on where and how to start. 
</P>
<P>
 * Discuss goals. Many couples find their biggest money troubles come from 
having conflicting goals. One wants a retirement account and the other wants a 
boat, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disagreements about money are really disagreements about priorities, because 
money is finite," says Stepp. You'll need to find common ground, which may not 
be as tough as it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sandy's and Tom's case, it turned out that their goals were similar. They 
just differed on when they expected to attain them. Sandy wanted to own a house 
in three years. Tom expected to buy one within 10 years. They're now trying to 
save enough for a down payment in five to seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Budget. Open up your checkbooks and start tallying how much money you've got 
coming in and where it's going out. Then figure out where you'd like to 
economize and whether it's possible. It's likely that your budget is 
significantly different now that you are married, Stepp notes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check your credit status. Equifax, TransUnion and TRW can provide each of 
you with updated copies of your credit reports. It's important to do this early 
in your marriage, because the results can determine how well you handle your 
finances going forward, says Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
 If one spouse has money troubles, for instance, you may want to draft and sign 
a "nuptial agreement." This is an after-the-ceremony legal document that 
stipulates how you're going to handle money. It might say, for example, that 
you are keeping your property separate in order to shelter the spouse with good 
credit from the other's credit problems. 
</P>
<P>
 If either spouse applies for additional credit later, it should be stated on 
the form that, although he or she is married, the application is based only on 
the individual's income and credit history. The other spouse will not be 
responsible for the account. Keep a copy of the application in case this comes 
up later, Leonard suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get together on fringe benefits. Two-income couples need to take a second 
look at their employee benefits to see if they can save money by eliminating 
overlapping coverage. You may also want to change the beneficiary designations 
on life insurance policies and consider whether additional coverage is 
necessary, as it might be if you plan to have or already have children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep some money separate. While it's fine to have joint checking and savings 
accounts, it's also advisable to keep some money separate, says Stepp. That 
way, neither spouse must "ask permission" to spend, and neither can complain 
about how the other spends discretionary funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Discuss details. Who is going to pay the bills? How will a two-income family 
handle child care after the birth of a baby? Who will stay home when the baby 
-- or the baby-sitter -- is sick? These may seem trivial issues, but they can 
cause fights. Again, compromise and communication are the keys. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever has to do the family bookkeeping should be exempt from cleaning the 
bathroom, Leonard suggests. Mother and father may take turns staying home when 
a child is sick, Stepp adds. Or the parents may make another arrangement based 
on whose career -- or income -- is more likely to be jeopardized by absences 
from work. The main thing is to talk it out and agree on a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 If you follow these steps and still have serious disagreements about money, 
consider talking to a financial adviser. One or both of you may have some 
misconceptions about money that are making it difficult to compromise. An 
independent financial adviser should be able to point those out and help you 
find common ground. 
</P>

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: IRA ERROR DEMANDS FAST ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: Several months ago I transferred my individual retirement account from a 
Puerto Rican bank in California to a well-known mutual fund. The transfer was 
completed within the 60-day limit imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. 
Still, the bank retained 10% of the funds as a penalty. The mutual fund 
representative says I have been treated wrongly. I concur. The bank refuses to 
cooperate. What can I do? -- P.A . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: If the facts are as you have recounted them, our experts say that you have 
indeed been treated improperly and should move q: uickly to redress the error 
to insure that you are not further penalized. How should you proceed? 
</P>
<P>
 First, you must try to determine why the bank withheld the funds. From your 
recounting, it would appear that the bank has erroneously imposed a 10% tax 
withholding on the transferred funds on the misinformed notion that your moving 
the account constituted an early withdrawal of IRA funds. This penalty was 
improperly assessed for two reasons: Taxpayers are entitled to transfer IRA 
accounts between institutions at least once a year, and any penalties for 
breaking account-transfer rules are assessed at the time a taxpayer files his 
or her tax return. The penalty is not supposed to be assessed at the time of 
transfer since, theoretically, the institution has no way of knowing if the 
money is being correctly or improperly transferred or even completely 
withdrawn.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Henry Ross of the Puerto Rican economic development 
administration, the bank with which you are dealing is subject to the tax laws 
of the United States because it is operating in a branch office in this 
country. Further, you are subject to U.S. tax laws as a resident and citizen of 
the United States. However, if you were dealing with a bank located in Puerto 
Rico and were a resident of that territory, neither you nor the bank would be 
subject to U.S. tax laws since they do not apply to residents of territories 
not entitled to vote in federal elections. Remember the Revolutionary battle 
cry "No taxation without representation"? It still applies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the penalty has already been assessed, you should be able to recover 
the money -- or at least get a credit for it -- when you file your next federal 
tax return. Simply note on the return the payment of this tax and debit that 
amount from any taxes you owe for the year.  
</P>
<P>
 The most important thing you can do -- and you must do it within 60 days of 
the transfer -- is to make up the 10% deducted from your account before it was 
transferred to the mutual fund. You will have to do this with funds out of your 
pocket, but unless you do, you will be trapped in the absurd Catch-22 situation 
of being accused of prematurely withdrawing the 10% that was improperly 
withheld before the transfer was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 You may, of course, also complain to the highest possible levels of the bank's 
organization. You might even seek the aid of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. consumer counselors ((800) 934-3342), who can give you some helpful 
advice. Virtually all foreign banks doing business in the United States are 
covered by FDIC insurance and are subject to FDIC regulations. Inheritance 
Stays Separate Property 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does a spouse have any right to the other spouse's inheritance or monetary 
gift? Is the spouse who receives the inheritance or gift free to do as he or 
she wishes with that money? -- G.H . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Even in community property states such as California, inheritances and 
gifts are considered separate property within the marriage. In addition, income 
generated from the investment of an inheritance or gift is considered the 
separate property of the spouse to whom it was given. The exception to this 
occurs when the separate funds are commingled with community property accounts. 
This means that if you receive a gift or inheritance and you want to treat it 
as your own separate property, you must take care to deposit it in a separate 
account from any of the joint accounts you hold with your spouse. Ex-Spouses 
Entitled to Social Security 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A recent column discussed Social Security benefits for divorced spouses. I 
want to know what type of benefits an ex-wife is entitled to receive if her 
ex-husband has remarried. Would both the ex-wife and the current wife be 
entitled to benefits? -- P.D.Q . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: A divorced spouse is entitled to receive Social Security benefits 
accumulated by the ex-spouse if the couple had been married at least 10 years 
and the primary wage earner is already drawing benefits. If the wage earner is 
still working, the ex-spouse may draw benefits if the couple has been divorced 
at least two years and the wage earner is at least age 62. By the way, the 
Social Security Administration treats ex-husbands and ex-wives equally; each is 
entitled to collect on the other's benefits under the same rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits paid to an ex-spouse in no way reduce the amount available to the 
primary wage earner and his or her current family. A current spouse is entitled 
to draw spousal benefits even if a wage earner has one or more ex-spouses 
drawing benefits on that account. These are all considered separate payments 
and an ex-spouse in no way robs a current spouse, or another ex-spouse, of 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Your question is one of dozens this column routinely receives on Social 
Security benefits available to spouses, widows and divorced spouses. Because of 
that, we have prepared a pamphlet addressing some of those questions. To order 
a copy, send a check for $4.33 (including tax and postage) to Times on Demand 
Publications, P.O. Box 60395, Los Angeles, CA 90060. Make checks payable to the 
Los Angeles Times. Please allow six to eight weeks for delivery. (A similar 
pamphlet on 401(k) plans can be ordered from the same address for $5.41.)

IN SEARCH OF THE ALL-IMPORTANT PACIFIC RIM; TRADE: IT IS A TERM THAT'S PART 
HYPE AND PART HOPE, BOTH LINKED TO ASIA'S GROWING IMPORTANCE IN THE WORLD 
ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL SCHOENBERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few places on Earth have been described in such rich statistical detail. But 
then, the Pacific Rim is an idea in search of a definition, and it needs 
something tangible to glue it together. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why anyone with a stomach for numbers can discover the growth rate of 
its aggregate GNP, the output in megawatts of its new power plants or the 
purchasing power of its emerging middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorize some of this minutia and you're a Pacific Rim expert. 
</P>
<P>
 In the popular American consciousness, Asia no longer seems a remote and 
incomprehensible place on the far side of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Asia is in your face. It's right off the shores of California, Oregon and 
Washington, an enticing fountain of riches. Asia was reinvented about a decade 
ago as a new creature of economic geography called the Pacific Rim.  
</P>
<P>
 Increased awareness, however, doesn't necessarily mean enhanced understanding. 
The Pacific Rim is as much image as it is phenomenon, a trendy concept that 
competes with new world order and information superhighway for the most dubious 
buzzword of our time. Yet somewhere behind this facile idea is a hard nub of 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Europhiles who once comforted themselves with traditional cross-Atlantic ties 
need only glance at recent trade statistics to see the spreadsheet writing on 
the wall. In 1993, U.S. exports to Asia exceeded those to Europe for the second 
year in a row. Two-way trade with Asia was $361 billion, compared to $239 
billion for Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 There's a local angle too. With its large concentrations of Asian immigrants 
and Asian Americans, Southern California is a hub for regional networking and 
agile, small-scale entrepreneurship. The rest of the population benefits as 
well. As the state struggles to restructure its sagging economy, rising 
merchandise trade with Asia is one of the few causes for optimism on the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, more than a third -- about $100 billion -- of all U.S. transpacific 
commerce funnels through harbors and airports in the Los Angeles Customs 
District, making Los Angeles the capital of Pac Rim East. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet these beguiling figures shouldn't be cited without also mentioning another 
naked statistic: While trade with Europe is in a reasonably cozy balance, trade 
with Asia is alarmingly out of line, with a whopping U.S. deficit of $98 
billion. More than half that imbalance is with one country, Japan, but the 
problem of closed markets and protectionism is regionwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Such worrisome details, however, tend to get lost in the zealous syntax of 
Pacific Rim Speak, as propagated by Pacific Rim consultants, Pacific Rim 
scholars and Pacific Rim pundits. 
</P>
<P>
 It was some time around the dawn of the audacious 1980s that the term Pacific 
Rim evolved from obscure geological jargon to one of the most impressionistic 
concepts ever known to the dismal science of international economics. 
</P>
<P>
 Its meaning, which once was understood to describe volcanoes and earthquake 
faults ringing the Pacific Ocean, is now stretched to suggest just about 
anything from relocating America's manufacturing base in cheap labor markets 
overseas to speculating on real estate in Vietnam to dining, eclectically, on 
Pan-Asian California cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A simplistic Pacific Rim vision of opportunity in Asia persists, colored, as 
always, by the fantasy of easy wealth. China's 
jackpot-at-the-end-of-the-rainbow market of 1.2 billion consumers comes to mind 
long before one considers the latent chaos of its fragile, sclerotic and 
corrupt authoritarian regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The combined Asia Pacific economies are projected to grow (to) about twice 
the size of a post-1992 'unified Europe,' reaching an estimated $13 trillion by 
the beginning of the next millennium," predicted the Pacific Rim Almanac's 
editor, Alexander Besher. 
</P>
<P>
 Could be. But this prophesy was written in 1990, before Tokyo's speculative 
financial mania turned to muted panic, tumbling the Japanese economy into its 
worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't mean other Asian economies aren't still booming, which they are. 
But they're not necessarily thriving on exports to Japan. The American economy, 
warts and all, remains the market of choice, the key engine of growth, the 
principal dynamo behind these Asian dynamos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the image of a self-sustaining Pacific Rim juggernaut prevails, giving 
the name the power of a magical incantation -- and the snappy appeal of a 
Madison Avenue jingle. 
</P>
<P>
 The business world's fascination is well illustrated by a Pacific Rim 
statistic not often cited in the seminars and chicken dinner speeches: The 
California secretary of state's office lists 297 registered corporations and 
limited partnerships enamored enough with the concept to use the words Pacific 
Rim in their name. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the way of all fads, this one seems to have spent some of its fury. As 
many as 157 of these enterprises, records show, have been dissolved, suspended, 
canceled or otherwise rendered inactive since going to the trouble and expense 
of filing legal papers with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of the technically active Pacific Rim companies are difficult to 
find, assuming they are still in business at all. 
</P>
<P>
 An outfit evocatively named Naturally Beautiful Nails of the Pacific Rim, for 
example, had no telephone numbers on record for offices in Santa Monica or 
Pacific Palisades, where it was incorporated on Nov. 26, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Same goes for Pacific Rim University in Apple Valley, the Pacific Rim Chamber 
of Commerce in Encino, Pacific Rim Concepts of Lancaster and Tsunami Pacific 
Rim Cafe in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectors of exotic Asian weapons shouldn't bother to look up Norwalk-based 
Pacific Rim Ordnance in the 1994 Pacific Bell Smart Yellow Pages. The number 
has been disconnected, and there is no new number. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet quite a few Pacific Rim namesakes are still conspicuous in their 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, Pacific Rim Printers-Mailers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The office manager said she wasn't sure why the printing and direct-mail shop 
calls itself Pacific Rim. "The owners just thought it was a good idea when they 
renamed the company five years ago," she said. "We really have nothing to do 
with the Orient." 
</P>
<P>
 If the term Pacific Rim has a hyped quality, the media can take some of the 
blame. The Los Angeles Times, which sometimes refers to itself as a Pacific Rim 
newspaper, has mentioned the words in 2,547 news articles published since 1985. 
The term Atlantic Rim has appeared in only four articles -- all in the context 
of ironic references to the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's no joke to many California entrepreneurs, who profess to know exactly 
what they mean by calling themselves "Pacific Rim." 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider it to be a buzzword for the 1990s," said Harvey Rosen, president 
of Los Angeles-based Pacific Rim Aluminum, a company that trades in containers 
full of aluminum ingots and scrap. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen, a commodities broker for 20 years before starting his company in 1988, 
chose the name because Asian markets were hot at the time. "I viewed it as the 
strongest area of growth in the world," he said, "and I wanted my company name 
to speak about that vision." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, however, fickle trends in global commodities markets make the 
United States the most lucrative trading scene, as the domestic economy lurches 
out of recession. "Our Asian business is not as good as we would like," Rosen 
concedes. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be unfair to omit Latin America in a serious treatment of the Pacific 
Rim, though this is perhaps one area where the concept suffers from serious 
fatigue. Nonetheless, it's certainly on the Rim, geographically speaking. At 
last count there are 11 Latin American countries with the Pacific Ocean lapping 
at their coastlines; their combined population totals more than 200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico and Chile are the avant-garde, trying to tap into whatever 
opportunities are out there on the Cuenca del Pacifico. Both joined the Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico, for its part, experienced a gusher of Japanese investment in its 
maquiladora (border factory) programs in the 1980s, as leery manufacturers 
sought footholds inside the fortress walls of the emerging North American 
free-trade area. New Japanese investment has dried up in recent years, however, 
as it has in California and elsewhere on this side of the Rim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pacific Rim" has yet another meaning for Dana Yamagata, creative director for 
Pacific Rim Advertising in Los Angeles. The agency specializes in crafting 
"politically correct language" for ads targeting the fragmented ethnic Asian 
markets in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use the term to unify the Asian countries," Yamagata said. "There are more 
than 80 different ethnic groups in Asia, so I guess the Pacific Rim is a 
politically correct term to describe a common economic experience and put a new 
light on that." Advantage: Asia 
</P>
<P>
 Although exports to Asia are outpacing exports to Europe, U.S. mechandise 
trade with Europe remains in balance while the deficit with Asia is rising 
precipitously. U.S. trade with the Pacific and Atlantic rims, in billions of 
dollars: 
</P>

TOWN'S SAFE INVESTMENT LED TO RISKS AND LOSSES; SECURITIES: ONE-FOURTH OF 
$5-MILLION VALUE DISAPPEARED IN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. FUND DENIES MISLEADING 
ITS CLIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gambling with $5 million was just about the last thing on Jon Elam's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 So the administrator of Maple Grove, Minn., seeking to invest the money until 
it was needed for street repairs, chose what seemed like a safe bet: a 
top-rated mutual fund that held only government-backed securities and that was 
pitched as ideal for everyone from municipalities to retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, this suburb of single-family homes and cornfields 20 miles northwest of 
Minneapolis has lost a quarter of its original $5-million investment and Elam 
is smarting. 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't alone. Leaders of several Minnesota communities -- and 7,000 other 
investors around the country -- lost money, and many charge the fund's sponsor, 
Piper Jaffray Cos., with deceiving them about the investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one suggested it was higher risk," Elam said in a phone interview from his 
office in Maple Grove's city hall. "They said it was ideal for governments who 
want to take a minimum of risk." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the managers of the Piper fund -- the Institutional Government Income 
Portfolio -- mostly invested not in ordinary securities but derivatives, among 
Wall Street's least understood and most complicated instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Piper, whose fund has plunged about one-quarter in value this year, denies it 
misled investors. Indeed, many corporations and brokerage firms use derivative 
transactions not for speculative purposes but to hedge against financial 
volatility. 
</P>
<P>
 But the surprising plunge in the Piper fund cuts to the heart of an 
increasingly vocal debate: whether everyday investors accustomed to the 
security of bank savings deposits are sufficiently informed about the 
volatility of arcane financial tools. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst derivatives losses hit only a handful of the more than 4,600 mutual 
funds and a small portion of the fund industry's $2.1 trillion in assets. And 
to mitigate the damage, about a dozen mutual fund companies, brokerages and 
banks have spent millions in recent months to bolster their funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But small investors may have yet to learn the problem's full extent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The little guy doesn't know it yet. They will know it when, 'Gee, I think I 
want to sell. . . . Gee I can only get 70 cents on the dollar now,' " said Jim 
Somers, who owns an asset management firm in Radnor, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Piper Jaffray fund was hardly for average Americans -- the minimum 
starting balance was $25,000 -- but it nonetheless attracted thousands of 
investors, including several small Minnesota cities that already were clients 
of the Minneapolis-based investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Assets in the Institutional Government Income Portfolio soared from less than 
$200 million in January, 1992, to $827 million at the start of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Elam, who approved the city's $5-million initial investment two summers ago, 
said the Piper Jaffray prospectus gave few clues about its emphasis on 
derivatives -- complex transactions in which payments are based on, or derived 
from, some pre-agreed benchmark, such as interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 A key paragraph in the 1993 prospectus lists preservation of capital as a main 
objective. It says the fund invests in "United States Treasury bills, notes, 
bonds and other obligations issued or guaranteed as to payment of principal and 
interest by the United States government or agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospectus does mention a large portion of mortgage-backed securities in 
the portfolio, and said it had the freedom to purchase such investments as 
"inverse floaters." But in a world of financial jargon, that term for a type of 
derivative didn't sound any alarms with Elam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the title of the fund, Institutional Government Income, speaks to what 
the goal is," said Elam, recalling his impression at the time. "Perhaps I was 
naive, but I didn't think that every fund that pays a higher return is 
automatically risky." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Piper fund soared 15.6% last year, outperforming the 72 other 
short-term U.S. government bond funds in its category, according to Lipper 
Analytical Services Inc. The Morningstar mutual fund research company awarded 
it five stars, its top ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 What was juicing up the fund's yields, though, weren't plain vanilla bonds but 
diced and recombined versions of mortgage-backed securities dependent on the 
cash flows from home loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds based on home mortgages tend to have a relatively low default risk 
mainly because the payments are guaranteed by various federal government 
agencies -- including the Government National Mortgage Assn., or Ginnie Mae, 
and the Federal National Mortgage Assn., or Fannie Mae. 
</P>
<P>
 But derivatives of these securities can plunge in value when interest rates 
change direction, upsetting assumptions made by market players about 
prepayments by holders of home mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happened in February, when the Federal Reserve unexpectedly raised 
rates for the first time in five years. The sudden increase sharply diminished 
the number of homeowners seeking to refinance their mortgages with new loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The upheaval forced portfolio managers, corporate treasurers and other large 
holders of exotic mortgage-backed securities to dump the derivatives, sharply 
driving down their market value. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop in the Piper fund was steep: It tumbled nearly 30% from early in the 
year to May, when Piper announced it would inject $10 million into the fund and 
closed it to new investors. The fund has since recovered a bit but was still 
down about 23% through August. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors stunned over the losses are suing for unspecified damages in federal 
court in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them are very angry and very distressed. A large number of them have 
invested retirement savings, or they've invested money they need to live off of 
and are watching the money disappear on them," said Gregg Fishbein, a 
Minneapolis attorney representing investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Piper Jaffray said through a spokeswoman that it believes the fund's 
disclosure is adequate and it would vigorously defend itself against lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Elam, who has fielded numerous questions from residents about the community's 
well-publicized loss, said Maple Grove cannot afford to sell its fund shares 
and take a $1.2-million loss on its investment. But the community is fortunate 
because the $5 million wasn't immediately needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the city continues to receive a dividend check each month from Piper 
for $33,000, nearly 8% on the original investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any personal malice toward Piper," Elam said. "Their loss is 
even greater than ours."

INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD SEE PROFITS DROP IF MORTGAGE RATES RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GULLO, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurance companies that invested heavily in some types of mortgage-backed 
securities could lose profits -- and customers -- if interest rates keep going 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of the securities, created with pools of home mortgages, has 
declined because fewer people are taking out new mortgages or refinancing 
existing loans while interest rates are rising. 
</P>
<P>
 When income from investments shrinks, that puts pressure on an insurance 
firm's ability to keep paying customers competitive rates on annuity-type 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies and banks are among the biggest investors in 
mortgage-backed securities, owning nearly half the $1.5 trillion in 
mortgage-related securities held by investors last year, according to industry 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not all those securities have fallen in value, many have, and they'll 
continue falling as long as interest rates stay where they are or go up. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is that the income streams from the securities are based on 
payments from first and second mortgages, and the pace of new mortgages and 
refinancings has slowed considerably since the Federal Reserve Board began 
hiking interest rates early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 This could prove troublesome for insurance companies, especially life 
insurers, which derive a quarter of their profits from investing the premiums 
they earn in stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The spread is the difference between the interest that life insurance 
companies pay to annuities customers and the interest the companies make on 
their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 When interest payments approach or exceed the level of interest income, 
earnings fall. How much profits will be squeezed depends on what happens to 
interest rates and which types of mortgage-backed securities are in insurers' 
portfolios, analysts say. If interest rates continue to rise gradually, profits 
could be flat or fall a few percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 But a spike in interest rates could help drive earnings down 10% or more this 
year, said Keith M. Buckley, an analyst at Duff & Phelps, a ratings company 
based in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies could also lose customers as a result of thinning spreads. 
If a company can't offer competitive interest rates on annuities because it's 
making less money on its investments, customers could choose to take their 
money elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 Some companies have more than half their bond holdings in mortgage-backed 
securities, analysts estimate. Insurance companies bulked up on these 
investments in the past few years because, while riskier than traditional 
fixed-maturity investments like privately placed bonds, the investments 
promised higher yields. 
</P>
<P>
 One type of mortgage-related security can be especially risky. Called 
collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMOs, these securities are created by 
taking pools of mortgages, stripping the principal and interest payments, and 
making a separate bond issue from the payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The payment flows are packaged into different classes payable after different 
time periods. Those with predictable life spans usually have lower yields than 
those with less predictable maturities. The higher-yielding classes are 
riskier. 
</P>
<P>
 Payouts from CMOs depend on the rate at which mortgage holders repay their 
loans. When interest rates are low, people tend to refinance mortgages and pay 
off the loans faster. When interest rates rise, they don't refinance and the 
maturities lengthen. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors who bet on CMOs tied to principal-only payments do well when 
interest rates are low because mortgages are paid off quickly. Those that bet 
on interest-only CMOs fare poorly because there are no interest payments on 
mortgages that have been paid off.

CUSTOMERS CAN FILL UP IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE; MARKETING: INDUSTRY OFFICIALS SAY 
THE BLENDING OF A FAST-FOOD OUTLET AND A GASOLINE STATION HAS PROVED POPULAR 
AND PROFITABLE.

 When Billy Bowling pulls into a Happy Mart convenience store, he fills his 
tank with gas and his belly with tacos. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go get gas and then you go down the road and have to stand in line 
again for food, you're going out of your way," said Bowling, clutching a gas 
receipt and a Taco Bell bag as he climbed into his car. "It's just less of a 
headache." 
</P>
<P>
 Of 18 Happy Marts that Coleman Oil Co. owns in eastern Kentucky, West Virginia 
and Virginia, eight have big-name fast-food operations. The company plans more 
fast-food stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials say the concept is popular with consumers and profitable 
for gasoline distributors and fast-food chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement allows fast-food companies to enter new markets without 
shelling out $1 million or more to build a free-standing restaurant. In an 
economically depressed rural area like eastern Kentucky, that's a big plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It works for us because it gives us access to consumers we couldn't normally 
reach," said Bruce Schroder, vice president for Taco Bell Express. "It's a 
change in marketing strategy. . . . (We are) actually taking our food to the 
consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 These on-the-run oases started appearing about five years ago. But 1993 was 
the year the trend really caught on, said Stewart Small, spokesman for the 
National Assn. of Convenience Stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, fast-food sales at convenience stores increased 15.3%, Small said. 
He said the fast-food share of convenience store sales is now 11.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials have no idea how many of these hybrid stores are out there. 
But, Small said, "Big companies are doing it, small companies are doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's happening in the city, it's happening in rural areas." 
</P>
<P>
 The concept is still new enough that some of the biggest players are taking a 
wait-and-see attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's Corp., the nation's No. 1 fast-food chain, has fewer than half a 
dozen such restaurants in its 9,500-unit empire. And they were developed on the 
local level, spokeswoman Ann Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very early for us," she said. "We're careful. We're taking a close look 
at this." 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses that have tried the idea so far report impressive results. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman Oil installed a Burger King at its store in Phelps, population 1,300, 
for about one-fifth the cost of building a free-standing restaurant. Doug 
Charles, vice president of Pikeville-based Coleman, said gasoline sales at the 
store soon jumped by as much as 500 gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big thing is we already had a good existing customer base, and it allowed 
us to maximize our property use," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant chains won't give figures, but the relationship appears to be 
working out well for them too. 
</P>
<P>
 When Charles started looking into adding brand-name fast food at Happy Marts 1 
1/2 years ago, he had to do the courting. Now, restaurant chains are coming to 
the oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us help you beef up your bottom line," said a full-page Burger King ad in 
the June edition of Independent Gasoline Marketing magazine. "It's never been 
this convenient before." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Paci, vice president for franchise sales at Burger King, said the 
marriage between gasoline and fast food is a natural. "They have a large 
similarity in the characteristic of the customers. Both businesses are very 
convenience-driven," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell, which is owned by Pepsico Inc., operates 200 convenience store 
restaurants and plans to open another 100 by year's end. "Our research shows 
that time is the currency of the '90s," Schroder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Happy Mart added fast food, Pikeville residents with a hankering for 
Taco Bell had to drive about 70 miles to Hazard. Now, there are three Taco Bell 
Expresses within a few miles of each other, with more to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement also has allowed Baskin Robbins Inc. to expand in the area. 
Before linking up with Happy Marts in November, Baskin Robbins had only two 
stores in all of eastern Kentucky. Coleman Oil has tripled that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The population and the traffic just does not support the cost involved in a 
full-scale store," said Baskin Robbins spokeswoman Lisa van Velthuyzen. But 
hook up with an existing operation, she said, "and that suddenly becomes very 
viable." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the fast-food operations are franchise relationships, with the gas 
distributor as the franchisee. But Tom Osborne, spokesman for the Society of 
Independent Gasoline Marketers, said some restaurant owners are becoming 
franchisees of the gasoline distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept is commanding strong interest in the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Petroleum Marketers Assn. of America, whose members sell about half the 
nation's gasoline, invited Burger King to offer a convenience store seminar at 
its fall convention in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "That room was overflowing," said association spokesman David Morehead. "I had 
to have chairs brought in, and people were literally spilling into the halls. 
So the interest is there."

O.C. VIETNAMESE BECOMING LINKS TO EMERGING DEALS; TRADE: U.S. COMPANIES ARE 
TURNING TO BUSINESS PEOPLE HERE WITH FAMILY TIES AND CONNECTIONS TO THE 
SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County's large Vietnamese American community, in helping to expand 
commerce with Vietnam, is becoming a brokerage center -- forging deals between 
their home country and American companies looking to trade there. 
</P>
<P>
 To locate scarce Vietnamese buyers, many U.S. companies are turning to 
Vietnamese American business people with family ties and connections in Vietnam 
to serve as their representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Familiarity with Vietnam's language and customs are particularly important for 
forging lasting ties in that nation, said Young Huynh, executive director of 
Irvine-based CJY Trading Inc. Without reliable telephone and mail services, 
much business is conducted in face-to-face meetings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huynh, who recently became a distributor for Sunbeam-Oster Co.'s household 
appliances and for another company's hardware division, met with officials 
during a trip to Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he had previously worked as a computer reseller in Irvine, Huynh said 
he didn't think that many in Vietnam -- where the annual household income is 
less than $300 -- would be able to afford the $1,000 machines. "You have to 
pick the right products to sell," he said. "Maybe in a year people will start 
looking for computers." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with other Vietnamese American companies tell similar stories of how 
they have sold equipment, brokered sales, or became agents for large American 
corporations in the months since the Clinton Administration in February lifted 
the trade embargo with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise of trade ties comes despite some opposition from community leaders in 
Orange County, who argue that a continued economic embargo would have pushed 
the Vietnamese government to respect human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The more that trade helps the Vietnamese economy, the less incentive there is 
for the government to hold clean, multi-party elections, said Bui Binh Ban, 
president of the Vietnamese Community of Southern California, a social services 
organization based in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever helps them (the government) to survive is against our community," 
said Ban. He said he had hoped trade with Vietnam would not develop as has 
American trade with China, which has been criticized by some here as lacking 
respect for human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 From January through June, U.S. exports to Vietnam were $29.6 million, 
compared to $7 million for all of 1993 (when some humanitarian goods were 
allowed to be shipped), according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Imports 
from Vietnam for the first six months of this year were $10.5 million, up from 
no imports in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Commerce Department officials said they didn't know how much of that money 
flows through Orange County but that they receive a steady stream of inquires 
from the Little Saigon business district along Bolsa Avenue, between Ward and 
Magnolia streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 U.S. Census counted 70,500 Vietnamese in Orange County, making it the 
largest concentration outside of Vietnam. The Little Saigon area of Westminster 
is the main shopping district, but the local Vietnamese American population and 
its businesses are spread throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many local Vietnamese had ties to the South Vietnamese government and 
are skeptical of doing business there now, their children -- some of whom don't 
remember much of the war -- are putting the most effort into establishing trade 
ties, said Xuan Nhi Ho, president of Vietnam Investment and Trade Opportunity 
Project Inc. in Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Ho said he expects trade with Vietnam may come to resemble the deals he 
already arranges elsewhere in Asia, such as importing coffee and rice for 
American companies. 
</P>
<P>
 While U.S. companies currently lack the distribution channels set up by their 
Asian and European rivalS, which have been doing business in Vietnam for years, 
Ho said Vietnamese consumers tend to recognize American brand names. The 
recognition dates from the years of U.S. military involvement and from the 
American products previously sold there -- despite the trade ban -- through 
third-country middlemen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With many government-owned businesses lacking solid track records in financial 
management, however, Ho said he often has difficulty persuading U.S. banks to 
loan entrepreneurs the funds needed to make such trades. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to see American (products) . . . but it's hard to find the 
financial backing," Ho said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bart Chapman, who is president and chief executive of Health Trade 
International in Mission Viejo, said he hoped American banks and government 
agencies would offer softer terms on loans to better compete with favorable 
financing arrangements made by Japanese and Korean competitors. "It might be 
expensive, but it would be worth it," Chapman said. "I talk to business people 
and I ask them, 'If you could have been in Japan in the 1950s, knowing what you 
know now, would you have done it?' That's the comparison." 
</P>
<P>
 With an estimated population of 71.8 million, many expect that development in 
Vietnam will increase demand for foreign products, such as agricultural and 
manufacturing equipment, as well as for professional services. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Pfeiffer, a Pasadena attorney and business consultant who has spent 
three months in Vietnam so far this year, said those interested in brokering 
deals will find that the Vietnamese government wants to discourage short-term 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're just trying to put together a few deals and make some commissions, 
that's not the way to go. You're going to have trouble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the interest in Vietnam is from brokers, however. EPG International in 
Anaheim recently sold $25,000 worth of the water-filtering equipment it 
manufactures to the city of Hanoi and expects to sell more soon. The company 
also exports more than $500,000 in goods to Indonesia, Hong Kong and Thailand, 
said Philip Nguyen, an EPG vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, who visited Hanoi in April to attend a trade show organized by Orange 
County backers, said the sale began with government contacts he made through 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 (Another mission, sponsored by the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce and the 
Asian Business League of California, is planned for later this year.) 
</P>
<P>
 EPG has several competitors in the United States that don't have such good 
Vietnamese contacts, he said, and therefore aren't yet a presence. "We think 
that we have the product and the price to beat them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim-Yen Huynh, an assistant manager of Cathay Bank's Westminster office in 
Little Saigon, said that she has received a steady stream of inquiries from 
area residents since the embargo was lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of them want to be brokers, the middle person," she said. "They 
still want to go to manufacturers here . . . but they'll be the ones who would 
go back and forth" to Vietnam to make the sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many of Orange County's Vietnamese American business people are anxious 
to begin trade with Vietnam, Huynh said she respects the views of those who are 
anti-communist. She said she does not expect the issue will divide the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of people I do business with are in favor of going back to 
Vietnam, of helping our country. But you can't forget the people who are 
against" the opening of trade, she said.

WHERE THE PLA-BOYS ARE; NEITHER WIND, HEAT NOR FAMILY COMMITMENTS STOP MEMBERS 
OF POSTAL LEAGUE TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They arrive at the park by 4 p.m. and flop down on the cool grass of a shaded 
area near the curb. They change into their softball shoes and examine their 
leather gloves, most of them faded and worn soft by seasons of play. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the players lie wilted from the heat, a couple of them sigh deeply as 
they finish cigarettes before flicking them into St. Andrews Street. Slowly 
they stand and walk toward the ballpark to jog their mandatory two laps across 
the outfield grass. Damn, it's hot. 
</P>
<P>
 All but one are U.S. Postal Service employees. It is good, steady work. They 
live throughout the Los Angeles area, but the roots of their team, the 
Pla-Boys, coalesce here in South L.A., where twice a week they sharpen their 
skills at a dying game. 
</P>
<P>
 There were once 24 men's fast-pitch teams in the Postal League, but now there 
are only 14, as more players are attracted to the slow-pitch version of the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The game, like few others, partners the young and old. The Pla-Boys range in 
age from 23-year-old shortstop Eric Perry, whose gold earrings dangle from both 
sides of a shaved head, to Billie Small, the 62-year-old pitcher whose cap 
covers a head of graying hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pla-Boys take the game more seriously than most. Other teams may practice 
once a week or not at all in preparation for the Saturday games, but the 
Pla-Boys are here every Tuesday and Thursday, even on days like today, when the 
temperature is in the mid-90s and the heat reflects wickedly off the dirt 
infield. 
</P>
<P>
 For about 20 years, they practiced at a nearby playground but decided to move 
on when gunfire came to play. Here at St. Andrews, seniors walk laps around the 
park and young people gather innocently in the shade. There is distant laughter 
and a peaceful calm, but it is veiled by a sixth-sense caution that comes with 
living in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pla-Boys come to life slowly. It is their last practice before their 
league championship playoffs. Some of them have just gotten off work, others 
are working late shifts and their days are just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 There is history and tradition to the Pla-Boys, not all of it principled. Some 
of the players have been together for more than 20 years, bonded by their love 
for the game and all that comes with it -- the competition and glory and 
trappings. 
</P>
<P>
 The older players remember when they played 10 games a week for numerous 
teams. After games, they would socialize around a cooler of beer. In softball, 
this is known as camaraderie. Or they would go to the bars that sponsored teams 
and eat and drink for free until closing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I couldn't keep my first wife," Small says. "I was never home." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the players begin playing catch, the balls gather velocity and begin 
slapping hard into their gloves. The chatter begins to flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people say the Pla-Boys have "the big head," and mouths to match. Players 
from other teams may laugh with them and drink their beer, but deep down inside 
they love to see the Pla-Boys lose. They have always, perhaps undeservedly, 
been cast as the villains. 
</P>
<P>
 Through fund-raisers and members' dues, the club helps players who face 
financial hardship. They recently made a donation when a member's house caught 
on fire and they do the same whenever there's a death in a player's family. 
Each year at Christmas, the club delivers food baskets to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in the early 1960s, the Pla-Boys now sponsor men's and women's 
slow-pitch teams as well as a youth team that plays here at St. Andrews. The 
Pla-Boy Club, made up primarily of the old-timers, raises money for team 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been glorious moments. In the last 20 years, they have won 13 
league playoff titles. They once won 68 straight games and seven consecutive 
championships. But it is not the victories one remembers, says Clay Williams, 
54, a coach and 29-year Pla-Boy veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 The losses -- especially the important ones -- seem to run over and over in 
his mind, he says, like a loop of film. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's playoffs have haunted him for a year now -- the missed 
opportunities and uncharacteristic errors. Fast-pitch is a game played in a 
flurry, and the slightest bobble or hesitation can be catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Williams can practically give a play-by-play of last year's 
disheartening semifinal loss to their rivals, the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four errors," he says, shaking his head. "Four double plays." 
</P>
<P>
 It will take three wins for the Pla-Boys to claim the Postal League crown, but 
one loss would put them out of the running. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace picks up as the team begins batting practice. Each player puts down a 
couple of bunts and takes 10 swings. It ends with fielding practice. Williams 
hits to players one at a time and has them chasing down balls until their legs 
are weak and their chests are heaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the two-hour workout, they repair to the shade and the trunks of 
their cars, where Coleman coolers await. The Pla-Boys also are celebrating a 
birthday, so half a gallon of gin makes the rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Some players, like Small, prefer soft drinks or water as they share softball 
lore, past victories and defeats, the certainty of upcoming conquests. They 
talk strategy, women, work. By the time the last beer is gone and the final 
players leave the park, it is well past dark. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Billie Small arrives at Westchester Park an hour early on Game Day. It's the 
same ritual every Saturday throughout the season. He finds a seat in the 
bleachers, reaches into his bag and pulls out a jar of liniment, which he rubs 
vigorously into his knees and shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't mind being called an old man and says it only makes him feel 
blessed to still be playing the game. But being an old man requires more time, 
effort and liniment to prepare for battle. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been playing fast-pitch since he was a youngster. Back then, he 
couldn't get enough of the game. One summer, he, Clay Williams and L.T. 
Tillman, the team's manager, played on seven championship teams. He remains one 
of the league's top pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were truly dedicated to the team," he says. "Our families knew come 
Saturday, we gonna play ball. Don't ask us to do nothing else. Don't ask us to 
go to no weddings or nothing like that. We playing ball. I been to funerals on 
Saturdays and took my uniform with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Small worked 39 years and 29 days for the Postal Service before retiring in 
1992. He now works part time for his church on South Vermont Avenue. While the 
game may have caused problems at home, he says with pride that he never allowed 
it to interfere with his job. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules now have been the rules forever, Small says. Players are expected to 
be at practice and are excused only for reasons of work or family emergency. 
They must wear full uniforms for games. Some younger players have complained 
about that one, preferring to wear shorts or something other than traditional 
Pla-Boy red and white. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them say they don't want to be wearing red because they afraid they 
might be identified with gangs," Small says. "They want to wear black. As soon 
as the game's over they change clothes, but I wear my uniform to the ballpark 
and leave it on until I go home and shower. I'm proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon completing his pregame warm-ups, Small takes a seat in the bleachers to 
await the start of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still got that adrenaline flowing when I play," he says. "All games to me 
is important. On the night before a game, I start going through in my mind who 
the batters are going to be. I start getting a little loosey-goosey in my 
stomach and I feel that way until after the first pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 The game begins, and the Pla-Boys go easily in the top of the first inning, 
three up, three down. Then Small takes the mound, tosses a few warm-up pitches. 
The first batter steps in, and the old man rears back, triggers his windmill 
motion and fires off a heater. 
</P>
<P>
 Strike one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each team is allowed one player on its roster who doesn't work for the U.S. 
Postal Service. For the Pla-Boys, that player is Timothy Mitchell, 24, a 
powerful lefty who played in the Boston Red Sox organization until 1992, when 
he injured a knee. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Pla-Boys leading 3-0 in the second inning, Mitchell digs in deep in 
the box, a thick wad of Red Man puffing out his right cheek, a runner on 
second. He is all business when he has a bat in his hands. His eyes are serious 
as he leans his weight on his back foot and steadily awaits the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 After injuring his knee two years ago, he was given his release from the Class 
AA Lynchburg, Va., team. Earlier this year, Mitchell was also released from a 
warehouse job, so now he is doing painting and odd jobs. He's good with his 
hands. A fifth-round pick in 1989, after graduating from Culver City High 
School, he still hopes to return to professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching silently from the fence near the Pla-Boy dugout is another big man. 
Around this ballpark, Henry (Hammerin' Hank) Strawberry is a legend. The father 
of San Francisco Giant Darryl Strawberry, Henry still stops by on Saturdays to 
visit his friends. When he was on the mound, he threw only one pitch -- no 
fancy curve or drop or rise or knuckleball -- only the fastball, and that was 
all he needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knew what was coming," he says in a soft voice. Then, with the hint 
of a smile, he adds: "But they still had to hit it." 
</P>
<P>
 People say his pitching was overshadowed by his hitting. Hammerin' Hank could 
hit the ball a ton, like Mitchell -- and like Darryl. 
</P>
<P>
 With the count full, Mitchell steadies his gaze. The pitch comes in just above 
the knees, and he unloads with a loud grunt, making solid contact. Neither 
fielder can catch up to it. There are no outfield fences, so by the time they 
run the ball down, Mitchell is rounding second base. The frustrations, the 
disappointment of the past two years are nowhere to be seen. There is a smile 
on his face as he is greeted at home plate with high fives. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester Park is a long way from Fenway, but a home run translates beyond 
the lines that separate levels of the game -- baseball from softball, Little 
League from the American League. For Mitchell, the moment is sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pla-Boys go on to win, 14-0, and advance to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 L.T. Tillman sits in a folding chair next to the dugout at Holly Park in 
Hawthorne, where the Pla-Boys are playing the Athletics -- the only team to 
beat them during the regular season. The winner will advance to the finals to 
play the Heat, last year's league and state champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two weeks earlier, he had surgery for an ulcer. The incision is 
still tender, so he is careful to rise slowly and is ordered by his wife to not 
get overly excited. By the bottom of the first inning, however, he is out on 
the field in the home plate umpire's face. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillman started playing ball in Borger, Texas. One of 15 children, it wasn't 
hard to get a game together. He would yank the head off one of his sisters' 
dolls to use as a ball, remove the handle from his mother's mop for a bat. 
</P>
<P>
 It is to be a controversial game, and the first confrontation arises in the 
first inning, when the Pla-Boys complain about a change in their opponents' 
lineup. They lose the argument but go on to win the game, 8-4, advancing to the 
championship round.

 By the time Small begins his drive home to Fontana, he is thinking about the 
Heat, the batters he will face and how he will pitch to them in three days. He 
is thinking about the state tournament in Stockton last year, when the Heat 
beat them twice in the championship round. 
</P>
<P>
 The butterflies in his stomach are beginning to flutter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the day of the game finally comes, Small is up by 5:20 a.m., anxious -- 
like a kid -- to get to the ballpark for the 4 p.m. game. The players gather in 
a circle before taking the field. Each player gets a chance to say a few words. 
</P>
<P>
 "125 percent," says Greg Harris, the team's speedy center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just win," says Perry, the young shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We, the team," says Tillman, the last person to speak. "They gotta come get 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 They pile their hands in the center of the huddle. "One, two, three." 
</P>
<P>
 "PLA-BOYS WIN!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat take a 1-0 lead in the first inning, and Tillman is already out on 
the field, challenging the umpires. His wife, Vera, steps down from the 
bleachers, pleading with him to calm down. 
</P>
<P>
 All along, the Pla-Boys have said they must play strong defense to win. Turns 
out they were right. The defense breaks down. The Heat capitalize, winning 4-3 
in the bottom of the last inning to claim the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams meet in the center of the infield to shake hands. Both teams are, 
for the most part, gracious. Small walks to the dugout and throws his glove on 
the ground. The Pla-Boys gather in a circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a few errors," Williams says. "We made some mistakes, but all in all, 
we played a good game. We didn't give up when we got behind. We had a good 
season. They had a good game. Let's drink some beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, the young center fielder, walks off to be alone, tears forming in his 
eyes. Tillman walks over and places an arm around his shoulder. They stand 
together, young and old. He tells Harris to hold his head high. On the bench, 
Greg Crowley, the first-year left fielder, sits silent and alone, staring down, 
giving anything to have another chance at a couple of those fly balls that 
could have made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 It hurts and it's cruel. When you expect so much, it's not the victories you 
remember.

HOW TO LIVE UP TO GROWING DOWN; MOST EXPERTS AGREE IT'S JUST A PART OF THE 
AGING PROCESS, BUT YOU CAN STALL THE SHRINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Gray hair can be colored. Flab can be fashionably dressed. Crow's feet can be 
ironed out. But just when it seems there's no symptom of aging that can't be 
tamed, it can come creeping up on you. Or creeping down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shrink. That gradual erosion of stature that hints (and sometimes shouts) 
that you are past your peak and sliding swiftly over the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, of course, it's easy to ignore and rationalize The Shrink. 
The frazzled nurse measured wrong, that's all. You're not growing shorter, your 
kids and grandkids are just getting taller. 
</P>
<P>
 When you discover more of you is missing, there's disbelief and anger. With 
every inch of height you lose, those ideal-weight charts get more hilarious. 
Then come the nightmares: Will you spend your golden years perched on pillows 
just to see over the steering wheel? 
</P>
<P>
 Shrinking, the folklore goes, is a normal, can't-fight-it fact of aging. No 
magic cream, no surgery, nothing but higher heels and taller hats can stem the 
southward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 But recently, that thinking has been increasingly challenged by physicians and 
researchers in the field (many of them, by the way, very tall people who show 
every intention of staying that way). 
</P>
<P>
 Some shrinking with age probably is inevitable, most experts agree -- but not 
as much as you may be blaming on birthdays alone. When height loss is so great 
that others start to notice, many experts now say, it could indicate an 
underlying problem such as osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
 While the risk of osteoporosis is partly determined by factors out of your 
control, many behaviors that lead to height loss -- smoking, sedentary 
lifestyle, poor body mechanics or posture -- can easily be altered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is normal not to shrink," says K. Michael Davies, a six-foot-tall 
researcher at the Osteoporosis Research Center at Creighton University, Omaha. 
It's possible to reach the golden years, he says, at the same or about the same 
height as you were in your young adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 The folklore about shrinking into senior citizenhood has been popularized 
partly, Davies says, by researchers' habit of comparing younger women (who grew 
progressively taller from one generation to the next, from about 1900 to 1965) 
with older women, who were always shorter to begin with. Researchers who found 
height differences between these generations mistakenly chalked it all up to 
old-age shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, the older people were shorter than the younger ones -- but that doesn't 
necessarily mean they were shrinking," says Davies, who spelled out his 
argument in a paper published recently in the Journal of Bone and Mineral 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
 To better understand shrinking -- or the lack of it -- in the later years, it 
helps to know there are really two types: senior shrink, and the day-in day-out 
shrink that happens way before you're eligible for movie discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 From dawn to dusk, it's not unusual to lose nearly a half inch in height, says 
Dr. Charles Prickett, a 6-foot-7 Pasadena orthopedic surgeon and USC associate 
clinical professor of orthopedics who also directs a spine clinic at 
Orthopaedic Hospital, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're at your tallest when you wake up," Prickett explains. "By late 
afternoon and evening, you have settled." 
</P>
<P>
 The fluctuation is due to normal functioning of the intervertebral disks -- 
the fluid-filled cushions between the 33 vertebrae, the bones that make up the 
spine. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think of bone as static, but it's dynamic," says Dr. Mauro "Stretch" 
Giordani, a 5-foot-7 Pasadena orthopedic surgeon (who claims he must stand on a 
crate in the operating room when working with his partner, Prickett). 
</P>
<P>
 With daily activity, fluid diffuses from the disks into the vertebral bodies, 
the building blocks of the spine, Giordani and Prickett explain. With less 
fluid, the disks provide less cushion. And you become shorter. When you lie 
down, fluid moves back into the disks, explaining why you're back at full 
height by morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Few people notice these daily fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you're going out for basketball," Prickett advises, "get measured in 
the morning. If you're about to be drafted, make an afternoon appointment." 
</P>
<P>
 It follows that youngsters stretching to meet the height requirement for 
certain amusement park rides should line up early. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the amount of fluid decreases. Cushioning decreases. You get 
the rest of the picture. Stay in good health, and this settling effect will 
have a negligible effect on your height, many experts concur. 
</P>
<P>
 But other factors -- some under our control, others not -- can take their toll 
on height. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truck drivers, for instance, are bouncing up and down all day," Prickett 
says. That's very tough on the spine. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who sit for long periods also put more stress and strain on the spine 
and its cushions. Diabetics are especially prone to loss of disk resiliency. 
</P>
<P>
 Smokers do their bones no favors. Smoking reduces circulation within the small 
blood vessels that deliver oxygen-rich blood to the bones, Giordani explains. 
The diminished blood supply, in turn, hinders the ongoing process of bone 
restoration and healing. Calcium stores decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor posture can also exaggerate The Shrink, although with practice it can be 
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Older people are known to slump," says Dr. Loren Lipson, 5-foot-8 chief of 
the division of geriatric medicine at USC. "This slump on average can take off 
1.5 inches," he estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, in particular, are known to contort their spines into previously 
unimaginable shapes when they teach their children how to ride a bike without 
training wheels or some similar feat. 
</P>
<P>
 By far, though, the biggest height robber with age is osteoporosis, a disease 
marked by low bone mass and deterioration of the bone tissue. This in turn 
leads to fractures of the hip, wrist and spine, deformities such as stooped 
posture or a dowager's hump -- and a decrease in height. 
</P>
<P>
 While half of all women in the United States will be afflicted with 
osteoporosis, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, men aren't 
immune. By age 75, a third of men have the disorder, too, according to 
foundation estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Height loss due to osteoporosis often becomes noticeable around age 50 in 
women and 60 or 65 in men, says Dr. Charles Sharp, a 6-foot-4 Pasadena 
endocrinologist specializing in metabolic bone disorders and a USC clinical 
associate professor of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain people are at much higher risk of getting osteoporosis. Among risk 
factors: menopause before age 45, low calcium intake, cigarette smoking, 
excessive drinking and inactivity. Whites and Asians are at higher risk than 
other ethnic groups; thin people have higher risk than heavier people. 
</P>
<P>
 How much height can osteoporosis take? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen women lose two or three inches over 15 or 20 years," Sharp says. 
"I've even seen women who have lost six inches." 
</P>
<P>
 While you can't control some risk factors for height loss, there are some ways 
to reduce the odds that you'll someday shop for clothes alongside Dr. Ruth. 
Among the experts' suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do engage regularly in weight-bearing exercise, but don't become a fanatic, 
says Prickett, who contends overdoing is as bad as doing nothing. Moderate 
walking, swimming and stationary cycling are the best for maintaining bone 
health, he says.  
</P>
<P>
 In a recent study conducted at Texas A&M University, post-menopausal women who 
exercised on stationary bikes three times for 30 minutes a week built bone mass 
by 3.5% in their lumbar spines, found researcher Susan Bloomfield, while 
sedentary women lost 2.4% of their bone mass during the same eight-month study. 
Water aerobics and resistance training with light weights are also good 
choices, says Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take vitamins and minerals. Pay special attention to calcium, copper, zinc 
and manganese -- all important for bone maintenance. Teen-agers and young 
adults should build as much bone mass as possible before age 30, when it peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Those at high risk for osteoporosis might consider a bone-density test, 
which can predict the chances of fracture and differentiate spinal osteoporosis 
from other spine problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Women experiencing menopause, when bone mass decreases, should discuss with 
their doctor whether they're good candidates for estrogen replacement therapy, 
which can help maintain bone. 
</P>
<P>
 If height loss at any age seems sudden or extreme, it could signal an 
abnormality such as disk disease leading to scoliosis (an abnormal spine 
curvature) or compression fractures, Prickett says. If you have lost a half 
inch or more before your mid-40s, it bears checking with a physician, Sharp 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 If clean living, a sense of humor or finding shorter friends don't ease The 
Shrink, there is another possible -- though temporary -- option: join the space 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Astronauts, whatever their original height, tend to grow in space. Astronaut 
Richard Hieb was 6-foot-3 when he blasted off on the recent Columbia shuttle 
mission but soon added an inch, a NASA spokesman says. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news (at least for Hieb, who was close to NASA'S maximum of 
6-foot-4): height returns to normal back on Earth.

REAGAN AND BUSH DECEIVED PUBLIC, MCFARLANE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush deceived the public about 
their knowledge of the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages deal, according to memoirs 
being published Monday by one of the central figures in the event, former 
National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarlane says he briefed President Reagan and then-Vice President Bush from 
the start of the deal in 1985, 17 months earlier than Bush admits he knew about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments are noteworthy because the question of Bush's knowledge has 
focused for years on whether he was present during two White House meetings in 
late 1985 and early 1986 at which the Iran-Contra deal was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview based on the book, scheduled to air tonight on CBS-TV's 
"60 Minutes," McFarlane is now saying he told Bush about the deal outside of 
those meetings, claiming he briefed Bush 12 times over the 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush's office in Texas said the former President was traveling and was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarlane pleaded guilty in 1988 to four misdemeanors for withholding 
information from Congress about the complicated secret deal, in which arms were 
sold to Iran in exchange for the release of hostages held in Beirut and cash 
from the sales was then used to resupply Nicaraguan Contra guerrillas, whose 
funding had been cut off by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, McFarlane writes that Reagan, who always insisted that he never 
knew the arrangement was a direct swap for hostages, "lacked the moral 
conviction and intellectual courage" to admit his involvement, though the 
author adds that he doubts First Lady Nancy Reagan and others would have 
allowed him to do so even if he had so desired. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan aides in California said he was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarlane's book, "Special Trust," offers other allegations concerning the 
scandal and the inner workings of the Reagan White House, particularly from 
1985 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: Israeli officials proposed assassinating the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini in July, 1985, by slowly poisoning his food. McFarlane said he 
rejected the plan outright, never mentioning it to Reagan. Soon after, 
McFarlane and other U.S. officials began trying to negotiate with moderates in 
Iran for the arms deal. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarlane's account is already generating a new spat with the another notable 
figure in the scandal, former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North, who is now the 
Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Virginia. According to the most 
recent polls, North is leading Democratic incumbent Charles S. Robb. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, McFarlane, North's boss at the White House, describes his 
former protege as a liar and a con man, and he contradicts North's assertion 
that he never lied under oath about the secret plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lies to me, to the Congress, to the President," McFarlane said. "This is 
not somebody you want in public life." 
</P>
<P>
 North, in a response issued Friday, called McFarlane's book a "pitiful and 
mean-spirited attempt to glue his broken reputation back together again." 
</P>
<P>
 North also released a previously undisclosed court transcript in which the 
late U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell called McFarlane "an intensely 
unreliable witness in almost every respect of his testimony." According to 
North, the comment was made during a conference with lawyers at the judge's 
bench after McFarlane testified at North's 1989 criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
 North was convicted of felonies for lying to Congress about the scheme, but 
those convictions were overturned on a technicality. 
</P>
<P>
 North remains popular politically, McFarlane says in the interview, "because 
he's a performer. In the last 30 years, being skilled in media has become more 
important than a matter of character or integrity. And North is conning people 
today the same as he did in government. 
</P>
<P>
 "For him, having dishonored his family name, betrayed his friends, he has to 
wash away that stain somehow. And a way to do it is to con the people of 
Virginia into saying: 'You are an honest man.'. . . I'm not hopeful about Ollie 
North. I mean, the guy has no business in the U.S. Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 After his conviction, McFarlane tried to commit suicide because, he said, he 
blamed himself for the scandal and the damage it did to the Reagan presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been the reason why we had this huge national scandal and in the 
process would lose the chance to do so many useful things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to assassinate Khomeini, McFarlane says, was offered by Israeli 
Foreign Ministry official David Kimche in a meeting at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimche said the Israelis had operatives close enough to the ayatollah that 
they had devised a scheme to gradually infuse the Iranian leader with poison, 
McFarlane reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said: 'The United States cannot be involved with Israel in any kind of 
operation in which your intent is to assassinate or otherwise accelerate the 
demise of anybody,' " McFarlane said in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarlane says Kimche then gave him a firm commitment that the Israelis would 
not proceed. As a result of that commitment, McFarlane says he never told 
Reagan about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, McFarlane also says officials around Reagan considered the "Star 
Wars" program -- the plan to build a halo of weapons in space that would 
supposedly protect the United States from attack -- to be nothing more than a 
bluff to scare the Russians. Congress would never fund it, even if the plan 
would work, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But McFarlane says Reagan didn't know this and believed the program would be 
financed.

MTA DELAYED RESPONSE TO WARNING ON TUNNELS; SUBWAY: TO SAVE MONEY, THEY SAY, 
OFFICIALS WAITED SIX MONTHS BEFORE ORDERING CONTRACTOR TO STABILIZE GROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly a year before subway construction beneath Hollywood Boulevard caused 
the street and adjoining buildings to sink, officials were warned that settling 
would occur unless the contractor altered its tunneling technique. 
</P>
<P>
 But records and interviews show that Los Angeles transit officials waited six 
months before ordering the contractor to begin stabilizing the ground with 
grout. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, more than 100 yards of the area that sank last month had been 
excavated without the grouting required by the subway contract, according to 
inspection reports. The sinking in Hollywood broke water lines, crumbled parts 
of the Walk of Fame and damaged buildings from Vine Street to Highland Avenue. 
Vehicle traffic, halted Aug. 20 and 21, remains restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has not assigned blame for the 
sinkage, which is expected to prompt millions of dollars in claims from 
property owners and repairs to tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that the grouting initially was not conducted along Hollywood 
Boulevard and Vermont Avenue out of a desire to save money. They said that they 
believed other aspects of the tunnel construction would adequately stabilize 
the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to the MTA's chief executive officer, Franklin E. White, said that he 
is generally satisfied with the construction decisions that have been made -- 
but will withhold more definitive judgment until after the Federal 
Transportation Administration completes an ongoing review. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a responsibility to be determined here," said the aide, L.A. (Kim) 
Kimball. The MTA will pay for remedial work now under way but may later ask 
other parties to assist, he said. The agency's first focus, Kimball said, is to 
ensure that tunneling can be resumed safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the contractor, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, a joint venture 
controlled by the Walnut-based J. F. Shea Co., declined to discuss the 
tunneling. The contractor has notified the transit agency that it attributes 
the sinking to unexpected underground conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground sinkage once was a frequent consequence of tunneling projects. But with 
the advent of modern techniques -- including the use of grout -- settlement of 
more than one inch is generally considered unacceptable. Parts of Hollywood 
Boulevard sank up to nine inches. 
</P>
<P>
 The sinkage is but the latest difficulty for what already is the most 
expensive subway project per mile in U.S. history. The project's first tunnel 
walls were built thinner than designed by another contractor. And according to 
an independent review, the MTA's construction management firm conducted 
substandard inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had pledged improved quality and oversight for new construction. A 
proving ground for these efforts was to be the roughly 12 miles of twin tunnels 
from Wilshire Boulevard north to Hollywood Boulevard and west to La Brea 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The $165-million contract won by Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, the largest on the subway 
project, is expected to exceed $200 million because of the sinkage and earlier 
construction difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 When tunneling was just under way in June 1993, MTA rail construction 
President Edward McSpedon voiced optimism about his ability to control the cost 
and quality of the work. He said the transit agency was spending more for soil 
borings to prevent contractors from claiming that they encountered unexpected 
conditions underground. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the investment in more borings will more than pay for itself, 
many times over," McSpedon said in an interview. "We have poked more holes in 
Vermont Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard than a pin cushion . . . The more 
information you have, the smarter you are." 
</P>
<P>
 One month later, on July 8, 1993, tunneling operations came to a halt when 
underground water flooded the excavation at the eastern end of Hollywood 
Boulevard. Tunneling ceased until January 1994, while the equivalent of a small 
town's water supply was pumped into storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 The project fell nine months behind schedule as a result of the flooding and a 
three-week closure, ordered after scores of alleged worker safety violations 
were uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an MTA engineering consultant, Paul Eller, warned McSpedon's staff 
in an October, 1993, meeting that they should enforce a specification requiring 
"contact grouting" of the tunnels. Eller, The Times has learned, said he 
believed that irregular ground subsidence already was occurring above the 
tunnels on Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 John Adams, vice president of construction for the MTA, said that he and 
others rejected Eller's advice. Adams said he believed that contact grouting 
was unnecessary because the same, ground-stabilizing benefits could be gained 
through other procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached recently, Eller declined to discuss his advice, saying: "This is going 
to come to a head at some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Contact grouting entails the injection of grout into the soil from within each 
freshly dug, circular section of tunnel. It is designed to help prevent sinking 
by ensuring tight contact between the concrete tunnel liner and the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The specifications for the Vermont and Hollywood tunnels required the 
contractor to grout within 16 hours of each four-foot advancement of the tunnel 
boring machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Shea-Kiewit-Kenny had proposed at the outset of tunneling that contact 
grouting be eliminated. One MTA official said that up to $1 million could have 
been saved if none of the grouting had been required. 
</P>
<P>
 Although tunneling ensued without grouting -- and as data showed sinking along 
both Hollywood and Vermont -- McSpedon's staff delayed deciding whether to 
require the grouting until March, 1994, after roughly one-third of the tunnels 
had been dug. 
</P>
<P>
 After the contractor continued to object to the grouting, Salvatore J. 
Calvanico, an engineer employed by the MTA's management firm, 
Parsons-Dillingham, wrote in an April report that benefits of performing the 
grouting "far outweigh any minor cost savings." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the MTA did not originally require Shea-Kiewit-Kenny to comply with 
the contract specification, MTA project manager Joel J. Sandberg said: "We have 
to consider anything that's proposed" to save money. The tunneling, he said, 
was allowed to continue on a "test basis" without grouting. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily inspection reports show that Shea-Kiewit-Kenny did not contact grout 
about 340 linear feet of tunnel -- a span longer than a football field -- 
between Whitley and Las Palmas avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, inspectors repeatedly noted that they had no way of determining 
what volume of grout was being pumped. The contract required accurate 
monitoring of the grout quantities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a little more consistency in how we're reporting the tunnel 
grouting," Chris Dixon, project manager for Parsons-Dillingham, said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 By July 27, according to a recent MTA report, Hollywood Boulevard had sunk 
four inches. 
</P>
<P>
 One Parsons-Dillingham inspector, Michael N. Graber, cited the contractor for 
failing to comply with the tunnel grouting specification, other records show. 
Graber filed his four "non-conformance reports" on Aug. 3, 8, 9 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 His logs, part of thousands of pages reviewed under the California Public 
Records Act, separately noted that the contractor's grout pumping equipment had 
broken down.

 On Aug. 13, a broken waterline flooded the Pacific Theatre, two blocks away. 
On Aug. 17, an inspector reported "ground loss" in the form of sinking, wet 
sand near Highland Avenue. At 11 a.m. on Aug. 18, tunneling was halted. On Aug. 
20, officials conceded that a nine-block area of the boulevard had sunk by up 
to nine inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspector Bud Morris' log that day captured the concern beneath the ground: At 
1 p.m., Morris wrote, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny's superintendent evacuated his workers, 
fearing that "the tunnel was caving in." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts who spoke on condition of anonymity said that at the first signs of 
significant sinkage on Hollywood Boulevard, the MTA could have minimized 
further settlement by ordering the contractor to inject grout from the ground 
surface downward. 
</P>
<P>
 This process, called "compaction grouting," is expensive and slows excavation. 
But it routinely is done when significant surface settlement is feared. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, after sinkage of four inches was detected on Vermont Avenue, 
Metro Rail engineer Stephen J. Navin on Oct. 28, 1993, ordered 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny to conduct compaction grouting from the surface "to arrest 
this continued settlement," records show. 
</P>
<P>
 And MTA officials now are using compaction grouting to stabilize the soil on 
Hollywood Boulevard above existing tunnels and in the path of future 
excavation. Tons of grout have been injected over the past three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandberg, the MTA project manager, confirmed that at least one staff engineer 
had recommended compaction grouting in late July or early August, when 
officials learned that the ground had sunk up to four inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was considered and it wasn't viewed that it would necessarily be 
effective," Sandberg said. Sandberg said he also had to weigh the disadvantages 
caused by compaction grouting, including a slowdown to tunneling and disruption 
to automobile traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandberg also said that the project's chief design engineer, Timothy P. 
Smirnoff, advised him at the time that compaction grouting was not necessary. 
Smirnoff's boss, Martin Rubin, said that the engineer and colleagues 
"determined that grouting would not significantly reduce settlements." Rubin, 
commenting on Smirnoff's behalf, said that other preventive measures were 
taken, including "more frequent monitoring" by inspectors and adjusting of the 
tunnel-boring machine. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Smirnoff who drafted an MTA "Tunnel Review Board" report that on Sept. 
1 recommended the use of compaction grouting, contact grouting and other 
precautions during the remainder of the tunneling. 
</P>
<P>
 The report cited a combination of factors that contributed to the ground 
sinkage, including the broken water lines and "indetectable" differences in 
soil characteristics. Records show that one panelist who signed Smirnoff's 
report, soils specialist James P. Gould, had told officials in writing Nov. 15 
that contact grouting would not be necessary in the loose, sandy soil beneath 
Hollywood Boulevard if "water problems" were controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould said in an interview that he stands by his earlier advice, noting that 
broken water mains did dampen some of the soil. He said he believes that 
contact grouting is of marginal benefit if other tunneling procedures are 
performed properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as preparations continue for a resumption of tunneling, members of the 
City Council are waiting for further assurances that the work can be done 
safely. On Sept. 2, they authorized city attorneys to seek a court order 
blocking construction if independent engineering tests do not allay concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, you've got people presiding over a fiasco," City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, who also sits on the MTA board of directors, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not adequate over- sight on the part of (MTA) executives over the 
construction process. They have got to quit apologizing for the contractors and 
quit sweeping things under the rug." BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 The $3-billion Los Angeles subway is being financed with federal transit funds 
and two half-cent sales taxes approved by Los Angeles County voters. Currently, 
4.4 miles of tunnels carry passengers from Union Station to MacArthur Park. The 
subway is part of a regional transit network that includes aboveground rail 
service connecting Downtown to Long Beach, the Santa Clarita Valley and the 
Inland Empire. Digging Difficulties 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in late July, the surface of Hollywood Boulevard sank several inches 
immediately after subway tunneling machines progressed westward, 50 feet below 
the street. The sinking caused closure of the street from Aug. 19 to Aug. 22. 
The portion is still partially obstructed to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Segments of one subway tunnel were not stabilized with grout during 
excavation.

CUBA DELAYS CLAMPDOWN ON RAFTERS; MIGRATION: HAVANA WILL WAIT UNTIL TUESDAY TO 
HALT THOSE FLEEING ISLAND. DECISION CATCHES U.S. BY SURPRISE. POSTPONEMENT OF 
KEY TERM OF ACCORD ALLOWS FINAL SURGE OF ESCAPES. 
</P>

<P>
 In a move that caught U.S. officials by surprise, the Cuban government is 
delaying until Tuesday its clampdown on rafters sailing for the United States, 
effectively postponing strong measures called for under the agreement just 
reached by the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 While a statement issued by the government of Cuban President Fidel Castro 
late Friday night did exhort citizens to stop their dangerous voyages into the 
Florida Straits, it said there would be no arrests or confiscation of crafts 
for a 72-hour period beginning at noon Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Michael Skol, the chief U.S. 
negotiator in the immigration talks with Cuba, warned Saturday that as far as 
Washington is concerned, the agreement "went into effect the moment it was 
signed Friday afternoon and we expect and assume the Cuban government will 
comply." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Cuba pledged to "take effective measures in every way it 
possibly can" to stop the exodus. At no point during talks in New York last 
week did the Cuban delegation bring up a 72-hour delay, U.S. officials said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba's surprise move has allowed a last swell of rafters to flee the 
beleaguered island. Early Saturday, more than a dozen rafts cast off from 
Gunabo and Cojimar, coastal suburbs of Havana, as many others continued work on 
makeshift vessels crafted from oil drums, pipes, inner tubes, wood and cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard reported having picked up 447 rafters by 9 p.m. EDT. Recent 
daily totals typically have been more than 1,000 rafters a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the new accord, the United States agreed to increase the number 
of visas granted Cuban citizens to a minimum of 20,000, in exchange for a Cuban 
agreement to halt the exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands have fled the economic and political impoverishment of Cuba during 
the past year, especially since a wave of hijackings of government vessels and 
an anti-government protest in early August led Castro to end efforts to prevent 
the escapes. A resulting shift in U.S. policy has sent more recent refugees to 
detention camps at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, producing 
frustrations among those held there. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,500 Cubans broke out of their camps Saturday to protest the new 
agreement, Defense Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of refugees walked about half a mile to the base's Navy Exchange and 
restaurant area about 1 p.m., but most began voluntarily returning to their 
camps by 2:30 p.m., the department said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 About half an hour later, Marine Brig. Gen. Michael J. Williams, who heads 
operations at the camps, spoke to about 500 to 600 Cubans who remained, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a 30-minute discussion, this group also began returning to their 
camps," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Military security personnel dressed in riot gear and armed with fixed bayonets 
escorted the Cubans back, according to the statement. At least one refugee -- a 
35-year-old man -- suffered a shoulder wound from a bayonet, and authorities 
said they were trying to confirm a report that one other person was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured man was reported in stable condition at the base's hospital, where 
he was to remain overnight for observation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. officials expressed frustration at Castro's hesitant first steps 
toward carrying out the new accord, they also appeared willing to give his 
government limited leeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not dictating to the Cubans how they're going to go about implementing 
this agreement," a senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 A State Department spokesman added: "We will judge Cuba's compliance by what 
happens. We're more concerned about the numbers in the water than what happens 
on the beaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts on the region said Saturday that it was unrealistic to expect 
Castro to be able to bring the migration wave under control immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The immigration crisis originated in part because so many Cubans wanted to 
escape that Castro was unable to control them. On Aug. 5, the Cuban leader 
faced the first real riot and anti-government demonstration of his more than 
three decades in power. Because he has lost a bit of his legendary control, 
some experts said, the confrontations on the beach will be risky for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real test will be to see how many Cubans come out and whether in 72 hours 
Castro's gradually able to control the flow," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tuesday noon, the Cuban government's statement said, Havana will be 
prepared to use force if necessary to stop the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials said force was unnecessary, noting that the Cuban 
government could end sales of materials used to make the rafts or control the 
access and departure routes along river ports and Caribbean shores. 
</P>
<P>
 In Havana, the government-owned Granma newspaper Saturday heralded the new 
pact, calling it a "reasonable and just solution, mutually useful and 
realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators reached the agreement after Cuba abandoned its insistence on 
expanding the talks to include the U.S. economic embargo and U.S. propaganda 
broadcasts, which Cuba charged were responsible for the exodus. U.S. officials 
cited several reasons Saturday for Cuba's change. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost, Cuba recognized that an accord would set a precedent that could 
possibly open a dialogue on meatier issues, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cuban government also wanted to demonstrate it was capable of conducting 
negotiations with the United States and coming to an agreement, U.S. officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Castro was embarrassed by the international publicity about the exodus, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it was almost ironically portrayed as an American problem, people 
were risking their lives to get out of his country," the senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the official said, when the United States reaffirmed that the sole 
focus of the talks would be immigration, Cuba caved in. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere Saturday, 14 presidents of Latin American and Caribbean nations 
appealed to the United States to lift its 32-year economic embargo on Cuba and 
asked for democratic reforms in the communist state. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting in Brazil, the so-called Rio Group of democratically elected 
leaders said they "consider indispensable a peaceful transition toward a 
democratic and pluralist system in Cuba that will respect human rights and 
freedom of opinion, that is consonant with the popular will."

RUDDER FAILURE SEEN AS POSSIBLE CAUSE OF CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers continued the grim task of recovering dismembered bodies from the 
wreckage of USAir Flight 427 on Saturday as attention focused on the 
possibility that a malfunctioning rudder system may have caused the crash of 
the Boeing 737 jetliner that killed all 132 on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence was still sketchy, but experts were studying the similarities between 
Thursday's crash at Pittsburgh International Airport and the crash of a United 
Airlines 737 four years ago near Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Both planes suddenly rolled over, went into a steep dive and crashed nose 
first as they were preparing to land. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the 1990 crash has never officially been determined. But the 
National Transportation Safety Board listed two possible causes: severe 
rotating winds or a malfunctioning rudder system. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also found that one of six thrust reversers recovered so far had 
been accidentally deployed but said it may have happened on impact and it 
appeared to be an unlikely factor in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Schiff, a veteran airline pilot who has been working on a Justice 
Department investigation of the Colorado accident, said the rudder failure 
scenario "seems to make a lot of sense" in the Pittsburgh and Colorado crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that while rotating winds were reported in Colorado, there were no 
reports of dangerous winds here, "so that sort of leaves you with the rudder in 
the Pittsburgh crash." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 737 and other planes, the rudder is a large, hinged slab on the 
trailing edge of the tail's vertical fin. Operated by foot pedals, the rudder 
swings to the right and left, helping a plane turn right or left by pushing the 
tail in the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Large jetliners like the 737 have a "yaw damper" -- a mechanism that 
automatically deflects the rudder slightly to straighten the plane out when 
winds buffet the tail from side to side. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff said the pedals do not move when the rudder makes these corrections, 
and the pilot has no sense that they are occurring. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there are growing suspicions that in the Colorado crash, the yaw 
damper suddenly made an uncommanded full deflection of the rudder -- possibly 
due to some sort of electrical failure in the damper's hydraulic system. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would make a plane start to yaw (turn to the side), then roll, then go 
down steeply," Schiff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is what the 737 did in Colorado Springs, and apparently that is what the 
plane did in Pittsburgh," he added. "If . . . (full rudder deflection by the 
yaw damper) is what happened, the pilots wouldn't feel it on the pedals and 
they must have wondered what the hell was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the NTSB's investigation of the Colorado crash, the Federal 
Aviation Administration ordered that rudders be inspected regularly on all 
737s. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane that crashed here was inspected four times this year, the last time 
less than a month ago, and the NTSB said that no problems had been found. 
</P>
<P>
 NTSB investigators say "black box" recordings of what the pilot and co-pilot 
of Flight 427 said during the final seconds of flight "does not help us much" 
in determining what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 NTSB investigators say the plane's other "black box" -- a flight data recorder 
containing 14 different kinds of information on the 737's control settings and 
performance during the last moments of flight -- is expected to provide more 
clues on what caused the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators interviewed witnesses and studied maintenance records 
Saturday. They also were able to identify much of the wreckage, and they talked 
to air traffic controllers who were on duty and flight crews of other planes 
that were flying near the airport when the crash occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the engines were located. Although one of six thrust-reverse 
activators from the right engine was found in a deployed position, a source 
close to the investigation said the deployment probably happened on impact. He 
said it appears unlikely that thrust reversal was a factor in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 If it was deployed during the flight, the plane probably would have rolled to 
the right instead of the left, said NTSB member Carl Vogt. Witnesses have all 
reported that the plane rolled to the left. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Vogt said, "any evidence that the thrust reverser accidentally 
deployed is something that demands serious attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Thrust reversers are normally deployed after landing to bring a plane to a 
quick stop. Much like reversing a motor on a vacuum cleaner, they direct the 
blast forward instead of backward. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the day's efforts were concentrated on the grisly job of 
recovering mangled human remains on a forested ridge about seven miles 
northeast of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovery team, working under a warm sun, sweltered in the heavy yellow 
bio-hazard coveralls worn to protect them from blood-borne pathogens, such as 
AIDS or hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Each body part had to be charted as to location and photographed before it 
could be removed. The job was slow, painstaking and often heartbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the information did not provide enough for positive identification. 
Authorities weren't sure when, or if, the information would be released to the 
public, or if all the victims could eventually be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still pretty bad up there," said Fred David, chief of the Hopewell 
Township Police Department, which has jurisdiction in the area. "But at least 
the weather's better. It's stopped raining." 
</P>
<P>
 Human remains were sent to the morgue at a nearby Air National Guard base. 
There they were tested after they were taken from plastic bags. Labels 
containing all the information known about the parts were attached to the bags. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying our best," said Terry Tatalovich, deputy coroner of Beaver 
County, Pa. "It's a little early in the game to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 coroners from neighboring counties were helping 150 members of the 
Air National Guard sift through the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're working as delicately as possible," said Fire Marshal John Kaus. 
"These are human beings. We're not stacking bodies on top of one another. We're 
treating these individuals with the utmost respect." 
</P>
<P>
 The job was about 60% finished Saturday, and it was expected to be completed 
on Monday, Kaus said.

REVIEWS MIXED FOR TRIAL RUN OF YOUTH CORPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 One steamy afternoon earlier this summer, a dozen young college students were 
sweeping broken bottles off a basketball court in a rundown park, picking up 
abandoned trash around a jungle gym and quietly trying to make a difference in 
the lives of neighborhood children who -- in their own way -- are castoffs too. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the college students, 20-year-old Londa Scott, paused to reflect on the 
task at hand and on the larger challenge of helping the children and teen-agers 
who worked alongside her to steer their lives away from the drugs, crime and 
rootlessness that shadowed their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "You pass the park days later and see that the trash is back, so, in a way, 
that's disappointing," said Scott, a senior at Maryland's Towson State 
University. "What's not disappointing is being a positive role model, day after 
day, with these kids. It's one-on-one, up close and personal. It's not just a 
job. It means a lot more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed it does, in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 The college students and their less fortunate charges were part of a pilot 
program run in cities across the country this summer as a kind of shakedown 
test of AmeriCorps, the Clinton Administration's new national service program 
that is scheduled to begin full-scale operation Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The program seeks to apply the altruistic pragmatism of President John F. 
Kennedy's Peace Corps to needy sectors of the United States. It will begin with 
20,000 paid volunteers and a first-year budget of $365 million for 330 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Long sought by liberals as a potentially valuable tool for getting at the root 
causes of crime, gangs, welfare dependency and other problems afflicting 
America's poor, AmeriCorps is the only such social program that President 
Clinton was able to win from a skittish, budget-conscious Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 And its success or failure may help determine whether other such programs -- 
shunned in recent years as costly and ineffective experiments in social 
engineering -- are given a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the summer test programs, the theoretical benefits could be 
large, but concrete successes will not be easy to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,500 college-age volunteers took part in the test run, known as the 
National Service Summer of Safety. Each received a $1,000 educational stipend 
in addition to a minimum-wage salary for eight weeks of work. The individual 
programs varied widely, but the overall goal was to reduce crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, volunteers spent the summer monitoring school playgrounds in 
dangerous neighborhoods. In San Francisco, the participants were former gang 
members who patrolled dangerous areas, intervening when trouble brewed and 
urging gang members away from violence and drugs. In Austin, Tex., the jobs 
went to public housing residents instead of college students in an effort to 
improve their work skills while giving them more of a stake in the places where 
they live. In Denver, college students and would-be college students sought to 
guide children toward further education and away from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes program directors had ideas about how to pursue their mission that 
were not exactly what the program's creators had in mind. A Summer of Safety 
group in San Francisco organized 40 other groups for a rally against the crime 
bill's "three strikes and you're out" provision, which the President supported. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, however, the efforts were less political. 
</P>
<P>
 While the formal assessments have not yet been made, program participants and 
government officials said some of the summer projects turned out to be examples 
of government-run social programs at their best, offering dedicated young 
people a chance to change their own lives while tangibly improving their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, the projects fell victim to the pitfalls that have tripped up 
such programs in the past. Poorly conceived and badly organized, they burned up 
scarce tax dollars, provided few benefits to anyone and sapped the enthusiasm 
of young people by putting them into make-work jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hector Garcia, a 19-year-old Austin participant whose job was to work with 
young children at a learning center in a public housing development, Summer of 
Safety was unexpected proof that he could be part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know I could do so much work. Mainly, with me, work was practicing 
basketball," he said. "But if you can get to the little kids and show them 
what's right before they grow up, that's what works. 
</P>
<P>
 "They consider me a grown-up, so they listen to me pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 In that same program, however, other participants were sometimes bored and 
uninspired. 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy Clark, a 26-year-old single mother, was posted in the file room of the 
Austin Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a waste of time. They wouldn't let you do anything," said Clark, who 
eventually talked her way out of the file room and into the learning center of 
the housing project where she lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington officials who have taken national service from a campaign 
promise to a federal policy view these lessons soberly. 
</P>
<P>
 "AmeriCorps has got to have lasting benefits for the community if it is going 
to delight the American public," said Eli Segal, who heads the program for the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 He conceded that this objective was not always reached during the short summer 
shakedown, saying that "the real drawback to the summer program is: What can 
you expect to get done in eight weeks?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Segal expressed confidence that the public will support the full-scale 
AmeriCorps as a good use of its tax dollars, both because of the work it will 
accomplish and the lifelong service ethic it will foster among participants and 
those they inspire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to solve the country's problems of crime, illiteracy, 
pollution and disease," Segal said. "But we are going to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Segal estimated that the program will cost the government $18,000 per 
participant per year for salary, benefits and program costs, as well as an 
educational stipend of $4,725. Congress has already allocated $585 million for 
the second year of the program. Funding for the third year and beyond will 
depend on what Congress and the public think of the program by then. 
</P>
<P>
 In Denver, the summer of 1993 became known by the inglorious title, "the 
Summer of Violence," so public officials were eager for as many Summer of 
Safety participants as they could get. Forty-five nonprofit groups and state 
and local agencies hired 137 Summer of Safety participants. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some of the most troubled sections of Denver did not participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't re-establish grass-roots involvement by dictating what every 
neighborhood should be doing," said Lance Clem, Colorado Gov. Roy Romer's point 
man on the project. "If they didn't come in with a proposal, they didn't get 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said it would take time before they could judge the program's 
effect, but the anecdotal evidence was encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosita Martinez, 18, spent the summer expanding the horizons of some of the 
city's poorest children. They visited the zoo, explored museums, hiked in Rocky 
Mountain National Park, watched movies and tried in-line skating. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing for them to do here," Martinez said. "So I decided I was 
going to show them opportunities -- something other than despair." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the children, who are primarily Spanish-speaking, were 
coached in English, self-defense and self-esteem and taught to use a library. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids had never heard of college," Martinez said. "Now, they are saying 
things like, 'When I'm 18, I'm going to college.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She said she discouraged them from joining gangs and comforted them when they 
were victims of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, a 10-year-old showed her cigarette burns near his wrist that he said 
his older brother had inflicted in front of friends, who all had laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't spend time around him when you can help it," she urged him, promising 
to speak with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the educational stipend, a small scholarship she received and money she 
plans to save from a clerical job this fall, Martinez hopes to be able to go to 
community college in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the volunteers -- especially in the Los Angeles, San Francisco and 
Austin projects -- said they initially were attracted to the program because it 
was a summer job with decent pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started out for the money, but by the end I was feeling so good about 
myself and what I learned I can accomplish," said Sandra Minjarez, 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Minjarez organized a graffiti-and-trash cleanup at the Austin housing project 
where she lives. She knocked on doors and recruited children and adults to help 
so that they would have a vested interest in keeping the place clean. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can do this much in eight weeks, think of what I can do with more time," 
she said. "It gave me confidence in myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 40 participants in Austin were welfare recipients. As the project 
drew to a close, however, almost none had plans for future jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, where most of the participants were ex-gang members and some 
said they probably would have been dealing drugs if they had not participated 
in Summer of Safety, that way of life still loomed menacingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Romero, who only has a seventh-grade education and quit a gang just a 
month before starting the program, said she was amazed by how she and her 
Summer of Safety colleagues were able to organize movies that members of rival 
gangs would attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the 24th St. boys walk in and then the Bryant St. gang. And, I thought, 
'Oh my God, what's gonna happen?" she recalled. "Everybody just sat down in 
their own corners. It felt good." 
</P>
<P>
 But she asked, "What am I going to do now, where am I going to go?" 
</P>
<P>
 There was similar ambivalence at Raymond Avenue Elementary School in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight Summer of Safety participants were particularly helpful one day when 
police called the assistant principal to warn her that a SWAT team was going to 
assault a nearby house that was the target of a drug case. The raid lasted 
longer than expected and a class had headed out for recess while it was still 
under way. The young adults rounded up the children and brought them safely 
back inside the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a working intercom here, so the SOS kids were great," said 
Assistant Principal Chiquita Watt. 
</P>
<P>
 The downside to the program, Watt said, was that having the volunteers around 
made her job more difficult: She had eight more people to manage. 
</P>
<P>
 The children targeted by the Baltimore project also had mixed opinions on 
whether it is showing them an alternative to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 If he had not spent the summer with the Baltimore Summer of Safety group, one 
14-year-old boy said, he would probably have been hanging out with his older 
brother while he sold drugs. The boy was on probation. Last winter, he broke 
into a neighbor's house and stole a television set, a VCR and some Nintendo 
games. But he left his hat behind and was caught. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing good now because I'm on this program," the boy conceded, taking a 
break from sweeping up glass. But the program's activities had little appeal: 
"It's hectic, all this waking up early and cleaning. I hate cleaning." 
</P>
<P>
 More important, at least in the brief period, he did not believe that he had 
formed any lasting attachment to the college students with whom he had worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know them that much for them to be my role model."

FAMILIES GRASP FOR INFORMATION LIFELINE; CUBANS: NEWS OF LOVED ONES' FATES IN 
REFUGEE EXODUS IS PAINFULLY SCANTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Migrants detained in dreary camps approach strangers from the outside world 
with hope in their eyes and crumpled pieces of paper in their hands bearing the 
scribbled names of relatives from Florida to California, wherever the far-flung 
Cuban diaspora has taken them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're completely isolated," lamented Odalis Gonzalez, a 29-year-old mother 
from Havana, accompanied behind the barbed wire by her 11-year-old son, Yosset. 
She asked a reporter to telephone a sister in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in Miami, hundreds of apprehensive residents make the pilgrimage 
every day to the drab stucco building of Radio Mambi, a Spanish-language 
station that posts the latest lists of those held at Guantanamo and other 
sites. Their ultimate fear: that loved ones who took to the rafts to risk a 
treacherous escape from President Fidel Castro's Cuba have perished in the 
Florida Straits. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother left with my two sons 12 days ago, and we haven't heard a word," 
said a distraught Luis Sosa after yet another disappointing examination of the 
rolls at Radio Mambi. "Imagine how one feels in such a terrible situation." 
</P>
<P>
 And in Cuba, residents listen intently to radio broadcasts from Miami giving 
names of rescued migrants and examine partial lists circulating in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The seaborne exodus of thousands of Cubans on small craft has been a 
wrenching, traumatic experience for both migrants and their families in the 
United States, Cuba and elsewhere. Anguish about separated loved ones is 
weighing heavily on Cubans and Cuban Americans alike. 
</P>
<P>
 A broad information chasm has only made things worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The more than 26,000 Cubans detained here, like the 14,000-plus Haitians who 
are sharing the naval base's hospitality, worry that relatives know nothing 
about their fates and fear the worst. Communication with loved ones is 
virtually nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 No family visits are allowed at this U.S. bastion on the southeast corner of 
the Western Hemisphere's last communist enclave. Many Cubans, accustomed to 
hearing about exiles' political clout, cling to the hope that kin will somehow 
be able to get them out of here -- although the White House says they are to be 
held indefinitely in Guantanamo and in third nations such as Panama, with no 
prospect of entry to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. military forces here, mostly young soldiers abruptly transformed into 
overseers of refugees, have struggled to keep pace with the influx and provide 
the essentials -- shelter, food, water and medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Mail, messages and telephone service have not been a priority. Authorities 
hope to soon set up some kind of postal system in conjunction with the Red 
Cross, and AT&T plans to open long-distance lines in Guantanamo for collect 
calls from rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're absolutely desperate for information and communication," said Marine 
Brig. Gen. Michael J. Williams, who heads operations here. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, camp residents typically rely on anonymous visitors to relay crucial 
developments about their whereabouts and the status of ill relatives, missing 
children and other intimate family concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "This boy's mother needs to know that her son is here," Aleyla Claro explained 
breathlessly to a journalist interviewing Cubans bound for the new camps in 
Panama. Back in Miami, Grisel Ortega was duly informed that her 7-year-old son, 
Edgar Acosta, was among the first of 10,000 Cubans transferred to Panama, where 
conditions are said to be better and family visits are permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 In information-starved southern Florida, capital of the Cuban American 
community, telephone service with Cuba is so erratic that many people cannot 
determine whether their loved ones have left the island. Nagging suspicions 
impel them to the impersonal lists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is my cousin!" exclaimed one young woman examining the rolls 
outside Radio Mambi this week, her finger planted beneath one name on a wall 
filled with computer printouts from Guantanamo and the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service detention centers near Miami and in Port Isabel, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Studying the listings has become a somber daily routine in Florida, a 
modern-day version of queues to examine casualty rolls of wars past. 
Spanish-language newspapers in Florida publish the names on a regular basis. 
Radio stations broadcast the monotonous rolls, along with occasional curt 
messages -- typically, "We're all safe," -- relayed from Guantanamo. Impromptu 
support groups have formed to pool often-unconfirmed bits of information. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is great uncertainty," said the Rev. Rafael Lira, a Mexican priest 
working at the Sacred Heart Chapel near Little Havana. The site was one of 
several where processions were held last week in honor of Cuba's Roman Catholic 
patroness, la Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, who, appropriately, is also the 
protector of navigators and the shipwrecked. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply finding a loved one's name on a list is a source of relief and even 
exhilaration, although life at the sweltering, makeshift camps is difficult and 
detainees face uncertain futures. Everyone recognizes that rafts and other 
jerry-built small craft can be no match for the shark-infested Florida Straits 
during the perilous 90-mile crossing to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Benito Blanco, who had checked the photocopied lists outside Radio Mambi 
daily, was growing more pessimistic by the day. Six relatives, including two 
brothers, left Cuba's northern coast eight days ago. There was still no word. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hopeful, but I have to recognize that they may be at the bottom of the 
sea," concluded Blanco, a 49-year-old laborer who went to Florida during the 
Mariel boat lift of 1980, the last large-scale burst of Cuban emigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Another man peering over lists said that he, his wife and two children reached 
the Florida coast on July 4 after a clandestine boat trip from the Havana beach 
of Sagua la Grande. That was before the current flood of would-be immigrants 
prompted the White House to reverse the longstanding policy of giving refuge to 
all Cubans who make it to U.S. shores. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the man was worried about his mother, sister and six other relatives, who 
all left in a 20-foot boat from the same Havana strand a week ago. The escape 
craft may have drifted to Louisiana, the man speculated hopefully, citing a 
news report that a boat of that size carrying Cubans had landed near New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 The torment is only accentuated for those who encouraged loved ones to embark 
on the hazardous trip, confident that the U.S. Coast Guard would quickly pick 
them up and take them to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else could I do? My mother told me there was no more milk for the 
children in Cuba," said Sosa, whose mother and children, ages 9 and 14, 
departed from Havana's Playa Jaimanita. 
</P>
<P>
 Sosa and his wife, Tania Rodriguez, themselves had set sail in a raft from the 
same beach two years ago, making landfall in the Florida Keys three days later. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple hoped to bring in the family legally, but Sosa, echoing a common 
perception, complained that immigration applications processed at the U.S. 
interests section in Havana were routinely denied after endless delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Many whose relatives are in the Guantanamo camps say the names never appeared 
on the official lists; they learned of their loved ones' whereabouts from 
journalists and other visitors. Relatives have become accustomed to receiving 
late-night telephone calls from someone who heard something from someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at all the lists, listening to the radio, trying to contact 
people however we can," said Elizabeth Rodriguez of Tampa, Fla., who was 
informed by a reporter that her nephew was being held at Guantanamo. "People 
are desperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Cubans and Cuban Americans, Rodriguez said she deeply resents the 
Clinton Administration's new policy of detaining Cubans. Many complain that the 
United States long used fleeing Cubans as vivid Cold War symbols when it served 
U.S. foreign policy purposes, but now caricatures them as prospective drains on 
public coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't it be more economical and more humane to let them be with their 
families, who will support them, help them find work?" asked Rodriguez, who 
fled to the United States 30 years ago in the first great wave of emigration 
after then-rebel leader Castro entered Havana from his base in the Sierra 
Maestra, not far from Guantanamo. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Rodriguez is eager to lend a hand to nieces, nephews and other 
relatives, many of whom she has never met. It is a widespread sentiment in the 
Cuban exile community. "Is the United States going to keep these people in 
camps until Fidel falls or dies?" Rodriguez wondered aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 Those left behind in Cuba don't even have the limited comfort of regular 
access to the lists, leaving them little hope of discovering the fates of 
just-departed husbands and wives, children and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please call my family in Cuba," Javier Rodrigues Freloe implored a visitor in 
Guantanamo. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodrigues explained that he lost all his meager belongings -- including 
cherished papers detailing relatives' whereabouts in the United States -- 
during the difficult raft voyage. Half a dozen others here also said they could 
not find their lists of addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 But without postal and telephone service, even those few Guantanamo detainees 
with detailed directories have little hope of getting in touch with kin. The 
maddening sense of isolation from loved ones has greatly aggravated tensions in 
the tent cities. Over and over detainees repeat the same complaint: Our loved 
ones don't know if we're alive or dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're cut off from everything," sighed Jose Antonio Echeverria, a 37-year-old 
former hotel administrator from Santiago de Cuba who arrived in Guantanamo two 
weeks ago with his mother, wife and 1-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Communication is so poor here that Jeffrey Lomal has been unable to contact 
his wife and daughter -- even though he said they arrived at Guantanamo with 
him almost three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The family was split up and placed in separate camps, Lomal explained, after 
he was hospitalized on Guantanamo for dehydration and severe sunburn following 
his harrowing four-day journey from Cuba on a raft crafted from inner tubes. 
Military authorities have been unresponsive, according to Lomal, a 31-year-old 
former broadcast technician from Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must find my family," he said, dazed and close to tears as he stood in the 
shade of a giant tent, his barracks-mates trying to console him. "They are 
everything to me."

NEWS ANALYSIS; DEATH PENALTY MOVE ALTERS SIMPSON CASE DRAMATICALLY; COURTS: 
JURY SELECTION MAY NOW FAVOR DEFENSE SIDE, EXPERTS SAY. GARCETTI COULD FACE 
SOME POLITICAL FALLOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decision by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office not to seek 
the death penalty against O.J. Simpson shifts the dimensions of the closely 
watched case, exposes the county's chief prosecutor to potential political 
fallout and dramatically alters many aspects of the upcoming trial, most 
notably the jury selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews Saturday, legal analysts and others said the decision may subtly 
affect future death penalty cases and may, at least in the short run, bring new 
attention to the issue of capital punishment by linking it to such a well-known 
celebrity. Its greatest impact, however, will be on the Simpson trial, where 
experts say it will shape the panel of prospective jurors, shorten jury 
selection and possibly leave prosecutors with a pool of potential jurors less 
inclined to convict Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the move represents the first ratcheting down of the 
intensity in the Simpson case, which has galvanized national attention since 
the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were found June 13. 
Simpson has pleaded not guilty to those murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This takes a bit of the cliffhanging drama out of it," said Sherry Bebitch 
Jeffe, senior associate at the Center for Politics and Economics of the 
Claremont Graduate School. "It's still a fascinating murder mystery, but some 
of the soap opera is gone from it when it's not a struggle for life and death." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the decision announced Friday probably means that the Simpson trial 
-- which has sparked public discussion about hot-button issues such as domestic 
abuse, racism and police conduct -- will not become a vehicle for prolonged 
debate about yet another contentious topic, the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had the prosecution sought the death penalty here, it would have been an 
occasion to talk about capital punishment in society, about its imposition in a 
racist manner and about the other issues it raises," said Erwin Chemerinsky, a 
USC law professor. "We'll hear some discussion about this over the next several 
days, but it won't go on for months, as it would have if the prosecution had 
sought the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 In the short run, opponents of capital punishment say, the Simpson case may 
call new attention to their efforts, which have met with little support from 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simpson's case has educated people about the importance of having adequate 
legal representation as well as having access to independent experts, and that 
is what is missing in so many capital cases," said Stephen B. Bright, director 
of the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Bright cited the case of Gary Nelson, sentenced to death in Georgia in 1978 
for raping and murdering a 6-year-old girl. In contrast to the high-powered 
team of attorneys backing Simpson, Nelson's lawyer had never tried a death 
penalty case before, was paid about $20 an hour and gave a closing argument 
that was a minuscule 255 words. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson spent 11 years on Death Row before his conviction was overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months since Simpson's arrest, Bright said, new attention has focused 
on the death penalty and its application. But he and others worried that 
interest may wane now that the issue is disappearing from the Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, the issue is not likely to go away so quickly. 
Few topics in criminal justice are as charged as capital punishment, and some 
political analysts say that if Garcetti runs for reelection, he will have to 
fight off accusations that he yielded to pressure in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, some critics have accused his office of playing politics by not 
seeking the death penalty against Simpson while pursuing it against Erik and 
Lyle Menendez, who are charged with first-degree murder in the shotgun killings 
of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Others attacked the district attorney for failing to seek the penalty in a 
case in which domestic abuse is alleged. And still others criticized him for 
their perception that prosecutors relied on a focus group that met last month 
in Phoenix to help decide whether to try to seek Simpson's execution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters elected Garcetti to make these decisions himself, not to go to a 
focus group," said author John Gregory Dunne, who described himself as "truly 
appalled" by that move. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I find most appalling is that he went to Phoenix to a focus group, and 
the focus group discussions indicated that a death sentence would never fly," 
said Dunne, who has written about the Simpson case for an upcoming issue of the 
New York Review of Books. "Eisenhower didn't use a focus group in 1944 to 
decide whether to attack in Normandy." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti could face backlash from women's groups as well. Gloria Allred, a 
prominent Los Angeles lawyer and president of the Women's Equal Rights Legal 
Defense and Education Fund, called a news conference Saturday to issue a 
furious denunciation of the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "The D.A.'s decision in my opinion reflects a callous and conscious disregard 
for the value that should be placed on the life of Nicole Brown Simpson and 
Ronald Goldman," Allred said. "It is apparently not enough that they were 
killed in a bloody and brutal slaying but now to make matters worse, they have, 
in my opinion, become human sacrifices on the altar of racial politics for the 
basest and crassest of reasons, to try to shore up the career of Dist. Atty. 
Gil Garcetti." 
</P>
<P>
 Allred, who had urged Garcetti's office to seek the death penalty, said that 
the failure to do so would endanger other women. 
</P>
<P>
 "The D.A. has in effect declared open season on women and issued a hunting 
license to men to prey upon their wives, ex-wives and lovers and terrorize 
them, brutalize them and even murder them and their friends without fear of the 
death penalty," said Allred, who called on Garcetti to resign. "To obtain this 
hunting license the applicant need only be male, a multimillionaire and a 
celebrity, preferably an athlete, with good political connections to a D.A. who 
can be placed in fear of what they will do if he does not appease them." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti's office announced its decision late Friday and said prosecutors 
would not comment on it further. A spokeswoman for the office said Saturday 
that prosecutors would have no response to Allred's criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garcetti and his office will bear the consequences of the decision 
not to seek Simpson's execution, most legal observers backed the move, saying 
the Simpson case did not meet the district attorney's criteria for capital 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, had the decision been announced soon after Simpson was charged, most 
observers said, prosecutors probably would have faced little criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have gained a new respect for Mr. Garcetti and the people on the 
committee" that deliberated the issue, said Gigi Gordon, a Los Angeles criminal 
lawyer. "This was a losing proposition either way. They made a legal decision 
as opposed to a political decision. I thought they would take the cynical 
approach because I thought there was a greater lobby for the death penalty than 
against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti's office made the right call "from what I know about this case," said 
Los Angeles attorney Curt Livesay, who for several years under Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner was the sole person to decide whether the district attorney's office 
would seek the death penalty in homicide cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Livesay said his opinion is based on his assumption that Simpson is guilty and 
that "heat of passion" was involved in the crime -- a mitigating factor. "The 
death penalty is seldom sought in domestic cases because of 'heat of passion,' 
" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he declined comment Friday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Frank E. Sundstedt, 
who chairs the district attorney's special death penalty committee, said in a 
July interview that "it is very difficult to get a first-degree murder 
conviction in any domestic violence case." 
</P>
<P>
 Even many observers who supported the decision criticized the district 
attorney's office for not acting more quickly. Prosecutors originally had said 
they would have a final decision no later than Aug. 31. Simpson's attorneys 
complained that the delay hampered their efforts to prepare for trial, and 
their concerns were echoed by the judge and other legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have made the decision sooner, but as Justice Felix Frankfurter 
said: 'One ought not to reject wisdom because it comes late,' " Livesay said. 
"It's too bad the district attorney has put himself in the position of having 
it appear that public influence was exerted," he added, referring to Garcetti's 
July meeting with leaders of the African American community who urged him not 
to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 By failing to disclose the reasons for their decision, prosecutors raised 
questions about what distinguished this case from others in which they ask for 
executions. The Los Angeles district attorney's office uses 12 criteria to 
assess whether to seek the death penalty, but prosecutors did not reveal which 
of those were applied in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Simpson's attorneys, Sundstedt said the decision was made after 
"consideration of all aggravating and mitigating penalty phase evidence," but 
he did not amplify. A member of the committee said Simpson's lack of a felony 
history was an important factor in the decision. Simpson was arrested as a 
teen-ager and later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor in a spousal battery 
case, but he does not have an adult felony record. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be a good sound reason for declination of the death penalty, but 
this is the wrong way to announce the decision," said Bruce Fein, a former 
associate deputy attorney general under President Ronald Reagan who is now in 
private practice in Washington, D.C. "Our system rests on the confidence of 
evenhandedness, that the poor don't take the brunt of punishment from the 
criminal law system. That's why this decision coming out unexplained like 
immaculate conception is the last thing we want in the law. It needs to be 
explained, not to rest on miracles." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing unexplained, Fein said, the decision is subject to a host of 
interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing in the record," he said, "that would discredit the theory 
(that) you don't get the death penalty if you're wealthy, if you have resources 
to fight off prosecutors with armies of attorneys, investigators, blood 
specialists." 
</P>
<P>
 Fein said Garcetti's action makes it clear that prosecutors "wield an enormous 
amount of unfettered discretion in how our criminal justice laws are 
administered" and that there is a need for clearer criteria on how such 
decisions are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Abramson, the lawyer for Erik Menendez, echoed that criticism, saying 
California courts have given prosecutors such wide latitude on whether to seek 
capital punishment that it may not be worth it to file a motion demanding that 
the district attorney drop its quest for the death of her client. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had such a hearing, I don't think we would prevail," she conceded, 
while continuing to assail Garcetti for seeking the death penalty in the 
Menendez case. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district attorney may be grappling with the fallout from the 
Simpson decision for months or even years, the most immediate impacts are on 
the coming trial. Experts say they are likely to be profound. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many legal analysts said they believed prosecutors partly decided 
against seeking the death penalty for fear that it would endanger their chances 
of getting a conviction, they also noted that the decision could have the 
opposite effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospective jurors who cannot support the death penalty are automatically 
excused from cases in which capital punishment is being sought. But Friday's 
decision means those people may now sit on the Simpson jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they tend to be more liberal, capital punishment opponents generally 
are considered more likely to vote to acquit criminal defendants, and thus the 
decision not to seek the death penalty may work against prosecutors' main 
objective: to have Simpson found guilty of the brutal double homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Like several others, Charles J. Ogletree Jr. of Harvard Law School said the 
decision "has shifted the advantage to the defense in selecting the jury. There 
are many jurors, and particularly jurors of color in California, who are 
opposed to the death penalty and who would have been disqualified from serving. 
This ensures a more diverse pool of potential jurors and increases the 
likelihood of a hung jury or an acquittal." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Levenson, a Loyola law professor and former federal prosecutor, agreed 
that the makeup of the Simpson panel could be affected by the decision not to 
pursue the death penalty, but added that the strategy questions were 
complicated by other possible advantages for prosecutors in dropping their 
quest for capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any juror pauses before voting to convict in a case where the death penalty 
might be imposed," she said. "They should not be imposing a higher standard 
because of the possible punishment, but I think they do." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some observers said the decision, though it may cost prosecutors some 
tactical points and gain them others, was in many ways a bow to the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the D.A.'s office has admitted by making this decision is that the 
horror of the offense is never going to outweigh the humanity of the alleged 
offender," Gordon said. "You can't dehumanize a guy who's been sitting in your 
living room for 27 years. No jury would execute this man. He will never be a 
thing. He will always be O.J. Simpson."

 "How extraordinary!" wrote political scientist Aaron Wildavsky in 1979. "The 
richest, longest-lived, best protected, most resourceful civilization, with the 
highest degree of insight into its own technology, is on its way to becoming 
the most frightened." 
</P>
<P>
 Extraordinary, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Life expectancy in the United States is 75.5 years, up almost 13 years since 
1940 and more than double what it was at the turn of the century. Since 1970, 
the infant mortality rate has been cut in half, the death rate from heart 
disease (our No. 1 killer) has dropped 27% and the death rate from stroke (our 
No. 3 killer) is down 44%. Death rates for emphysema, tuberculosis and other 
once-dreaded diseases have also declined. Polio and smallpox, long the scourge 
of childhood, have all but disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Deaths from cancer (our No. 2 killer) have increased, but that increase is 
largely attributable to smoking -- which has led to a doubling of the lung 
cancer death rate in the last 30 years -- and to two simple facts: (1) People 
are living longer. (2) The sharp decline in fatalities linked to heart disease 
and stroke means that other causes of death are rising proportionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these enormous improvements -- and despite recent improvements in the 
health of our much brooded-over environment as well -- psychologists, 
sociologists and epidemiologists say we may well be the most anxious, 
frightened society in history. 
</P>
<P>
 No reasonable person can deny that very real dangers lurk in all our lives -- 
in our air, in our food and water supply and in other natural and artificial 
substances. Guns kill. Cigarettes kill. Toxic chemicals, high-fat diets and 
abuse of alcohol can kill. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the risks that kill people and the risks that scare people are 
different," says Peter Sandman, a risk communications consultant based in 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are we so scared -- and so often scared by the wrong things? 
</P>
<P>
 Many people say the news media are largely to blame. The media, after all, pay 
the most attention to those substances, issues and situations that most 
frighten their readers and viewers. Thus, almost every day, we read and see and 
hear about a new purported threat to our health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 We are warned about benzene in our Perrier, Alar on our apples, and asbestos 
in our school buildings. We are told that popcorn, margarine and red meat -- as 
well as Chinese, Italian, French and Mexican food -- all contribute to heart 
disease. Aluminum and zinc are reported to contribute to Alzheimer's disease. 
Alcohol is blamed for virtually every malady but the national debt. And 
everything, it's said, causes cancer: Caffeine. Cellular phones. Dioxin. 
High-power lines. The hole in the ozone layer. Hot dogs. Secondhand smoke. 
Silicone breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
 While we are fretting about the fat in our fettuccine alfredo ("a heart attack 
on a plate," according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest), we 
are also being bombarded by terrifying tales of violent crime, crashing 
airplanes, an AIDS epidemic among heterosexuals and a global warming trend. 
</P>
<P>
 The media are supposed to serve as an early warning system for the public, and 
they have long fulfilled this function in alerting people to a range of risks, 
from high-fat diets to cars (the Ford Pinto) to medical devices (the Dalkon 
Shield IUD). 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, says Al Meyerhoff, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense 
Council, an environmental group, the media "almost do too good a job" in 
sounding alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the political problems the environmental movement has had to deal 
with, particularly over the last few years, is simply getting through the 
clutter of all the different messages of gloom and doom that the public 
receives," Meyerhoff says. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the media to "not say anything at all is the worst crime," says 
Marlene Cimons, who covers federal regulatory agencies for the Los Angeles 
Times. "If there's a debate going on, people need to know about it. My 
responsibility is to report it in a balanced way. I can't help the way people 
react." 
</P>
<P>
 Many people -- a number of them journalists -- say that media coverage of risk 
issues is often un balanced, and that does make reporters responsible for the 
way people react. Too often, critics say, the media provide not just essential 
information and legitimate warnings but unwarranted alarms for an increasingly 
susceptible audience, one willing to see risk in almost everything. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to educate the public and attract readers and viewers, the media 
often overplay risks of dubious legitimacy. Scientific studies show that many 
of the alleged hazards the media trumpet are either misstated, overstated, 
nonexistent or that there just is not enough scientific evidence yet to yield 
reliable guidance on the true risk for the average American. 
</P>
<P>
 David Ropiek, a longtime environmental reporter for WCB-TV in Boston, says 
risk coverage "gets to the most fundamental failing of the media today." In 
their zeal to have an impact, Ropiek says, journalists are "seduced . . . into 
playing up what is dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
 But emphasizing "overdramatized" stories, suggesting that "everything you eat 
will kill you, that every breath will kill you, . . . profoundly colors the 
public psyche," Ropiek says. "We start living like Chicken Littles being told 
the sky is falling." 
</P>
<P>
 Why did many Americans suddenly decide last fall, for the first time, to tell 
national pollsters that crime is "the most important problem facing the 
country"? Could it have been because last year, for the first time, ABC, CBS 
and NBC nightly news programs devoted more time to crime than to any other 
topic? 
</P>
<P>
 Several media critics think so; as a Los Angeles Times Poll showed early this 
year, people say their "feelings about crime" are based 65% on what they read 
and see in the media and 21% on experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees that the media skew the degree of risk in our society. 
</P>
<P>
 Howell Raines, editor of the editorial pages of the New York Times, says we 
live in "a dangerous world," and the media have been a major player in making 
people more aware of those dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Risk is not just about the statistical threat to health and life," Raines 
says. "Risk is also about what kind of society you want to have. . . . I think 
we're probably doing a better job (in the media) if we're responding to the 
popular sense of risk rather than the scholarly side of risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science and the Public 
Interest -- which conducted the widely publicized studies of movie theater 
popcorn and ethnic food -- says the media have done "an excellent job of 
alerting people to problems roughly in proportion to the importance of the 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 But studies show just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 "A direct comparison between hazards as topics of news stories and (hazards) 
as causes of death shows essentially no relationship between the two," said 
social scientists Eleanor Singer and Phyllis Endreny in their study of risk 
coverage by national and local newspapers, newsmagazines and television 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, says Sandman, the risk communications consultant, is that "hazard 
and outrage are independent of each other," and the media are "in the outrage 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most media coverage of risk is about outrage, not about hazard," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because people and their emotions generally make for more riveting 
stories -- especially on TV -- than do dry, often tentative or conflicting 
scientific facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a basic rule of journalism to get the human angle," says Jeff 
Greenfield, an analyst for ABC News. "But with a complicated, technical story . 
. . the concerns, the worries, the fears of people . . . will always carry more 
weight than the disputes and the cautions of the experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Human drama, human emotion is what works well on television," Greenfield 
says. "Maybe sometimes too well." 
</P>
<P>
 Pictures also work well on television. Pictures are television. Often dramatic 
pictures -- mothers sobbing at a toxic dump, for instance -- may get a story on 
the air even when the underlying science is shaky at best. 
</P>
<P>
 In his studies on coverage of risk situations, Sandman has found that the 
media devote most of their space and time to "opinions, not facts . . . to how 
upset people are (about an alleged risk) rather than about how likely this risk 
is to kill you." 
</P>
<P>
 When he is hired to advise industrial clients involved in risk stories, 
Sandman says, he tells them not to waste time giving reporters facts on why 
they do not think their product or service is not dangerous; instead, he tells 
them to "get the compassionate stuff in. (Say) you're sorry, you made a 
mistake, you're going to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Only that approach, he says, can counter the outrage the media will report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media don't create the outrage," Sandman says, "but they cover it and, 
inevitably, they amplify it." 
</P>
<P>
 No risk creates as much media outrage -- or attention -- as the threat of 
cancer, the disease that kills more than half a million Americans every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though heart disease kills 40% more people -- more than 700,000 Americans 
a year -- cancer evokes special feelings of dread. Cancer can be painful, 
debilitating, disfiguring; it can drain your strength and spirit -- and your 
life's savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the turn of the century, cancer carried such a stigma that in some 
places, cancer cases were given other, less terrifying -- albeit incorrect -- 
diagnoses. The disease was not mentioned in polite company. Now, says Sharon 
Begley, a Newsweek senior writer who specializes in science and the 
environment, there's a "cancer fixation in this country;" we can't stop talking 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the media, this often translates into what Begley and others call "the 
cancer-of-the-week syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these stories involve charges that this chemical or that pesticide 
causes cancer. But Bruce Ames, a biochemist and molecular biologist at UC 
Berkeley, says the three main causes of cancer are not the much-publicized 
pesticides or other chemicals developed since World War II, but "smoking, 
dietary imbalances and chronic infections." 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, who performs no consulting for private industry, is the director of the 
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Center and the recipient of 
more prestigious awards than you could shake a test tube at. He also invented 
the standard laboratory test for cancer-causing agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The onetime darling of the ecology movement, he now makes such provocative 
statements as: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think pesticide residues have anything to do with cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 But the media almost invariably focus on pesticides and other artificial 
chemicals -- "story after story," Ames complains. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 study by researchers Robert Lichter, Stanley Rothman and Mark Mills 
supports Ames' judgment. Their study of 1,147 stories on cancer over 20 years 
found that the major print and broadcast media gave the most attention to 
artificial carcinogens that scientists generally thought were low risk, while 
largely neglecting the often natural carcinogens that the scientists thought 
were higher risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames says "99.99% of the pesticides we consume are naturally present in plants 
to ward off insects and other predators." One cup of coffee, he says, contains 
10 grams of natural carcinogens -- the amount the average American consumes in 
pesticide residues in one year. The average American, Ames says, ingests 10,000 
times more natural pesticides than artificial pesticide residues every day. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ames thinks that fruits and vegetables, which contain carotenoids and 
antioxidant nutrients such as Vitamins C and E, suppress the cancer process -- 
despite two recent studies calling these conclusions (and earlier studies) into 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, he argues -- and he wants the media to point out -- pesticides actually 
help prevent cancer; they lower the cost and increase the yield of produce, 
enabling more people to eat them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pesticides," he says, "are one of the public health advances of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 But what of widely reported laboratory studies that have shown pesticides and 
some other chemicals to be toxic? What of the Delaney Clause, the 1958 law that 
prohibits any food additive, including pesticide residues, that have been shown 
to cause cancer in laboratory animals? 
</P>
<P>
 Ames says that the standard cancer tests -- feeding chemicals at high doses to 
rats, then extrapolating to lower doses for humans -- is not a good way to find 
out if a substance will cause cancer in humans. He argues that large doses 
cause cells to proliferate and the new, mutated cells to form tumors. Under 
normal circumstances, a body repairs cell mutations before cancer develops. But 
a rat -- or any other animal -- cannot do this if its metabolism is overwhelmed 
by a massive dose of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental activists say such chemicals should be banned anyway, on the 
theory that it is better to be safe now than sorry later. Ames thinks that that 
is bad science and bad public policy, and he says it is bad journalism for the 
media not to point it out. 
</P>
<P>
 When pesticides are banned, he says, all that's left is organic or other 
pesticide-free produce, which is more expensive. That deprives many people, 
especially the poor, of a natural "medicine" and creates what Daniel Puzo, who 
covers food safety issues for the Los Angeles Times, calls "an obvious inequity 
. . . in our system." 
</P>
<P>
 Many scientists and risk assessment experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economics is at the most basic level," says John Graham, director of the 
Center for Risk Analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health. "If the prices 
of fruits and vegetables go up, people are likely to eat fewer fruits and 
vegetables," and there is solid evidence that eating more produce makes you 
healthier. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not rocket science," Graham says. Journalists do not need "advanced 
degrees from Harvard" to make this connection. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the media coverage of and public anxiety about a "cancer epidemic" 
triggered by environmental pollutants, "less than 5% of human cancer can be 
traced to causes that are within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency," Graham says. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, according to the National Cancer Institute, the age-adjusted mortality 
rate for all cancers combined except lung cancer has been declining since 1950, 
except for those 85 and over. 
</P>
<P>
 But one wouldn't get that impression from the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true of a whole range of other "risks." 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crime? Certainly, urban life is much more violent than it was 40 years 
ago. Random violence is far more prevalent. But despite what television says, 
FBI and Justice Department statistics show that the national crime rate, 
including violent crime, has been fairly level for 20 years -- and it dropped 
slightly last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Silicone breast implants? The news media have been filled with tales of cancer 
and other diseases attributed to these devices. But in June, researchers at the 
Mayo Clinic reported that they could find no connection between silicone 
implants and the diseases that had been attributed to them. In August, 
researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital said preliminary tests in a small 
study suggested that silicone seeping from implants may actually help fight 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some doctors have challenged the methodology and provenance of 
studies that seem to exculpate breast implants, Elinor Brecher, who has written 
widely on the issue for the Miami Herald, says: "There has yet to be a credible 
study supporting the women -- and their lawyers -- who claim they have this 
disease or any of those diseases." 
</P>
<P>
 Brecher -- who had breast cancer, a double mastectomy and two silicon breast 
implants -- acknowledges that "some women have had some problems" with the 
implants, but she says she has been "deeply disturbed . . . outraged" by the 
way the media have overplayed the risk and underplayed studies repudiating the 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pure horror, creating needless panic," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Heterosexual AIDS? The disease has wreaked horrible devastation. It is a 
shattering, global tragedy that warrants government action, scientific research 
and human compassion. But statistics from the Centers for Disease Control make 
it clear that the media -- which long ignored or underplayed the threat in the 
gay community -- have overstated the threat in the general heterosexual 
community. AIDS remains confined, by an overwhelming margin, to gays, bisexuals 
and intravenous drug users. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number and percentage of heterosexual AIDS deaths have increased 
considerably in recent years -- especially among women -- only 6% of all adult 
and adolescent AIDS cases have involved heterosexual contact, the CDC says -- 
and two-thirds of those involved people who had sex with someone who already 
had (or was in a known risk group for) HIV infection. Only 2.2% of AIDS cases 
have involved heterosexuals with no other known risk factor. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, AIDS is not presently a serious threat to the non-promiscuous, 
non-intravenous drug-using, North American heterosexual -- notwithstanding the 
Time magazine cover stories ("How heterosexuals are coping with a disease that 
can make sex deadly") and Oprah Winfrey warnings ("AIDS has both sexes running 
scared. Research studies now project that 1 in 5 . . . heterosexuals could be 
dead of AIDS in the next three years"). 
</P>
<P>
 Secondhand smoke is probably the risk issue getting the most media, public and 
political attention right now, so its coverage -- and the controversy 
surrounding it -- is worth examining. 
</P>
<P>
 Although virtually no one outside the tobacco industry doubts that smokers run 
a much higher risk of lung cancer and other diseases, the science on secondhand 
smoke is more problematic. Some critics have accused the EPA of distorting the 
findings in its landmark 1993 report alleging a link between secondhand smoke 
and lung cancer and other diseases. Critics in science, medicine and the 
nonpartisan Congressional Research Service say the EPA ignored contrary 
studies, used unreliable methodology, failed to consider such "confounding 
factors" as diet, health care, poverty, heredity and consumption of alcohol and 
caffeine and changed its statistical standards midstream to produce the 
politically desired result. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am adamantly opposed to smoking; I completely agree about the magnitude of 
this health threat for people who smoke," says Michael Gough, senior associate 
in the congressional Office of Technology Assessment. "But I think that the EPA 
played very fast and loose with its own rules in order to come to the 
conclusion that (secondhand) smoke is a carcinogen." 
</P>
<P>
 Most mainstream media -- daily newspapers, weekly newsmagazines, the TV 
networks -- have ignored or given such short shrift to suggestions that the EPA 
data was flawed and had been manipulated that the tobacco industry bought 
full-page advertisements four days in a row in major newspapers across the 
country in June; the ads reprinted criticisms of the methodology and integrity 
of the EPA report that were published in the quarterly journal Forbes 
MediaCritic. 
</P>
<P>
 When a few newspapers -- including the Los Angeles Times -- reported on the 
ads, they generally emphasized the tobacco industry ties of critics quoted in 
the story and of major donors to the Reason Foundation, publisher of Reason 
magazine, whose former managing editor was the author. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stories did not address the substance of the criticisms of the EPA 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Investor's Business Daily, National Review and Consumers' Research Magazine 
are the only national publications apart from Forbes MediaCritic that published 
detailed critiques of the EPA report. Science magazine also noted the EPA's 
"fancy statistical footwork," and the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and 
New York Times, among (very few) others published stories on the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Times devoted several paragraphs to the controversy in a 
three-part series on secondhand smoke in May, a series that may be the most 
comprehensive discussion of secondhand smoke in the mainstream media. 
</P>
<P>
 Although generally evenhanded, the ultimate impact of The Times series seemed 
to support those who say secondhand smoke is hazardous; one story was largely 
devoted to the plight of a 39-year-old cocktail waitress who "never touched a 
cigarette but got lung cancer after 11 years of serving drinks in the blue haze 
of a smoky airport bar." 
</P>
<P>
 But more than most mainstream media stories, this series did acknowledge that 
critics of the EPA report -- and of the campaign against secondhand smoke -- 
might have some legitimate basis for their opposition. The series touched only 
briefly on specific criticisms of the EPA report because Sheryl Stolberg, the 
author, says she did not believe she could resolve that dispute herself, being 
neither a statistician nor an epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Stolberg, a Times medical writer, did allow critics of the EPA to state their 
general case, and her series did say, at one point, that the evidence on deaths 
caused by secondhand smoke, "while compelling, is not as complete" as some 
anti-smoking crusaders insist. 
</P>
<P>
 The series also noted that the nature of the campaign against secondhand smoke 
is "a little bit of science -- still emerging, not all of it conclusive -- 
shaping a lot of public policy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Secondhand smoke is bad for your health," Stolberg said in an interview, "but 
I think if you really examine the overall body of evidence, you'll see that 
politics really comes into play and that the medical evidence has been used to, 
in essence, sell the notion to the public that secondhand smoke is bad for you, 
and it may have led some people to think it's a lot worse for the general 
public than it really is." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Stolberg says, "the real health risk from tobacco smoke is smoking." 
The issue of secondhand smoke is "more complicated than most people believe." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the media have generally minimized criticism of the EPA report -- 
and of the anti-secondhand smoke campaign -- is the widespread sense among 
journalists that spokesmen and apologists for the tobacco industry have long 
lied about the dangers of smoking. As a result, anyone who says anything that 
seems supportive of a tobacco industry position is viewed with skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA says it "absolutely stands by" its report, and in June, the agency 
released an eight-page, point by point rebuttal of its critics' charges. The 
EPA and others in the anti-smoking movement also point out that most 
independent scientists agree that heavy exposure to secondhand smoke can 
exacerbate respiratory illnesses in nonsmokers, can cause death and disease in 
some healthy nonsmokers and can contribute to respiratory ailments in children. 
</P>
<P>
 But how much exposure is "heavy" and how great a contributor secondhand smoke 
is to death and disease -- and to which diseases -- is not incontrovertibly 
settled, many independent scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real problem estimating the quantitative effect of environmental 
tobacco smoke," says Sir Richard Doll of Oxford University, one of the world's 
leading epidemiologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Research on secondhand smoke and heart disease is relatively new and 
incomplete. Yet activists say 70% of the deaths linked to secondhand smoke -- 
37,000 of the 53,000 total -- come from heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 A much smaller number of deaths -- 3,000 -- are attributed to lung cancer, but 
because of the dreadful power of the word cancer , it was cancer that the EPA 
emphasized in its report. The first major conclusion, listed at the top of Page 
1 of its 137-page report, said secondhand smoke is "a human lung carcinogen, 
responsible for approximately 3,000 lung cancer deaths annually in U.S. 
smokers." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, that statistic was the lead paragraph in virtually every 
major media story on the EPA report. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, except for coverage of the U.S. surgeon general's landmark 1964 
report and, to a lesser degree, follow-up reports in 1982 and 1986, the dangers 
of smoking did not receive widespread media attention until recent years, when 
activists seized on the issue of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many medical experts long complained that if the media would cover the 
hazards of smoking even a fraction as aggressively as they covered many other, 
lesser hazards, thousands of smokers might quit and thousands of lives might be 
saved. 
</P>
<P>
 Many journalists agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, I think it was true that the risks posed by tobacco smoke were 
severely underplayed by the media," says Timothy Noah, an environmental 
reporter for the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 As Susan Okie of the Washington Post documented in 1985, most magazines 
ignored the smoking story -- and some censored stories that might have offended 
the tobacco companies, who accounted for about 9% of magazine advertising at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers, which drew only 1% of their advertising from tobacco companies, 
were not substantially better. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be significant that, until relatively recently, many journalists 
smoked; like most other smokers, they scoffed at the risks inherent in their 
habit. 
</P>
<P>
 But today's better-educated journalists -- like their better-educated readers 
-- are much less likely to smoke. In contrast with previous generations of 
journalists -- many of them hard-living, hard-drinking news hounds whose only 
exercise was using a dull knife to cut a tough steak -- many journalists are 
now card-carrying members of the jogging, tofu-eating, Perrier-drinking, health 
club set, and they aggressively object to smoking anywhere around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Responsible reporters try hard to prevent their personal feelings from 
unfairly influencing what they cover, but they are only human, and that's not 
always possible. As Noah says: "The changing culture of the newsroom has 
probably affected the way the media cover" the smoking issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the growing sensitivity of many in the media to smoking has coincided 
with the development of secondhand smoke as a "hot" story.

 Time magazine was correct when it said this year that "nothing has galvanized 
today's anti-smoking activities as much as the Environmental Protection Agency 
report released a year ago that classified environmental tobacco smoke as a 
Class-A carcinogen." 
</P>
<P>
 That enabled anti-smoking activists -- like AIDS activists before them -- to 
say: "Everyone is at risk." No longer could nonsmokers smugly say to 
themselves, "OK, go ahead, smokers; you want to poison yourself, be my guest." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, according to the EPA, everyone was being poisoned. The groundswell of 
opposition to smoking mushroomed, and the media moved in: TV specials. Page 1 
series. Newsmagazine cover stories (Time: "Is It All Over for Smokers"; U.S. 
News & World Report: "Should Cigarettes Be Outlawed?") 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA report made smoking "a political issue, not just a medical issue," 
says Cristine Russell, a special health correspondent for the Washington Post, 
and the media have always been more interested in politics than in medicine; 
the former provides clear conflict while the latter is usually burdened by 
uncertain data. 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 health story in the American media today is tobacco," Noah says. "I 
think it's also the No. 1 health risk in America today. That's a happy 
convergence of circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, news media coverage of the hazards of smoking has become so 
aggressive that studies show Americans believe that more than 40% of the people 
who smoke heavily will die of lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The real figure is less than 10% -- and perhaps as low as 5%.

FRAIL PONTIFF URGES CROATS TO FORGE PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He came at last to the tortured Balkans as a "defenseless pilgrim," looking 
frail and unsteady but sounding resolute. Pope John Paul II on Saturday 
admonished the welcoming faithful of a Catholic country that it is their 
"sacred duty" to forge peace in a land riven by ethnic warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul's first visit to a piece of the former Yugoslav federation was 
marked by unflagging spirit but physical discomfort: For the first time in 62 
foreign trips, the 74-year-old pontiff failed to directly kiss the ground of a 
new country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope, who broke his hip in April, maneuvered with difficulty and uncertain 
balance when he arrived in this Croatian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 With fierce concentration, he descended the 19 red-carpeted steps from his 
plane slowly, one hand on a thin black cane, the other clutching the gangway 
banister. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides sprang to help him with the last two steps. With the Pope clearly unable 
to kneel, the ground-kissing ceremony was finessed when two welcoming Croats 
came forward with a bowl of earth. John Paul bowed and brushed the warm soil 
softly with his lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatia's history is steeped in Catholicism -- 3.7 million of the country's 
5.5 million people are members of the faith, by Vatican count -- and the Pope 
received a thunderous welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Gigantic crowds lined fields of fresh-harvested corn near the airport and 
Zagreb's pleasant, tree-shaded streets, cheering the Pope as he rode his 
Popemobile to the cathedral that has been the religious heart of the capital 
since the 13th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long, elaborate vespers service, John Paul seemed drained. Vatican 
aides clustered protectively around him as he shuffled from the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace in the Balkans has become an abiding priority for the Pope. He had 
envisioned the Croatia visit as one of three to pieces of a Yugoslav federation 
that was splintered after the fall of communism. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Serbian government in Belgrade and the Serbian Orthodox Church, which 
believe that the Vatican sides with Catholic Croatia, said the pontiff would 
not be welcome there. A papal visit scheduled for last Thursday to the besieged 
Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, was canceled at the last minute for security 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 At the airport, John Paul proclaimed himself "a defenseless pilgrim of the 
Gospel of Jesus, which proclaims love, harmony and peace." The message has not 
been embraced in the Balkans. Croatia sent two warplanes to escort the 
pontiff's jet, and reporters making the trip were immediately given a 121-page 
book chronicling the Serbian destruction of churches in Croatia and neighboring 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 In a strongly nationalist welcoming address, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman 
applauded the Pope as a friend -- and ally -- of an independent, Catholic 
Croatia in the face of Serbian aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul, though, tried to remain nonpartisan, railing against "bloody 
fratricidal war" that has too long savaged a land "whose people for centuries 
were used to reciprocal tolerance and exemplary collaboration." 
</P>
<P>
 With scant prospects for peace, war has shifted from Serb-Croat struggles in 
Croatia to three-sided slaughter in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much innocent blood has flowed, how many tears have streaked the faces of 
mothers, children, young men and elderly people?" he lamented in a 
Croatian-language address broadcast live from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Holy See is continuing to adopt every means available to overcome the 
existing tensions and toward the re-establishment of justice and peace in the 
Balkans. However difficult, the peace effort is a sacred duty for every 
believer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace, if it is really desired, is always possible! To construct peace on the 
basis of justice and truth, we must first pray to God," John Paul said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a region where peacemakers have been more frustrated than blessed, John 
Paul begged Croats to promote a tolerant "culture of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 "Such a culture does not reject a healthy patriotism, but this is far from the 
exasperations of exclusive nationalism. . . . Wounds produced by hatred will 
not be healed by rancor, but rather by the therapy of patience and the balm of 
forgiveness," the Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the cathedral, John Paul told Croatian priests and nuns that it is their 
"great and serious task . . . to reconcile men with God and among themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope lavished praise on the late Cardinal Aloysius Stepinac, leader of 
Croatian Catholics during World War II and a symbol of unslaked hostility 
between Croats and Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Croats cherish Stepinac as a patriot, and, to repeated applause from the 
congregation, the Pope lauded him in the cathedral where he is buried as "a 
true man of the church, ready for extreme sacrifice not to deny the faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Serbs revile Stepinac, saying he and his priests condoned the massacre of tens 
of thousands of Serbs by Croatian Fascists allied with Nazi occupiers during 
the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the papal visit say they expect as many as half a million 
Catholics at a Mass this morning at Zagreb's racetrack after John Paul pays a 
courtesy call on Tudjman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope returns to Rome tonight, concluding his first foreign trip since a 
visit to the three Baltic republics a year ago. A spring visit to Lebanon was 
canceled because of possible violence, and a trip to Belgium was canceled 
because of the broken hip. 
</P>
<P>
 As he completes the 16th year of his reign, the world's most traveled Pope has 
one more 1994 trip scheduled: to the United Nations in New York next month, 
with brief side visits to Newark, N.J., and Baltimore.

AN IMPULSIVE TRIP -- ON USAIR FLIGHT 427; TRAGEDY: WHEN SOUTHLAND ENGINEER'S 
MEETING ENDED EARLY, HE HOPPED A PLANE TO SURPRISE HIS PARENTS FOR HIS 40TH 
BIRTHDAY. RELATIVES AND COLLEAGUES RECALL PLANE CRASH VICTIM AS QUIET, 
DEDICATED AND DYNAMIC.

<P>
 Since he moved west to Cypress, research engineer David D. Garber liked to 
surprise his parents on special occasions, popping up unexpectedly on their 
doorstep in North Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 So on Thursday when a conference in Chicago ended early, Garber hopped on 
USAir Flight 427 to Pittsburgh, an hour's drive from his hometown. He was 
turning 40 on Friday and wanted to spend it with family. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the morning of Garber's birthday, his mother, Martha, got a telephone 
call from USAir. Her son had died, along with 131 others, on a flight she never 
knew he was taking. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't even know he was coming," said Bob Hooper, Garber's college 
classmate from Ohio, as he stood outside Garber's Cypress home Saturday. "They 
didn't know until the airline called them Friday morning." 
</P>
<P>
 On a wall outside Garber's home, someone had placed a vase of carnations. 
Inside, his parents, his former girlfriend and Hooper tried to come to terms 
with the fate that had snatched the quiet, gentle Northrop Grumman engineer, a 
bachelor whose projects were often so classified that even his closest friends 
had no idea what he was working on or where. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's with me every Saturday night having a barbecue," said Hilda McDonald, 
Garber's friend since 1977. "Tonight I keep thinking he might show up with his 
porterhouse and wine." 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely, Garber's parents and friends had thrown him an early 40th birthday 
celebration, complete with gag gifts, in Ohio last month. 
</P>
<P>
 And McDonald had tossed Garber an early surprise birthday barbecue in Cypress 
last Saturday, luring him over by telling him it was a housewarming party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about making assumptions," Hooper said, shaking his head over the 
pre-birthday celebrations. "He was five hours from turning 40 when he died." 
</P>
<P>
 Hooper, who got his master's degree in statistics with Garber at the 
University of Akron, had made a rare visit to Garber last week while he was in 
California on business. The pair had driven to Tijuana and Hooper had handed 
over a list of songs Garber had demanded back in February: the 10 albums Hooper 
would take with him when he died. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so intent on finding it out. I don't know why. I finally finished it 
the day before I left here last week," Hooper said. "It's eerie. I'm just glad 
I saw him." 
</P>
<P>
 Garber's list had included: Vivaldi, Mozart and the Beatles' "Abbey Road." 
Garber, who had a doctorate in electrical engineering from USC, had worked as 
an engineer at Northrop Grumman since 1981. For the past half a dozen years he 
worked at the Electronics System Division in Hawthorne, specializing in 
programming computers to recognize and target images, even from the most blurry 
film or video. Friends say he had even done some work on cockpit 
instrumentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, he and a group of co-workers flew to Chicago for a conference at the 
Northrop Grumman site in Rolling Meadows, a suburb of Chicago. The meeting 
finished sooner than expected Wednesday, so Garber told co-workers he was going 
to take an earlier flight to Pittsburgh the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody else was coming back to California," a co-worker said. "Dave had 
intended to take two days of vacation Thursday and Friday. . . . The last time 
the (other Northrop workers) saw him was on Wednesday night. He apparently took 
a flight he hadn't intended on taking." 
</P>
<P>
 Garber's resume tells of a man who moved from one high-powered, highly 
classified project to another. At the age of 24, he served as the principal 
investigator on image restorations for the U.S. House of Representatives Select 
Committee on Assassinations. A year later he was a consultant to Project Air 
Force for the RAND Corp. in Santa Monica, devising battle management strategies 
and cruise missile simulations. In 1985, after receiving his doctorate, he 
taught computer architecture at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how busy he got, Garber always made time for his city, serving 
on Cypress' voluntary Traffic Commission since 1987. In his application letter 
in 1986, Garber said he was "concerned about development in the city, 
especially as it relates to traffic flow," and offered his technical expertise 
and "plain common sense" to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Garber was chairman of the commission from 1991 to 1993. In 1992, he 
recommended placing controversial parking regulations on the ballot, measures 
that would have restricted large vehicles and nighttime parking. He spoke with 
friends about running for City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just a wonderful man, very quiet, very dedicated," said Linda Keenan, 
who now heads the Traffic Commission. "He threw his whole heart into every 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress Mayor Cecilia Age has been making plans to dedicate next Monday 
night's City Council meeting to Garber. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised when I first saw him on the Traffic Commission," Age said. 
"He was younger and he was talented and he was very smart." 
</P>
<P>
 But Age said Garber quickly became the spokesman for the commission. "The guy 
had a lot going for him. He was very dynamic." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, McDonald wept as she entered Garber's house with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 She had met Garber in 1977, when she was administrator of the USC 
image-processing institute and he was a research assistant. Although she has 
married three times since, she said, Garber had been the one constant and the 
only father figure her 16-year-old daughter had ever known. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never wanted to tell me his itinerary. I told him I would never know if he 
got there or not," McDonald said. "He said, 'Oh babe, when I drop, you'll just 
know.' "

WILSON MOVES TO FUND ALAMEDA CORRIDOR; TRANSPORTATION: GOVERNOR WILL SEEK $80 
MILLION FOR PROJECT. BROWN ACCUSES HIM OF WAITING UNTIL AN ELECTION YEAR TO 
ACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Wilson Administration is moving to finance the first phase of construction 
on the Alameda Corridor, a mammoth rail project expected to produce thousands 
of jobs for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Watts, undersecretary for the Business, Transportation and Housing 
Agency, said the Administration will seek California Transportation Commission 
approval in early October for the expenditure of $80 million in bond funds for 
the construction of five major overpasses along the 20-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member commission is expected to authorize the expenditure at its 
November meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Watts said that it was mere coincidence that the decision to move ahead with 
the construction came only a week after gubernatorial challenger Kathleen Brown 
vowed to make the Alameda Corridor a centerpiece of her economic plan for 
California. He said the Wilson Administration, a strong supporter of the 
project, was planning all along to release the funds as soon as local officials 
reached agreements with the three railroads that will use the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has criticized Wilson for waiting too long to ask for funding and for 
not providing enough leadership on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of the bond funds sets the stage for the initial phase of 
construction on what has been described by its supporters as the biggest 
economic development project in the state, one vital to Los Angeles' economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, ultimately expected to cost $1.8 billion, would provide a 
high-speed rail link for freight between Downtown Los Angeles and the ports of 
Los Angeles and Long Beach. Supporters of the project say it is critical to the 
expansion of the ports, which are expected to triple their exports and imports 
in the next 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, it often takes rail freight carried over the same route as long as 
eight hours to move across the Los Angeles Basin, crawling along at speeds of 5 
m.p.h. to 10 m.p.h. as it passes through 34 street crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to transform the route into a high-speed corridor call for eliminating 
all at-grade crossings and the complete separation of train and automobile 
traffic. North of the Artesia Freeway, the corridor would be entrenched to cut 
down on noise and pollution and allow traffic to cross at street level. South 
of the freeway, overpasses would be built to carry traffic above the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gill Hicks, general manager of the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority, 
estimated it would take two to three years to complete the first five 
overpasses at Carson Street, the Pacific Coast Highway, Sepulveda Boulevard, 
Del Amo Boulevard and Alameda Street near Laurel Park Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks said the completion of the first phase would demonstrate that California 
is capable of undertaking a project of that magnitude and help convince federal 
officials that they should make a larger investment in the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the authority has been able to nail down $1.1 billion of the funds it 
needs for the project and is searching for an additional $700 million to 
complete the financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the financing, there are numerous other obstacles the authority 
must overcome before completion, including opposition from adjacent 
neighborhoods and permits from various government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Watts said the first phase is now likely to be completed no matter what 
happens to the rest of the project. He said the first phase is justified even 
if it were not part of the overall project because the overpasses will relieve 
serious traffic congestion at five major crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although voters approved Proposition 116 in June, 1990, which authorized a 
$2-billion bond issue and earmarked $80 million of those funds for the 
corridor, the money could not be spent without authorization from the 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to seek that authorization not only gives a boost to the project 
but also helps defuse a political issue for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, and particularly Brown, have argued that Wilson should have 
provided more leadership on the project and complained that his Administration 
has waited too long to seek authorization to use the Proposition 116 funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly I think that lack of interest from the Wilson Administration has 
allowed this project to languish," said Assembly Transportation Committee 
Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). "If the Wilson folks had signaled early that 
this was a priority, I think fewer games would have been played." 
</P>
<P>
 John Whitehurst, press secretary for the Brown campaign, said he doubted it 
was just a coincidence that, right after the Democrat challenger made the 
project part of her economic strategy, it was listed for discussion on the 
Transportation Commission agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's typical of Pete Wilson, waiting until the last minute, waiting for an 
election year to do something about an issue that is so important to 
revitalizing the economy of the Los Angeles Basin," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Cranhold, a spokesman for Wilson, accused Brown of not showing any 
interest in the corridor project until she became a candidate for governor. 
"We've been pushing this for a long, long time. We've had a long interest in 
this project." 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Commission member Daniel Fessler, a Wilson appointee, said the 
commission has made it clear that it would not authorize any expenditures until 
it had assurances there was an acquisition plan for the corridor and an 
operational plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governor's responsibility is not to sit there and write checks just 
because somebody says there may be some conceivable way to cash them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no final documents have been signed, the three railroads that will 
use the corridor have agreed on a plan for its operation including fees that 
will be paid to use it. The broad terms of an agreement with Southern Pacific 
Railroad to purchase the corridor right of way for $235 million has been 
reached, but not yet signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fessler said his concern that the railroad will be paid too much for the 
property gives him mixed feelings about approving the $80-million bond 
expenditure. "But, while I am unhappy with those terms, I suspect I will hold 
my nose and vote for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one official -- state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) -- was 
critical of Democrats and Republicans for pushing the project so hard. He said 
he did not believe there had been enough objective analysis to determine how 
economically feasible it really is. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the local politicians beat the drums of jobs, jobs, jobs," he said. 
"When everybody has a green light for the Alameda Corridor is there no one 
there with a flashing yellow who will look at the cost benefits?"

ON CALIFORNIA: THE BOY WHO MADE THEM LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once there was a little boy, looking for his mother. She'd gone north from El 
Salvador to the United States, to California, to Marin County. She had gone to 
work, and work she did. She cleaned houses for a few dollars an hour. After 
four years of this, she sent for her son, and here the 9-year-old himself takes 
up the tale: 
</P>
<P>
 I remember a dark and cracking street with puddles. At the end of the street I 
saw police hiding behind trees on bicycles. I saw them start to approach us and 
I was the first to run. They caught everyone else but me. I hid behind a tree 
by the river and then, all of a sudden, I fell asleep. When I woke up the 
coyote was standing over me.  
</P>
<P>
 We had to cross the river. There were four other men trying to cross over. We 
took tires to help us float across. The eddies in the river spun us around. The 
four men fell off their tires into the water. The tires came back but we never 
saw the men again. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The coyote dropped us off in the desert. We walked for four days. We found 
some water but it was too sour to drink. On our way we saw several animals with 
just one eye. . . . I looked up on the hills and saw men watching us through 
binoculars. We ran through a railroad tunnel and had to hide behind rocks until 
night.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before he finishes, perhaps it might help to know how the boy came to tell the 
story. Last September he started fourth grade at Bahia Vista Elementary School. 
He was, his teacher recalls, "a wild child," alternately overexcited and 
withdrawn. He seemed never to have been in a classroom. He could not add 2 plus 
3. Gradually he let slip fragments of his past. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher was intrigued. Her class was filled with immigrants. It was not 
her duty to play border guard -- this, sadly, will change, should Proposition 
187 pass in November -- but she assumed that many of her pupils had similar 
stories to tell. Still, this one boy's passage seemed extraordinary -- to come 
so far, alone, in search of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it happened that two Marin County artists, Larry and Kelly Sultan, had 
started a public arts project titled "Have You Seen Me?" The idea was to let 
youngsters tell their life stories on grocery bags. The intent was to demystify 
children, particularly immigrant children, to make people see them for what 
they are -- children. Grants were obtained, a grocer was found, and the artists 
were steered by the teacher to the boy. He was proud anyone was interested: 
</P>
<P>
 Every night I would sleep curled up in a ball -- I didn't have a blanket. We 
started off early the next morning. Everyone was really thirsty. I remember 
seeing a big sandy hill with a lot of deer on it. When we passed through the 
desert a car was waiting for us.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bags went into use on July 4, a coincidence. By day's end, the patriots 
were burning. Propaganda, they thundered. There would be boycotts, pickets. 
This boy must be found, cast out. The uproar brought national attention. The 
store owner, bullied, pulled the bags. The boy seemed more confused than hurt. 
His mother cried, and kept cleaning those houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest died out and the story seemed over, one more sorry measurement of 
California's tumble into darkness. Except, there's an epilogue. The initial 
flurry has been followed by a stronger, less publicized, push of public 
opinion. All summer, letters have poured into the store, expressing outrage 
that such venom could be directed at a child. A college scholarship fund has 
been established for the boy, to document Marin County's "civility." 
</P>
<P>
 This reversal should interest those who resist the current anti-immigrant 
hysteria. The boy's story offers a political lesson: Let people discuss 
immigrants, and not just immigration, let them see people instead of abstract 
policy, and then the debate can shift away from shrill hatred and toward deeper 
core values. Like human kindness. And simple fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 This week the boy -- his identity's never been revealed -- returned to school. 
He's in fifth grade now, his math up to speed, his English improving. He rides 
a bike to school, plays plenty of soccer, wants a paper route. A boy. Like any 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 We finally arrived in L.A. and got to eat and sleep in a house for three days. 
Each day they selected people to leave. I was the last one. I was taken to 
another house. I opened the door and my mother was standing there inside.  
</P>
<P>
 I want to be a lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
 I would like to have a dog.

WHERE IDEALISM AND LOBBYING INTERSECT; CAPITOL: ADVOCATE FOR NONPROFIT PUBLIC 
INTEREST GROUPS IS A PERSISTENT UNDERDOG WHO CAN SAVOR OCCASIONAL VICTORIES -- 
SUCH AS THE PASSAGE OF A BIKE HELMET LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Barrow is a lobbyist. And an idealist. 
</P>
<P>
 On the wall above his desk is a quote from French philosopher-novelist Albert 
Camus: "I should like to be able to love my country and still love justice." 
</P>
<P>
 That may seem surprising in a profession with a popular image below that of 
carnival pitchman, mercenary or even politician. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barrow is among a small number of professional lobbyists who work the 
Capitol on behalf of nonprofit, public interest organizations. In a Statehouse 
in which moneyed interests command respect, these are the frustrated reformers, 
the underdogs. 
</P>
<P>
 With persistence and passion for their causes, they urge legislators to stand 
up for principle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they actually win. 
</P>
<P>
 And few are as effective as Barrow. Mounted on the wall above his desk is half 
of a bicycle helmet. The odd object commemorates his role in passing the state 
law requiring minors to wear protective headgear while riding bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sacramento representative of two nonprofit foundations -- the Children's 
Advocacy Institute and the Center for Public Interest Law -- Barrow also has 
his share of losses. 
</P>
<P>
 A child-drowning prevention bill lost because of opposition by the swimming 
pool industry. The center for public interest has been unable to win support 
for a measure combining the two separate boards that regulate funeral homes and 
cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrow compares his job to selling cars from a lot, something he did while 
growing up in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a realist," Barrow said. "You make an experienced determination how 
far you have to go, what you have to give up to make an advance." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are limits, he said, adding, "At other times you have to go down in 
flames." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boys and girls do not grow up dreaming to become lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 And after almost 15 years, Barrow is still surprised at finding himself here. 
At 41, he is a veteran of the public interest lobbying corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in a "low middle-income family," he worked his way through UC Davis, 
partly by caring for seriously disabled roommates. He began volunteering in 
support of the rights of the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 He also worked as a paramedic; one night while lifting a patient, he ruptured 
three discs in his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance provided rehabilitation, including six months salary at a new job. 
Barrow was snapped up by the California Tax Reform Assn., a nonprofit group 
that lobbies to close tax loopholes and tax the rich. 
</P>
<P>
 After a stint with California Common Cause, he landed his present job. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many of the nonprofit groups with lobbyists in the Capitol, the two 
organizations that Barrow works for are not hurting for cash. Both are backed 
by Price Club founder Sol Price and the Weingart Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrow's salary, in the mid-$50,000 range, is higher than most of his 
colleagues. "Most public interest groups pay anywhere from the high teens to 
the mid-30s," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Top lobbyists representing corporate interests make hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrow's office is in a downtown building with marbled corridors that has seen 
grander days. Many public interest lobbyists lease space here and it has been 
dubbed "the public interest ghetto" or the "do-good building." 
</P>
<P>
 And on a recent afternoon, the air conditioning proved no match for Central 
Valley temperatures reaching into the 100s. After 5 p.m., and on weekends, 
there is no air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of pretentiousness almost seems a point of pride with Barrow. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't pal around with legislators after work, but drives home to his wife 
and children. "We're Ozzie and Harriet," he said. "I live on Maple Lane. I 
coach Little League and soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 He knows he is at a disadvantage because the groups he works for, like most 
nonprofits, do not buy tickets to campaign events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't pay $500 to eat rubber chicken at a fund-raiser," he said. "We don't 
cat around with them at night." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1,100 registered lobbyists who work the Capitol, about 90 represent 
nonprofit public interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same "do-good building" as Barrow are lobbyists for the California 
National Organization for Women and the California ProLife Council, an 
anti-abortion group; the Planning and Conservation League, a major 
environmental organization, and the Committee for Moral Concerns, a Christian 
values group. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the public interest organizations would be regarded as being liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Barrow, they generally have to settle for small victories -- the defeat 
of a particularly harmful bill, the amendment of another. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is very tough," said Lenny Goldberg, who represents several public 
interest groups, including the California Tax Reform Assn. "I'm arguing for 
taxes. Who's for taxes?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these lobbyists are so certain of defeat that just getting a vote is 
sometimes a victory. The California ProLife Council settled for symbolic 
roll-call votes on a proposal to end repeat abortions under Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not naive," said the Council's executive director, Brian Johnston. "And 
we know that there are certain things that can't get out of this Legislature. 
The leadership won't let it." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, California NOW lobbyist Roberta White Battle was trying 
to console herself over the loss of a bill she had been working on for six 
months. The measure was "a move away bill," which would have given a custodial 
parent after a divorce -- most often the mother -- greater freedom to move away 
for a better job or for schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 Battle spoke what could be the mantra of the public interest lobbyist: "You 
have the feeling you can do something. If you don't win today, you can come 
back tomorrow and eventually things do change this way, little by little." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the current two-year legislative session, Barrow and other lobbyists 
representing children's groups held a reception for legislators in the 
Capitol's sixth-floor cafeteria. Only five of the 120 legislators dropped by. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, the California Manufacturers Assn. held a more lavish 
affair across the street from the Capitol in the lobby of the old Senator 
Hotel. Twenty-eight legislators attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "The legislators mouth that they care about kids," Barrow says, "but kids are 
the lowest priority." 
</P>
<P>
 For him a case in point is a measure by Sen. Teresa Hughes (D-Inglewood), 
which would have required fencing or warning devices on all new swimming pools. 
Even with the backing of several insurance companies, supporters of the bill 
could not overcome an all-out lobbying effort by the pool builders. "We got 
slammed," Barrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there have been triumphs. Barrow was the lead lobbyist on the bicycle 
helmet bill, carried by freshman Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Caldera credits Barrow with being able to come up with ways of reaching 
reluctant legislators just before crucial legislative votes. "We would say, 
'Steve, we've got to find someone in X member's district, someone close to him 
whose opinion he respects,' " Caldera said. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach individual legislators during floor sessions, lobbyists must line up 
at gates outside the Senate and Assembly chambers. Barrow says that he, like 
many public interest lobbyists, has little luck getting legislators to come to 
the gate. But allies in the bicycle helmet fight -- lobbyists for insurance 
companies and the California Trial Lawyers Assn. -- had no such difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most experienced public interest lobbyists work with people who have 
money and use them as a cloak, as a cape to work on the issue," Barrow said. 
"As long as you don't have to give up substance or ethics or sell your soul, it 
is a wise thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 On the wall above Barrow's desk is a Times story about a Huntington Beach 
youngster who collided with a car while riding home from school. The article 
quotes a local fire official saying it was the helmet that saved the girl from 
serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's your reward," he said, pointing to the story.

NEW U.S. POLICY ON TAIWAN PROMPTS CHINESE WARNING; ASIA: BEIJING IMPLICITLY 
RENEWS THREAT OF MILITARY ACTION AGAINST THE ISLAND IF IT DECLARES 
INDEPENDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 China issued a harshly worded protest Saturday against a recent upgrading of 
Washington's relations with Taiwan, warning of "grave consequences" from the 
new U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, in a statement reported by the official New 
China News Agency, also implicitly renewed a longstanding Chinese threat to 
take military action against Taiwan if it ever formally declares independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Liu threatened that U.S.-China relations will face new "difficulties and 
crises" as a result of the U.S. policy, announced Wednesday, which provides for 
slightly freer public contact between U.S. and Taiwanese officials and clearer 
identification of Taiwan's representative offices in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In a "strong protest" delivered to U.S. Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy, Liu 
charged that the United States has adopted a policy of creating "two Chinas" or 
"one China, one Taiwan." The question of Taiwan will become an "explosive 
issue" if not handled properly, Liu declared. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Embassy had no immediate comment on the Chinese protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan, which officially calls itself the Republic of China, is governed by 
the Nationalist Party, which fled to the island after its 1949 defeat by the 
Communists in China's civil war. Until a few years ago, Taipei and Beijing 
agreed that Taiwan is part of China but argued over which government was the 
legitimate ruler of the entire nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Taiwan is seeking greater international recognition as a separate 
political entity in which the Taipei government claims to govern only Taiwan. 
Taipei argues that China is a single nation with two governments, much like 
Germany before its unification, and it has expressed interest in joining the 
United Nations on that basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration announced Wednesday that although it would not 
support the U.N. bid, it would allow a slight upgrading of its relationship 
with Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan's representative offices in the United States -- previously known as 
the Coordination Council for North American Affairs, a name chosen to 
deliberately downplay its actual identity -- will be allowed to be renamed as 
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office. Taiwanese officials 
will be allowed to visit most U.S. government offices, and U.S. economic and 
technical officials will be authorized to visit Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Lynn Pascoe, head of the American Institute in Taiwan, visited 
President Lee Teng-hui. It was the first time since 1979 that a U.S. official 
has visited a Taiwanese president in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 These changes, however slight, carry some diplomatic meaning. But the island's 
president, vice president, premier and vice premier will still be barred from 
visiting the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months the Clinton Administration has taken far more dramatic 
measures to improve relations with Beijing. In May, President Clinton severed 
the link between human rights and trade. And two weeks ago, Commerce Secretary 
Ronald H. Brown led a sales mission to China in which he avoided public 
criticism of Beijing's human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 Liu specifically warned Saturday, however, that China will not show greater 
flexibility on the issue of Taiwan in response to these gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 For Beijing, the issue of Taiwan is a "question of principle which allows no 
room for maneuver," Liu said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will never sit idle if the Taiwan authorities go in for Taiwan 
independence with support from foreign forces and turbulence breaks out in 
Taiwan as a result," he added. Statements of this nature, which Beijing has 
made before, are generally interpreted as threats to invade or otherwise take 
military action. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent serious Beijing-Washington clash over Taiwan came in 1992, 
when then-President George Bush authorized the sale to Taiwan of 150 F-16 jet 
fighters. Delivery of those planes is scheduled in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Liu reiterated Chinese criticism of the jets' sale, warning that the issue is 
not yet closed.

U.S. DELEGATION TO NORTH KOREA OPENS TALKS ON LIAISON OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first official U.S. delegation to go to North Korea began discussions 
Saturday on opening liaison offices, a major step toward establishing formal 
diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Liaison offices in Washington and Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, would also 
open a channel of communication that could speed resolution of the nuclear 
impasse with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say relations will not be fully normalized unless North Korea 
lets in inspectors to see for themselves whether the North has been secretly 
building nuclear weapons at clandestine installations. 
</P>
<P>
 A simultaneous round of technical talks on nuclear issues began Saturday in 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has never had diplomatic relations with North Korea since 
its founding as a Communist state in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar pattern was followed with China. Former President Richard Nixon 
ended decades of U.S. isolation of China by opening liaison offices in Beijing 
and Washington. Former President Jimmy Carter subsequently established full 
diplomatic relations in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. delegation, led by State Department Korea specialist Lynn Turk, 
arrived in Pyongyang on Saturday and began preliminary discussions that 
evening, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks, expected to last through Tuesday, are to focus on technicalities 
such as mail delivery, office space and telephone service. South Korean 
officials believe the liaison offices will be opened by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Berlin, U.S. and North Korean nuclear experts began discussions Saturday on 
helping North Korea get light-water reactors, which are safer and produce less 
weapons-grade plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. delegation also is expected to ask the North Koreans about the 
condition of about 8,000 corroding fuel rods they have removed from their one 
operating reactor. 
</P>
<P>
 The fuel rods provoked an international crisis because the North refused to 
let inspectors monitor their removal. If reprocessed, the rods could produce 
enough plutonium for about five atomic bombs.

NUMBER OF DEATHS IN BURUNDI CHURCH ATTACK UPDATED TO 70 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least 70 people were killed in an attack a week ago on a Roman Catholic 
church in Burundi as ethnic violence continued to escalate, the Red Cross said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are being killed here almost every day now," said Daniel Philippin, 
chief of delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross in 
Bujumbura, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 He said details of last Sunday's attack during a baptismal Mass at the church 
at Buhinyuza commune in the northeastern province of Muyinga were filtering out 
and it was now known that of the 70 dead, 60 were women and children. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it was not clear who was responsible. Previous official reports on the 
incident spoke of nine dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Burundi has the same ethnic mix of Hutus and Tutsis as neighboring Rwanda, 
which has gone through one of the worst tribal bloodlettings in history, with 
possibly more than a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus massacred by militant 
Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
 Other aid workers with operations in the north of the country said the church 
attack followed the replacement of the former bishop, a member of the Tutsi 
minority that ruled the country for three decades until last year, with a Hutu 
bishop. 
</P>
<P>
 The bishop has told reporters that the victims were both Tutsis and Hutus but 
that the majority were Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
 The new details on the massacre came after state radio said three people had 
died of injuries suffered in a grenade attack on the crowded central market in 
the capital at midday Friday. At least 76 people were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats and aid workers say the grenade has become the weapon of choice in 
attacks throughout the tense central African country. Seven people were wounded 
in a similar attack on the market a month ago.

IRA JAIL BREAKOUT RATTLES PEACE PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five members of the Irish Republican Amy tried to shoot their way out of a 
high-security jail, shaking the fragile Northern Ireland peace process, 
authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The British government and the IRA said the foiled escape did not constitute a 
breach of a 10-day-old cease-fire in Northern Ireland, but Protestant 
nationalists insisted that the incident spelled the end of the truce. 
</P>
<P>
 The prisoners, including a sixth inmate not affiliated with the IRA, used a 
smuggled pistol in the Friday night jailbreak attempt at Whitemoor Prison in 
Cambridgeshire, about 110 miles north of London. They shot at pursuing prison 
guards, wounding one, then scaled a 35-foot wall using knotted sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards with attack dogs chased down four of the inmates; a police helicopter 
cornered the others within two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Secretary Michael Howard ordered an inquiry into the attempted jailbreak, 
particularly as to how weapons were smuggled into the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But Prime Minister John Major's office struck a cautious note, declining to 
comment on the state of the cease-fire but hinting that the incident would not 
be a major obstacle to peace. 
</P>
<P>
 In Belfast, Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, issued a statement saying the 
escape attempt "in no way" violated the truce that began Aug. 31, halting a 
bloody quarter-century campaign against British rule of Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter Robinson, vice president of the militant Democratic Unionist Party, 
said that "the attempt to kill prison officers and guards means the cease-fire 
has come to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 "This incident shows that the IRA has not abandoned violence," said Ken 
Maginnis of the moderate Ulster Unionist Party. "It is a stark reminder that, 
amidst the euphoria, the IRA remains an active, scheming and dangerous 
organization and its members are still prepared to use weapons and explosives 
to achieve their ends." 
</P>
<P>
 The IRA inmates are: Paul Patrick Magee, 46, serving a life sentence for 
murder and attempted murder; Liam McCotter, 31, serving 17 years for conspiracy 
to cause explosions; Gilbert MacNamee, 33, sentenced to 25 years for conspiracy 
to cause explosions, linked to a 1982 blast that killed four military band 
members in a London park; Peter Sherry, 39, who was sentenced for life for his 
part in bombing a Brighton hotel where the Conservative Party was holding its 
annual conference in 1984, and Liam O'Dwyer, 32, serving 30 years for making 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth prisoner is Andrew Russell, 32, who was serving 10 years for various 
offenses including aiding and abetting a 1987 escape. 
</P>
<P>
 In the earlier escape, Russell hijacked a helicopter and forced it to land 
inside a prison area allowing two prisoners to jump aboard and flee. He was 
arrested two months later. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, British government officials said they were unlikely to oppose 
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams' application for a U.S. visa because American 
authorities have expressed willingness to grant one. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they said they hope to persuade Washington to impose "sensible" 
conditions on the visit in order to prevent Adams doing anything that, in 
British eyes, would impede the peace process under way to end 25 years of 
sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.

EU READY TO SEND MONITORS TO POLICE CUTOFF OF SERB AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The European Union said Saturday that it is ready to send 135 monitors to 
Yugoslavia's border with Bosnia-Herzegovina to check on Belgrade's promise that 
no war supplies reach Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign ministers of the 12 EU nations, at an informal meeting on this 
Baltic Sea island, endorsed a lifting of sanctions against Serbia if Belgrade 
acts decisively to cut supply lines to Bosnian Serb troops, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord Owen, the EU's Bosnia mediator, told the ministers that at least 135 
monitors would be required to determine whether Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic is honoring his pledge. Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark offered 
60 monitors, officials said. The operation would also involve 150 Yugoslav 
monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said the EU foresees a scenario under which monitors will be 
quickly deployed to see if the Yugoslav-Bosnian border remains closed. 
</P>
<P>
 If it does, the United States, Russia, France, Germany and Britain will draft 
a U.N. resolution providing for a gradual lifting of sanctions against 
Belgrade, which has urged Bosnian Serbs to accept an international peace plan 
for Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign ministers also agreed there should be no lifting of the arms 
embargo against the Muslim-led government in Sarajevo, a step advocated by the 
United States.

TIFFANY SECURITY CHIEF AMONG 6 HELD IN HOLDUP OF JEWELER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A security supervisor accused of masterminding an inside job was one of six 
people arrested Saturday in the $1.9-million Tiffany's heist -- the worst 
robbery in the world-renowned jewelers' 157-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth suspect, Mark Klass, walked into a police precinct to surrender 
Saturday night and handed over most of the jewelry, said Sgt. Joseph Gallagher, 
a police department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests came just six days after the robbery, which police had praised as 
"exceptional" work by well-prepared criminals. The bandits made off with 457 
necklaces, bracelets, watches and rings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were shocked," Tiffany's Chairman William R. Chaney said Saturday. "We 
didn't think it could happen." 
</P>
<P>
 While the robbery was professional, attempts to fence the jewelry were 
comical. Manhattan Chief of Detectives John Hill said one suspect sold a $6,000 
gold bracelet for $300 on a Harlem street; another was trying to sell the 
stolen jewelry in Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
 An anonymous tipster who told police about the fencing attempts may get a 
$50,000 reward if the suspects are convicted, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than go from the head down, this time we went from the tail up," Hill 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the plan was cooked up three weeks ago by Scott Jackson, a 
security supervisor at the 5th Avenue store for the past five years, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson recruited his cousins, Derrick Jackson and Klass, as the gunmen and 
persuaded another Tiffany's guard, Mark Bascom, to join in the heist, Hill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested the four and two other men accused of trying to sell the 
stolen jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers were so sure of their scheme that they pulled the robbery without 
wearing anything to cover their faces, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A tipster led police to bike messenger Theodore Johnson, who lived in the same 
building as Derrick Jackson. Johnson was allegedly trying to sell the expensive 
jewelry near Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany's initially thought about 300 items worth about $1.25 million were 
stolen. But a more complete inventory showed that 457 items worth $1.9 million 
were taken.

DOLE WILL CAMPAIGN WITH OLIVER NORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, who once appeared hesitant to endorse 
Republican Senate candidate Oliver L. North, has agreed to join him on the 
campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to barnstorming Virginia in support of his candidacy on 
Monday," the Kansas senator said in a statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole will appear with North in Alexandria, Norfolk, Salem and Richmond as part 
of a tour on behalf of Southern GOP candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 North is running for the seat held by Democratic Sen. Charles S. Robb. Former 
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder and former state Atty. Gen. J. Marshall Coleman are 
running as independents. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole did not immediately endorse North after he was nominated, and met with 
Coleman in June.

FORD EMPLOYEE KILLS 2 DURING UNION MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ford worker opened fire with a handgun as a union meeting was breaking up 
Saturday, killing two fellow workers and wounding two others. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman, Oliver French, surrendered to authorities and was being 
questioned, Police Chief Ronald Deziel said. 
</P>
<P>
 French left the room during the meeting, returned about 20 minutes later with 
a .357-caliber Magnum and started shooting, Deziel said. French, 47, refused to 
give a motive. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told another employee: 'I just shot four people,' " Deziel said. He 
repeated the statement to police when they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Police planned to seek first-degree murder charges against French, Officer 
Robert Bochenek said. 
</P>
<P>
 French and his four victims were representatives of UAW Local 600, part of a 
unit representing maintenance and construction workers at the Ford Motor Co. 
Rouge Plant complex, Deziel said. French has worked at the plant for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no arguments, threats or other signs of a dispute before the 
shooting, Deziel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McNeil, president of Local 600, said there was no disciplinary action 
pending against French and nothing to indicate why the shooting happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "This event has hit us like a ton of bricks," McNeil said. "The world's become 
a very strange place." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kirkland worked with French and said both attended a creative writing 
class at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was pleasant to talk to," Kirkland said. "He never had a bad word to say 
about anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Killed were Ron McTasney, 44, and Greg Couls, 46, Bochenek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bisbing, 44, was shot in the chest and was in stable condition at Oakwood 
Downriver Medical Center in Lincoln Park. Dave Weitz, 53, was treated and 
released for a grazing gunshot wound to the head.

SPECTER OF AIDS WORRIES A THIRD OF DATING ADULTS; CONCERNS ARE APPARENT EVEN 
AMID TALK OF CELIBACY AND MONOGAMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A third of single adults in Orange County who are dating consider AIDS a 
significant threat to them, but another third say they are not worried at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentiments were reflected in a Times Orange County Poll conducted in June 
among 500 unmarried adults in Orange County. Those who said they were currently 
dating were asked "How much do you worry about getting AIDS from people you 
date?" 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-two percent said they worried "a great deal," and 35% said they were 
worried only "somewhat" or "a little." Thirty-three percent said they worried 
"not at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The results are significant because they show a rather high level of anxiety, 
said Mark Baldassare, a UC Irvine professor of social ecology who conducted the 
poll for The Times. "The fact that one in three worries suggests there is a lot 
of nervousness about AIDS in the singles community." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, where 2.58 million people live, about 2,000 have died of 
AIDS and an estimated 14,000 are infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials have tried to slow the spread of the disease through safe-sex 
education campaigns. Last year, Orange County reported fewer new cases of AIDS 
per capita than did California or the nation as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts noted that many heterosexuals feel relatively invulnerable when it 
comes to AIDS. A decade ago AIDS struck gays and intravenous drug users almost 
exclusively in the United States. But nationwide, AIDS from heterosexual 
contact grew from 2% of all new cases in 1985 to 9% in 1993, while new cases 
from gay sex have dropped from 66% to 47%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually use condoms," said a 33-year-old Huntington Beach woman who asked 
not to be identified. "But there have been times when I think, 'Oh, he's a nice 
guy. He's safe.' I'm not saying it's smart -- I know I must sound really 
foolish." 
</P>
<P>
 Many say they have adopted celibacy as a defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm waiting until I'm married to have sex," said Brian Bivens, 20, a college 
student in Fountain Valley. "If I were sexually active, I would be very 
nervous. A lot of my friends are very active, with multiple partners. They say, 
'I'm fine,' but they don't know if they're fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Nattrass, 58, an escrow officer in Costa Mesa and the mother of three 
grown children, said she doesn't bother with romantic relationships anymore: 
"I'm old and lazy and don't want to share my bathroom or my closet." And she 
finds the prospect of contracting AIDS terrifying. "Sex isn't worth the risk," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Cheryl Zuvich, 38, has not given up on dating, she approaches sexual 
intimacy with extreme caution. "I'm not promiscuous, so AIDS doesn't worry me," 
said the Anaheim woman, who is a buyer for an oil company. 
</P>
<P>
 Zuvich recently divorced after a nine-year marriage. "I guess you could say 
I'm lucky because I was in a monogamous relationship for so many years," she 
said. "When I go into a new relationship, I will insist that safe sex be 
practiced until both parties agree to testing (for AIDS)." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, though, are willing to take a chance. Gabriel Olea Castanol, 20, a 
college student in Santa Ana, said that he avoids getting AIDS by sleeping with 
"young women who have never had sex." Asked how he can be sure that the women 
he meets in nightclubs are virgins, Castanol said, "That's a good question. I 
just take their word for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Tisone, 24, the manager of a purchasing department for an engineering firm 
in Orange, said he bases his decision on whether to use a condom on the woman's 
social class. "I'd be less apt to use a condom with someone from the middle or 
upper class," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie, 29, an Irvine legal assistant who requested that her last name not be 
used, said she rarely asks her mate to put on a condom. "I just don't like 
them," she said. "I take the pill, so I don't have to worry about birth 
control. Condoms ruin the mood. I don't have one-night stands, so AIDS seems 
pretty remote to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Asking a man to wear a condom can be awkward, Julie added: "It's like you're 
accusing him of being bisexual." 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Wills, a 33-year-old bookkeeper in Huntington Beach, has been in a 
monogamous relationship for about a year and thinks her chances of contracting 
AIDS are relatively small. Her boyfriend, Perry Allen Palmer, a masonry 
contractor, said the specter of AIDS has prompted people to commit to long-term 
relationships. "Values have changed," the 34-year-old Costa Mesa resident said. 
"One-night stands are no longer the way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 One gay man who responded to the poll said he does not worry about AIDS 
despite the fact he has more than one partner. But in a follow-up interview, he 
explained that he already has tested positive for HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always practice safe sex," said the 46-year-old Santa Ana man, who 
requested anonymity. However, he avoids directly telling prospective partners 
that he has AIDS. "Instead, I say to them, 'I'll assume you are HIV-positive, 
and you can assume I'm HIV-positive.' I don't want to blurt out my whole 
history for a onetime encounter. But if someone didn't want to use a condom, I 
would tell them no, we can't have sex." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ammon, a Laguna Beach psychologist who specializes in a gay clientele, 
said most gays indeed practice protected sex today. But, he warned, anecdotal 
evidence -- from both gays and heterosexuals -- must be taken with a grain of 
salt. 
</P>
<P>
 "People lie about their sexual behavior," Ammon said. "They know that the 
politically correct thing to say is, 'I only practice safe sex.' They are aware 
of what they should be doing, but they don't always do it." TIMES ORANGE COUNTY 
POLL: Wary Bedfellows 
</P>
<P>
 Great fear of contracting AIDS is more common among Orange County's female 
singles than it is among men. And monogamous individuals, regardless of sex, 
are more fearful than those who are celibate and who have multiple partners. 
</P>

TRUCKER KILLS HIMSELF AFTER TAUNTS ON CB 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A truck driver committed suicide after passing motorists used citizens band 
radios to egg him on during a three-hour standoff with police. 
</P>
<P>
 Crisis teams trying to talk David Carroll out of killing himself inside the 
cab of his 18-wheeler heard several radio taunts prodding him to do it, 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll, 32, shot himself to death with a rifle Thursday in the cab of his 
truck, parked at a convenience store about 180 miles east of Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were talking to him over the CB because he refused to accept a cellular 
phone. Truckers passing nearby on Interstate 40 were mocking Carroll on the 
same channel, saying he didn't have the guts to pull the trigger, police said. 
Carroll recently separated from his wife, and he told police he was distraught 
over the breakup.

STUCK IN THE MIDDLE; THOSE 35 TO 54 ARE LESS LIKELY TO GO OUT, MORE LIKELY TO 
BE UNHAPPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Young singles want to get married, and if they follow current trends, most 
will succeed by the time they're 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Older singles are not so eager to marry. Those 55 and older, usually widowed 
or divorced, prefer to spend their leisure time with friends, not prospective 
mates. More of them claim to be "very happy" than any other age group. 
</P>
<P>
 But stuck in the middle are the middle-aged, the 35- to 54-year-old singles, 
most of them divorced, many raising children and few satisfied with their lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This group of divorced men and women is very interesting," said Steven L. 
Nock, a University of Virginia sociologist. "It's a phenomenally large group, 
and we really don't know much about these people." 
</P>
<P>
 A Times Orange County Poll found that three of every four middle-aged singles 
wanted to marry) but found the search for an ideal mate particularly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of those age 35 to 54 said it was hard to meet single people like 
themselves. Only three in 10 said they had a serious romance underway, and 
fewer than four in 10 said they were dating at all. And as a group, middle-aged 
singles spent less time socializing with friends than any other group. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, "it's somewhat depressing," said Jim Gollner, 39, married for 10 
years and now divorced for nearly three. He lives alone in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, how do you meet people? If you go to a place like a bar, 
someplace that says, 'This is where you meet people,' you get the desperate 
crowd. Most of those ladies don't interest me. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if you go the newspaper ad route, the woman gets 40 calls a week -- 
that's what she told me. She's picking and choosing by voice mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I answered an ad. That was a scary experience. We went out about four times, 
and then she started just hanging around outside my apartment. I felt like I 
was being stalked." 
</P>
<P>
 Gollner says he's backing away from the dating scene. "I just basically 
figured I give up. Leave it be and someday a woman will come waltzing into my 
life. I think I've been spending too much time trying to find a girl. All 
things considered, it's not a bad life." 
</P>
<P>
 In some respects, men such as Gollner are lucky, sociologist Nock said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men have a lot more options in remarriage in terms of eligible partners," he 
said. There are about 2% more single women than men in Orange County. "Because 
women -- especially women with custody of children -- stay single a lot longer. 
It's a tough life for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, there's just no time for dating. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the girls I work with who have young children, they just basically 
don't date at all," said Tomye Schilling, 43, a manufacturing executive from 
Irvine. She divorced 21 years ago and began raising her 2-year-old son alone. 
She remains single, dates only occasionally and finds that the appeal of 
marriage has faded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the right guy exists. I hope if he does, I meet him. I would like to 
think he's out there, but it's not a major priority in my life. The longer 
people go on their own -- the more adjusted to it they get -- the harder it is 
to see themselves as part of a unit. Things that used to not bother me are 
getting on my nerves. I'm to the point I'd like my own space." 
</P>
<P>
 Marlene McKeown, 44, of Lake Forest, divorced and raising two teen-agers and a 
10-year-old, put it bluntly: "Basically, as a single parent with teen-agers you 
do not have a life. That's the cold, hard reality of it. If you are dedicated 
to raising them right and being involved in their activities, there just isn't 
any time at all. None." 
</P>
<P>
 Her daily routine: In bed by midnight, up again at 5:15. "You're into a 
lifestyle that allows absolutely no letup. You get so bone tired, but you know 
there is no other choice. You can do it if you have to. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to get the mind-set that this is not forever. Eventually they will 
grow up and move away. You commit to getting them to that point, and you give 
up your life" until then. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she doesn't know what that life will be. She may want to remarry, but 
she may have become so independent by then that marriage becomes undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
 As for now, dating is a threat, not a goal, she said. She avoids the singles 
group at her church because "I'm afraid I'd meet somebody, and I could not 
handle the added complication." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Kain, a Southwestern University sociologist and author of "The Myth of 
Family Decline," argues that most people who say they want to stay single did 
not start out that way. 
</P>
<P>

 Karen Vidler, 35, a medical group controller from Laguna Niguel, hasn't dated

She's well-off and does not want to finance a mate's irresponsibility, she

 "A majority of them don't plan for the future and have nothing to show for 
what they make. I have a real problem with getting married because then I'm 
financially hooked to them."

 When younger, she conceded, "I probably was more of an idealist. But as time

<P>
 A man was sentenced to 30 years in prison for abducting two women at gunpoint, 
making them buy Twinkie snack cakes and caffeine pills, then forcing them on a 
tour of Christmas lights. 
</P>
<P>
 David Lynn Justice, 21, was sentenced Thursday on aggravated assault charges 
in the December, 1993, abduction of the women outside a Houston restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice told authorities he abducted the women "because he was depressed and 
wanted some company," said prosecutor Debbie Mantooth. He later freed them.

LASER-GUIDED WEATHER STUDY CONDUCTED FROM SPACE SHUTTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bright green laser pulses streamed from the space shuttle Discovery on 
Saturday and bounced off thick, high clouds over a tropical storm in the first 
atmospheric study of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground controllers directed the lasers at Tropical Storm Debby in the 
Caribbean as the shuttle soared 160 miles overhead.The experiment was conducted 
in the early morning while it was dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Light from the lasers was reflected off the clouds back toward Discovery and 
collected by instruments in the cargo bay. Bob Menzies, an atmospheric 
scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, said he should be able 
to determine the altitude of the clouds by the end of this weekend -- valuable 
information for meteorologists tracking the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really excited about it," he said from the command center at Johnson 
Space Center in Houston. "There's usually some activity in that region this 
time of year, so our chances were pretty good" of monitoring a storm.

RECLAIMING TOWN'S HISTORY BRICK BY BRICK; REBUILDING: TWO MEN ARE CLEANING 
MORTAR FROM TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY BRICKS TO HELP REBUILD FILLMORE AFTER 
NORTHRIDGE QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One by one, Bruce Munoz and Jose Herrera slice white mortar from red-clay 
bricks. Using air-powered chisels, they peel away the mortar that once glued 
together Fillmore's turn-of-the-century buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men work eight hours a day on the huge piles of bricks, literally 
scraping a profit from the rubble of the Jan. 17 earthquake that devastated 
downtown Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Used brick brings a premium price these days, and these men are converting 
waste heaps into the stuff of walkways and walls. 
</P>
<P>
 As they finish each brick, they take it to a pallet nearby. There it joins 
about 70,000 others that have been hand-cleaned since June. They have a mere 
500,000 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The bricks rattled loose in January when the magnitude 6.8 quake shook the 
buildings with their masonry facades. Many of them toppled onto Central Avenue; 
others were deliberately dumped in the street as wrecking crews demolished 17 
buildings that were condemned after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of six men had been working at the recycling project, but federal 
earthquake relief funding was pared back this month, leaving the two men to 
attack the seemingly endless piles of bricks by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a hot, dirty job that pays $7 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the dust gets into your lungs and you can't even breathe," said 
Herrera, 30, of Fillmore. "Especially on windy days." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before cleaning the bricks, the two men must dig through the 
rubble-strewn piles to search out the most complete bricks. They spend two or 
three hours of their day just gathering bricks to clean. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boss is a little (upset) because he wants more production," Herrera said, 
brushing sweat from his forehead with a chalky right hand. "With six people we 
could do about four pallets a day. But now we have to stop cleaning the bricks 
just to go and look for more." 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for their jobs runs out in December, when they hope to have cleaned 
more than 130,000 bricks. The Fillmore City Council plans to use them in civic 
projects and offer the bricks to downtown businesses during their 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't do any better than putting (Fillmore) back together with the broken 
pieces," Councilman Don Gunderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the bricks, city officials hope, can be crushed and used for 
ground cover at the city baseball diamond, or sold as-is to wholesalers for 25 
cents each. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are things from real life," city engineer Bert J. Rapp said. "Sure, 
some of them are chipped and some are cracked, but it just adds to the (city's) 
character when you build something out of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the used bricks, which tumbled from turn-of-the-century landmarks such 
as the Fillmore Hotel, Masonic Lodge and Central Market, have been installed at 
the new sheriff's substation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made a sidewalk with the bricks," said Munoz, 31, a father of six from 
nearby Santa Paula. "That's pretty neat because I can look back and show my 
kids what I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Roger Campbell said he wished he had used some of the bricks to 
rebuild his home, which was knocked off its foundation during the earthquake. 
Instead, he bought used bricks for his front porch from another supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it made a real difference in how the house looks," he said. "But I'm 
going to buy some from the city and put them somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman said dressing up the re-emerging downtown with recycled bricks 
will maintain a sense of history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nostalgia thing," said Campbell, one of the first homeowners to 
rebuild after the quake. "I don't think of them as leftovers, I think of them 
as historical pieces. Besides, it was cheaper to do this than pay the dump 
fees." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council decided that it will keep as many of the bricks as Herrera 
and Munoz are able to clean and reserve them for projects such as the planned 
Central Park. Others will be offered to merchants rebuilding along Central 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, what we want to do is keep bricks in town if we can," Gunderson 
said. "It'll help us keep the look we had before the earthquake, or keep it 
authentic when it's restored."

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: GARCETTI FACES POLITICAL PITFALLS AT EVERY TURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decision not to pursue the death penalty for O.J. Simpson shows the 
political dangers that wait at every at step of the case for Los Angeles County 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Praise and criticism were flowing before the sun set Friday, the day 
prosecutors made, and Garcetti affirmed, the long-awaited announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Logically, politics shouldn't be a consideration in a trial of this man 
accused of the brutal murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Simpson, and her friend 
Ronald Lyle Goldman. Justice should be administered on the basis of facts 
developed in a courtroom, isolated from the clamor of the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 But the legal system has never been free of outside pressure. Long before 
television, many a man was hustled off to the gallows by juries acting under 
the influence of inflammatory newspaper stories. But the atmosphere is much 
more explosive today. Television is having a love affair with criminal trials. 
In addition, crime is the hottest political issue here and elsewhere in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, every move by Garcetti is magnified by television and then 
examined by the voters who elected him in 1992 and who will decide whether to 
reelect him in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The handsome, tightly controlled Garcetti -- robocop in a business suit -- 
looks like a politician on the move in the law- and-order era. Convicting 
Simpson would be a big help, reversing a string of major losses under him and 
his predecessors, losses that were partially responsible for the election 
defeats of two previous D.A.s, Ira Reiner and Bob Philibosian. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday morning, I visited a man who has a unique perspective on the 
situation, John K. Van de Kamp, district attorney and state attorney general 
before losing a race for governor in 1990. He's a thoughtful conversationalist, 
a contrast to the television legal experts who remind me of Dick Vitale, the 
loudmouth basketball commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 As D.A., Van de Kamp was the boss of lawyers on both sides of the Simpson 
case. Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., part of the Simpson team, was one of Van de 
Kamp's top assistants. And Van de Kamp hired William Hodgman as a deputy D.A. 
Hodgman is co-prosecutor with Marcia Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was D.A., Van de Kamp caught considerable political flak on the 
Hillside Strangler case in 1981. Van de Kamp was criticized when he decided to 
charge murder suspect Angelo Buono with a sex crime because prosecutors felt 
the main witness against him was shaky. But a judge overruled Van de Kamp, 
ordering a murder trial. The state attorney general's office subsequently won a 
murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 The job of D.A., Van de Kamp said, has always been full of risks. "The job 
hasn't changed so much, but we're living in more complicated times," he said. 
"You're on the hot seat every day in that job. . . . The D.A. is constantly 
dealing with cases the press is interested in," he said. "I think it is more 
complicated to be D.A. today because of television and the insatiable need of 
the television media to cover 'news.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor, he said, "is a greater skepticism now about officialdom. 
Police are treated more as regular witnesses today rather than coming in with a 
presumption of total integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked him about the prosecution's performance so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they have been running against the clock to get their evidence in 
hand . . . because (co-defense attorney Robert L.) Shapiro has pushed them into 
a quick trial, which may have been good strategy on his part. . . . I'm not 
sure they have all the DNA testing done. They are under a very tight timetable 
for that. It's very important in this particular case because of the fact that 
there are no eyewitnesses. So the scientific evidence becomes very important." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We talked a day before Garcetti made his decision against seeking the death 
penalty, but even then, Van de Kamp said he thought that was what the D.A. 
should do. "If you look at the history of the way jurors look (at such cases), 
assuming it was a husband-wife emotionally fraught situation, juries don't 
execute in these kind of cases," Van de Kamp said. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of support helps Garcetti, as does backing from several law 
professors. But just after he made his announcement, Garcetti was criticized by 
an attorney who may be trouble for him, Leslie Abramson, the lawyer for Erik 
Menendez. Menendez and his brother face a second trial for the murder of their 
parents. As he did in their first trial, which ended with a hung jury, Garcetti 
is seeking the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson, a media star since the Menendez trial, said she agreed with 
Garcetti's decision on the Simpson case, but said he should do the same for the 
Menendez brothers. "He went for this because there is a political component and 
the African American community is already up in arms," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism also came from Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling Norris, who ran against 
Garcetti in 1992 and may oppose him in 1996. He faulted Garcetti for not having 
the police jail Simpson when he was first questioned. Instead, authorities 
waited several days before an arrest, giving Simpson a chance to take his famed 
freeway ride that Norris said "blew up the celebrity status, blew up the racial 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti has been in the background recently, leaving the hot seat to 
prosecutors Hodgman and Clark. But it will be hard for him to avoid the 
fallout. Abramson, Norris and others will undoubtedly see to that. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll remain what he promised to be in his campaign -- a hands-on D.A. or, in 
the view of critics, a control freak. As such, he'll reap the rewards or take 
the heat at the end of O.J. Simpson's trial.

LIVING SCARED; CONTROVERSIAL STORIES GO AGAINST THE GRAIN; REPORTING: NEW YORK 
TIMES' KEITH SCHNEIDER SAYS HE IS LOOKING BEYOND THE USUAL PRONOUNCEMENTS OF 
DOOM ON DIOXIN AND OTHER ISSUES. BUT SOME CRITICS SAY HIS WORK IS 'DECEPTIVE' 
AND DELIBERATELY PROVOCATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1970, when Keith Schneider was 14, he joined environmental activists in the 
first Earth Day, helping to clean up and paint a railroad station and pull 
automobile tires out of the Bronx River in his hometown of White Plains, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider was interviewed by a New York Times reporter that morning for an 
Earth Day story, a proud moment in his adolescent life. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schneider is 38 now, a New York Times reporter himself, and to many 
environmentalists -- and to a number of journalists -- he has become a traitor, 
the symbol of a revisionist view on the environment that is beginning to take 
hold in some quarters after two decades of media coverage that many acknowledge 
has been overwhelmingly sympathetic to the environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
 What has Schneider done to attract all this attention? He has written such 
things as: "Many scientists, economists and government officials have reached 
the dismaying conclusion that much of America's environmental program has gone 
seriously awry." He has also written stories that raise such questions as: 
</P>
<P>
 * Are government policies on cleaning up toxic waste "raising risks to public 
health instead of lowering them"? 
</P>
<P>
 * Is the government spending too much money and effort responding to "popular 
panics" rather than "sound scientific analyses"? 
</P>
<P>
 * Is the government wasting billions of dollars every year on relatively minor 
problems, thus "leaving little money for others that cause far more harm"? 
</P>
<P>
 Rae Tyson, who covers the environment for USA Today, says it was courageous of 
Schneider to write these stories; Schneider and the New York Times should be 
commended for them, he says. But, Tyson adds, "if you're going to do it, you 
should do it based on good, solid science, and some of that stuff just had too 
many holes in it for me." 
</P>
<P>
 David Ropiek, longtime environmental reporter for station WCB-TV in Boston, is 
more blunt. Some of Schneider's reporting, Ropiek says, has been "purposefully 
deceptive." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Schneider's critics say he has taken deliberately provocative 
positions as a means of drawing attention to his work and of making a mark for 
himself, and that he now has a vested interest in trying to prove that his 
published skepticism is valid. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider vigorously defends his work as "following the data wherever it leads 
and coming to conclusions about real risks, which are important and which are 
not . . . a much richer story" than the narrower stories warning about 
impending environmental doom that have dominated the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Environmental journalism suffers from the same thing a lot of American 
journalism suffers from -- too much dogma," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In one especially controversial story in 1991, Schneider wrote that dioxin -- 
long considered the most potent artificial carcinogen and the chemical compound 
involved in the Love Canal, Agent Orange and Times Beach environmental crises 
of the 1970s and '80s -- is now "considered by some experts to be no more risky 
than spending a week sunbathing." 
</P>
<P>
 That story -- and that statement in particular -- triggered an avalanche of 
criticism. Many journalists accused Schneider of trying to "write the final 
chapter" to a scientific controversy that is still evolving -- a charge that 
Schneider scoffs at. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months ago, Schneider reported that a draft summary of the EPA report 
said that cancer was "not the most serious health hazard (from dioxin) at 
common exposure levels" and that "subtle effects on fetal development and the 
immune system" were "of greater concern." 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview Friday, William Farland, director of the Office of Health 
and Environmental Assessment for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
rejected that characterization. "I would not say that one is a greater concern 
than the other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the EPA will release two, long-awaited 1,000-page reports on 
dioxin. Farland, who directed the assessment studies that led to these reports, 
says they will warn of the dangers of dioxin to fetal development and to the 
human immune system, as well as "reconfirm the position that dioxin is a 
probable human carcinogen . . . despite what has been said in the press." 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to believe that dioxin is a human carcinogen and the data we have 
in this reassessment has strengthened that position," he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Farland said the dioxin reassessment study "adopts the hypothesis that the 
major pathway for exposure by humans is through the food chain," but that there 
is a "major data gap" on dioxin levels in food. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA is concerned about dioxin, he said, because of what he characterized 
as "the small difference" between the routine exposure to dioxin in daily life 
and the exposure that produced adverse effects on animals in laboratory tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said he defends his May story and "all of what I've reported on 
dioxin." 
</P>
<P>
 His work, he said, has largely reflected debate over the question of whether 
dioxin constitutes a public health emergency, as many environmentalists argue, 
or whether it is a risk that has been largely controlled, with only new sources 
of potential risk to be dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider says criticism of his work has been "political, not scientific," and 
he says he has been surprised that it has been "so personal, so mean-spirited, 
so ardent and emotional." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Schneider's predecessor on the environmental beat at the New York Times, 
Philip Shabecoff, has attacked his work as "retrograde . . . bad reporting, 
just replete with errors." 
</P>
<P>
 During a panel discussion at the annual conference of the Society of 
Environmental Journalists last year, Shabecoff launched a bitter but thinly 
veiled attack on Schneider (and other journalistic contrarians): 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it easier to be a courageous challenger of the conventional wisdom," 
he said, "if you are thereby doing exactly what your publishers and editors 
want you to do . . . (catering to their) "inherent distrust of environmental 
activists," whose efforts threaten "rampant consumerism and therefore their 
advertising base." 
</P>
<P>
 Other journalists, some of them at the New York Times, echo Shabecoff's 
criticism of Schneider. But Shabecoff was taken off the environmental beat in 
1991 because he was perceived by many as having become too sympathetic to the 
environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Shabecoff denies this charge. He says he had a series of responsible positions 
at the paper because "I was considered a good reporter. . . . I did the things 
a good reporter should do. I covered the facts as thoroughly as I could. I 
looked for all sides of the issue. I tried to verify everything. Then I went 
and covered the environment, and I reported it the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism of his (and others') reporting, Shabecoff says, reflects a change in 
journalistic priorities, a turning away from concern for the environment in 
economic hard times, rather than an abrogation of his journalistic obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 But even some of Shabecoff's longtime admirers say his personal views on the 
environment had begun to influence his coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "His point of view came through in his reporting to a degree that did make 
some editors here uncomfortable," says Joseph Lelyveld, the executive editor, 
who was foreign editor at the time Shabecoff left the beat. (Shabecoff 
subsequently left the paper to start an environmental news service, Greenwire). 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider, meanwhile has many supporters inside and outside the paper, and -- 
his critics notwithstanding -- Lelyveld says he's "very proud" of Schneider's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider has been controversial ever since he started writing about the 
environment 14 years ago, he says, and that doesn't bother him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dioxin has also long been the subject of controversy. And conflict. And 
contradiction. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Times Beach., Mo., was evacuated because oil laced with dioxin had 
been sprayed on its streets. But in 1990, Vernon Houk, director of the Center 
for Environmental Health at the Centers for Disease Control, said that new 
studies showed dioxin to be only a "weak carcinogen." Had he known that in 
1982, Houk said, he would not have urged the evacuation of Times Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Several studies came to similar conclusions about the alleged harmful effects 
of dioxin on the residents of Love Canal in New York and of dioxin-based Agent 
Orange in Vietnam: No scientific evidence supported the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's legitimate for a journalist to use 1993 science to 
question a 1983 policy decision," Tyson of USA Today says. But Sharon Friedman, 
head of the journalism department at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, says 
that if reporters had "dug more deeply, they would have found a significant 
disagreement among experts about dioxin safety levels even earlier in its 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Franklin, who won Pulitzer Prizes in 1979 and 1985 for the Baltimore 
Evening Sun, did dig into the dioxin controversy in 1982 while investigating 
Agent Orange, the defoliant used by U.S. troops in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 In college, Franklin had participated in protests against Dow Chemical Co., 
manufacturer of Agent Orange and napalm, and he approached the Agent Orange 
story with what he later called "the righteous fervor that is the armor of the 
crusading reporter." 
</P>
<P>
 But when he finished his reporting, Franklin concluded that there was no 
medical evidence that dioxin had caused the cancers, birth defects and other 
medical calamities that its critics had alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agent Orange story was "a myth" manufactured by anti-war protesters, 
capitalized on by Vietnam veterans and widely disseminated by an unquestioning 
media, Franklin said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many reporters covering the Agent Orange story had the attitude: "Now 
we're going to hang the bastards," he said. "They refused to look into it 
further. A lot of them were advocates. This sickened me. It really shook me as 
a journalist. It changed my attitude toward journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, Franklin quit the news business. He now teaches journalism 
at the University of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Schneider has no immediate plans to quit journalism. He's having too 
much fun. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been exciting, he says of his work on dioxin and the reaction to it. 
"I've aspired to be considered an important writer, an independent player."

LIVING SCARED; DOSE OF SKEPTICISM ENTERS COVERAGE ON ENVIRONMENT; BIAS: 
SYMPATHETIC EARLY STORIES WERE SPURRED BY AN EFFORT TO "SAVE THE EARTH." AS THE 
PROFESSION MATURES, REPORTING IS MORE CONTRARIAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Stossel has come a long way since his days as a young consumer reporter 
for KGW-TV in Portland, Ore., in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, he says, "we consumer reporters approached it from the bias 
that on the one hand is business, which is greedy and has an ulterior motive 
and will distort the data, and on the other hand is the noble environmental 
group, which has no motive other than to help the public." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm embarrassed to say that it took me years to realize that their data were 
often soft, if not absurd, and that they had their own venal motives . . . to 
get on TV, to get famous, to get more grant money." 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, Stossel shared his discovery with 16 million television 
viewers nationwide. He produced an ABC News special -- "Are We Scaring 
Ourselves to Death?" -- in which he argued that media reports and political 
posturing suggesting that "there's danger everywhere and it's all getting worse 
. . . just isn't true." 
</P>
<P>
 Stossel is part of a backlash, a revisionist or contrarian movement among a 
growing number of journalists who believe that the media have needlessly 
alarmed the American public with biased coverage of many environmental and 
other risk issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me the environmental groups . . . tend to get a sympathetic 
hearing from the press," says Nicholas Wade, science and health editor of the 
the New York Times, "whereas the industry side, you're skeptical of them right 
from the start." 
</P>
<P>
 Sympathetic coverage of the environmental movement in its early days in the 
1970s was probably almost inevitable, given the confluence of the media's 
perennial desire for both simple news and bad news, and the emotional 
identification that many reporters felt with the environmental movement. To 
them, "saving the Earth" was not the sort of partisan political or ideological 
issue they had been trained to avoid taking sides on; it was a nonpartisan 
effort to make life better for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Many journalists who write about the environment acknowledge that their 
colleagues have tended to write from a pro-environmentalist standpoint, to make 
common cause with environmental activists, forging a bond that led to "a 
difficulty for environmental journalists to objectively cover the environmental 
groups," in the words of Richard Stone, a writer for Science magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Standards for environment writers and others who write about risk issues have 
improved considerably in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more context now, more precision . . . an increasing sophistication 
about magnitudes of risk," says Baruch Fischhoff, a professor of engineering 
and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 To Boyce Rensberger, longtime science writer for the Washington Post, this 
represents a coming of age for environmental journalism, the same sort of 
transformation he saw take place with science writers a decade or more ago, 
when they began to "write stories with a more skeptical tone." 
</P>
<P>
 Early science writers were inexperienced and prone to believe whatever 
scientists told them, Rensberger and others say. In the case of environmental 
reporting, the unchallenged sources were often environmental activists and 
their scientists. This resulted in what Frank Clifford, an environment reporter 
for the Los Angeles Times, calls a "one-sided debate." 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't believe the industry scientists because we were conditioned not to 
trust them," Clifford says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, stories on the environment have often been written with "an 
unquestioning, alarmist spin," in Rensberger's words. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite recent improvements, many journalists worry that the alarmist spin 
continues in some quarters -- and may be getting worse in some ways. They say 
that increasing competition for readers' and viewers' time -- and the 
attention-getting impact of tabloid media -- are forcing reporters to 
oversimplify their stories and play up conflict, drama, emotion and doomsday 
scenarios even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media are becoming less capable of dealing with an increasingly complex 
world," if only because the space and time that most editors and news directors 
make available for the average story is much less than it was 10 years ago, 
says Diane Dumanoski, the longtime science and environment reporter for the 
Boston Globe, who is on leave to write a book on the impact that artificial 
chemicals have on fetal development. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, as Casey Bukro, environment reporter for the Chicago Tribune says: 
"There are still environmental activists working for the mainstream media." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Rensberger, Keith Schneider of the New York Times and Gregg 
Easterbrook of Newsweek have, in a sense, become the de facto leaders of 
the-sky-is-NOT-falling movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Rensberger wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "After nearly a decade of headlines and hand-wringing about erosion of the 
Earth's protective ozone layer, the problem appears to be well on the way to 
solution . . . (with scientists unable to) find any solid evidence that serious 
harm was or is being done." 
</P>
<P>
 Some journalists criticized that story. Sharon Begley, a senior writer who 
covers science and the environment for Newsweek, said it represented "somewhat 
twisted logic." 
</P>
<P>
 Rensberger has also challenged the traditional environmentalist view on global 
warming -- the greenhouse effect, the phenomenon by which a significant rise in 
the Earth's temperature, caused by modern man, is thought by many to be causing 
irreversible changes that will severely disrupt human life, causing flooding, 
famine and mass relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Most scientists seem to agree that there is some sort of greenhouse effect, 
but they do not agree on what has caused it, whether it is unprecedented and 
what impact it will have. 
</P>
<P>
 Rensberger has written that the changes measured to date in the environment 
are "no bigger than those the Earth has undergone in recent centuries through 
entirely natural processes." Computer models that are "the chief basis for 
forecasts of blood and doom are flawed," Rensberger wrote in 1992. Seldom, he 
said, has an issue "risen to the top of the international political agenda 
while the facts of the matter remained so uncertain." 
</P>
<P>
 Rensberger was criticized by some colleagues for this story, too, but he 
strongly defends his work and he has his supporters -- among them Easterbrook, 
who wrote a similar story in Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Easterbrook argues that rather than continuing to sound alarms, 
journalists and environmentalists should recognize that environmental 
protection "is one public policy and technology area where programs are 
successful, (where there is) something to be optimistic about." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalism, he says -- not the public schools or the criminal justice 
system -- is the true "triumph of liberalism" in our society.

GUNMEN ROB TOUR BUS BOUND FOR LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three gunmen hijacked a tour bus bound from Monterey Park to Las Vegas on 
Saturday, robbing the tour guide and 40 passengers of more than $20,000, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's spokeswoman Diane Hecht said the gunmen boarded 
the bus at a stop in Rowland Heights on Saturday morning, ordered the driver to 
go to a nearby street and ran away after demanding that the passengers empty 
their wallets and purses. 
</P>
<P>
 One suspect, Yen Chiu, 22, was arrested and held for investigation of robbery 
and kidnaping at the Walnut sheriff's station, Hecht said. Chiu was being held 
on $35,000 bail, deputies said. The other suspects remained at large late 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred after the AA Tour bus stopped in Rowland Heights to pick 
up eight passengers, three of whom turned out to be the robbery suspects. There 
were no reported injuries, Hecht said.

RANCHO CUCAMONGA FIRE FULLY CONTAINED 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters fully controlled a wildfire Saturday sparked by children playing 
with matches that burned 105 acres in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze near Rancho Cucamonga was contained early Saturday and was fully 
controlled by 6:40 p.m., said Fire Capt. Steve Humeston. 
</P>
<P>
 Two 10-year-old boys admitted setting the fire, officials said. Fire 
investigators may bill the children's parents for the firefighting costs, which 
could run into the thousands of dollars, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze was reported Friday evening on state land covered with shrubs and 
brush. It burned within 200 yards of several expensive homes before fire crews 
and water-dropping aircraft halted the advance, officials said.

PEROT LASHES OUT AT CLINTON AND HIS HAITI INVASION POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ross Perot said Saturday that President Clinton has "no concept at all of what 
combat is like" and suggested that the President threatened to invade Haiti to 
win crime bill votes from black members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing a pointed attack he launched Friday night in Denver, Perot also 
told a St. Louis rally that Clinton was inclined to invade Haiti because 
"history teaches us that you get a bump in the polls if you have a little war." 
</P>
<P>
 Perot urged members of his United We Stand, America, Inc. organization to 
write Congress to oppose any military action to restore democracy in Haiti, 
saying history had proven that residents of the island nation prefer dictators 
and that, in any event, the country was not worth a single American life. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he believed that Clinton was hellbent on restoring deposed 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide without getting advance approval from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we have a President who was unwilling to serve in the armed 
forces and risk his life when he was a young man," Perot said. "I think in his 
case he has an enormous obligation to go to Congress and get their approval." 
</P>
<P>
 Perot offered no documentation to back up his suggestion that Clinton promised 
an invasion to win votes for the recently passed crime bill from the 
Congressional Black Caucus, saying only that he had heard that was the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not Dixie cups," he said of U.S. military personnel. "They are not 
to be used for political purposes, and they are not to be used to trade votes, 
and they are not to be used to get a bump in the polls." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to citing Clinton's lack of military service, Perot said mistakes 
during the military mission in Somalia "shows that this Administration has no 
concept at all of what combat is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 While Perot's goal was to rally his backers for the coming elections, he left 
the unmistakable impression he was still fighting the last fight -- over the 
North American Free Trade Agreement -- and hardly ready to concede defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's NAFTA victory was a major setback for Perot, who had put his 
political prestige on the line in vowing to defeat the pact. Now, with 
government data suggesting it is benefiting the United States as well as Canada 
and Mexico, Perot had a simple retort for the Administration: "I am sick and 
tired of you lying to the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 He said jobs were rushing across the border to Mexico and that Canada was 
getting a much better deal too. "The giant sucking sound is alive and well," he 
said, reviving a familiar campaign slogan.

HUGH GRANT DEALS WITH IT ; WE WERE INTRODUCED TO HIM AS THE CHARMING, 
UNAFFECTED BRIT IN 'FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL.' NOW HE'S ONE OF HOLLYWOOD'S 
MOST-WANTED LEADING MEN. THE HONEYMOON IS OVER, BLOKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Gritten, David Gritten frequently reports from England for Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hugh Grant, peering from beneath a wide-brimmed hat, assumes his brilliant 
signature grin. "On balance," he says, in that terribly English drawl of his, 
"I have to say I'm loving all this. Hugely." 
</P>
<P>
 "All this?" Celebrity, of course -- sudden celebrity of a sort no British 
actor has experienced in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of this year, lest we forget, Grant was "Hugh who?" -- one of 
several, almost interchangeable young Britains, winsome, well-spoken chaps who 
tended to pop up in various films by Merchant Ivory or Merchant Ivory 
wanna-bes. 
</P>
<P>
 But this all changed when Grant starred in one film, "Four Weddings and a 
Funeral," a respectable hit in the United States and, proportionately, an even 
bigger hit in Britain. As a result of that film, Grant is sought after by le 
tout Hollywood, has become about as well-known in his own country as Prince 
Charles, and is certainly more popular. Her association with Grant has made his 
girlfriend, actress Elizabeth Hurley, a household name, though few people could 
name a movie she has actually appeared in. One London newspaper columnist, 
tongue only slightly embedded in cheek, has described Grant as the Most Famous 
Living Englishman. 
</P>
<P>
 "After years and years of obscurity," says Grant, "it would be nonsense to 
pretend a little bit of glamour and attention wasn't quite nice." And yet, as 
he concedes, there are downsides to fame -- hard work being one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite apart from the acting, I seem to have to spend most of my life on the 
telephone talking to agents and lawyers. The stakes seem so much higher now. I 
can't afford to make mistakes -- I have to do the right interviews, make the 
right films, do all the things that never bothered me before. Well, not so 
much. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways I miss my unemployment. I miss those long periods when I could 
sit at home and watch cricket on TV all day." 
</P>
<P>
 He tells you all this with the same insouciant charm that marked his role as 
the chronic bachelor in "Four Weddings." Grant punctuates the serious parts of 
his conversations with jokes, politically incorrect or impolite observations 
about life and people, and shockingly funny pronouncements delivered in a 
mock-solemn manner. 
</P>
<P>
 He often resorts to English schoolboy slang; someone he likes is referred to 
as "a good egg." All this has the dual effect of making him both entertaining 
company and someone who keeps his true feelings, in best British fashion, well 
in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 One imagines Grant will have even less time to watch cricket in forthcoming 
years. A glittering Hollywood future clearly beckons -- but in the meantime he 
is still fulfilling his obligation to contracts struck before "Four Weddings" 
catapulted his career into the stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 He has come to this tiny picturesque border village to make a film with the 
unwieldy, charming title "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but Came Down a 
Mountain." Grant plays one of two English map makers who in 1916 arrive in a 
small, remote Welsh village with a single claim to fame -- it is overshadowed 
by the first mountain inside the Welsh border. The English cartographers make 
some calculations, then announce to the dismayed village that their mountain is 
15 feet too short to qualify as a mountain; it must be reclassified as a hill, 
and will not appear on the new, redrawn maps they are completing. 
</P>
<P>
 Their pride stung, the villagers unite (burying some old differences in the 
process) and decide to attack the problem in the most practical way -- by 
physically hauling loads of earth in carts and barrows up the hill, and piling 
it up at the summit to increase its height. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, which has a budget of less than $8 million, also stars Colm Meaney 
("The Snapper," "Star Trek: The Next Generation"); Tara Fitzgerald, who 
co-starred with Grant in "Sirens," and Ian Hart ("Backbeat"). It is written and 
directed by Christopher Monger ("Just Like a Woman"), who was born in Taff's 
Well, a Welsh village where these events actually occurred at the turn of the 
century. Monger says that he was told the story by his father, David, who in 
turn was told it by his father, Ivor; Monger credits them both at the end of 
his screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Englishman" has been kicking around for more than three years. Its 
producer, Sarah Curtis, first commissioned it for the BBC, where she was then 
working. "But it really needs a bigger shooting budget than the BBC could 
afford, and it needs a big screen to do justice to the Welsh landscape," Curtis 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hugh was the first actor to be attached. He read the script in April last 
year, and responded very positively, instantly. But I can't say there was 
overwhelming interest initially. It took a while to get the ball rolling." 
Eventually Miramax financed the film. 
</P>
<P>
 All this was before "Four Weddings" gave Grant his big break. "The Englishman" 
was to have been shot last summer, but various cast commitments prevented it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colm Meaney keeps going off into space," grumbles Grant in deadpan mode about 
Meaney's "Star Trek" role. "Every time it happens we get put off again. We've 
just had a two-week break while he goes off to the furthest reaches of the 
galaxy. But he's landing again shortly. I'm a bit jealous, actually. I've 
always wanted to do one of those space movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Grant wanted to be in "The Englishman" as soon as he read it. "They're 
so few and far between, good scripts," he said, sprawled across two seats on 
the crew bus during a break in shooting. "When you find one, it's like a gem. 
You want to cradle it like a child. This was one of those. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good material is really hard to come by. I've just signed up for one in the 
autumn in America, but that's after reading 50, 60, 70 scripts. That's all I do 
now -- I'm more or less a professional script reader." 
</P>
<P>
 Is that boring? "Quite tedious, yes. Everyone in America seems to have to read 
scripts from dawn till dusk. It's wearying. I'm dying to read a book again. 
Just for pleasure. I'm not one of those people who when they read a book they 
enjoy immediately want to make it into a film. Quite the reverse. I want to 
protect it from filmmakers." 
</P>
<P>
 G rant has settled next on a major studio movie, called "Nine Months," which 
Christopher Columbus ("Mrs. Doubtfire") will direct for Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked that script too," Grant says. "It's a remake of a French film about a 
guy who's been in a longstanding relationship for about five years and he's 
perfectly happy. Then one day, to his horror, his girlfriend announces she's 
pregnant. And he can't hack it, can't cope, can't get it together. One thing 
leads to another, she leaves him, and you track them through the pregnancy, 
month by month." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the heat currently surrounding Grant, his participation in any 
film would give it a boost. Since emerging in "Four Weddings" earlier this 
year, he has completed work in two other films -- a lead role in "An Awfully 
Big Adventure," which continued his collaboration with director Mike Newell 
from "Four Weddings," and a small part in "Restoration," a period epic shot in 
England and Wales, starring Robert Downey Jr. and Meg Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition for his services is understandably hot at present, and Grant has 
not endeared himself to director Allison Anders ("Mi Vida Loca"), who believed 
she had an understanding that Grant would star as Paul McCartney in her film 
"Paul Is Dead." Once "Four Weddings" made Grant a hit earlier this year, 
however, she says Grant changed his mind; for his part, Grant has refused to 
comment on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant is also highly selective about scripts, which, as he tells it, must 
clear three hurdles before he can consider them: "Firstly, they have to be 
good, and secondly there has to be a (role) for me. And then we have to see if 
the part for me can be made English, because I don't want to play American. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, American is a deadening accent. I did it once, in a CBS TV movie 
about AIDS called 'Our Sons,' with Julie Andrews and Ann-Margret." 
</P>
<P>
 And how was that movie? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was beautiful," says Grant, perfectly stony-faced before dissolving into 
giggles. "No, it was quite good, actually. Seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he has a dilemma here, since most of the scripts that come his way are 
American in origin. Grant is meeting the problem head-on; he has a first-look 
deal with Castle Rock and is setting up an office in London to look for British 
scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a big fan of Rob Reiner, and the people at Castle Rock, it seems to me, 
are the company which puts the greatest emphasis on script rather than star, 
director or producer. They're all good eggs over there. 
</P>
<P>
 "My idea is to weed out our best (British) TV writers and novelists, and get 
them to write feature films. Writing for film isn't the first thing that occurs 
to the best people in this country. I'd better not say who I have in mind, 
because they'll probably spurn me as soon as I call them up. But that's my 
plan." 
</P>
<P>
 N ot that Grant is anti-American in his approach to films, though he can be 
howlingly funny about "taking meetings" and "doing breakfast" with studio 
executives in Hollywood. "It's easy to get snobbish about European films, but 
if I had to say which side of the Atlantic produced more good movies, it would 
always be America. They're really good at it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a thoroughness about Hollywood. Often if a script isn't good enough 
they'll say, rewrite it and rewrite it again. In Britain, there's a whole 
culture of 'The text is sacred, darling.' You don't rewrite Shakespeare, 
certainly, but some screenplays you see in Britain now, people are just too 
quick to start shooting them. Often they should get more writers in." 
</P>
<P>
 This was what he liked about "The Englishman." "It was perfect. I go through 
these (scripts) with a fine-tooth comb. If there's anything I don't like, I'll 
worry the writer about it for hours and suggest rewrites. But there was very 
little I could find to complain about on this one. It just works, it clicks." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues on the set insist that Grant has responded well to his newfound 
stardom. English character actor Ian McNeice ("No Escape"), who plays the 
second map maker, concedes: "I was rather nervous, because Hugh had got to be 
such a big star just before this, and one's always interested to see how that's 
going to work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Monger concurs that fame hasn't gone to Grant's head. "Oh, I have 
to thrash him each morning to get him started," he says in a droll manner 
reminiscent of Grant himself. "No, really, he works very hard. He can't get too 
above himself because the crew tease him all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day in a newspaper there was a story that he'd been voted the No. 7 hunk 
in the world, or something. He got total hell from the crew, with every one of 
them claiming they were in the Top 6. He's been great about it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Monger first saw Grant alongside Judy Davis and Emma Thompson in James 
Lapine's 1991 film "Impromptu." "I thought he was fabulous, so I offered him 
this part. He was gracious enough to accept and he came in with a lot of good 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I first met him when he was in the middle of shooting 'Four Weddings'; I had 
lunch with him on the set. And of course at that point no one had any idea the 
film would be so big." Monger casts an approving glance around the hilly 
terrain: "It's been a fantastic bonus for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the crew bus, Grant is growing increasingly uneasy with my questions. 
"I don't want this to be a major profile," he frets. "I'm happy to talk about 
this film, but, ummm. . . ." One particular inquiry about the dangers of media 
overexposure has clearly sounded a warning system in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, sorry to be such a queen about this," he says, rather winningly, "but I 
think I'd better talk to my press agent. I didn't know this interview was going 
to be so . . . far-reaching." 
</P>
<P>
 And he descends from the crew bus and strides off to the one pay phone in 
Pen-y-bont-fawr, from where he will place a call to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 He returns 10 minutes later. "Yes, look, let's just talk about this film, OK?" 
His whole body seems contorted with apologetic embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 He goes on to say that he doesn't like to talk about the characters he plays 
("It's bad karma, somehow"), that he dreads it when directors want to talk 
about character motivation, that he's a believer in the adage "shut up and 
act." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's about all there is left to say under the ground rules he has 
imposed, and we stare at each other helplessly for a full minute before 
agreeing to end the discussion. Grant shuffles off, brows knitted in worry: 
"Sorry about this. Umm, sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another downside to overnight fame.*

VIRTUALLY REAL VIRTUAL REALITY; COMPUTER EXPERT AND VIRTUAL REALITY PROPHET 
JARON LANIER IS MAKING NEW CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PREVIOUSLY UNCONNECTED MUSICAL 
CULTURES -- BUT ON REAL INSTRUMENTS, NOT SYNTHETIC ONES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mark Swed, Mark Swed is a free-lance writer based in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jaron Lanier has invented an absolutely new way of playing music. He plays 
instruments inside virtual real ity, the ultra-veristic computer simulation 
that any teen-ager can tell you about. 
</P>
<P>
 It works like this: Onstage, Lanier, a dramatically large man with a pale 
complexion, red hair in long dreadlocks and an unkempt red beard, dons goggles 
with tiny TV monitors for lenses that seem to transport the wearer directly 
inside the computer universe. 
</P>
<P>
 He puts on the "glove," to which is attached sensors that, through the motion 
of the hand, make Lanier feel as though he is moving around in the computer 
landscape. Through these sensors, he perceives himself to be in an alternate 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 And in this world are virtual instruments of his own design. Some are 
recognizably similar to the physical instruments we know; some are something 
else altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 To the audience, the real Lanier appears in a trance state, but the audience 
also watches a video projection of the virtual world he has entered into, and 
it hears the electronically generated music he produces through loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does look unusual," Lanier says of this style of performance, which he has 
undertaken on only a few rare occasions. "If I were going to promote myself as 
a star I would do this kind of performance more, because it's a very 
interesting show visually and no one else can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lanier has decided he is not going to promote himself thus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be a spectacle in my music," Lanier confesses, "because that 
sort of happened to me in my science already." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaron Lanier is a mathematician-turned-celebrated computer scientist. He is 
one of the principal creators of the virtual reality phenomenon, which is the 
ultimate multimedia experience and which was prominently featured in last 
season's television miniseries "Wild Palms," produced by Oliver Stone. Lanier 
invented the glove. Ten years ago, at age 24, he made the cover of Scientific 
American, and he founded VPL Research, the first company to develop and market 
virtual reality. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lanier is also -- in another, parallel life -- a musician who has just 
released his first CD, "Instruments of Change," on Point Music, the crossover 
label overseen by Philip Glass. He studied classical music and became an 
accomplished pianist very young. He also began composing early, writing 
orchestral works at the age of 13, around the time he started college. 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-ager -- taking time off from college -- and in his early 20s, Lanier 
spent time hanging around and performing in Manhattan's downtown avant-garde 
new-music scene, where he sometimes got so carried away in his piano playing 
that his hands would bleed in performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in the Bay Area, he worked with a short-lived ensemble, Khayal, begun 
by Terry Riley, which required that its members be adept at Western classical 
music, jazz and South Indian raga. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now 34, Lanier has managed to find time to master more than 100 instruments 
from around the globe. His new recording features, among other surpris ing 
music, Lanier producing weirdly distracted impressionistic tremolos on the 
piano; Lanier playing his favorite Laotian mouth organ, the khaen ; Lanier 
producing shimmering resonance from Thai bells; Lanier plucking beautiful 
effects from Chinese harps. 
</P>
<P>
 A traveler in so many worlds -- musical and scientific, virtual and real -- 
Lanier would seem to be the ideal oracle to consult about the future of music, 
about where music might be headed in both the laboratory and the global 
village. But as is the way of oracles, his answers can be surprising and 
Sphinx-like. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, everything about a meeting with Lanier does, in fact, feel oracular. 
His TriBeCa loft is an oddly impersonal space. Anonymously furnished, it 
appears hardly lived in (Lanier also has a cottage in Sausalito). There is a 
TV, some modest stereo equipment, conventionally functional modern furniture. 
The only personal touch among the minimalist decor is the reptile intrusion -- 
a stuffed snake on the living room floor, an alligator head that serves as a 
letter holder on the kitchen counter -- a reminder that Lanier grew up in New 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the large, cheerfully inscrutable Lanier himself and his 
laser-beam eyes, which seem made for gluing to a computer screen. He has been 
much written about for his scientific accomplishments, and one memorable 
description of him was as a "Rastafarian Hobbit." He has become a legend for 
the fortunes he has made and lost -- a distracted businessman, he lost control 
of his company and patents through a French buyout. 
</P>
<P>
 He may be mistrusted in the non-technological music world, yet neither Lanier 
nor his music can be so easily dismissed. Lanier, in his own original manner, 
appears to be delving into many of the most important issues of our time. 
</P>
<P>
 He may be beloved among kids for having invented the ultimate computer game 
high, now that special virtual reality video game parlors are starting to 
appear around the country, but both his science and his music are the result of 
a profound language quest. Lanier's development of virtual reality came, he 
claims, almost as a sidelight out of his desire to improve computer languages, 
which he finds primitive and creatively asphyxiating. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanier contends that only with better computer languages can you have your own 
voice when communicating with a computer. Since he believes eventually all 
human culture will be transmitted digitally, he insists that making computer 
languages part of the vernacular is imperative. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no small thing," Lanier says. "This is a very big deal for the 
expression of culture in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 And for Lanier that is the where science intersects with art, because he has 
realized that, for all artists, language is "the ultimate arbitrator of what is 
real between people." It was a desire for a more sensual and experiential 
common base in computer language that led him to develop virtual reality. And, 
ironically, that is also what has driven him away from the computer almost 
altogether in his approach to music. 
</P>
<P>
 M oreover, Lanier's ultimate distrust in computer glitz has helped fuel his 
fascination with traditional instruments, a fascination that has turned into 
outright obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 Acoustic instruments, Lanier has found, provide a much deeper experience than 
electronic ones, and he thinks the cause is related to some of the issues 
surrounding the essence of science. 
</P>
<P>
 As he explains it, science is not involved with the understanding of truth, as 
most people think it is, because any scientific idea is true only until new 
data or better theories come along to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Therefore," Lanier has discovered, "the scientist lives in this universe 
that's absolutely mysterious, with these contingent kinds of truth, and that's 
a very spiritual sort of foundation for a discipline. The scientist has to 
accept a deep humility that we never really know." 
</P>
<P>
 All of this "unknowableness" of science, as Lanier calls it, is exactly the 
same sense of mystery that he experiences when he plays a physical instrument, 
which, he feels, brings him directly in touch with "that fundamental mysterious 
thing we call the physical world that science tries to study. And the reason 
why it's good for art is because of that mysteriousness." 
</P>
<P>
 But synthesizers, on the other hand, have taken the process of discovery out 
of the player's hands and lips. The sound is already there, and that sound was 
the idea of the engineer who designed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "And as soon as you build the idea of a note into an instrument," Lanier says, 
"you can no longer discover a note. So instead of contacting this mystery, 
you're simply toying with the ideas that you've already had, and that 
contradicts the humility you really need to approach music fresh every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Lanier's attitude toward art is not an uncommon one among scientists. For many 
scientists, the arts are exotic and gadgetry is not, and thus they tend to be 
highly conservative when it comes to their own artistic inclinations. Einstein 
played only 18th- and 19th-Century music on his violin and never exhibited the 
slightest interest in the modern music that was deeply influenced by his ideas 
of time and space. Richard Feynman, the celebrated Caltech physicist and 
jokester, played conventional pop music on the bongos. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, it has been the artists who have used technology in the 
most seemingly futuristic ways, whether it be Laurie Anderson with her 
applications of electronic technology to perk up our perceptions of society, or 
the computer composers at Stanford or UC San Diego busily inventing new sonic 
perceptions. All are composers who see the computer as liberating them from the 
confines of old technology -- namely, traditional instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 For a scientist-musician like Lanier, however, art is to be separated from the 
gadget-freak aspect of science. Or, as he puts it, "Gadgetness for its own sake 
is a very powerful seductive force, and it can certainly interfere." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while there is barely more than a hint of electronics on his CD, Lanier 
remains, nonetheless, the ultimate musical child of the Electronic Age. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall McLuhan, who is increasingly perceived as the original guru of 
multimedia, proposed that the Electronic Age will become the era in which 
everyone's environment is the entire globe and that humans' primary function 
will be information gathering. And in that McLuhan-esque sense of a global 
village, Lanier is simply the most connected musician there has yet been. 
</P>
<P>
 He is, for instance, tireless in his efforts to learn more and more new 
instruments from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always learning," he says of his passion. "If I'm not learning a new 
instrument, I feel sick. I have to be learning a new instrument. That's like a 
physical requirement for me, for my health." 
</P>
<P>
 And in his learning, Lanier is always making new connections between 
previously unconnected musical cultures, making new musical synapses that are 
the equivalent of what McLuhan identified as the essence of the Electronic Age 
-- the process of information rubbing against information. 
</P>
<P>
 There is hardly a track on Lanier's disc that doesn't combine the sounds or 
techniques or harmonic modes (or any combination thereof) of at least two 
cultures completely foreign to each other in time and place. 
</P>
<P>
 The implications of this are groundbreaking, because Lanier, the computer 
expert and prophet, ultimately rejects the computer as an instrument (which has 
been what we have always thought about when we have thought about future 
music), while nonetheless embracing the essence of computer thinking in a new 
kind of global music. But if connectivity is inevitable, as the era of the 
Internet has proved, it is also, as McLuhan also pointed out, crisis-making. 
</P>
<P>
 The clash of cultures that now is occurring throughout civilization has also 
led to the problems of integrating disparate cultures in big cities as well as 
the ethnic strife in Eastern Europe and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 In this, Lanier has become his own personal musical laboratory in which the 
crisis of connectivity is played out, in which information gathering becomes 
its own sort of irresistible virtual reality creating a great sense of 
universal belonging that at the same time threatens his personal identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This comes to the heart of what I think is really going to be a dilemma in 
the next century in our culture," Lanier says, as he applies it to his own 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine life without the richness of all these ethnic cultures. 
They're all deeply a part of me. I would feel terribly limited and oppressed if 
I was, for some reason, forced to be in any particular one of them. It's almost 
like being able to take on different identities. Moreover, by studying many 
different cultures as deeply as I can, I do think it's possible to have a sort 
of metacultural experience now where you just treat the whole world as your 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
 B ut that has, he confesses, led him into difficulties too, where he has felt 
a lack of identity, especially in times of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really struck that, in our society, many people live with no sure 
tradition at all, which is both very freeing but at moments of crisis it 
becomes apparent how much of a lack that really is. For instance, if somebody 
dies, what exactly do you do? Do you make a traditional funeral or don't you? 
You don't know what to do. So there's this problem of not knowing what to do 
when you would like to be able to be on automatic. I don't know how to resolve 
those two things." 
</P>
<P>
 One way, though, may be through the example of virtual reality. The virtual 
world, Lanier finds, can be a new way to connect with other people, since it 
operates by the sharing of imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he sometimes speaks as if virtual reality were more real than plain 
old reality, as a place where the realization of imagination is tangible and 
objective, instead of the world of subsumed symbols and words and all of these 
other inadequate conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 But that also sounds like rationalization of the inevitable, which is Lanier's 
other dilemma. The sheer appeal of gadgetry is unstoppable, and no 
multicultural model is going to appeal to the public the way, say, Laurie 
Anderson's technological showmanship does, let alone the fun ride of virtual 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtual reality will clearly overwhelm the art world once it becomes a more 
readily accessible medium. It will surely overwhelm ethnic music just as 
American pop music has already become the true world music, unavoidable 
everywhere. The backbeat has now become the closest thing we have ever had to a 
universal language. The question now is just how much a visionary like Lanier 
will be able to control his invention -- and whether it will be a 
Frankenstein.*

TRUST US, THIS IS REAL; FOURTEEN ALTERNATIVE-ROCK GROUPS HAVE RECORDED VERSIONS 
OF THEIR FAVORITE CARPENTERS SONGS.; IS THIS A JOKE? NOT TO THEM. THE DARK SIDE 
OF THE CARPENTERS' AMERICAN DREAM ISN'T JOKE MATERIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul Grein, Paul Grein is a Los Angeles free-lance writer who specializes in 
pop music. He interviewed the Carpenters for Calendar in 1981. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Carpenters were called a lot of things in the '70s, but hip was never one 
of them. The brother and sister from Downey were known almost as much for their 
squeaky-clean image as for their poignant ballads. 
</P>
<P>
 But a lot of certifiably hip acts have been singing Karen and Richard's 
praises lately. 
</P>
<P>
 And now 14 alternative rock acts -- from Sonic Youth to the Cranberries -- 
have recorded an album in which they perform Carpenters hits in their own 
styles. "If I Were a Carpenter," which is set for release Tuesday on A&M 
Records, was conceived as a heartfelt yet irreverent tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternative acts liking the Carpenters? The same Carpenters that the Rolling 
Stone Record Guide long dismissed as "bubbly and bland"? 
</P>
<P>
 That incongruity is what intrigued Matt Wallace, who has produced records by 
such acclaimed alternative acts as Faith No More, the Replacements and Paul 
Westerberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the interesting rub about this project, taking very commercial, pop, 
melodic songs and marrying them with bands that don't tend to do very melodic 
songs," said Wallace, who served as executive producer on the album with music 
journalist David Konjoyan. 
</P>
<P>
 Konjoyan notes that, despite the obvious musical differences, the Carpenters 
have a lot in common with these alternative acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In their own time, the Carpenters were probably as alternative as any 
alternative band is today," he said. "They were certainly taking their own 
path. I think anybody who bucks trends, anybody who does their own thing 
despite what's going on around them, earns respect for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Hamby -- vice president of artists and repertoire at A&M Records, which 
released all the Carpenters' records -- agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Karen was sort of emblematic of an alternative type of soul," he 
said. "It's there in her story, her presence, her voice. There was always this 
sad, melancholy quality in her voice -- even on the happiest, most up-tempo 
songs that she sang. And I think a lot of these alternative artists have picked 
up on that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Do these acts really like the Carpenters -- or is this some kind of a sendup? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the first question people invariably ask when they hear about this 
album -- which also includes performances by Babes in Toyland, Shonen Knife, 
Cracker, Sheryl Crow and Johnette Napolitano with Marc Moreland. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Carpenter and executives at A&M acknowledge that they were concerned 
that the album might be "tongue in cheek" when Konjoyan and Wallace first 
presented the idea a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They needn't have worried. The artists' affection for the Carpenters seems 
genuine. There may be some nostalgia at play here, but the attraction isn't 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The second question people usually ask is more complex: How much of this 
fascination is due to the tragedy surrounding Karen Carpenter? The singer was 
just 32 when she died in 1983 after an eight-year battle with anorexia nervosa. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Konjoyan says, "I don't think we can extract the Carpenters' lives from 
their music and have it really mean the same to all these bands. I mean, there 
is a very tragic story behind their career, and I think that's added a lot of 
depth to what they're about." 
</P>
<P>
 Alternative acts seem to be especially intrigued by the disparity between the 
Carpenters' sugarcoated image and the darker reality of their lives. Some even 
see the Carpenters' story as a metaphor for the dark side of the American Dream 
-- the underside of success, beauty and family ties. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're so American -- they have the light and the dark," said Kim Gordon, 
bassist and singer for Sonic Youth, a leading underground band that performs 
"Superstar" on the album. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just find the whole family aspect fascinating," she added. "It's like the 
Beach Boys family. They're supposed to be the ideal American families -- the 
success dream, and all that." 
</P>
<P>
 But underneath were problems and conflicts, as in any family -- only magnified 
by the pressures of stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonic Youth co-leader Thurston Moore added that those undertones of darkness 
come across in the Carpenters' music -- and are part of what makes it so 
alluring. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a certain sort of dark mystery to the music that we always found so 
potent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bettis, who teamed with Richard Carpenter to write such hits as "Goodbye 
to Love" and "Yesterday Once More," said that what Moore and others hear in the 
music was real. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dark side, the melancholia, was as real as they feel it was. They're 
responding to the emotional truth, not the image, which is what I always 
wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 W hen Karen Carpenter died on Feb. 4, 1983, many pop fans hadn't given the 
Carpenters much thought in years. The duo's last album, in 1981, and last TV 
special, in 1980, had both bombed. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen's death drew heavy coverage, in part because it was so unexpected and 
she was so young. But an album of previously unreleased material released later 
that year met with only modest success. When producer Dick Clark included a 
brief tribute to Karen on his American Music Awards program in January, 1984, 
it was like remembering someone from another era. 
</P>
<P>
 And with Karen dead and unable to add to her legacy, it seemed that there was 
little chance of a popular revival or critical reappraisal. It appeared that 
the Carpenters were destined to be permanently undervalued as simply an 
engaging middle-of-the-road pop group like, say, the Fifth Dimension or Bread. 
</P>
<P>
 That was frustrating for Carpenters fans who thought all along that Karen 
Carpenter deserves to be considered among the best female vocalists of the 
modern pop era, someone who could (and, for a few years, did) give Barbra 
Streisand a run for her money. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrissie Hynde, the lead singer of the Pretenders -- and a longtime favorite 
of critics -- may have been the first major rock artist to challenge the 
critical consensus that the Carpenters were a pleasant but insubstantial act. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1984, in the midst of a Pretenders show at the Universal 
Amphitheatre, Hynde dedicated a number to Karen, saying she had "one of the 
greatest voices of all time." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, numerous other artists -- as varied as Michael Jackson, Axl 
Rose, Luther Vandross and k.d. lang -- have spoken fondly of the Carpenters. 
</P>
<P>
 An important step in the reappraisal of the Carpenters came in 1987, when Todd 
Haynes, an avant-garde New York filmmaker, made the dark and unsettling 
"Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story." The critically lauded film showed 
sympathy for Karen as a person and respect for her as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 And the film didn't just preach to the converted: It played on the underground 
art-house circuit, where it made fans of the very sort of people who had 
previously scoffed at the Carpenters. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Rolling Stone came around eventually. In 1990, the magazine ran a 
positive review of "Lovelines," a collection of previously unreleased 
Carpenters and solo recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voices like Karen's never really go out of style," wrote critic Rob 
Hoerburger. " 'Lovelines' reveals just a few of the avenues that would have 
been open to her. But sadly . . . she died before she could shed the 
goody-two-shoes image that shrouded her immense talent." 
</P>
<P>
 A rave in Rolling Stone? The irony was not lost on one reader who wrote in: "I 
found the review for the latest and last Carpenters album to be bittersweet. To 
have the publication that made it a stigma to enjoy their music finally extol 
its virtues proves that we cannot appreciate what we have until it is lost 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The editors ran the letter under an illustration of a three-star rating taped 
to Karen's headstone. 
</P>
<P>
 M any of the acts on "If I Were a Carpenter" have been Car penters fans since 
they were kids. 
</P>
<P>
 * Christa Hillhouse, the bassist of 4 Non Blondes, still has the ticket stub 
from a 1972 Carpenters concert that she attended when she was 11. 
</P>
<P>
 * The members of the acclaimed Dutch band Bettie Serveert once rented a car to 
drive to the Carpenter family's first home in New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thurston Moore, the Sonic Youth guitarist, has hours of Carpenters TV 
appearances on video -- what he calls "a gold mine of Carpenters glory." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of the artists on the album, Kim Gordon points first to Karen's 
voice when asked why she is drawn to the Carpenters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was this girl-next-door image with this incredibly soulful, and at 
times sexy, voice," Gordon said. "Even though Karen didn't write the songs, she 
really made them her own -- in much the same way that a singer like Billie 
Holiday did. With both of them, the words came right from the heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said that she became a fan just five years ago. Before, she was put off 
by the Carpenters' Establishment image. "It was music your parents would like 
you to listen to," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Moore brought in a Carpenters tape, she ignored the image and simply 
focused on the music. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Gordon went public with her affection for the Carpenters. She 
co-wrote and sang lead on "Tunic (Song for Karen)," a dark-edged but 
sympathetic song that was featured on the band's album "Goo." The song depicts 
Karen, happy at last, speaking to her family from heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, some Sonic Youth fans took it as a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure a lot of people just thought, 'Oh, they're into it for the kitsch 
factor,' but it was a sincere song," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think the Carpenters have transcended kitsch because the music is so 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since Karen died, Richard Carpenter, 47, has spent much of his 
time preparing compilations of Carpenters songs for release around the world. 
The composer-pianist, who was married in 1984 and has four children, also 
served as a consultant on a top-rated TV movie about the Carpenters in 1989 and 
cooperated on an authorized biography about the duo that was published earlier 
this year. On Oct. 1, he will perform at the formal dedication of the Richard 
and Karen Carpenter Performing Arts Center at their alma mater, Cal State Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A nd what does the man who produced and arranged the Carpenters' long string 
of hits think of "If I Were a Carpenter"? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm impressed with the whole project," he said. "I find the fact that they 
wanted to put this project together touching and a real testament to the 
Carpenters and Karen in particular."  
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, who played piano and sang background on Matthew Sweet's version of 
"Let Me Be the One" for the new album, said his initial concerns that the 
collection might be tongue in cheek were quickly dispelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can hear that . . . it was all done from the heart," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis, Richard's longtime lyricist, especially likes the fact that the album 
isn't "precious" about the Carpenters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the feeling for a while after Karen passed away that there was almost a 
handle-with-care attitude about it," he said. "I'm kind of glad -- and I think 
Karen would be glad -- that the kid gloves are off." 
</P>
<P>
 Herb Alpert, who signed the Carpenters to his A&M Records in 1969, thinks the 
resurgence of interest in the duo is linked to the dearth of classic pop 
songwriting in recent years -- years in which the music scene has been 
dominated by rap, hard-rock and dance music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good melodies have become a unique commodity in the last several years," 
Alpert said. "The Carpenters' songs are speaking to a lyrically starved 
community of artists." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, Alpert downplays all of this analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think one needs to probe deeply for the answers," he said. "People 
respond when they are moved."*

VISIBILITY, STABILITY. NOW, THE NEXT STEP.; THE OLDEST GAY AND LESBIAN THEATER 
COMPANY IN L.A. HAS HAD ITS BEST YEAR EVER -- BUT WHAT NOW? ARTISTIC DIRECTOR 
ROBERT SCHROCK HAS A PLAN THAT MAY SURPRISE SOME PEOPLE.

 It's show time in West Hollywood, and half a dozen beefy, clean-cut guys 
soft-shoe their way across the stage with their pants around their ankles. They 
sing as they dance -- cheek to cheek, so to speak -- through "The Ballad of 
Little Mikey." 
</P>
<P>
 On another evening, it's gals' night out in the "Girl Bar" as the regulars 
tell tales and angle to put the make on the new woman on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Check back again and there's a young Latino metamorphosing into an array of 
immigrant hucksters and others in "Men on the Verge of a His-panic Breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
 The fare may be diverse, but it's all part of the 1994 season at Los Angeles' 
oldest gay and lesbian stage company, the Celebration Theatre. Though it has 
struggled to find its niche in the past, this year the theater has had a 
breakthrough season -- thanks in no small part to Robert Schrock, artistic 
director of the past year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ballad of Little Mikey," for instance, turned out to have legs -- and not 
just the flashy gams with the half-mast jeans. In fact, in the months since 
that chorus line first kick-stepped its way across the proscenium, the show has 
been revised and moved to another venue, the St. Genesius Theatre in West 
Hollywood, where it recently passed the 800-performance mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celebration's mission is "to entertain and enlighten and to combat 
homophobia, not only in the straight world but also amongst homosexuals," 
Schrock says. "We need to present work that lets everybody know that we have a 
lot to contribute. Audiences come and they see good work and it gives them more 
respect -- if they're gay, for themselves, and if they're straight, for gays." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Schrock also stresses what gays and straights have in 
common: "I want people to say, 'That's a great play -- it happens to be about 
gays, but it's a great play.' I'm more interested in presenting theater than I 
am in presenting 'gay.' I'm a gay man, but I'm a theater person before I'm a 
gay person, and that's my approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a salmon-colored polo shirt that complements his blue-gray eyes and 
blond locks, Schrock has the enthusiasm -- and fatigue -- of a man who has 
landed in the right job at the right cultural moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gay theater is a viable place to be right now," he says, doing more talking 
than munching over a chicken Caesar salad in a Sunset Boulevard bistro. "It 
doesn't have to be hidden anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Schrock is referring to the success, in recent years, of such gay-themed 
Broadway shows as "Kiss of the Spider Woman" and "Angels in America," as well 
as to the movie "Philadelphia," starring Tom Hanks as a young man dying of 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 These works -- as well as the success of the television adaptation of "And the 
Band Played On" -- suggest that there is room for gay stories in the 
mainstream. "You can do your Highways activism, your ACT UP thing, and that's 
immediate," Schrock says, referring to the Santa Monica performance venue known 
for presenting a great deal of gay work and the AIDS activist group. "But in 
the long run, if you present work that has a universal voice and is 
intelligent, then you're combatting homophobia in a broader sense." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Celebration has always been widely regarded as less experimental and 
confrontational than 5-year-old Highways. Launched by director Charles Rowland 
in 1982 -- only a year after Harvey Fierstein's "Torch Song Trilogy" premiered 
and just as AIDS was first beginning to trickle into the public consciousness 
-- the Celebration Theatre began in a small venue in a run-down part of Silver 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the emergence of gay theater in America dates to the late 1960s, the 
early 1980s were a time when gay plays such as "La Cage aux Folles" (1983) were 
proliferating in New York. Similarly, gay theaters like the Celebration were 
being established throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if there's truth to the saying that what matters is "location, location 
and location," Celebration had three strikes against it from the get-go. "It 
was literally ghetto theater in a ghetto," says actor-activist Michael Kearns 
of Artists Confronting AIDS. "The self-worth of the theater was affected by 
where it lived." 
</P>
<P>
 Also during these early years, there were many artistic directors, most of 
whom served for no more than a year. They could not get comfortable under the 
aegis of Rowland, who continued to oversee the theater's activities. 
</P>
<P>
 During the mid-1980s, when the Celebration had a few years under its belt, gay 
theater became increasingly visible on a national level. Two landmark AIDS 
dramas -- Larry Kramer's "The Normal Heart" and William Hoffman's "As Is" -- 
bowed in New York in 1985, the same year that actor Rock Hudson died of 
complications from AIDS. And shortly thereafter, AIDS plays began to 
proliferate on both coasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celebration, however, seemed to have one foot stuck in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I totally respected his roots and what he'd done, there was 
something old-fashioned about Rowland that stunted the growth of the theater," 
says Kearns, who was Celebration's artistic director in 1988 -- one of the 
theater's most provocative years, because of the controversial play "Jerker, or 
the Helping Hand." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerker," written by the late Robert Chesley, portrayed a series of phone-sex 
encounters between two men and was staged Off Broadway in 1987. Subsequent to 
the 1988 Celebration staging, the Federal Communications Commission found the 
script "offensive" when portions were aired on KPFK-FM. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it wasn't until Rowland died in late 1990 and the theater moved from 
Silver Lake to its present West Hollywood site that the Celebration really 
began to come into its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Borden first joined the theater as an actor that year. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, the theater was a kind of collective," he says. "A bunch of 
people got together and made it run, and that's the only reason it ran." 
</P>
<P>
 Borden, who became executive director and a member of the board of directors 
in 1991, decided to "professionalize it" -- "I tightened up procedures, basic 
responsibility issues. No one ever got paid before this past year." 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the spring of 1992, Borden began to expand the board. He also set 
in motion a search for an artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Schrock, a Goodman Theatre-trained former New York actor who has lived 
in L.A. since 1976. Schrock had worked at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre and 
directed more than two dozen productions in small L.A. houses. He had also 
logged time as a staff writer on the soap "Rituals" and written original 
theater works. 
</P>
<P>
 Schrock's foremost task was assembling a season, and even now, he's still 
Monday-morning-quarterbacking this year's success. 
</P>
<P>
 The season opener, "The Pink Triangle," is, for example, a show that Schrock 
believes may have gotten short shrift. The play, brought to his attention by 
director Ron Link, portrayed the persecution of gays in Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back, I shouldn't have opened the season with that show," says 
Schrock, who is considering reviving the play in a year or so. "It's a subject 
that needs to be known, and if the theater had already done a few shows, more 
people would've come to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pink Triangle" was followed by such works as Mark Savage's "The Ballad of 
Little Mikey" -- Celebration's first musical -- and Chilean writer Guillermo 
Reyes' multi-character solo "Men on the Verge of a His-panic Breakdown," a 
Celebration commission performed by Felix A. Pire. 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis Nagy's "Girl Bar" was the most successful lesbian drama in the 
nine-play season. The Celebration also broke ground in terms of stretching its 
own boundaries with the premiere of a gay Asian play called "A Language of 
Their Own," which is set to be produced by the Public Theatre in New York in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, it has been a strong season for the ledger too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been lucky this year in that we have survived solely on ticket 
sales," Schrock says. "We have no outside funding whatsoever. That's 
miraculous, that we've made it totally off the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Celebration isn't completely in the black. "We have a bit of a deficit 
but it's manageable," Schrock says. "If my board of directors starts to get 
aggressive like they've said they were going to, we can erase that. There's a 
lot of money in the gay community, and we haven't tapped it." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the money woes, Schrock and his board have also been at odds over more 
substantive matters. At least once, the bone of contention has been what 
scripts should be produced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lulu," a play with music adapted from the pre-Expressionist writings of 
German dramatist Frank Wedekind, was originally set to be produced by the 
Celebration. The project was dropped, though, when board members and Schrock 
disagreed about whether to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Schrock was in favor of staging the work, which follows the exploits of an 
amoral seductress and draws upon the same source that inspired G. W. Pabst's 
1928 film "Pandora's Box" and the Alban Berg opera "Lulu," as well as other 
theatrical adaptations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that it would be a good play to produce because I couldn't find 
good lesbian material, but also because it had the historical value of being 
the first sympathetic lesbian character in modern literature," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 O thers, however, didn't share his enthusiasm, Schrock says: "Some of our 
board of directors said it wasn't gay enough. When that play was first 
produced, it was banned because it was too gay. So it's interesting how the 
times have turned." 
</P>
<P>
 But Borden differs with his artistic director's recollection of events: "It 
was never that the board of directors decided to withdraw because it wasn't 
'queer' enough. It was the finances more than anything else. The board 
overextended itself. We would have had to spend another $5,000 (to mount the 
production)." 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason that Schrock was enthusiastic about "Lulu" was that one of his 
goals is to make Celebration an equally gay and lesbian theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boys don't come to the girls' plays and the girls don't come to the boys' 
plays," he says. "As much as we are supposedly a very together community, we're 
not all one. It's a totally different market, and it's hard to reach both." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just that a good lesbian script is hard to find but also that the 
audience isn't as regular as Schrock would like. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been told that the lesbians were the backbone of the theater, that they 
gave it the most support and that they're starving for anything to come see 
that represents them," he says. "But I haven't found that to be true. 'Girl 
Bar' did well. But on 'Lesbian Sea Gulls,' we're not doing well at all." 
</P>
<P>
 S till, sometimes you have to make an investment in the future via what 
Schrock calls a "noble failure" such as "Lesbian Sea Gulls." 
</P>
<P>
 "My original idea for 'Lesbian Sea Gulls' was to have well-known, established 
gay writers write a little 10-minute play," he says. "But it's hard for a 
theater at this level to attract major talent, because we can't pay them." 
</P>
<P>
 He turned instead to emerging talents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an uneven show and I'll be the first to admit it," Schrock says. "But 
I'm proud because I was able to commission six lesbian playwrights and a 
songwriter to write for the theater. That's my psychic income." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Schrock realizes that he has to tread lightly when it comes to 
helping female artists and their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not being a lesbian, it makes it even harder for me to find what they want to 
see," he says. "For every 20 male scripts that I get, there's only one female 
script, and it probably isn't good. So that's why I'm trying to develop more 
lesbian writers." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone thinks he is succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Bob has a real sensitivity toward women's issues," Borden says. 
"He's in the process of still learning that." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Schrock maintains that he'd like to see all kinds of gay separatism go by 
the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just don't cross over," he says of the various factions within the 
Celebration audience. "The 'Little Mikey' crowd didn't come to see 'A Language 
of Their Own.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Schrock would even like to push the envelope of what is usually considered 
right for a gay theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get away from doing ghetto plays," he says. "A Tennessee Williams 
festival would be appropriate to do in a gay theater. But right now, I don't 
think my audience would be quite accepting of that. They really want to see 
their own issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly with the increasing respect afforded such places as Highways and 
such groups as Artists Confronting AIDS -- both of which present predominantly, 
although not exclusively, gay work -- it will be even more imperative that 
Schrock keep working to hone Celebration's own artistic identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden, though, won't be around to see what Schrock accomplishes. He has 
resigned and will be officially leaving his post Sept. 19. "I couldn't see 
myself going into another year for $500 a month, plus having a regular job to 
keep myself alive," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then too there are the usual antagonisms and frustrations that plague the 
boards of many nonprofit arts organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough working with an artistic director sometimes and it's tough working 
with a board sometimes," Borden says. "There are some things that I'm not 
thrilled about. I felt that when I left, they'd have to be responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 S hrock, for his part, is neither burnt-out nor sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of growing pains," he says. "It's been a difficult year in 
many respects because we've created a child that needs to be fed and the 
organization is now realizing that. Now that it has that visibility, it takes a 
lot more maintenance. And maintenance equates with money." 
</P>
<P>
 But money isn't easy for any small theater to come by. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a 63-seat theater with a post down the middle and you can't let that 
defeat you," Schrock says. "You have to think bigger than that. You have to 
have a much broader vision of what you want to bring to people." 
</P>
<P>
 And that is the kind of optimism mixed with realism that has helped Schrock 
and the Celebration so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great about it," he says of the success of his first full season. 
"It's a real roller-coaster ride. But as a kid, I didn't like the 
merry-go-round. It's a choice that I have made to ride the roller coaster."*

JAZZ; IT'S NOT THE 'TUDE, IT'S THE TUNES; WHAT'S GOING DOWN IN MONTEREY? A JAZZ 
FEST WHERE (SURPRISE) MUSIC MATTERS. BUT DON'T WORRY. A PARTY ATMOSPHERE IS 
STILL PART OF THE MIX.

<P>
 How hot has the Monterey Jazz Festival been in the past? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this: At the close of the event's first installment, 1958, a bra and 
panties were found among the seats. Nothing special now, perhaps, in the 
post-Woodstock rock 'n' grunge '90s, but pretty radical for the conservative, 
crew-cut Eisenhower decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Not for the Monterey Festival, though, which always has been as much about 
atmosphere and attitude as it has been about music. This is, after all, an 
event that is so ingrained in the community that box seats have been known to 
figure in divorce settlements, and the intensity of the partying sometimes 
equals the energy of the music. 
</P>
<P>
 This is also an event that proudly lists that well-known jazz aficionado Clint 
Eastwood as a member of its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real news about this year's festival, which runs Friday through next 
Sunday, is not about bras or divorces, or partying or movie stars -- at least 
not yet. The real news is that Monterey, after years of relative musical 
decline, is showing powerful signs of once again becoming an important jazz 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the MJF has been a perennial commercial success, with its audience 
loyalty extending across generations, the festival's impact as a leading 
international stage for the display of state-of-the-art jazz diminished 
considerably in the '70s and '80s. Rock, blues and peripheral acts crept into 
the programming, and general manager Jimmy Lyons' firm devotion to mainstream 
jazz tended to limit the appearances of younger, more contemporary players. The 
ironic result, for the last decade and a half, has been a festival that -- to 
many jazz observers -- has been musically unimportant. 
</P>
<P>
 No such characterization could ever have been applied to the festival in its 
early years, when -- in addition to its free and easy social atmosphere -- it 
was a model for the presentation of first-rate, innovative music in an open, 
airy and pleasant setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dizzy Gillespie, a festival perennial, once said that he felt "back at home 
again" whenever he played the MJF. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people feel the same way. Located on the Monterey Fairgrounds, 
caressed by crystal-clear breezes from the peninsula and within easy distance 
of Cannery Row and the quaint streets of Carmel, the festival is blessed with 
an ambience comparable to atmospheric European festivals in Montreux, Nice and 
Umbria, and an abundance of devoted fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Darlene Chan, once a production assistant at the MJF and now producer of the 
Playboy Jazz Festival, sees at least one striking difference between the two 
programs. To her, the longtime listeners who come to Monterey are "real jazz 
lovers." The Playboy festival attendees, she believes, "are just music fans." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three Monterey festival performing venues -- the large Main Arena, the Garden 
Stage and the Night Club -- are surrounded by acres of food and merchandise 
booths, photo and art exhibitions and various clinics and workshops. Less 
obvious, but equally important, the musical programs -- unlike many other 
contemporary jazz festivals -- have generally been presented with excellent 
sound, a legacy of decades of dealing with the audio reproductive needs that 
are unique to jazz ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterey was a major-league jazz happening from the first notes of its kickoff 
production in 1958. Virtually everything that came to characterize the festival 
in later years was present from the beginning: a sterling lineup of acts 
(including Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Gerry Mulligan, the Modern Jazz 
Quartet, Dave Brubeck and Billie Holiday), a dedication to the commissioning of 
new works and, above all, a loose and easy, party-time atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Chronicle's venerable Herb Caen, in his column of Oct. 7, 
1958, described that seminal weekend perfectly: "The first annual Monterey Jazz 
Festival staggered to a finish in a cloud of puffed lips, sore fingers and 
monumental hangovers -- to say nothing of flattened fifths hanging in clusters 
from the ancient pines and cypresses."

 The first festival was also the start of a series of dramatic images that 
continued over the years: Gillespie playing "The Star-Spangled Banner" at 
1958's opening session; Harry James and Miles Davis bringing Gillespie his 
trumpet on a pillow; a frail-looking Billie Holiday in one of her last 
performances; Lambert, Hendricks & Ross singing vocalized introductions for 
each of the acts on their bill; John Lewis playing " 'Round Midnight" for 
Thelonious Monk; an angry Charles Mingus leading his band offstage to the 
strains of "When the Saints Go Marching In" as quickly as he had led them on. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Monterey Jazz Festival, the 37th annual installment, continues a 
hopeful return to past artistic glories. In 1992, with the transfer of the 
festival's general managership from Lyons, a former disc jockey who (with jazz 
critic Ralph Gleason) created the event, to musician-producer Tim Jackson, the 
festival began its journey back into the global jazz picture.  
</P>
<P>
 "Monterey may have been resting on its laurels a little bit," Jackson says. "I 
know it's not fair, but a lot of people only look at the last 10 or 15 years, 
and they say, 'No, man, it wasn't happening. It was too conservative.' Even 
though if you look at the early years of the festival, there was some 
incredibly creative stuff happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem was that there was a perception on the part of a lot of the 
old-timers on the board of directors that sort of went, 'Well, we're the 
Monterey Jazz Festival. We're the best thing since canned beer.' And I said, 
'Well, folks, I hate to pop the bubble, but it's a new day out there. If we 
don't do the necessary things to remain competitive and make this a better 
place to come, we're going to start losing out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At 40, Jackson is already a 20-year veteran of the Central California/Monterey 
Bay jazz scene. A jazz flutist who continues to lead his own groups, he was one 
of the founders, in 1975, of a highly successful, nonprofit performance center 
in Santa Cruz called the Kuumbwa (Swahili for act of creation ) Jazz Center. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Jackson took over the Monterey festival, it was no longer the sole 
major player in the central California jazz scene. The '80s and '90s had seen 
the emergence of five other significant events in the Bay Area alone: the San 
Francisco Jazz Festival, the San Jose Jazz Festival, the Russian River Jazz 
Festival and two festivals in Concord.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was very much aware of the competition when he began programming for 
the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1991, the year before he replaced Lyons as 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things had gotten kind of predictable from around 1975," he explains. "You 
can't fault some of the acts that were included, but there's no doubt that the 
programming got too predictable. And, even though the attendance never went 
down, there was grumbling from some of the patrons that they wanted to hear 
some new things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Jimmy wanted to avoid the more contemporary-type acts. There was one 
year in which the board asked him, maybe even insisted, that he book some 
contemporary-type jazz, and he booked Spyro Gyra. But he apparently gave them a 
somewhat less than inspiring introduction, which didn't exactly thrill the 
band." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson came on board with the inherent advantages of an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I grew up in this area, and had been involved with jazz all my 
life," he says, "I had never actually come to the festival before, and never 
had any real contact with it." 
</P>
<P>
 "But I knew the festival organization had become a bit inbred, in that there 
had been very few changes, staff-wise, in many, many years, and the board of 
directors had stayed pretty stable. So, because I didn't know anything about 
the organization, I could question everything, legitimately. And I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson believes he was further aided in the modifications he has made by the 
fact that the board, from the festival's inception, has never played a role in 
any of the creative decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't make creative decisions about a music festival by committee," he 
says, "even though some festivals try to do it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's more eclectic tastes -- a direct departure from Lyons' musical 
beliefs -- reflect his continuing parallel persona as a professional musician.  
</P>
<P>
 "I take the point of view of not going for the label so much as for the music 
itself," he explains. "To me, for example, Joe Zawinul is just as vital a 
musician as Oscar Peterson. He just happens to enjoy electronics, while Oscar 
enjoys a Bosendorfer grand piano. But both artists are the sort I want to see 
at this festival." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed for examples of acts that might not fit into his perception of the new 
Monterey Jazz Festival picture, Jackson replies, reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, like, say, the Rippingtons, or the Kilauea-type acts," he says. 
"They're really not what this festival is about, although I don't mean to 
disparage what they do, which is fine for what it is. But it maybe defines 
things better to say that, in the contemporary arena, acts like David Sanborn 
or the Yellowjackets or Grover Washington are what the festival is about." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's MCI-sponsored fes tival, with its sparkling main events and 
far-ranging ancillary entertainments, is a clear expression of the fresh ideas 
and forward-looking programming notions that Jackson has brought to the 
festival. In the 7,000-seat Main Arena, the principal performance area, evening 
concerts will include Sonny Rollins, Joe Henderson, Ornette Coleman, Max Roach, 
Milt Jackson, J. J. Johnson, Shirley Horn, Marcus Miller and Ray Brown, as well 
as the Contemporary Piano Ensemble, John Santos and the West Coast debuts of 
Roach's 12-piece percussion ensemble, M'Boom, and the Bob Mintzer big band. 
Grover Washington and Etta James will headline afternoon programs. 
</P>
<P>
 A multiplicity of events on the Garden Stage, which are open to anyone with a 
grounds pass, will feature, among others, singer Carmen Bradford, the quirky 
Boston-based Either/Orchestra and the Dottie Dodgion Trio. 
</P>
<P>
 (Inveterate stargazers will also have the opportunity during Sunday 
afternoon's Garden Stage program to see if Carmel's most famous political 
figure, the father of bassist Kyle Eastwood, will show up to hear his son's 
quartet.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We've also got some cutting-edge things," Jackson says. "The hip-hop and acid 
jazz of the Charlie Hunter Trio and Josh Jones and Human Flavor, and 
avant-garde in saxophonist John Tchcai and Eddie Gale, who played with Cecil 
Taylor and Sun Ra." 
</P>
<P>
 The Night Club, often a tryout venue for acts with Main Arena potential, has a 
lineup that not only is ready to step up, but is quite capable of being 
competitive with the Main Arena performers. A Columbia recording session will 
spotlight the much-praised Black/Note Quintet, David Sanchez and Terence 
Blanchard. Singer Nnenna Freelon, pianist Jessica Williams and her trio and the 
Dolphins (featuring Dan Brubeck, yet another offspring of a celebrity parent) 
will also appear. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Jackson's fascinating new additions has been the Sunday afternoon 
conversations with "jazz legends." Successfully initiated last year with 
guitarist-banjoist Danny Barker and bassist Milt Hinton, the Night Club 
presentation offers, according to Jackson, "a unique chance to hear stories 
from some masters of music." This year's "jazz legends" will be represented by 
drummer Max Roach and a panel discussion on the life of Lyons, who died in 
April at the age of 78. 
</P>
<P>
 A few things at the Monterey festival, however, have not changed. A "Statement 
of Principles" in the 1959 program noted that the festival's goal was to serve 
as a "true festival . . . where new works by prominent composers" would be 
commissioned and performed. Around the same time, the festival's commitment to 
jazz education was established and further concretized by the creation 10 years 
ago of the Monterey Jazz Education Fund.  
</P>
<P>
 Both concepts continue to play significant roles in the festival proceedings. 
Next Sunday night's program will premiere a recently commissioned composition 
for orchestra by L.A.-based pianist Billy Childs -- an extension of a tradition 
that reaches back to include works by Jimmy Giuffre, John Lewis and Gunther 
Schuller in 1959, Jon Hendricks' "Evolution of the Blues" and Duke Ellington's 
"Suite Thursday" in 1960, Lalo Schifrin's "Gillespiana Suite" in 1961 and Dave 
Brubeck's "The Real Ambassadors" in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday evening, Mintzer and pianist James Williams will conduct 
instrumental clinics. And on Sunday afternoon, the recipients of the nonprofit 
festival's revenues -- student musicians -- will strut their stuff in the Main 
Arena. It's a long weekend of colorful action, one which will extend a jazz 
legacy of music and entertainment that is now reaching into its fourth decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question about it, " Jackson says, "Monterey is a magnet. It's a 
place people want to go. And we intend to honor that desire."

I, SCREENWRITER; THE INSIDE STORY ON HOW ANDROGYNOUS PAT FROM 'SATURDAY NIGHT 
LIVE' TURNED INTO A MAINSTREAM (KIND OF), BIG-BUDGET (NOT VERY) HOLLYWOOD 
MOVIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Emerson, Jim Emerson is working on other writing projects, including 
another screenplay with Julia Sweeney. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Part of my job used to be to condemn the homogenized blandness of certain 
factory-tooled studio motion pictures. I was a movie critic at the Orange 
County Register and the Seattle Rocket, and I used to pride myself on being the 
only person I knew in Los Angeles who wasn't working on a screenplay. So I 
never dreamed I'd actually find myself in the belly of the Hollywood beast. 
</P>
<P>
 All that changed in the fall of 1992 when a producer and former manager of my 
friend, actress-writer Julia Sweeney, persuaded us to pitch an idea for a movie 
based on Pat, Julia's androgynous "Saturday Night Live" character. 
</P>
<P>
 At first we had exactly the same reservations you probably do: How can you 
make a feature film out of what was supposed to have been nothing more than a 
one-joke sketch at the Groundlings Theatre? We did not believe for a second 
that anybody would actually make this movie. Especially after they heard our 
pitch, which we (Julia, myself and former Groundling Stephen Hibbert) basically 
made up as we went along, and which must surely rank as one of the worst 
pitches ever delivered at a major studio -- including the ones at the beginning 
of "The Player." 
</P>
<P>
 It had something to do with an impending wedding between Pat and Pat's equally 
androgynous significant other, Chris. You know, "The Crying Game Meets 
Pee-wee's Big Adventure."  
</P>
<P>
 Then, at the end of our spiel, the executive clapped his hands and said: 
"Great! Let's do it!" We went into shock. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, the movie we made bears practically no resemblance to our pitch -- 
except that Pat and Chris do get married in the end. We had time to refine the 
concept a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of legal delays, we finally signed our writing deal with Fox. Two 
weeks later, the top executives who had wooed us left the company. Thus 
orphaned, we went through development -- the process whereby, as the cliche has 
it, the executives try to take anything original or distinctive out of the 
movie, while the writers struggle to salvage the stuff that made them want to 
write the thing in the first place.  
</P>
<P>
 I thought of Christopher Guest's "The Big Picture" in one early development 
meeting when an executive turned to us and said: "You know what? I want you to 
put a car chase in here." What does a car chase have to do with Pat? I don't 
know; but it evidently has something to do with "upping the stakes" for the 
character and with "externalizing" conflicts that were otherwise "too 
internal." 
</P>
<P>
 Naive though we may have been, we were pleased that our first draft was 
basically a non-car-chase kind of script. Instead, it was a character-based 
comedy with a provocative take on the nature of human (bi-)sexuality -- 
featuring a strait-laced, married, Orange-County-type neighbor of Pat's who is 
forced to question his own sexual orientation when he falls in love with Pat 
and still doesn't know if Pat is a man or a woman. (He doesn't care either way; 
he just wants a definite answer.) And we prided ourselves on refusing to stoop 
to the trite, overused devices (guns, drug deals, explosions, car chases) that 
are usually invoked to grab the audience's attention, but that usually put me 
right to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 We ended up writing a car chase, of course. But it involved bumper cars and, 
fortunately, proved too expensive to film. I'm very happy to report that no car 
chase made it into the shooting script. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a helpful producer suggested that, to "increase the sense of danger" 
for Pat, we should have Pat on the trail of a "Jeffrey Dahmer-like serial 
killer." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," I said. "You mean the bodies are so badly mutilated that you can't tell 
if they're male or female? That's hilarious." He got the point. The idea was 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 We honestly thought we were going to get expert guidance from the studio 
professionals on things like story structure and "character arcs." Instead, the 
constructive criticism from the pros rarely went any deeper than: "This isn't 
funny" or "This is hilarious." 
</P>
<P>
 One day, a development executive singled out one scene in our script that he 
"didn't get" and another he "loved." Since I'd been taking notes through the 
whole process (none of the studio people at Fox ever wrote anything down), I 
pointed out that, in our last meeting, his aesthetic judgments had been 
precisely the opposite. "Oh really?" he said, shrugging cheerfully. "Never 
mind, then." 
</P>
<P>
 T o be fair, the studio system is no better and no worse than any bureaucracy 
I've ever dealt with, whether it's a university or a major metropolitan 
newspaper. As in most bureaucracies, there's an incredible amount of wasted 
time and energy -- chiefly in the form of tedious meetings and memos that don't 
accomplish anything except to justify the jobs of middle-management. Sound 
familiar?  
</P>
<P>
 And yet, in the end, that wasteful and inefficient system did allow us to make 
a small-budget movie that we're proud of, that reflects our sensibilities and 
values, and that (above all) we think is funny for the right reasons -- which 
means we don't expect it to play well to Republicans or teen-age boys who are 
insecure about their sexuality. We didn't get everything we wanted from the 
studio, but we were kept involved throughout the entire process, from the 
writing and hiring of cast and crew, through shooting, to the final editing, 
music and even marketing, advertising and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Making this movie was a hands-on experience like nothing I'd ever expected and 
it taught me one thing above all else: It really helps when your co-writer is 
also the star of the picture. And when your executive producer (Teri Schwartz) 
understands what you're trying to do and is willing to fight for it. 
</P>
<P>
 It soon became clear that Fox envisioned "It's Pat" as a gag-filled, "Hot 
Shots!" kind of movie, while we were thinking more along the lines of an 
androgynous version of "The Awful Truth." What did they expect? "Wayne's 
World?" (Answer: yes.) Now, we all loved "Wayne's World," but it wasn't the 
kind of thing we wanted to do, or were even capable of doing, ourselves. To 
give you an idea: "Wayne's World" had "Laverne & Shirley" jokes, we had Camille 
Paglia jokes. And for music, they had Queen, we had Ween. 
</P>
<P>
 As our ever-developing script became cluttered with elaborate fantasy 
sequences, locations and stunts, the projected budget went higher and higher. 
When Fox wanted to hire another writer, Julia persuaded our friend, director 
Quentin Tarantino, a major Pat fan, to take a stab at it. Quentin agreed with 
our less-is-more philosophy, and his version -- basically a cut-and-paste 
editing job, as he described it -- brought the script closer to our simple 
first draft. Fox responded by putting us into turnaround, offering the movie to 
any other studio who would reimburse them for their expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 We wound up at Disney -- Touchstone, actually -- where we finally became the 
low-budget movie we had always thought we were. We immediately streamlined the 
script further and shot with a union crew on a tight, six-week schedule for 
roughly $8 million, or about one-third the cost of the average studio picture.  
</P>
<P>
 At first, however, we feared the studio was going to stifle the life right out 
of the movie. They gave us notes on every little thing: Pat has too many zits 
today, Chris' voice is too high, Pat's shirt is too tight. We were consumed, 
inundated with notes. But, miraculously, after they'd seen the dailies for a 
week or so and loved them, they left us alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, almost. When it came time to shoot a scene that was a parody of 
"Indecent Proposal" (this was about as mainstream as our comedy got), we were 
told we had to cast a European actor in the Robert Redford part. Apparently, 
the guy was a EuroDisney investor. So, we ended up with a guy in a tux and a 
mane of blond curly hair saying, 'Vat vould you say if I offered you a million 
dollarz to zleep vis Pat?' Needless to say, the scene didn't work and we wound 
up cutting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, I was horrified during post-production to find myself agreeing 
more often with the creative instincts of the Touchstone studio executives than 
I did with the first-time director we'd hired. Critical heresy. And I used to 
consider myself an auteurist.  
</P>
<P>
 As somebody who's worked for newspapers all his adult life, one of the 
revelations of making a movie has been seeing for myself how the press coverage 
compares to reality. Not well, I'm afraid. In fact, what happens in the news 
media is just as absurd and Kafkaesque as anything in the studio bureaucracy. 
Let's just say you don't want to see what goes into making certain things -- 
among them, laws, movies, news stories and sausages. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading an article about something you're involved in is kind of like watching 
blindfolded kids play Pin the Tail on the Donkey. They keep stabbing in the 
dark, but they never quite hit the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the Los Angeles Times has run two articles suggesting that there 
must be something wrong with "It's Pat" because -- God forbid -- it's short. 
(The running time is 77 minutes, something neither story got right.) Well, it 
is short, and it was meant to be. Because we trimmed the script before shooting 
to fit our budget and schedule limitations, the first cut of the movie was only 
seven minutes longer. Instead of the usual procedure of cutting a 2 1/2-hour 
assembly down to 90 minutes, we tightened it from 84 to 77 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the press's peculiar zealousness -- covering "Last Action Hero" or 
"I'll Do Anything" as if they were as momentous as Watergate, for example -- I 
think is due to the exaggerated sense of importance we place on entertainment 
these days, and general lack of understanding about how movies are made, 
especially how they are shaped and reshaped in the editing room. For instance, 
when we were in post-production, I was amazed to see again and again how 
choosing a different take or altering a couple cuts could make or destroy a 
whole scene.  
</P>
<P>
 E ven our trailer came in for scrutiny. In a recent Times story, a reporter 
included "It's Pat" in a list of recent trailers that "divulge nearly all plot 
elements or visual gimmicks." Had the reporter seen the movie she was talking 
about? No. So she didn't know how few jokes are revealed in the trailer, or 
that there's absolutely nothing from the climactic third act. She was just 
passing off unsupported and unattributed speculation as if it were fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, on Friday the speculation about "It's Pat" will end and, after almost 
two years, the picture will open -- in a limited, cult-picture-like way -- at 
last. We never really thought it was a mainstream comedy (with our play, "Mea's 
Big Apology," we only had to fill 99 seats at a time at the Groundling 
Theatre), but from test engagements in Seattle, Houston and Spokane, let's just 
say it looks like it's a whole lot less mainstream than we'd suspected. The 
early reviews have been wildly mixed -- from three stars to zero -- with the 
best ones being from small, gay and alternative papers read by hundreds and the 
worst ones being from major dailies read by millions. 
</P>
<P>
 From being a member of the Los Angeles Film Critics Assn., I know that, no 
matter what the movie, opinions always vary dramatically. In the meantime, I 
can't help speculating (especially after this article): Will I ever work in 
this town again?*

FILM CLIPS / 'WAR' HUNT: DIRECTOR REALLY OUT ON A LIMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Brennan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Auditioning humans is grueling enough, but director Jon Avnet and his crew 
found themselves auditioning trees -- 272 of them -- for a central role in his 
forthcoming film, "The War." 
</P>
<P>
 The Universal film tells the story of the children of two poor Georgia 
families in the '60s feuding over a fort built from refuse in the most perfect 
tree imaginable -- an 800-year-old angel oak, 60 feet tall, with limbs that 
swoop down to the ground 100 feet on either side like open, inviting arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's feud, in Avnet's words, "is a war over junk and that becomes 
the perfect metaphor for what are we fighting for" -- the "we" in this case 
being Americans who are waging a losing battle in Vietnam. Another key plot 
line centers on Vietnam veteran Jim Simmons (Kevin Costner), father of two of 
the children involved, grappling with that question and counseling his children 
(Elijah Wood and Lexi Randall) over the senselessness of fighting over things 
that don't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from telling a compelling story in the film (which is to be released 
Nov. 11), what did matter to Avnet and associate producer Martin Huberty was 
laying claim to just the right tree -- based on a drawing by Avnet's wife, 
Barbara, which ran in an ad in the Atlanta Constitution with these words: "The 
Makers of 'Fried Green Tomatoes' Are Back in Georgia: Make Your Tree a Star."  
</P>
<P>
 Letters and Polaroid snapshots poured in from Georgia, Mississippi, the 
Carolinas and Florida. "There were 90 gazillion resumes," laughed Huberty. 
"People would take these pictures of trees in their back yard and put their 
wives and kids in them, like that would convince us to give them a part in the 
film." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Huberty's favorites: a tree that had grown around a metal lawn chair. 
Another favor ite was what some of the crew called the Charlie Brown tree: a 
20-foot tall tree in the middle of a packed parking lot that looked like a 
stick with a green ball on top -- "exactly those kind of trees you drew in the 
first grade." It met at least one criterion: There wasn't a building in sight 
-- just 100 cars. Still, the selections were not exactly the arboreal ideal for 
the ultimate treefort that would inspire its inhabitants to defend it with life 
and limb. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner, ultimately, was a tree in Beaufort, S.C., actually located at the 
end of a Marine airbase runway with a road running around it. Avnet had been 
hesitant to even go see it, since he had wanted a tree near Senoia, Ga., where 
the movie was being filmed, and where "Fried Green Tomatoes," his sleeper hit 
of 1991, had also been filmed. But the South Carolina Film Commission was 
insistent on Avnet's flying to their state for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Scout Linda Lee had stopped by a convenience store on the way to the airport 
to pick up Avnet when she told the clerk about her search. "He told her to 
drive down the road a mile and she'd find her tree -- and there it was," said 
Maida Morgan, another location scout. 
</P>
<P>
 It matched pictures of the angel oaks Avnet had seen in books, trees native to 
South Carolina that grow huge over the centuries because their branches twist 
so much they broke blades when sawed, says Huberty. 
</P>
<P>
 After sleeping in the tree three nights, Avnet had a fort designed by Kristi 
Zea that didn't use a single nail but was mounted by planks in the four 
crotches of the tree. The road around the tree was ripped up and the earth was 
prepped to handle the heavy movie equipment, cranes and trampling by the crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were other trees that were larger, but there was such a sense of awe 
about this one," notes Avnet. "When I was a kid and grew up in Brooklyn, we 
didn't have trees like this . . . a world like this to live in. This film is 
literally about kids trying to build a house of their own." And that, he says, 
is something worth defending.*

FILM CLIPS / 'WILD' TIMES: RIVER OF RAGING REWRITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judy Brennan

<TEXT>
<P>
 What Denis F. O'Neill caught on his fishing trip goes beyond a whopper. In 
fact, his fish tale is so big, it's the kind Hollywood movies are made of: "The 
River Wild" (which unreels in theaters Sept. 30), to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, 45, conjured up the idea for the movie's script while on a 
fly-fishing trip along Montana's Smith River, which flows through the Lewis and 
Clark National Forest. After a few shots of Irish whiskey with his pals, he 
began to fantasize about his camping and fishing trip on what they dubbed the 
"river of no return." A few what-ifs in their storytelling began to scare the 
wits out of each other and eventually resulted in a 1989 article O'Neill wrote 
for Fly Rod & Reel magazine called "Diary of a Mad Floater." 
</P>
<P>
 Producer David Foster, longtime partner of Lawrence Turman, loved the script 
and got Universal Pictures to option it in August, 1991, for their Turman 
Foster Co. to produce. Several script rewrites later, the tale was floating in 
front of Meryl Streep. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill had met Streep through her husband, the sculptor Donald Gummer. Gummer 
knew O'Neill's wife Deborah McLeod, a contemporary art specialist, who had 
planned a showing of his work at the now-defunct BlumHelman Gallery branch in 
Los Angeles. The showing never happened, but O'Neill and Gummer became friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The role was a great part for a woman in her early 40s," which O'Neill said 
was culled largely from O'Neill watching his friend and river guide Sandy 
Colvard maneuver the Smith River in Montana. "Donald thought Meryl would be 
interested in reading it," added O'Neill. "Truth is, I reworked it with her in 
mind." But O'Neill was bumped off his script and, in typical Hollywood fashion, 
another writer -- Robert King ("Clean Slate") -- was brought aboard to rework 
it. But that didn't work out and O'Neill was brought back for a second rewrite. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at that time that the script fell into Streep's hands. But it still 
wasn't the version that Universal and Foster wanted. Curtis Hanson ("The Hand 
That Rocks the Cradle") agreed to direct only if changes were made in the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio hired the writing team of Raynold Gideon and Bruce Evans ("Stand by 
Me," "Starman"), who had a deal at Universal, to add their Midas touch. Then 
Hanson and writer/actress Carrie Fisher took a stab at it. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was the beginning of a long ride in the white waters of arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Writers Guild stepped in because O'Neill was co-producer on the picture. 
Any time a writer carries executive credit on a picture, it automatically 
becomes a matter of arbitration over who gets screenplay credit. Because 
O'Neill originated the story and script, any writers other than O'Neill had to 
show the guild that at least 50% of their writing was up on the screen or their 
names would not appear in the credits. They all pulled the short straw except 
O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is, Meryl was interested but still didn't commit until she read our 
version of the script, which is what Universal greenlit for the movie," says 
Gideon. "When we read Denis' original screenplay we knew how to fix it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fixing it, in Evans and Gideon's view, meant ditching the opening scene that 
has Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly's characters killing a co-ed at a car wash, 
stealing her car, then robbing a bank and being chased by a determined sheriff 
throughout the course of the film. O'Neill's original ending was also changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Denis wrote the original screenplay, the story and he got everybody involved. 
But we did the screenplay that got it made," says Evans. Some scenes were 
altered. "We made one of the characters mute and Meryl's character a history 
teacher who works in sign (language), which becomes significant later in the 
film." 
</P>
<P>
 The writing duo never met O'Neill and they say they are not sucking on sour 
grapes over the Writers Guild's decision to deny them screenplay credit. "This 
is the way it goes. We obviously would like to have credit, but we believe the 
rules are correct in saying the original writer should always be favored." 
After all, they acknowledge, that rule could easily turn in their favor some 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 That said, O'Neill is quick to point out that Fisher, and particularly Hanson, 
had a lot to do with shaping the script and tweaking plot points. Hanson says 
that neither he nor Fisher wanted credit, but felt O'Neill should get story 
credit and share screenplay credit with Gideon and Evans. "It was Denis who 
came up with the idea of a woman being the expert oarsman and that of course is 
the nucleus of the film," the director noted. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the end of the day, O'Neill can dust off any discrepancies, settle back 
in his Beverly Hills writing perch surrounded with photos of past river rafting 
and fly-fishing trips and every trout gadget imaginable, and bask in what he 
calls his 15 minutes of fame, turning a $350 magazine short story into a 
$400,000 script called "The River Wild." 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect," he muses, "it's the best fishing trip I ever took."

COMMENTARY; AN ANTIDOTE FOR TV'S TALK SOUP; 'THE DYSFUNCTIONAL SHOW' -- HOSTED 
BY WHITEY FJORD -- GIVES US A FUNCTIONAL AND FUNNY LOOK AT SOCIETY'S FREAK 
SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that NOW's "Flush Rush" campaign has persuaded the Florida Orange Juice 
people to unhire Rush Limbaugh (those juice folks really know how to pick 
spokespeople, don't they?), the National Organization for Women is pushing to 
rid the airwaves completely of the smug darling of the lazy right. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are, however, "Flush Rush" will only bring its target more and more 
attention. No, the correct antidote to Rush Limbaugh is not NOW but Whitey 
Fjord. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitey Fjord, you see, is the overfed, overconfident, overly right-wing host 
of a talk-show parody, otherwise known as "The Dysfunctional Show," played as 
improv by a troupe of stand-up comedians and actors every Saturday night at 
10:30 at the Hudson Theatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Each week, Whitey (Dan Rosen) and his guests explore topics that you might 
actually find in your TV Guide, often on shows with more left-leaning, 
seemingly compassionate hosts.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of Whitey's recent topics: "Gay Men and the Women Who Want Them," 
featuring a Ph.D whose book is called "I'm OK, You're a Faggot"; "The Rap on 
Gangster Rap," on which Whitey explained that the violence depicted by rappers 
was worse than movie violence because "when you talk about Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, you're talking about a guy who shoots foreigners," and the 
always timely "O.J. Simpson -- Martyr or Mandingo?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the multicultural tinderbox that is Los Angeles, people officially discuss 
race, religion and gender in language so thickly powdered and polite that it 
sometimes obscures the anger that is often really at issue. "The Dysfunctional 
Show" blasts through all of those minefields. Rosen, his fellow creators Phil 
Emmett and Warren Hutcherson and their revolving and racially mixed cast walk a 
dangerous line as they enter these discussions from the opposite direction -- 
that is, head-on, with guns blazing, insults flying and subtext unearthed. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitey beholds an African American woman and muses, "You're at the bottom of 
the totem pole, aren't you?" When she answers, "First of all, have you been 
examined?" Whitey shoots back with, "Yes, I've been examined and I'm 100% 
American." He is too. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitey's insensitivity is just a shade more manifest than what actually gets 
on the air. When confronted with a Puerto Rican manicurist (Emily Cutler), he 
asks, "Your boyfriend, Hector, an Hispanic man, is what, a gardener?" On the 
same show he inadvertently exposes the stupidity of the nation's debate about 
homosexuals in the military: "You're a lesbian. How do you feel sitting next to 
all of these women and yet not having sex with them?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dysfunctional Show" does not really explore the paper-thin 
"controversies" that overflow the airwaves. Instead it exposes how the passion 
for cheap drama that makes TV producers book guests according to their 
confrontation value, or their sideshow-freak appeal, can inflame real 
discussions that are at the heart of how we all live together. 
</P>
<P>
 The laughter is cathartic for several reasons. The parade of weirdos and angry 
righteous people who appear on Whitey is pathetically familiar not only because 
of television but because we have all passionately defended some feeble 
nonsense that made enormous sense at one moment in time. Blacks against whites, 
men against women, straights against gays. This show revels in how asinine all 
of these divisions really are. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And of course, there's everyone's favorite excuse for a talk show: Mindless 
titillation masquerading as social commentary. Hence, Whitey is apt to 
introduce a program with, "Today we're going to explore the hopes, the dreams, 
the fears of women and we're going to do it all in lingerie." 
</P>
<P>
 In this show Whitey pits four women (in lingerie) against a fully dressed Dr. 
Chris Robinson (the hilariously hostile John Ridley), who has written several 
books, such as "Whores Who Lie: Sexual Harassment in the '90s" and "A Whole Lot 
of Nothing: Women's Collective Consciousness." When the women turn on him (I 
believe it was after he said, "Women, basically, have nothing to talk about"), 
Dr. Robinson, who is black, fights back Clarence Thomas-style with, "This is 
nothing but another high-tech lynching!" 
</P>
<P>
 Whitey makes a high art of insincerity and constantly congratulates himself by 
murmuring his trademark tag line, "Tough talk," after he shoots off a 
particularly embarrassing question. If he brings on three bare-chested male 
dancers during a show called "What Women Really Want," he'll inevitably turn to 
the one African American dancer and ask, "You're black. How has this O.J. thing 
affected your dancing? (Tough talk!)" The dancer returns a blank stare; another 
offers thoughtfully, "I think it's improved it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the hands of Dan Rosen, Whitey is an extremely useful creation, a tool for 
exploring TV personalities from Jerry Falwell to Rush Limbaugh to Geraldo, 
whose pious sentiments mask their own bloated egos. 
</P>
<P>
 Shameless about exploiting his or anyone else's tragedy, Whitey has a 
daughter, whose name mysteriously changes from Courtney to Chelsea during the 
course of one program, who is in a coma. He constantly brings up that coma, 
unctuously thanks viewers for their cards and letters and then asks for a round 
of applause for "the power of prayer, ladies and gentlemen."  
</P>
<P>
 Here's how the show works: On Sunday, Rosen, Emmett and Hutcherson choose the 
next week's topic and cast actors from a pool of about 40. Actors are given 
bios of the characters they are to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone has other TV and movie gigs so there is no time for rehearsal, 
keeping the show spontaneous and fun. Actors and roles vary from week to week, 
so that reappearing characters might be played by different actors. A few jokes 
or book titles may be thought out in advance, but essentially no one knows 
exactly what will go down once the show begins. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best thing about "The Dysfunctional Show" is that the audience 
implicitly understands its role, inventing its own perfectly ridiculous 
questions (some planted, some not) and applauding the most inane points. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as if we all naturally understand our part in the circus that is what 
Greg Kinnear calls "talk soup." "The Dysfunctional Show" allows us to play that 
role, expunge it and laugh the entire time.*

THEATER NOTES; ODYSSEY TO CITY -- HOLD THE HOT WAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Don Shirley, Don Shirley is a Times staff writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Odyssey Theatre Ensemble wants to expand its operations into a larger 
theater at its site on Sepulveda Boulevard. But can that plan coexist with the 
carwash next door? 
</P>
<P>
 When the Odyssey moved to the site in 1989, creating three new 99-seat venues 
in the process, it was clearly labeled an interim move, necessitated by the end 
of the lease at the theater's former site a few miles west. The city of Los 
Angeles arranged for the Odyssey to remain in West L.A. -- as opposed to moving 
to Santa Monica or another Westside spot -- by temporarily renting the 
city-owned site on Sepulveda to the theater company for $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, the Odyssey board and artistic director Ron Sossi have 
decided that they want to stay on Sepulveda -- and use the site to build a new 
facility that would include one 500-seat theater as well as two 99-seaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sossi said his team has informally developed two different plans for the site. 
But he fears that a proposal by a neighboring carwash to lease part of the 
Odyssey's rear parking lot for its detailing facility would stymie any such 
plan. The transaction would eliminate 48 parking spaces from the lot, which 
would reduce the theater's total parking capacity from 109 to 61 -- just above 
the amount Sossi says is required by city codes before any expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 The carwash would lease the area for $4,500 a month -- which would bring 
considerably more money into the city coffers than the $1 a year that the 
Odyssey pays for its entire site. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sossi has enlisted his subscribers and other theatergoers in a petition 
campaign to try to stop the lease of the parcel to the carwash. 
</P>
<P>
 No decision has been made; the city has issued a request for proposals to see 
if there are any other parties interested in the site. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who represents the area, has not taken a 
position on the lease proposal. "I love the Odyssey," said Galanter, "but if 
we're going to give them money, we need to give it upfront, with numbers on it, 
so people know about it. This is a terrible dilemma we face all the time, where 
we have wonderful organizations whom we are able to give things to in times of 
prosperity and frequently with a time limit on it. Then the prosperity 
disappears, and we have an enormous number of competing demands for the same 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter spokesman Jeff Prang said that "ample street parking is available" in 
the largely industrial area during the evening hours when the theater is in 
operation. If the theater were to expand, he said, the Odyssey probably could 
obtain a variance that would enable it to make an exception to city codes for 
on-site parking. Furthermore, Prang noted, the Odyssey formerly rented part of 
the controversial parcel to another business for storage, not for parking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baloney," Sossi responded to Prang's claim that ample street parking exists. 
"We have people all the time who are irate because they have to walk too far." 
They'll have to walk farther if the parking in back is reduced, he said. He 
added that the one part of the back lot that had been rented to another company 
was "a concrete lump" that was unsuitable for parking. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't the first time that parking has been the focus of attention at this 
site. Before the Odyssey moved in, the city used the site as a garage for those 
little vehicles that are used by the people who issue parking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 HERMAN/MERMAN SONG: When Civic Light Opera of South Bay Cities opens "Hello, 
Dolly!" Friday, it will include a song that hasn't been heard in the score 
since Ethel Merman sang the role on Broadway in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 When composer Jerry Herman heard that his friend Karen Morrow would play the 
title role in Redondo Beach, he fished the ballad "Love Look in My Window" out 
of his trunk and offered it to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Herman originally wrote the song -- and show -- with Merman in mind, 
she initially turned down the role. Carol Channing got the job instead, and her 
"larger-than-life, unreal quality" was well suited to the show, Herman said (in 
fact, Channing's still touring with it). However, she lacked Merman's pipes, 
and "Love Look in My Window" was a casualty of her casting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it had been cast first with a real singer, it would have stayed in," 
Herman said. When Merman finally took the role six years later, Herman restored 
the song for her. But she was the last Dolly of the original production, and 
subsequent productions followed the Channing model. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow is in the Merman tradition more than the Channing tradition, and 
"she'll sing the hell out of it," Herman predicted. However, she won't be doing 
a second song that was restored for Merman's benefit, because Herman thinks 
it's too similar to the existing "Before the Parade Passes By." 
</P>
<P>
 REP REBOUND: When the Los Angeles Theatre Center company folded in 1991, some 
feared that San Diego Repertory Theatre might be next on the list of 
city-center theaters to bite the dust. But San Diego Rep has rebounded. The 
last two seasons have resulted in operating surpluses, and subscriptions were 
up 34% last season -- the first increase since the theater moved to the Lyceum 
in Horton Plaza in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the company has announced an ambitious 1994-95 season. First up will be 
Pearl Cleage's "Flyin' West," about four black women who claim their own land 
in Kansas in 1898, Sept. 21-Oct. 8. It will be followed by a revival of Claire 
Luckham's "Trafford Tanzi" (Oct. 21-Nov. 19), the annual "A Christmas Carol" 
(Nov. 26-Dec. 24, actually set in Victorian England, for the first time in six 
years -- what a concept), "Hamlet" (Jan. 28-Feb. 18), the Southern California 
premiere of Octavio Solis' "El Paso Blue" (Feb. 24-March 25) and a final 
to-be-announced show (Jane Martin's controversial "Keely and Du" is a 
possibility).*

THE CLUB GETS BIGGER; ESCONDIDO'S ARTS CENTER JOINS A NUMBER OF NEW SUBURBAN 
PERFORMANCE VENUES. IS IT A CULTURAL VISION OR JUST A GOOD INTENTION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Here the new buildings have that certain comforting California feel to them 
with their signature curls and curves, great sweeps and serene surfaces, one 
rising to a landmark 100 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the latest of the brave, new cultural centers that, like weeds and 
wildflowers, pop up in the most unexpected of places. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the California Center for the Arts, Escondido, designed by late 
architect Charles Moore of Santa Monica's Moore Ruble Yudell. The center has 
been 10 years in the planning and building and, when it opens Oct. 1, there 
will be $74-million worth of buildings and programs, 12 gardens and an 
ambitious side-by-side enterprise involving performing and visual arts. 
</P>
<P>
 New arts centers are opening this year in Escondido and Thousand Oaks. Last 
year Cerritos opened its $60-million Cerritos Center for the Arts. Two years 
ago, an 815-seat Performing Arts facility opened in Poway. Cal State Long Beach 
has two new performing arts theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Something clearly is stirring in the "hidden" towns and valleys of America. 
</P>
<P>
 What Escondido ( Hidden in Spanish) is doing, miles from anybody's downtown 
except its own, may prove to be a cultural vision for the future or just 
another good intention turned fiscal folly. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-acre site in mid-town, a four-minute drive from where the I-5 and 
Interstate 78 intersect, will house a stately 1,532-seat concert hall with no 
seat farther than 100 feet from the stage; a 400-seat theater; three art 
galleries with 9,000 square feet of exhibition space and another 8,000 square 
feet of studios for visiting artists and students, plus a 9,000-square-foot 
conference center. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will have a $3-million first-year performance budget and $1-million 
visual arts budget, part of a $6-million annual operating budget, at a time 
when many arts centers have turned to renting their halls rather than booking 
whole seasons for them as Escondido is doing. 
</P>
<P>
 In its ambitious inaugural eight-month season, the California Center has 
scheduled star names ranging from Cecilia Bartoli (Oct. 2) to Itzhak Perlman 
(March 5), from Anna Deavere Smith (Jan. 28) to the Kirov Orchestra (Oct. 8), 
Mel Torme (March 22) and touring musical companies, a total of 73 performers or 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Center for the Arts had its origins in the early '80s, when 
Escondido officials decided they needed to bring life into the downtown center. 
First they built a city hall, completed in 1988, next came the arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys of the million-plus people in north San Diego county found a strong 
interest in arts and entertainment, especially for events closer than the 
30-minute drive to San Diego, the hour drive to Costa Mesa or the two-hour ride 
to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What we had to do was 'un-hide' Escondido by building an arts center," says 
Steve Wolff, president of A.M.S. Planning and Research, a national arts 
management consulting firm, called to Escondido over the past 10 years to 
advise on the city's downtown redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 Oleg Lobanov, an arts administrator for 35 years, has spent the last three 
years in Escondido as president of the California Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (the center) will enhance the quality of life in this region. Overnight we 
will change the options of what 1,200,000 people can do culturally," he claims. 
"While we will have thousands of square feet devoted to what our business is, 
we have to start with quality of life because quality of life is directly 
linked to the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides offering performing arts events, the Center also plans to be a 
full-service, multipurpose campus. "There is no place in this country where 
four buildings will come on line at the same time for the performing arts and 
the visual arts, and be philosophically tied to a community the way we will 
be," Lobanov says, pointing to partnership programs being developed with nearby 
colleges (Cal State San Marcos, Palomar College) along with public and private 
schools in the region, master classes and artist-in-residence programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Center people also envision "curatorial programming," hoping to offer 
cross-disciplinary programs -- a series, for example, on Mexico, with Mexican 
sculpture and paintings in the galleries, a folklorica group in the concert 
hall, a Latino drama company in the theater, a "fiesta" in the conference hall. 
</P>
<P>
 From its start in the mid-'80s, the center has been planned as a 
public-private partnership. The city provided the land and helped finance the 
buildings through bond issues and development fees, saving the center from 
having to go through the traditional wooing of patrons for its construction and 
start-up costs. 
</P>
<P>
 A nonprofit private corporation operates the complex with a $6-million annual 
budget, backed by a $500,000 interest-bearing fund from the city. Income from 
box office and rentals is optimistically hoped to be about $4 million -- any 
deficit would have to be offset through interest on the reserve fund and 
through private donations and fund-raising efforts. Two years ago the center's 
development officials and volunteers raised $360,000, last year $600,000 and 
this year the goal is $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important, the center has what no other similar facility has, an 
attached conference center where $900,000 in bookings -- 50% of its first-year 
goal -- have already been made, Center officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 T he art museum began as Feli cita Foundation, a group of Escondido residents 
who put on community art exhibits in a 2,000-square-foot former city library. 
Now the California Center for the Arts Museum will occupy 9,000 square feet of 
galleries linked to the performing arts halls along with an additional four 
artist studios, photography lab and video facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibitions are scheduled into 1996, says Director Reesey Shaw, with 
"Wildlife" the inaugural exhibition, a show emphasizing the image of animals. 
Included are William Wegman's Polaroids and paintings by Donald Roller Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum buildings open to a sculpture court for temporary exhibits. A 
permanent on-site sculpture will be an installation by San Diego artist Mathieu 
Gregiore, a series of blue granite boulders, starting with rough textured rock 
near the adjacent parking facility and moving toward smoother, almost-finished 
boulders near the performing halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some doubters have scoffed at the center's demographic studies, questioning if 
there really is much citizen interest and support in the project. The use of 
tax moneys for art projects came under debate at several Council meetings. And 
one local resident claimed the city was losing its identity with the name 
change to the California, not Escondido, center for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction snags caused opening dates to be moved several times from late 
1993 to early 1994 and finally October of this year. Putting a spin on the 
delays, one center officer said it was better to delay until October since most 
performance seasons open in the fall.  
</P>
<P>
 Last month center officials asked for and got a 10-year, $1.5-million loan 
from the City Council when its budget came up short in buying such items as 
time clocks and kitchen equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the inaugural season was to be announced last spring, the center's 
first executive vice president, Neil Archer Roan, left -- causing a scramble to 
find a new "artistic director." Before leaving for a post with the Oregon Bach 
Festival, Roan said he had carved out a "killer season" -- but one with almost 
no theater offerings. "There's so much competition in San Diego with the Old 
Globe, the San Diego Repertory and the La Jolla Playhouse," Roan had reasoned. 
"We should explore, try to complement what they do, maybe bring in some 
children's theater." 
</P>
<P>
 But his replacement, Robert A. Freedman, who had been director of Portland's 
Center for the Performing Arts, has a different slant. "I'm leaning to use it 
(the 400-seat theater) more as a theatrical space," he says. "It's the right 
size for a smaller regional theater company or a linkup by us with the La Jolla 
Playhouse for a second season or with other theatrical companies. The San Diego 
Symphony committed itself to traveling north for four concerts in the new hall 
and Freedman hopes others will do the same.

 "It's all like a 'field of dreams,' " says Sarah Davies, West Coast booking 
agent for ICM Artists, Ltd., of the growth of new performing arts centers. 
Davies says that in many communities, "local business people feel they have to 
congratulate themselves by having culture in their towns. So they build 
buildings with the belief that they (audiences, businesses, investors) will 
come." More than buildings are needed, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 A truer gauge of a community's commitment would be how much money is budgeted 
for programming -- from its first year on, whether the facility will make its 
own programming commitments or just rent out space. "There are halls all over 
the West without buyers (resident programmers) any more or without any money to 
bring acts in. Independent promoters have to be found to do the booking," 
Davies says. 
</P>
<P>
 With all of its planning and building, its committees and support, could this 
new California Center for the Arts, Escondido, disappoint? 
</P>
<P>
 "If we offered unimaginative programming we might be driven into the red," 
answers Center President Lobanov, "or if we didn't think of our linkage with 
the community, or of the quality of what we present, or if we try to do too 
many things too soon. Then we might fall and hurt ourselves financially. Now is 
the time to move slowly, especially because of the size of this place. We've 
set our philosophy, our main diet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we must ask ourselves what will be here one year or two years and more 
from now."*

ART; EVERYBODY LOVES A CLOWN; KIM MACCONNEL TOSSES SUBTLETY OUT THE WINDOW AS 
HE TEARS DOWN THE HIERARCHY OF AESTHETICS TO OPEN THE DOORS OF ART TO THE WORLD 
AROUND US.

 "Too great an importance has been given to the retinal," Marcel Duchamp told 
interviewer Pierre Cabanne in 1971. "Since Courbet it's been believed that 
painting is addressed to the retina -- that was everyone's error. Before, 
painting had other functions: It could be religious, philosophical, moral, but 
our century is completely retinal. . . . It's absolutely ridiculous. It has to 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Change it did. In the decade following Duchamp's observation, his belief that 
art should provoke the brain rather than please the eye came to dominate art. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to the key movements of the '70s, Minimalism and Conceptualism, this 
reductive idea ultimately led art to the point where it was in danger of 
dematerializing altogether. When the pendulum swings too far in one direction, 
there's nothing left but for it to hurtle pell-mell the other way -- which 
brings us to Pattern and Decoration, a shamelessly optical school of 
Postmodernist painting that had a healthy run in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Modernism was an attempt to refine, define and streamline; Postmodernism is 
about stepping outside boundaries, allowing other voices in, and recognizing 
daily life," observes San Diego-based artist Kim MacConnel, a key figure in the 
Pattern and Decoration school, whose first L.A. exhibition in seven years, "Age 
of Plastic," opened Saturday at Thomas Solomon's Garage. (A related body of 
work also goes on view Friday at the Quint Gallery in San Diego.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Minimalism, the reigning Modernist style when I was coming of age as an 
artist, ruled life out -- there was no room for it in that work -- and I saw 
Pattern and Decoration, which uses Third World motifs and images from everyday 
life, as a means of breaking down the hermeticism of the New York school. 
Unfortunately, that strategy led to my being labeled kitsch and a cultural 
imperialist," he adds with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 MacConnel's work has been called kitsch, along with several other less than 
laudatory things, over the course of his career. Dismissed as "the worst kind 
of exploitation" by Arts Magazine critic Gretchen Faust, as "solely visual work 
that offers nothing to sustain the viewers' interest" by Elizabeth Hayt-Atkins 
in Art News, MacConnel's art has been largely read in terms of its relationship 
to the decorative arts, which have occupied a debased position in the 
avant-garde for decades. Picking up on the political subtext in MacConnel's 
art, however, critic Douglas Blau describes him as "a hawk masquerading as a 
parrot," which seems closer to the artist's intention; the visual cacophony 
MacConnel whips up in his work is tethered to a foundation of ideas rigorous 
enough to have warranted his being included in five Whitney Biennials between 
1975-85. 
</P>
<P>
 Assaulting the viewer with a riotous melange of color and shape, MacConnel 
tosses subtlety -- the central tenet of "good taste" -- out the window (he even 
went so far as to make a series of flocked paintings). At the heart of all his 
work is the notion of patterning -- simple forms repeated at measured 
intervals. Favoring harlequin patterns, oversize polka dots and bold stripes, 
MacConnel points out that "repetition essentially functions as a grid, which is 
the basis of everything from maps to the printed page." Layered onto these 
patterns are elements of folk art, Chinese script, funk, space age motifs a la 
"The Jetsons," tribal fetishes, Pop and, most importantly, the decorative arts 
(fabric, furniture and rug design, for instance). 
</P>
<P>
 MacConnel might be loathe to admit it, but his work is part of a visually lush 
tradition that's always thrived on the West Coast, and stretches from European 
masters such as Matisse, to L.A. artists like Sam Francis and Billy Al 
Bengston.

<P>
 Meeting with the 47-year-old artist on a Sunday morning in his studio at UC 
San Diego, where he has been chairman of the art department since last year, 
one encounters an easygoing man who speaks openly about his life while managing 
to remain decidedly private. He's not the sort to bare his soul to the press. 
Dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, unlaced purple sneakers and no socks, 
MacConnel is a surfer and he looks the part -- he's fit, energetic and tan. 
</P>
<P>
 His studio is orderly and clean, despite the fact that the center of the room 
is dominated by a colorful mound of trash, much of which will be recycled into 
the body of work currently occupying him; "Age of Plastic" is composed of 
approximately 100 small clowns fashioned out of debris scavenged on beaches 
here and abroad. Traveling is central to MacConnel's life, and has been since 
he was very young. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born in Oklahoma -- my father was a geology student at the University 
of Oklahoma -- and shortly after I was born my parents moved to Chicago because 
my father transferred to a school there," he recalls. "Not long after that my 
father wound up being a hospitalized alcoholic, my parents divorced and my 
mother, my younger sister and I moved to Houston where my mother's brothers 
lived. My mother found life there boring though, so when I was 7 we moved to 
Mexico City and stayed there for six years." 
</P>
<P>
 During the years MacConnel's family lived in Houston, his mother worked as a 
decorator. "I'd deny it, but maybe her work as a decorator had an effect on 
me," says MacConnel, whose younger sister, Bridget MacConnel, is an artist who 
does tile work and cloisonne. "My mother took painting classes when we were in 
Mexico City and always loved art -- I grew up in an environment where education 
was considered important. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those years in Mexico City left me with an insatiable wanderlust," he 
continues. "As a kid I spent a lot of time skipping school and wandering around 
Mexico City by myself. We lived there in the mid-'50s when they were building 
the subway, and they dredged up all kinds of stuff from lake bottoms and stored 
it on tables in the courtyard of a city building. The front door was always 
open there and I loved to go look at this stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "My experiences in Mexico City are reflected in the anti-Minimalist art I 
make," he adds. "Minimalism was a hermetic movement based on system and theory, 
and I've always been attracted to odd things outside the system. I remember 
being impressed by this scuzzy old guy in Mexico City who always wore two pairs 
of pants and left his fly down. He sold artifacts and things like fake Aztec 
maps in the thieves' market, and fakery has always been an interest of mine. 
Fakery, myth and cliche have a beguiling quality of non-reality and are a big 
part of art-making. Artists create myths and artifacts." 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 12 MacConnel left Mexico for a pre-prep school in Connecticut, 
then spent four years at the Tabor Academy, a prep school in Marion, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "From there I went on to Rutgers University where I spent two miserable years 
drinking and playing cards, prior to flunking out when I was 18," MacConnel 
says. "I was such a hopeless case at Rutgers that just before flunking out I 
bought some paint and covered the wall in my room with a big, awful, abstract 
painting. That was the first time it occurred to me to make any kind of visual 
art -- I wasn't one of those kids who drew. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I left school I joined the Merchant Seamen and wound up on a ship off 
the coast of Vietnam -- this was 1966, so it was pretty scary over there," he 
continues. "We were in Da Nang harbor when there was a mortar attack, and got 
shot at a lot going up the Saigon River. The war changed me, not because it was 
scary, but because it was so bogus. The supplies we carried were medical 
supplies and a huge amount of liquor. It left me very cynical." 
</P>
<P>
 MacConnel left the Merchant Seamen in 1968 and settled in San Diego, where his 
mother and sister were living (MacConnel's mother was born and raised there). 
Enrolling at Mesa Junior College with no particular goal in mind, he took an 
art class, "and was lucky enough to get a terrific teacher who liked what I 
did," he recalls. "I was just playing around making adolescent pen and ink 
drawings, but she encouraged me to apply at UCSD, which I got into in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very ignorant as I entered this arcane world," he recalls. "At the time 
I was making large polka-dot paintings a lot like the ones I'm making now, and 
nobody was making work like that then -- maybe somebody in New York was, but I 
hadn't been there at that point, and avoided reading about what was going on 
there. Minimalism and Conceptualism were the dominant styles at UCSD, so I 
didn't feel part of things. 
</P>
<P>
 "That began to change for me when the New York critic Amy Goldin came here to 
teach from 1968 through 1970 -- she was a huge influence on my work. Amy was a 
rigorous intellectual, which I was not by any stretch of the imagination, and 
she provoked an interest in that world for me. She led me to begin asking 
myself such questions as: Why is an Oriental carpet not art? Why is it 
decorative art? What is a decorative art? Why are Renoir the younger's pots not 
art, yet his father's paintings are art? Who created this hierarchy of 
aesthetics? I came to the conclusion that a lot of it is simply pedigree." 
</P>
<P>
 Graduating in 1971, MacConnel spent a year in Europe with his first wife, Nina 
MacConnel-Chino, whom he married in 1969 and divorced in 1980. On returning, he 
tackled the arduous task of landing a one-man show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mowed a lot of lawns for several years after I got out of school," he 
laughs. "Nobody on the West Coast would touch my work. (Orange Country dealer) 
Jack Glenn showed one piece in 1973, but it didn't sell and that was the only 
time he showed my work. That same year I went to New York and made appointments 
with every gallery in town, but everyone told me my colors were too bright. One 
person actually told me I'd never get a show in New York because my work wasn't 
somber enough." 
</P>
<P>
 That person was wrong, of course. MacConnel made his solo debut in New York 
two years later at the then-newly opened Holly Solomon Gallery, which played a 
key role in popularizing Pattern and Decoration. In 1976 MacConnel began 
teaching at UC San Diego, a job he hung onto until 1980, despite the fact that 
his work was selling at a consistently brisk pace by 1978. He left the 
university in 1980, and didn't return until 1987. "I've been here, more or 
less, for 25 years -- I'm totally a product of this place," MacConnel says. 
</P>
<P>
 The other constant in MacConnel's life is the beach. He lives with his wife of 
two years, artist Jean Lowe, in the small beach town of Encinitas, goes body 
surfing twice a day, and has been collecting trash on beaches since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't an ecological show although that will inevitably be read into it," 
he says of "Age of Plastic." "I've been making stuff out of beach trash since 
'75, mostly flower vases and things like that -- in fact, when I moved into 
this studio the first thing I brought in was my trash pile. I always have a 
Hefty bag with me when I go to the beach and I just toss things in the bag. 
I've collected trash all over the world -- India, Africa, Mexico -- and I mix 
it all together. I mostly pick up aged stuff that looks like it's been floating 
around a while, but I don't collect aesthetically -- I'm not looking for 
treasures or bright sea shells. At the same time, I don't pick up everything 
because if I did I'd have a room full of fast-food wrappers. The most common 
things on the beach are tampon applicators and lighters, and the best beach 
trash is in Africa -- you find plastic baskets, weird little dolls, and all 
kinds of things typical of that culture." 
</P>
<P>
 As to how he made the leap from trash to clowns, he explains, "in 1993 I saw a 
show at the Guggenheim called 'The Age of Iron' that included work by people 
like Picasso, Miro and Calder, and for some reason when I looked at the show I 
just thought, 'Bing! Clowns are where it's at!' There were no clowns in that 
show," adds MacConnel, who's amassed an army of about 400 of the figures at 
this point, "but it made me realize we're living in the age of plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of these pieces as the polka dot meets (Minimalist sculptor) Don Judd 
-- Judd is the sconce-shaped base, and the clown is the polka dot," he says of 
the work, which will also be exhibited at the Holly Solomon Gallery in New York 
in November. "The bases play off Minimalism, and the work is installed to 
create a repetitive pattern on the wall. The clowns cut those formalist 
qualities though because they're clearly handmade, and the clown occupies a 
debased position in art. My hope is that the work reads as funny, pathetic and 
disgusting. The little clown face is pitiful and humorous, but at the same 
time, it's disgusting because it's trash from our environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Surveying the wall of clowns in his studio, MacConnel says: "I'm pleased to 
look at 20 years of my work and see some consistency. My first show railed 
against a Minimalist aesthetic that still dominates the art world to a 
surprising degree -- many young artists are just recycling Bruce Nauman. 
Minimalism was about austerity and my work is rooted in exuberance. This 
wrestling match is always going on in art, and I'm absolutely clear about which 
side I'm on." Stats

'YOU REALIZE MUSIC ITSELF IS THE GOAL'; THE TITLE OF THE JESUS AND MARY CHAIN'S 
ALBUM -- 'STONED & DETHRONED' -- REFLECTS THE DIFFICULTIES THE ACCLAIMED BAND 
HAS HAD IN BREAKING THROUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 'Stoned & Dethroned" serves as more than the title for the Jesus and Mary 
Chain's sixth album. It can also be seen as a bittersweet summary of the band's 
own frustrating career misfortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the most consistently exciting and influential music of anyone from 
across the Atlantic since U2, the Mary Chain is still struggling to build an 
audience in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem: Brothers Jim and William Reid's stark musical sensibilities -- a 
combination of relentless guitar feedback and dark, obsessive themes a la the 
Velvet Underground -- have proved too radical for U.S. radio programmers. 
</P>
<P>
 American Recordings is optimistic about the new album, pointing out the new 
single ("Sometimes Always," a duet by Jim Reid and Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval) 
is being played extensively by college and alternative-rock stations. The 
collection is a step away from the group's trademark feedback but doesn't 
compromise its musical integrity. ( See review, Page 78. ) 
</P>
<P>
 With the album just having arrived in the stores, the Reid brothers spoke 
about their band's music, the early acclaim and adjusting to nearly a decade of 
career frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: It's hard to believe that you've been on the scene for 10 years now. 
Does it feel like that long -- or does it feel longer at times? 
</P>
<P>
 William: Sometimes it feels like 20 years 'cause everything is speeded up in 
the music business. In England especially, the music press has to find the Next 
Big Thing every issue -- the next Beatles, the next Sex Pistols, the next 
Nirvana. It's not like the art world or someplace where things seem to be 
judged in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 In pop music, everything is measured in months -- and that's a lot of months 
when you are talking about 10 years. Lots of things come and go. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was it like when you released your first album, "Psychocandy," and 
people started talking about you as the new Sex Pistols -- the beginning of a 
new era in the legacy of British rock? 
</P>
<P>
 Jim: I actually thought that at the time (smiles). We felt the music was 
great, the reviews said it was great, so why couldn't we take it to the next 
level? We used to talk about the idea of taking this kind of music and play 
football stadiums. What we thought might happen to us did kind of happen with 
Nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does it do to your spirit when you don't live up to the original 
promise -- at least commercially? 
</P>
<P>
 Jim: The idea of what you call an achievement or goal changes. After the 
second year we realized that the idea of playing, say, Shea Stadium was 
hopelessly naive. There was a time after that where you really didn't know what 
you are trying to do, what the goal is. By this stage of the game, however, you 
realize that the music itself is the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When did that realization hit? 
</P>
<P>
 Jim: It is kind of a recent thing. At the end of the '80s, I think we were 
kind of confused and a bit lost. I don't think we made bad records because of 
that, but I think we got kind of slightly defeated by the whole industry and 
the fact that we didn't reach the goals we set for ourselves. Now, it's like, 
"(Expletive) it." 
</P>
<P>
 William: I take inspiration from the fact that I've got two sets of favorite 
bands. There is the Stones and the Beatles and Dylan on one side, and then 
there is the Velvets, the Burrito Brothers and Subway Sect -- bands that never 
sold a lot but were also great. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like 1967 and everyone was saying what a great record "Sgt. Pepper's" 
was, what a milestone in pop history. But over in New York at the same time, 
the Velvet Underground were making another milestone in pop history, but nobody 
even noticed it for years.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: There was lots of talk in 1992 about how Lollapalooza would help you break 
through to American audiences, but it didn't happen. You came on in the middle 
of the afternoon and that was especially hard for you -- just as it has been 
this year for Nick Cave. How disheartening was that whole experience? 
</P>
<P>
 Jim: After about two days, we wanted to leave, but we had a contract. We don't 
really sell ourselves on stage. We play songs, and you take it or leave it. 
</P>
<P>
 William: Don't get us wrong. I don't think it's bad to be a showman. I like to 
go to a show and get entertained, but that's not us. Because we aren't showmen, 
we normally rely on a lot of devices . . . including darkness and smoke and 
lights (to build an atmosphere), and we were (without them) in the daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What has been the critical reaction in England to the new album -- to the 
softer style? 
</P>
<P>
 William: It hasn't been good, for the most part, and I kind of expected it. 
Reviewers apply the word mellow to it like they are spitting dirt on you. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your feeling?  
</P>
<P>
 William: You think, (expletive). What about Neil Young and Bob Dylan and the 
Beatles and the Velvet Underground and Hendrix? Those people were all good at 
ripping your face off, but they were also good at making good, softer music. 
</P>
<P>
 In the studio, you try to close out what the critics are going to say or even 
what the fans want . . . and focus on the music inside you. If you try to 
figure out what others want, you are really lost. If we listened to our mother 
and father, we'd be making Dean Martin records. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think about the American music scene post-Nirvana? 
</P>
<P>
 Jim: After Nirvana made good, you had all these imitation bands, which is what 
has been going on in Britain for years. 
</P>
<P>
 William: I saw the Stone Temple Pilots, and I don't believe them. It doesn't 
ring true to me. To me, that guy (Scott Weiland) seems like a "Saturday Night 
Live" version of Kurt Cobain. He's going through all the moves, but it's all 
exaggerated and stupid. The guy who sings "Achy Breaky Heart" probably has more 
problems than the guy in Stone Temple Pilots.*

PRIVATE LIVES; TO CD OR NOT CD-ROM?; THAT IS THE QUESTION, AS THE BARD GOES 
MULTIMEDIA IN SOFTWARE THAT RANGES FROM RUDIMENTARY TEXT-ONLY DISCS TO PACKAGES 
THAT LET YOU BECOME A MEMBER OF THE ROYAL SHAKESPEARE COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

and writes the Cyburbia column in Life & Style.

<TEXT>
<P>
 For countless students, back-to-school time means an introduction to 
Shakespeare. This is not welcome news to those who think of his 400-year-old 
plays only as examples of slow pacing and bad dialogue. Even those who may 
recognize the Bard's value may have trouble accessing his works. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not be their fault: Shakespeare productions are often presented as 
deadly museum pieces that are about as lively as study hall. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if Shakespeare went multimedia, with fine actors speaking the parts 
as viewers follow the text on the screen? What if the click of a mouse could 
conjure up a film clip of a scene, get explanations for unfamiliar terms or 
call up expert commentaries to explain a passage's meaning and relevance? 
</P>
<P>
 What if a multimedia Shakespeare production even allowed students to take on 
one of the roles in the company of professional Shakespearean actors? 
</P>
<P>
 Voyager's "Macbeth," which aspires to do all these things, has been one of the 
most eagerly awaited educational CD-ROMs since it was announced last year. 
After several delays, it finally made it into software stores and the 
warehouses of mail-order houses this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it is in many ways disappointing, especially considering all 
the sound and fury of the hype that preceded its release. But this CD-ROM, and 
a handful of other Shakespeare-themed software products on the market, can help 
students unearth the riches, vibrancy and timelessness of the Bard's works. 
</P>
<P>
 The Voyager "Macbeth" includes a full-length audio performance by no less than 
the Royal Shakespeare Company, with Ian McKellen and Judi Dench in the lead 
roles and direction by Trevor Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the project was announced, Voyager officials said it would include 
the video too, much in the way its CD-ROM of the Beatles' "A Hard Day's Night" 
lets viewers watch the movie in one corner of the screen while following along 
with the script. 
</P>
<P>
 When the "Macbeth" CD-ROM was released, however, a Voyager spokesman said that 
the video was abandoned because of technical limitations. And it's true that 
live-action video, now limited to postage-size windows on the screen, is not of 
sterling quality. But even a somewhat blurry view of actors performing the 
lines would have added much to the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is nice to hear these actors speak the lines, and it is possible to 
listen to an entire performance of the play while following along (the pages of 
the text turn automatically). 
</P>
<P>
 Using any other feature of the disc, such as clicking on a word to see its 
annotation, causes the performance to be interrupted. Better to first go 
through the play piece by piece, digging into the richly rewarding annotations, 
essays and commentaries, and then play the performance for the added insights 
the reading can offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the real interactive ability -- Voyager calls it "Macbeth 
Karaoke." The user can play Macbeth or Lady Macbeth, reciting lines with an 
experienced actor. It's fun but limited, as it can be used on only two scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some film clips are included in the Voyager "Macbeth," and their use on the 
CD-ROM is the most exciting and evocative feature of the program. There are 
short clips from film adaptations of "Macbeth" by Orson Welles, Akira Kurosawa 
and Roman Polanski. In each case we get to see how the directors interpreted 
the witches' scene near the beginning of the play. Sure, the clips are blurry, 
but it's fascinating to see how very different their approaches were. 
</P>
<P>
 This "Macbeth," currently available only for the Macintosh platform, lists for 
$49.95. Despite its unimaginative use of the medium, the CD-ROM from Voyager 
(800-446-2001) does provide a good deal of background to the computer-equipped 
student who wishes to brush up on Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Shakespeare-themed programs are less ambitious: 
</P>
<P>
 BookWorm Electronic Books (800-845-1755) has "Macbeth," "Hamlet," "A Midsummer 
Night's Dream" and "Romeo and Juliet" on CD-ROMs for Windows and Macintosh. 
With no film clips and only a few bits of audio included, the main feature of 
these programs is their annotations. For example, click on Macbeth's first 
line, "So foul and fair a day I have not seen," and up pops the information: 
</P>
<P>
 "By having Macbeth echo the Weird Sisters -- before he has even seen them -- 
Shakespeare gives us a subtle indication that Macbeth is already connected to 
the strange fate and supernatural powers represented by the Sisters. The 
surface meaning of his comment, of course, is merely, 'The day is foul because 
of the weather but fair because of our great victory.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The BookWorm titles are easy to use but expensive for what they offer. The 
four Shakespeare plays together on one disc list for $79.95. Separately, they 
are each $49.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakespeare on Disk (800-446-2089) has 60 software products that are sold 
mostly to schools. In its catalogue are three "Macbeth" titles: "Shakespeare's 
Macbeth," "Macbeth Study Questions" and a third product that combines those 
two. Again, the products are pricey, with individual copies of the third going 
for $99 in either DOS or Macintosh versions. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheapest way to go, electronically for a commercial product, is a $19.95 
CD-ROM sold by the mail-order company Computer Direct (800-289-9473). It has 
almost no features but reportedly includes the complete text of Shakespeare's 
plays, all on one DOS-platform disc. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, for no fee if you have access to the Internet, you can download not 
only the text of just about any Shakespeare play but also several scholarly 
essays (mostly from the electronic files of various universities) about the 
playwright's works.

A HIGH-STAKES PROPOSITION FOR DOWNTOWN; GAMBLING: MIXED REACTION GREETS 
BUSINESS GROUP'S PITCH FOR A LARGE-SCALE HOTEL AND ENTERTAINMENT DEVELOPMENT 
NEAR THE CONVENTION CENTER -- CONTINGENT UPON APPROVAL OF A CARD CASINO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A business group's plan to bring gambling into Downtown has drawn mixed 
reviews from the community -- some calling it a big moneymaker for the city, 
others fearing increased blight and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But most residents and business and political leaders, including Mayor Richard 
Riordan's staff, are open to holding forums to discuss the idea of a 
hotel-casino project across from the city-owned Convention Center on Figueroa 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any sort of project that comes to the city that has an economic benefit will 
be looked at seriously," said Tanya Mishell, mayoral spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Because no written proposals or drawings have been submitted to the city for 
review, Mishell said, Riordan has yet to take a position on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 A hotel-casino, project coordinator Carlos Siderman said, would be the first 
of three phases for a "mega-center of entertainment" that would help give a 
boost to the nation's eighth-largest convention center. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently approved a Downtown Strategic Plan that embraces an 
entertainment-hotel project near the Convention Center, excluding the casino 
element. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's general agreement that the Convention Center would work much better 
if there was a hotel that was located in close proximity," said Don Spivack, 
director of operations for the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are interested in talking to anybody that seems to have a serious proposal 
that might get us that hotel," Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 That includes Siderman, whose Downtown firm, City Midland Development, has 
been hired by a group that calls itself the Convention Center Entertainment 
Complex. Siderman declined to give details about the organization's financial 
resources or its investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Siderman said the first phase of the plan features a 2,000-room hotel with a 
casino -- similar to the card clubs in Bell Gardens and Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Siderman said that the casino is needed to help make the hotel profitable and 
that nothing would be built without it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot open half of a Disneyland," he said. "You have to open when 
everything is ready, and gaming is a very important component of the project." 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel-casino would be built on about 345,000 square feet of property 
bounded by Figueroa and Flower streets and Pico and Venice boulevards, he said. 
Some lots in that area are already owned by a partner in the project, Carlos 
Vignali, but the rest have yet to be purchased. Vignali could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The second and third phases would stretch the eastern boundaries to Hope 
Street and would consist of a water theme park, a 500-unit housing complex for 
employees, a row of 14 restaurants, boutiques and a 20,000-seat sports arena 
that could also be used as an ice hockey rink. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the first phase can be built, the city's voters would have to 
overturn an ordinance that forbids gambling, with the exception of bingo games, 
in Los Angeles, officials said. State law requires that any gambling-related 
issue be put to a vote of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Siderman said the Entertainment Complex group will present details later this 
month on how it will mount a campaign to put a gambling measure before Los 
Angeles voters.  
</P>
<P>
 Siderman, along with state and local officials, said a gambling measure could 
be written in such a way as to allow a casino only at a specified location, 
rather than throughout the city. In this case, it would be across from the 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a wide range of responses from the community, it appears the prospect 
of a casino in Los Angeles could be a tough sell to the city's more than 1 
million registered voters.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have really mixed feelings about it," said Charles Woo, president of the 
Central City East Assn. and owner of a Downtown toy business. "Personally, it's 
against everything I believe. . . . You can make the argument, since (card 
clubs) are already here, we should take advantage of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Echo Park resident Susan Borden considers the hotel-casino proposal "a lousy 
idea" that could contribute to crime around Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a stable source of income," said Borden, who serves as secretary for 
the Echo Park Improvement Assn. "To base an economy on gambling is really like 
giving up on having a productive kind of manufacturing center." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Harris, co-chairman of a committee that produced the Downtown Strategic 
Plan, agrees but said he can see the golden opportunities for Downtown if 
gambling became legal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a good plan in place," said Harris, a USC architecture professor 
who lives Downtown. "It doesn't include a gambling option, and yet if gambling 
were to come along, we'd figure out how to take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Auth, president of Kaiser Bros. Oldsmobile-Honda, could be one of the 
Figueroa Street property owners affected if the casino-hotel project becomes a 
reality. The car dealership has remained at 1540 S. Figueroa St. since 1932. 
</P>
<P>
 Auth said a game room could help revitalize the Convention Center area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if it was done right, I'd probably vote for (gambling)," he said, 
adding that no one has offered him a price for his lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Skid Row service providers are divided on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gambling, by its nature, attracts people to play who are not able to afford 
it, and it hurts them greatly," said Andy Raubeson, executive director of Skid 
Row Housing Corp. They could end up broke and out on the streets, adding to the 
blight that already exists on Skid Row.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Martha Brown Hicks, who runs Skid Row Development Corp., said a game room 
in Downtown is a gamble the city should take. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens to be against my religion. However, I think the city is in dire 
straits," Hicks said. "If it can bring money into the city, I think it ought to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Downtown groups are taking a wait-and-see stance and have scheduled or 
are planning community meetings to discuss legalized gambling in the city. They 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A Sept. 22 panel discussion on the economic impact of gambling. Sponsored by 
the Central City Assn., a group of 250 Downtown business leaders, the noontime 
event will be held at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, said President Don 
McIntyre. The association has not taken a stand on the Convention Center 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 * A community meeting sometime in the next two months for residents and 
businesses in South Park, where the Convention Center is located. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole idea with a casino, a hotel and an entertainment complex is new," 
said Mike Pfeiffer, executive director of the South Park Stakeholders Group of 
30 commercial and residential property owners. "I haven't heard any immediate 
negative concerns about it. I think people are positive about exploring what it 
all means." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the project becomes a reality might also depend on the City Council. 
Siderman and his Entertainment Complex group could ask a council member to 
initiate putting a gambling measure on the ballot, or they could seek a voter 
initiative -- which requires 87,413 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rita Walters, whose district includes the Convention Center, has 
expressed opposition to the project; councilmen Mike Hernandez and Richard 
Alatorre, who also represent Downtown, are open to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre said he would support a gambling ballot measure.  
</P>
<P>
 "I support the concept," he said. "(Gambling) is a fact of life. . . . People 
that want to gamble are going to gamble, so why not benefit from it."

OFFERING A HAND -- AND A FRIENDLY EAR -- TO JOB SEEKERS OVER 50; EMPLOYMENT: 
AGE NEEDN'T BE A BARRIER TO RE-ENTERING THE WORK FORCE, SAY COUNSELORS WHO GIVE 
RESUME AND INTERVIEWING TIPS AT SECOND CAREERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In December, 1991, Marsha Reynolds left Ohio to live in Los Angeles with her 
adult daughter's family, armed with a bachelor's degree in social science and 
more than 20 years' experience in social work. Not yet 50, she figured that 
with her powerhouse resume, she would have an easy time beginning anew in 
Southern California, where she planned to spend her later years watching her 
granddaughter grow up. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost three years later, Reynolds, now 51, is still looking for work. On a 
recent Friday morning, she joined several other mature job seekers in an 
interviewing skills workshop at Second Careers, a Wilshire-based nonprofit 
placement agency whose workshops offer a unique blend of learning and emotional 
support for unemployed people 50 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't think I'd have any problem finding work, with my experience 
and education," said Reynolds as she addressed a group of nine women and one 
man gathered around her in a conference room high above mid-Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
 As she spoke, a few graying heads nodded in assent. Each person had a story to 
tell: the former vice president of a pension administration firm who was laid 
off just before the Jan. 17 earthquake caused costly damage to her Mid-City 
home; a 23-year veteran of a major oil company who had lost her data-entry job 
in a corporate cutback; a widowed former nurse with two children in college 
unable to find work in a new field after an accident prevented her return to 
nursing.  
</P>
<P>
 From her chair near the window, Sheila Hazlett, the workshop leader, listened 
sympathetically to each story, letting the job seekers air their frustrations 
before offering advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to sell yourself short," she told the group when the talk 
turned toward the desperation that drives some older workers to apply for 
entry-level jobs for which they are overqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do not refer to yourself as entry-level," she continued. "You deserve better 
than that. Don't blame everything on age. Older people do get jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazlett, 55, can speak from experience. A former publisher with a master's 
degree in journalism who lost her business in 1992 after a divorce, she was 
unable to re-enter the publishing field after a year and a half of searching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found myself having to start over," said Hazlett, who has two adult 
children. "You don't expect to find yourself in this situation at this stage in 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking help, Hazlett came to Second Careers, a program of the Volunteer 
Center of Los Angeles that has been assisting older workers in finding jobs 
since 1976. When she noticed the agency had an opening for a placement 
counselor, she decided to play up her communication skills and apply. She was 
granted an interview, in which she discussed the possibility of developing 
workshops to retrain older job seekers in interviewing and resume writing 
skills.  
</P>
<P>
 Hazlett was hired, and her workshops began in June. Offered every other Friday 
from 9 to 11:30 a.m., each session costs $5, including materials. Although the 
workshops target an over-50 audience, displaced workers in their 40s are also 
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Second Careers has occasionally featured workshops by outside consultants, but 
Hazlett's in-house program is the organization's first, said director Todd 
Lipka. The new workshops have been developed to complement the agency's newly 
opened job resource center, which offers a computer database for job seekers, 
as well as computer training classes, telephones and fax machines for their 
use.  
</P>
<P>
 Though the program is new, Hazlett said she has received grateful feedback 
from participants who used what they learned in the classes to get back in the 
work force, either through the efforts of the placement service or on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 The job resource center was developed through a grant received last spring 
from Care America 65-Plus, a health maintenance organization catering to older 
patients.  
</P>
<P>
 Under Hazlett's direction, the workshops have a warm, sensitive feel -- a 
cross between a job-hunting seminar and a group therapy session. She said she 
feels it is necessary to address the frustration and disappointment felt by 
many mature workers who were not planning to retire early, yet found themselves 
squeezed out of their jobs by a poor economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge shock to find out the company you had faith in puts you out the 
door," Hazlett said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of unemployed 
people 50 to 54 jumped 50% between July, 1984, and July, 1994, from 2.8% to 
4.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Lipka said many of the job seekers who come to Second Careers have not looked 
for work in several years, sometimes even decades. They are unaware of how to 
sell themselves to employers in the competitive job market of the 1990s, and 
must learn some job-hunting skills, such as resume writing, from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come from an era where you would put your height, weight and marital 
status on your resume," he said. "It's not like that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazlett advised her workshop attendees to put together functional resumes, 
highlighting skills while downplaying chronological experience, a sure giveaway 
of age. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never, never put down the year you graduated," she stressed. "If they see the 
age first, they may not go any further." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazlett reminded the group that anyone over 40 is protected by 
age-discrimination laws and that it is illegal for an interviewer to ask an 
applicant's age. She also warned them not to bring up the issue of age 
themselves, which she said many mature job applicants do because they are 
self-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 Older job seekers need to be realistic about employment goals, Hazlett said, 
and should be forewarned that they may not land the same type of job at the 
same salary level they once had. But this does not mean they are unemployable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a myth that there is age discrimination out there," she said. "But 
it is possible to make a midlife career change."

SCREENWRITING CONTEST FOR MINORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Writers Workshop, a nonprofit organization for hopeful 
screenwriters, is holding its fifth annual screenwriting contest for 
minorities. 
</P>

 American Film Institute graduate Willard Rogers founded the contest in 1990 as 
part of the workshop's Ethnic Minority Screenwriters Development and 
Promotional Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, 53, head of the organization, established the $500 scholarship to 
discover talent in ethnic communities, which account for only 2.5% of writers 
employed by the motion picture industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Five winners will be chosen. According to Rogers, at least half of the 
previous scholarship winners have been hired by major motion picture studios. 
</P>
<P>
 The entry deadline is Dec. 16.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; ONLY THE BEST FOR 49TH STREET SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dancing in sync to the tune of Michael Jackson's "Jam," 68th Street 
Elementary's after-school drill team put on a nearly flawless performance for 
city officials, educators, parents and children at 49th Street Elementary 
School on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by instructors of the city's Better Educated Students for Tomorrow 
program (LA's BEST), the drill team's performance was deemed an example of what 
the free after-school enrichment program can do for kids.  
</P>
<P>
 "All that they're putting in discipline and daily routines will translate 
(into) how they work at school," said Carla Sanger, executive director of LA's 
BEST. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, LA's BEST activities will be offered for the first time at 49th 
Street Elementary, the 21st school to benefit from the 6-year-old city program. 
The program's 200-student capacity at 49th Street Elementary was expected to be 
reached by Friday, according to an LA's BEST representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Operated by the Los Angeles Unified School District, the program provides 
assistance with homework, computer skills development, academic, recreational 
and seasonal sports competition, visual and performing arts and field trips. 
Activities are offered from the end of the school day until 6 p.m., Monday 
through Friday, 245 days a year.  
</P>
<P>
 Funds for the opening of 49th Street's LA's BEST program came from proceeds 
from the gala opening of the Los Angeles Convention Center, at which 
Councilwoman Rita Walters named the after-school program as the sole 
beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the opening ceremony Wednesday in the school's auditorium, Mayor 
Richard Riordan spoke of the importance of crime prevention programs in urban 
schools. He cited the death of LA's BEST participant Crystal Kimberly Bracey, a 
second-grader who died in an accidental shooting at a friend's home in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "When our children become innocent victims, some people say, 'What's the use? 
Prevention programs don't work,' " Riordan said. "I say to them, 'If we are 
able to save at least one life, prevention programs do work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Also last week, Lois Salisbury, executive director of Children Now, released 
findings of a UCLA evaluation of LA's BEST. The study found that 77% of the 
children liked school more since joining LA's BEST, and a majority of parents 
surveyed said their children's participation in the program lessened worries 
about exposure to crime and drugs. Most parents reported academic improvements 
among their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The LA's BEST children have a significant gain in their (grade-point 
average)," said Pauline Brooks, project director of UCLA's study. "In our 
preliminary findings, the GPA of children that are not in the program actually 
began to drop." 
</P>
<P>
 Launched as a pilot program in 1988 at 10 schools serving 2,000 children, the 
after-school program now serves 4,200 children. Site schools are selected based 
on low test scores, lower socioeconomic status of the community and high gang 
and crime rates within the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Laverne Govan and Carlas Barlow, site coordinators at 68th Street Elementary, 
said considerable change is evident in children who participate in the program. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first started the program, the children came in and their behavior 
was out of control," said Govan, a first-grade teacher. "Since they've been in 
LA's BEST, they are calmer. They have higher self-esteem and they enjoy being 
there." ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; 3 YOUTHS CHARGED WITH KILLING DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three South-Central teen-agers were charged with felony counts of animal 
cruelty and arson Tuesday for allegedly setting a dog on fire, then beating it 
to death with metal poles. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys, two 16-year-olds and one 15-year-old who were not identified because 
of their ages, were arrested Aug. 31 in the Hyde Park area, said Los Angeles 
Police Sgt. Candace Shimizu of the 77th Street Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers were sent to the 1700 block of West 65th Street about 8:15 p.m. to 
investigate a report of animal cruelty. When they arrived, they saw the boys 
chasing the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time the police were called, the dog was on fire and being chased by 
the defendants down the street," said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the 
district attorney's office. "When the dog fell they also beat it and kicked 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rottweiler mix eventually fell over and died as the boys continued beating 
it, Shimizu said.  
</P>
<P>
 The youths were arraigned after spending the Labor Day weekend at Los Padrinos 
Juvenile Hall in Downey. The 16-year-olds will have fitness hearings in the 
Compton courthouse Sept. 20 to determine if they will be tried as adults, 
Gibbons said. The 15-year-old will face a pretrial hearing on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the 16-year-olds and the 15-year-old have other cases pending, 
according to the district attorney's office. The 16-year-old has been charged 
with two counts of robbery for attacks on two victims in separate incidents 
Aug. 6 and 15. The 15-year-old has a misdemeanor sexual battery case pending.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; SELF-LOVE MESSAGE HAS A RAP BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a prophet out of Watts, Jacinto Rhines' words musically spilled out his 
messages of respect and self-love in a Jefferson High classroom. Students, 
clapping to the rhythm of the rap beat, read along from a booklet the poetic 
instructor handed out. 
</P>
<P>
 It's so true and so real, every living heart should feel, joy and pride to be 
alive! Put that self-hate jive, aside . . . Do you like yourself?  
</P>
<P>
 Through his South Central-based Nature's Hotline, Rhines' goal is for all 
students to respond with an emphatic "yes!" to his rap-inflected poem, "Do You 
Like Yourself?" Rhines' nonprofit organization is built around a motivational 
program that emphasizes nutrition education, cultural awareness and 
self-esteem, themes Rhines has been promoting since 1978.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of his messages are presented through poetry and music. Whenever 
possible, Rhines takes along his band, Truth Messengers of Love Healing, which 
adds a jazzy flavor to his act. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are using an artistic approach to give a message that is hard to swallow," 
said Rhines, 54. "My basic thing is to help people feel good about living and 
about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Washington, D.C., Rhines moved to his South-Central home in 1967, 
where he now operates Nature's Hotline, which runs on donations from private 
corporations and fees Rhines charges at some schools and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by his wife, Alexis Watson, Rhines tours cities across the country 
speaking to people at all levels of education. He has lectured at 600 schools 
in seven states and speaks regularly at South-Central and other inner-city 
schools as an educational consultant and parent volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Rhines will take the hot line message to Los Angeles Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 In about an hour of educating through performance, Rhines, who is a veteran 
marathon runner, raps about good nutrition and avoiding controlled substances 
with the song-poem "How to Eat to Be a Super Athlete." In the work, he attacks 
sugar and junk food as attitude benders and emotion destructors. Rhines blends 
in a discussion of cultural awareness to promote cross-cultural student respect 
and appreciation. "I am an example of how well the program works, because I am 
a before-and-after situation," Rhines said. "I used to not respect myself, so I 
used nutrition on myself and cultural awareness on myself to build my own 
self-respect as a black man and human person in this world. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of thing that heals racial problems," Rhines said. "When you 
respect yourself, you can respect other cultures." 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson High junior Maria Bravo, 16, found this point particularly moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all the students listened to what he has to say, we can put something 
together and stop fighting because of color," said Bravo, who says racial 
brawling at the school is common. 
</P>
<P>
 Classmate Sergio Palos, 17, said the message should not be confined to 
classrooms alone. "This is necessary to have in all schools, say in an 
auditorium, to teach people like he taught us. He has a message for all of us."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; BOXING CLUB'S FUNDS MAY BE IN 
JEOPARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Huntington Park Youth Boxing Club's future may be in danger after an 
inspection last month found that a slim majority of participants were not city 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Wong, director of the city's Community Development Department, said that 
the federal Community Development Block Grant the city uses to fund the program 
stipulates that the majority of the club members must live in the city. 
According to Wong's report, 16 of the club's 31 members live outside the city, 
which represents an improvement over the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will decide this month whether to continue funding the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a good use of our funds if half the kids are non-Huntington Park 
residents," Wong said. "That means half the funding should come from outside 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
 In last year's round of city budget cuts, the club's budget was reduced from 
$70,000 to $35,000. The Boxing Club has two paid part-time employees and two 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boxing Club charges monthly fees of $10 for non-residents and $6 for each 
additional family member. City residents are not charged. The club's business 
manager, Josie Arrey, said she has collected $180 in fees since July.  
</P>
<P>
 The typical member spends 1 1/2 to 2 hours a day, five days a week, at the 
club, according to Wong's report. It is open six days a week, and seven days a 
week when preparing for a boxing show. 
</P>
<P>
 Club members are not allowed to swear, chew gum or spit on the gym floor. The 
club also prohibits weapons and all forms of gang clothing, including hats worn 
backward. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the city's concerns over the club's funding and enrollment, 
Arrey noted the boxing program's positive presence in members' lives: "The kids 
come here to forget their daily worries. By teaching boxing, we keep kids from 
joining gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 The club is also gaining a reputation as a prime training spot. Last year, it 
produced two national Golden Gloves champions -- Salvador Casillas, 18, in the 
flyweight division, and Jose Hernandez, 14, in the middleweight division. Both 
are Huntington Park residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrey, 43, who has directed the program for seven years, said it makes no 
difference whether the participants live in the city, because all of them 
attend Huntington Park High School and their families contribute to the city by 
doing business in the city's commercial district. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrey said the club is seeking alternative ways to augment its funding. A 
barbecue and boxing match in which spectators will pay for a meal and chance to 
see the club's best aspirants spar with each other is planned for later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved funding for the club June 20, when it allocated 
$5,000 per month for three months. Marin said the money came from a federally 
funded grant from Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Pro Tem Rosario Marin said the club's future depends on how it fares in 
its in-house search for boosters. "If they haven't done anything to look for 
other funding, we'll probably pull their funds," Marin said. 
</P>
<P>
 For 12-year-old Urbano Antillon, whose idol is Eastside boxing great Oscar De 
La Hoya, the threats to the club's future are baffling: "All I want to do is 
box and this is the only place to go." SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; FEE APPROVED TO EXTEND HOURS AT 
LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has paved the way for increased hours at local libraries by 
adopting a property assessment approved this summer by the County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's library will probably expand its hours from 28 per week to 50, and 
its days of operation from four to six, said Albert Tovar, the area manager for 
libraries in Southeast and East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Needless to say, this is a big victory for Huntington Park," Tovar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessment will range from $28.50 annually for a single-family household 
to several hundred dollars for most commercial properties. The Board of 
Supervisors voted 3 to 1 in July to set up a Community Facilities District to 
fund extended library service. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen cities in the county have voted to join the district, which is 
expected to raise $16 million a year for the county library system. Property 
owners in unincorporated areas will also pay the fee, which will appear on 
November property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Cudahy, Huntington Park was the only Southeast city to approve the 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to county estimates, the assessment is expected to net an additional 
$365,000 for the Huntington Park library. The library's yearly operating budget 
had dropped from $1.3 million in fiscal 1992-93 to $985,000 in fiscal 1993-94. 
An estimated 160,000 people use the library each year, according to figures 
compiled by the county library system. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: RADISSON SUIT ALLEGES RED LINE DAMAGE

 Owners of the Radisson Wilshire Plaza hotel have filed a lawsuit against the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority for $20 million in damages, claiming the 
hotel has lost business and suffered physical damage since Metro Red Line 
construction began around the property in August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Williams, asset manager for the 396-room hotel at 3515 Wilshire Blvd., 
said the owners tried to reach a settlement out of court for several months.The 
agency rejected the hotel's claims in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just been stonewalled at every turn by them," Williams said. "I've 
watched the level of frustration (at the hotel) build, and the MTA's attitude 
has added to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Heard, an MTA spokesman, said the hotel did not back up its claims.  
</P>
<P>
 "They claimed property damage and economic damage, and we needed proof of 
that," Heard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heard said the MTA sent an extensive explanation of the proof needed to the 
hotel owners earlier this year, but received no answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams recalls the situation differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted permission for their attorneys to go through our books," he said. 
"We had already sent them significant amounts of background material 
substantiating a loss of business, but they said they wanted access to all 
records since the hotel started, and we thought that was absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Continuous noise from construction around the property at Wilshire and 
Normandie has caused a large number of tour companies, corporations and 
individual patrons to steer clear of the hotel, Williams said. Street closures 
impeding access to the hotel have also affected business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the hotel owners have also noticed cracks and water seepage 
throughout the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other Wilshire-area businesses have already filed damage claims 
against the MTA, blaming subway construction for economic losses. LESLIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: MID-CITY; STRIKING A BLOW AGAINST SICKLE CELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, leaders of the 1,600-member Los Angeles chapter of the 
National Bowling Assn. decided to turn their games into a fund-raiser to help 
combat a disease affecting their friends, family members and others within the 
African American community. 
</P>
<P>
 The chapter amended its constitution to commit itself to annual charity 
bowling tournaments, with proceeds going toward medical research and 
educational materials on sickle-cell anemia, a deadly inherited blood disorder. 
The group is once again hosting a "Strike for Sickle Cell" benefit, which began 
Saturday at Mid-Town Bowling Center, 4546 Venice Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our bowling organization, we have always had members who have had someone 
in the family that has suffered from sickle cell," said Eugene Knox, president 
of the Los Angeles chapter of the association, founded in 1939 as the National 
Negro Bowling Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament, which will run from 1 to 6 p.m. every Saturday and Sunday 
through Sept. 25, will benefit the Sickle Cell Disease Assn. of America. A $15 
entrance fee entitles bowlers to three games as they compete for prizes donated 
by the association and the community. With the exception of large groups, 
reservations are not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynda K. Anderson, executive director of the Sickle Cell Disease Assn. of 
America, believes the public needs to be educated about the gravity of the 
illness.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we have (AIDS and other) diseases that affect the population at 
large, sickle cell disease has been put back in the shadows," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sickle cell anemia attacks the red blood cells, causing them to harden and 
assume a curved, sickle-like shape. These cells have a tendency to get caught 
around the joints, causing severe and often crippling pain. Diseased cells can 
also form blood clots, often leading to leg ulcers and sometimes strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the National Center for Health Statistics, 419 Americans lost 
their lives to sickle cell anemia in 1991, the latest year for which statistics 
are available. Of that total, 406 were African American.

 Under the sheltering leaves of a solitary shade tree, Nelson Guzman watched as 
his 8-year-old son Marlon and close to 20 other boys practiced kicking a bright 
orange soccer ball under the hot afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second day of soccer clinics for schoolchildren at the newly opened 
Ketchum Downtown YMCA's "Field of Dreams" community soccer field. Guzman, a 
soccer fan, had come to chaperon Marlon and a few of his third-grade pals from 
Union Avenue School, as well as get in a few kicks of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great," Guzman said as he huffed toward the shade after kicking a 
stray ball back into the fray. "It opens up their minds. I'd rather have them 
thinking about sports than thinking about being on the street. This helps them 
keep their minds on good things." 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer clinics, which target kids between 8 and 12, began on Labor Day, 
when the field was officially opened for play. Although it was completed in 
July after a communitywide effort, the freshly lain sod had to set for a couple 
of months before soccer activities could begin. 
</P>
<P>
 League soccer play for 8- to 12-year-olds began Saturday. So far, said Kathy 
Bates, program director for the YMCA, 22 youth teams have been formed. 
YMCA-sponsored teen soccer leagues will begin competing in October, and adult 
leagues can schedule evening and weekend use through the YMCA, Bates said. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters are being driven to the field twice a day from four schools. Every 
two weeks, the YMCA will pick out four schools to serve as drop-off points, 
from which kids whose year-round schools aren't in session will be driven to 
the field. Children from the first two schools are picked up at 9 a.m. and play 
until noon. For the afternoon session, kids are picked up at 1 p.m. and play 
until 3 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Although parents may accompany their children to the field, most simply take 
them to the drop-off point to await the van, then pick them up afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch is provided for both groups of youngsters, and those who do not wish to 
play soccer will soon be able to participate in arts and crafts activities in a 
grassy area adjacent to the field. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first week, both the morning and afternoon sessions averaged about 20 
children each, said Carlos Lopez, a YMCA coach who volunteered to assist site 
director Matthew Omenwu. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good option for them, instead of being bored at home," Lopez said. 
"This field is surrounded by a very bad area, so they have nowhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-year-old Rudy Romero agreed as he trudged off the field after play 
concluded. Until now, said the cherubic third-grader, vacations hadn't been 
much fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd stay in the house and get bored all day," he said, his Bugs Bunny T-shirt 
covered with grass stains. "This is really nice, 'cause I like playing soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Omenwu, who had never coached children, said he was thoroughly enjoying his 
new job. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're picking it up real quick," he said, noting that many kids already 
have soccer experience. "They're like sponges." 
</P>
<P>
 Bates said the YMCA is looking for local businesses to sponsor teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer van drivers are also being sought.

 A grant will enable USC School of Medicine to expand its partnership with 
Bravo Medical Magnet High School with more support for its annual science fair, 
additional classes and summer training. 
</P>
<P>
 USC was among 42 biomedical research institutions nationwide that were awarded 
a total of$10.3 million from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to improve 
science education at primary and secondary grade levels.The five-year grant 
amounts to $200,000 for USC and Bravo. 
</P>
<P>
 It will help the high school expand its science fair, in which students plan, 
prepare and exhibit experiments using the resources of USC's faculty and 
equipment. Some students go on to compete in county and state science fairs, 
Bravo Principal Rosa Maria Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant will also help the school continue its summer training for students, 
who receive a stipend for their lab work. The stipend acts as an incentive for 
students to attend the six-week program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most successful and most popular programs," Hernandez 
said. "They come back ready for the biomedical research class." 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher training will also increase in the clinical and medical research 
fields, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,600-student high school will also add tissue culture procedures to its 
biomedical research courses and expand the hospital occupations and ophthalmic 
technician courses.  
</P>
<P>
 The grant will also support the continuing publication of Metamorphosis, a 
student-written newsletter focusing on research and science club activities. 
The newsletter will be circulated to other high schools to foster interest in 
biomedical issues and research. 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo was designed so that its teachers and students work with USC faculty in 
biomedical research in diabetes, cancer, AIDS education and research, 
cardiovascular disease and substance abuse. It is one of two medical and health 
professions magnet high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: LINCOLN HEIGHTS; GOODWILL GIVES ITS WORKERS A NEW START

 It's all bustle at the Goodwill Industries loading docks, where workers every 
day haul off 10,000 pieces of donated clothes and 600 pairs of shoes, and an 
untold number of mattresses, clocks, radios and other items worth repairing for 
resale at Goodwill stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Lives and livelihoods are also under repair at the Lincoln Heights plant, many 
of whose 700-member work force cope with mental and physical disabilities and 
problems such as alcoholism and illiteracy as they train for jobs and 
independent living outside the plant.  
</P>
<P>
 'The goal is always to find people jobs outside of Goodwill," said Sophia 
Chavez, who works in community relations at the Lincoln Heights location, 342 
San Fernando Road, the main center for the 75-year-old, nonprofit organization 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "They learn the skills here and find employment somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 In the stores, $2 out of every $3 goes back to the job-training programs for 
salaries and supplies, Chavez said. The organization itself takes no federal or 
United Way donations, she said. It is 95% self-sufficient, to serve as an 
example to workers that they must become independent, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 One employee, Lices Ramirez, 25, has worked her way up at Goodwill from 
telephone operator to secretary to her new job as a counselor in the 
organization's Special Projects program.  
</P>
<P>
 The program, started about a year ago, helps people through drug or alcohol 
addiction, emotional problems and other obstacles that keep them from being 
productive workers. While in the program, the workers perform job tasks that 
also serve as training for future jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez was named the Goodwill Achiever of the Year for 1994. She serves as 
inspiration to the workers because she has lived most of her life without her 
hands.  
</P>
<P>
 As an infant, Ramirez had her hands amputated after being severely burned in a 
house fire. She hopes to become a counselor for people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we don't know how to manage our own problems and then they tell you 
their problems and you have to think about them as well as yourself," she said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Ramirez's job is to teach people responsible behavior, such as getting 
to work on time and communicating and working well with others. When workers 
get depressed over their situations, she said she tries to explain that the 
productive work they do today will help them get into more rewarding jobs in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so hard for me to tell them (to do what they should do), but you have 
to," Ramirez said.  
</P>
<P>
 In other parts of the plant, workers assemble bar stools, package drinking 
straws and seal dog food for businesses that contract with Goodwill. A Job Club 
connects job-seekers with a coordinator who helps them hone their interview 
skills, find jobs through classified ads and other sources, and even arranges 
transportation to job interviews. Chavez said the program, open to the public, 
has an almost 100% success rate in helping people land a job. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs placed 165 people in outside jobs last year, Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Home Depot in Glendale employs three Goodwill-trained workers, said 
assistant manager Maurice McLeod. One of the men works in the lighting 
department cleaning the light fixtures and replacing lightbulbs. Two others 
work in the garden department watering and arranging plants and sometimes 
assisting customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Hiring from Goodwill) is just something we've done for quite a while to put 
people to work who have, shall we say, limited abilities," McLeod said. "They 
do good work and they really work hard at what they do." MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: 'MEXICANZ' BILLBOARD ADS PROTESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A letter-writing protest against radio station KPWR-FM 106 for its "2 Fat 
Mexicanz" advertising campaign appears to have brought results. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters ask station manager Doyle Rose to discontinue the campaign, which 
depicts Mexican American disc jockeys Nick and Eric Vidal (brothers who are 
known as the Baka Boys) in beach attire, sitting on toilets or walking with 
surfboards. The ads are on billboards throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The East/Northeast Networking Roundtable, a group of community organizations, 
found the advertising "insulting and demeaning to the Latino community," wrote 
Chairman Eddie Farias in his letter to Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is already an abundance of negative sentiment directed to the Latino 
community. Enough is enough! It is your corporate social responsibility to 
avoid the perpetuation of negative imagery of a people in our culturally 
diverse society," the letter said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of advertising is really disparaging to the community and we feel 
they need to be more responsible," said Reva Trevino, senior consultant for the 
County Commission on Human Relations and a member of the Roundtable. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose blamed the disagreement over the ads on a generation gap, rather than an 
effort to disparage Latinos, pointing out that the deejays came up with the 
idea themselves and that the station's audience, which is 65% Latino, has not 
been outraged by the billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saying that they're Mexican and fat and they're proud has become their 
moniker and in a sense it's become something that people rally around," Rose 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Rose agreed that the toilet scene was in poor taste and replaced those 
billboards with the Baka Boys with their surfboards. The entire ad campaign 
will end in about 30 days, he said, adding that future ad campaigns will be 
more sensitive to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not about to be offensive to the bread and butter of our station," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The duo's show has risen to one of the top five morning shows in Los Angeles, 
the only morning show that targets young Mexican Americans, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The letter-writing campaign started after a member of the commission on human 
relations, Eduardo Garcia, spoke to Roundtable members at its Aug. 9 meeting 
about the advertisements. The Roundtable then agreed to join the protest by 
writing letters. MARY ANNE PEREZ

 He's been dead since Christmas Day, 1948, but on Sept. 24, Mayor Arthur C. 
Harper will come back from the grave to explain his "open city" policy that 
allowed legal prostitution and gambling in Los Angeles during the first part of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper will be among eight Los Angeles citizens of the past who will come to 
life at the Rosedale Cemetery during the West Adams Heritage Assn.'s Living 
History tour. Local actors and actresses will portray historic figures from the 
city's past on 90-minute walks through the landmark cemetery starting every 20 
minutes from 9 a.m. to noon. The tour costs $8. 
</P>
<P>
 The tours, sponsored in conjunction with the Los Angeles City Historical 
Society, have been offered for four years. A California state historian will 
also be on hand to field questions, said heritage association official Joe 
Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first year that we are going to do portrayals of individuals at 
individual grave sites," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper was often found drunk at the "pleasure houses" of the day, "ostensibly 
to see if they needed repairs," Ryan said. Few accepted Harper's explanation 
that he was on a fact-finding mission. In 1909, at the beginning of the reform 
period, Harper resigned from office amid charges that he was taking payoffs 
from casinos.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the brothels Harper visited was owned by Minnie Wilson and an actress 
will relate Wilson's experience as a businesswoman at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Hattie McDaniel, the first African American winner of an Academy Award for her 
role in "Gone With the Wind," and John Bradbury, who built the Bradbury 
Building on Broadway in Downtown, will also be portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1884 as the first lawn cemetery in the city, Rosedale is at 1831 W. 
Washington Blvd.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; CENTRAL LIBRARY'S TEEN CENTER DEBUTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 To some teen-agers, the 68-year-old restored Central Library on 5th Street may 
look more like a monster of a maze than a resource for research. 
</P>
<P>
 With 2.1 million volumes spread throughout the shelves of the 
540,000-square-foot building, it's no surprise to librarians that youths would 
prefer seeking help at a smaller, local branch library. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Central Library, because of its location and its size, can be 
intimidating to people coming from the (San Fernando) Valley or the city," said 
Pat Kiefer, manager for general library services.  
</P>
<P>
 "(When) you come in off any of the entrances to the Central Library, you're in 
a lobby area that could be very intimidating," said Kiefer, who added that the 
young readers are sometimes overwhelmed when told the library has nine subject 
areas to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that could change with the opening Saturday of a Central Library 
resource center that caters to young adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Called Teen'Scape (pronounced "teen escape"), the second-floor center offers 
teen-agers their own collection of fiction, nonfiction, classics and magazines. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really meant for teen-agers to have a comfortable place to come in," 
Kiefer said. "It's an area where the teens can find information and materials 
both to do homework assignments and to accomplish recreational reading." 
</P>
<P>
 One room contains four IBM-compatible computers with CD-ROM capability, which 
allows users to obtain information from an encyclopedia and other educational 
materials. Teens can also try out a computerized Scholastic Aptitude Test 
tutorial program. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's opening will coincide with a free 1 p.m. performance of "Lonely 
Souls," a high school play about a girl's efforts to get out of a gang. The 
drama will be held at the library's Mark Taper Auditorium.  
</P>
<P>
 The Central Library is at 630 W. 5th St.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ECHO PARK; VOTE SCHEDULED ON KITE HILL DUPLEXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to vote Wednesday on a West Los Angeles 
developer's plan to build four duplexes on a scenic hillside that some local 
residents have fought to preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Kaufman, general partner of Avon Terrace Homes Ltd., has been trying to 
develop the area known as Kite Hill at 1450 Avon Place since he purchased the 1 
1/2-acre lot in 1991, his attorney, Benjamin M. Reznik, has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members in May delayed voting on Kaufman's proposal pending a possible 
compromise plan between Kaufman and residents from Echo Park and other 
surrounding communities. But an agreement seems to be far from sight, residents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer had offered to produce drawings to show that six houses, instead 
of four duplexes, could squeeze into 30,000 square feet of space on Kite Hill. 
In exchange, Kaufman would donate a part of the parcel -- known as an ideal 
location for flying kites -- to the city or a land conservancy for recreational 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just doesn't look any better," said Susan Borden, member of a committee 
organized to protect Kite Hill. "It would be putting six houses into an area 
that's extremely small." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Kaufman nor Reznik could be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Borden said the committee prefers a maximum of five single-family homes. 
That's just one of 13 conditions committee members submitted to Councilwoman 
Jackie Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg is expected to meet with Kaufman and the community before voting 
Wednesday, said Gerald Gubatan, Goldberg's planning deputy. TOMMY LI

CITY TIMES COVER STORY; TRUE COLORS; INSTEAD OF FUN AND GAMES, THIS SUMMER CAMP 
TEACHES TEENS TO CONFRONT THE STEREOTYPES THAT TEAR AT LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the evergreens of the San Bernardino Mountains, far from the Echo Park 
neighborhood where he ran the streets as a tough cholo years ago, Jose Esqueda 
cried out to be seen not as a stereotypical immigrant or gangbanger, but for 
who he really is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a human being. I have feelings. I am a human being. See me that way! See 
me that way!" he bellowed to 102 teen-agers of varying races. 
</P>
<P>
 Serwa Fontenot, a student at King-Drew Magnet School in Watts, sat rapt along 
with cliques of other teens as Esqueda, 24, talked of the pain of being 
stereotyped as an illegal immigrant or criminal. When Esqueda finished, 
Fontenot walked up to him and put her arm around his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Esqueda's emotional outburst jarred Fontenot, 17, and several other teen-agers 
into examining the harshness of stereotypes, which is the point of 
Brotherhood/Sisterhood USA, a weeklong camp where Asian, Latino, African 
American, Native American and white teen-agers live together and confront the 
prejudices, separatism and stereotypes that tear at the social fabric of life 
in Los Angeles. Esqueda, who volunteers as a staff member at the camp, was 
ending a discussion on stereotyping before he broke down in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 For seven intense days last month, Fontenot and 14 teens from Central Los 
Angeles high schools joined other high school students from throughout the Los 
Angeles area to grapple with prejudice on a personal level. They explored 
sexism, racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism and discriminatory attitudes toward 
immigrants and the disabled.  
</P>
<P>
 "Literally, kids will come here and have a life transformation," said Lori 
Nelson, director of youth and education programs for National Conference, a 
nonprofit interdenominational organization that runs the project in a mountain 
retreat in Yucaipa, about 100 miles east of Los Angeles at the base of the San 
Bernardino Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 National Conference has been organizing human relations programs in Southern 
California since 1950. The weeklong camp, which is run twice each summer, is 
one of 17 programs that include sessions for adults, teachers and police as 
well as high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 At Brotherhood/Sisterhood USA, campers met as a large community and in 
separate racial groups, and in smaller dialogue and cabin groups. The rules for 
communication were simple: honesty, personal responsibility, patience, cultural 
sensitivity and active listening. 
</P>
<P>
 The process, however, was anything but simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary," said Leora Goren, an attorney from Los Angeles and a staff 
leader who was a camper in 1980. "We stick them in different cabins and tell 
them to be friends. And then what do they have to do? They have to say nasty 
things to each other."  
</P>
<P>
 "But if you really want a relationship with someone, you have to get through 
that . . . or else there's no trust," Goren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through emotionally charged and painful exercises and discussions, the camp 
has become a rite of passage for thousands of high school students over the 
years. Many leave with a newfound determination to rid themselves and their 
friends of prejudicial images of others.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned a lot of stuff about myself, that I could be versatile and don't 
have to cling to one group," said Fontenot, who had often struggled with the 
pressure of being accepted by her African American peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is helping me to be more sure of myself . . . of what I want to be and 
who I am," she said. "The hardest part is I think I'm changing, but people at 
my school haven't all gone through this so they haven't changed. And how am I 
supposed to change them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Perez Jr., a senior at Belmont High School, learned from his teachers 
that he would be discussing issues in society. "I didn't think it was a normal 
camp, but I didn't think it would be this intense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez came to the camp to understand more about peoples' stereotypes. He 
didn't believe he held stereotypes of others. He quickly learned otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized that I do have fears about people and then think things about 
them. I just never considered they were stereotypes," the 18-year-old 
Guatemalan native said. "This is a good experience because it makes me go 
inside myself and learn about what I think inside my head and my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Students attend the camp for various reasons, from meeting new people or 
dealing with race relations to gaining the social studies credits offered to 
those enrolled in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers are selected for the camp on a first-come, first-served basis 
from applications they receive from teachers or former campers. Most of the 
students are from public schools, and for many the $200 fee to participate is 
subsidized in part by contracts with Los Angeles Unified and a substantial 
donation from the Herb Alpert Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Conference staff tries to pull together a racially balanced 
group. What they usually end up with is a microcosm of Los Angeles -- socially, 
racially and economically. 
</P>
<P>
 The range of issues and the intensity of the discussions make for an emotional 
roller coaster, with dips and turns, sharp drops and steep climbs that test the 
levels of friendships the students are encouraged to build. Sometimes, things 
can get ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This scares me," said Moira Potter, a student at South Pasadena High School. 
</P>
<P>
 She was staring at a lengthy list of stereotypes that non-Jewish campers 
compiled about Jews. It was Day 3 of the camp and the evening's exercise was on 
anti-Semitism. The campers had started forming bonds that crossed racial, 
gender and religious lines, bonds they thought were solid. But opinions seemed 
to easily rip through that fabric as they did in almost every daily exercise, 
from religion to race to sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't feeling any true anti-Semitism before this," Potter said to the 
cluster of Jewish campers in a room separated from the others. "It scares me 
because I didn't notice it before," she said. "I wasn't on guard and now I'm 
going to be and I don't want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the large community meeting, the scene between Jewish and non-Jewish 
campers mirrored what would happen in the following days. The teens tussled 
back and forth trying to tell their story or their opinion. A few campers left 
the room feeling persecuted or misunderstood. Others sobbed from an increasing 
sense of futility or emotional pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff leaders stepped in at times like this to pull people back on track and 
sometimes clear up misconstrued statements. All but two of the 50-member staff 
are former campers who have returned over several years to voluntarily lead the 
groups. Although many have seen the process played out repeatedly, they are 
still affected by the stories and are sometimes reminded of their own 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for this camp I don't think I would be here today," said Goren, 
31, who came out as a lesbian when she was a camper. "For me, coming back here 
I believe in the goal. I believe in the kids, but I also want to be here for 
the gay kids. The camp was a safe place for me to come out and for many of 
these kids it's the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 At the last retreat three weeks ago, several campers declared their 
homosexuality or bisexuality for the first time to a large group of people, 
some of whom were accepting, while others were confused or completely 
intolerant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm worried about how my cabin will react," said one gay Latino camper. "It's 
been five days that we've been together, that we've been friends and then all 
of a sudden by them knowing this about me, I can be rejected." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Marshall, a gay staff member, said: "Those attitudes in there end up 
having people beaten to death on the street. And we're here worried what people 
think about us. This is where we have to start to confront that." 
</P>
<P>
 The safe environment of the mountain retreat program resembles more of an 
ideal world than reality; campers can be open and honest about everything, no 
matter how hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have never learned about different religions and things if I didn't 
go there," said Xochil Mora, 17, a student at Ramona High School on the 
Eastside. "There ain't no Jewish people or white people who live around here. I 
don't think I changed at all, but I learned a little more." 
</P>
<P>
 In an exercise on sexism, Mora and more than 50 young women tried to conquer 
the pressure to fit the perfect model image that had led to bulimia among 
several female campers. Others painfully recounted incidents of molestation and 
harassment that have affected how they deal with men. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way I believe . . . I'm fat and ugly," cried Fontenot, a strikingly 
beautiful and statuesque African American. "And there's so much that goes into 
it. . . . I've been mistreated. I've been disrespected. And it hurts so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 She broke down sobbing and nearly a dozen other girls sobbed along with her 
because of their own similar experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 For men, the tables were turned. They became the oppressed rather than the 
oppressors as women whispered catcalls at their backs: "You know you like it." 
"I didn't rape you, (expletive)." "Why are all you women so emotional?" The 
exercise was to make the men more conscious of the effect their actions or 
remarks have on women. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jason Miller of Leuzinger High School in Hawthorne, the example was 
insuperable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize today that when I talk about women and make reference to how women 
look, that's offensive," he said. "I'm willing to make a change for the better. 
When I hear my homeboys saying something, I'm gonna remember each and every 
face here." 
</P>
<P>
 The memory of people's faces and their words rarely fade in campers' minds, 
said Nelson of National Conference. They take their experiences back to their 
communities and schools, where they continue to struggle with teaching others 
or understanding more about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria and Carmen Nieto, students at Jordan High School in Watts, said the 
experience would help them deal with the occasional racial tensions between 
blacks and Latinos at their high school that they often shied away from. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps you to learn what other people think about you and themselves so it 
makes it easier to talk to them," Maria said. "I didn't talk to many of the 
black kids at school, but maybe that will happen more. I don't know. I'll just 
have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
 Esqueda left his camp experience in 1985 a confused 15-year-old. He ran with a 
gang and knew of death, but little of Latino history or successes in the Latino 
community. The camp turned his life upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to camp, I was gangbanging and all I knew was my world," said 
Esqueda, who left his Echo Park gang and now works as a youth counselor with an 
Asian American drug abuse program in the Crenshaw district. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came here it all turned around for me," he said. "I had to fight 
myself here. I knew a certain way and up here it was different." 
</P>
<P>
 It took three years for Esqueda to leave his gang after continuing efforts to 
talk to them about respecting women or moving beyond their nihilistic 
lifestyles. Eventually, he had to walk away. Although he promised himself he 
would never return to the camp after such a wrenching experience, he has been 
volunteering for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, the pain is still there for Esqueda -- as well as other staff 
members -- when he sees his race pitted against another. 
</P>
<P>
 In a daylong dialogue on race, prejudices and stereotypes flew and stung 
relentlessly and people looked like they were preparing for battle rather than 
entering a discussion. The exercise on race relations was one of the prickliest 
in the camp. Racial groups were separated and compiled lists of stereotypes 
about themselves and other groups on 6-foot-long white sheets of paper that 
were often covered from top to bottom with stereotypical impressions. 
</P>
<P>
 Asians said they saw African Americans as abusing the welfare system, being 
involved in gangs and disliking Koreans. Blacks said Latinos have roaches in 
their apartments and sell oranges on the corner, and women prostitute 
themselves by the tight clothes they wear. Latinos portrayed whites as devil 
worshipers and oppressors. Whites stereotyped Asians as passive and very quiet 
and hard workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups then met head on -- two by two -- to confront each other and debunk 
some of the false impressions one group had of another. In a meeting between 
Asians and Latinos, a male Latino camper took offense at Asians who consider 
Latinos dumb and without regard for higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm breaking those stereotypes, and it hurts that every time I walk down the 
street that I might not be considered smart because I'm Mexican," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, an Asian girl said being called mute by the Latino group "implies that . 
. . we're afraid to stand up for what we believe in and that hurts me." 
</P>
<P>
 While the discussions were tense, nothing was more divisive than the Power 
Grid exercise, in which campers independently ranked the racial groups from 
most to least powerful. Four times, whites were ranked the most powerful and 
told to take the stage. Four times, Latinos and Native Americans were ranked 
last. The realism of the exercise was a blow to the Latinos, who were wailing 
before the end of the Power Grid exercise.  
</P>
<P>
 "They think we're low-lifes," said Mora, who likened the opinions of the Power 
Grid exercise to how Latinos are viewed in society. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look down on us because we don't have the money. But this was our land," 
she said defiantly. "(California) was Mexico and the white man just came in 
here and took it from us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino campers' despair trickled through each of the racial groups, each 
feeling the frustration and anger or, in the case of the white group, guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate meeting for the people of color, the tension from the day's 
exercises in which they were pitted against each other disappeared into 
collective exasperation. The campers of color wanted to build bridges among 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had what you have -- a language, a culture. You've got it," Fontenot 
said to Asians and Latinos. "So can you teach me so I can bond with you?" she 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 From across the room, a Latino camper passed Fontenot the Mexican flag he had 
carried throughout the day. She clutched it for the remainder of the night.  
</P>
<P>
 When the white group returned, camper Meldy Hernandez of Long Beach stood 
before all the campers to deliver a message that she hoped would leave an 
indelible impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you think about stereotyping someone, remember me," she told them. 
"Remember all of us. And remember when you stereotype one person you do it to 
everyone. And it hurts."

KEY RETURNEES, STAR RECRUITS RAISE HOPES AT SOUTHWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ETHAN ALLEN THOMAS JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The high points were few in Los Angeles Southwest College's 1993 football 
season, a 3-6-1 campaign punctuated by blunders, missed opportunities and 
lopsided scores. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the 1994 season opens, Coach Henry Washington is confident that his 
Cougars will produce performances worthy of highlights and pleasant flashbacks. 
He's convinced they will erase the memories of their plunge to the bottom of 
the Western State Conference standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a group of fellows returning that were key players last year, and some 
of the key players from the high schools we got in this year. If we play like I 
think we will, we'll be a good football team," the head coach at LASC for the 
past decade said. 
</P>
<P>
 But what's so different about the Cougars of 1994? "We've got a bunch of men 
now. We had a bunch of little boys last year. We're men on a mission," 
Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, it looks like he has a winner.  
</P>
<P>
 The biggest addition is Locke star Akili Roberson, one of the top players in 
the state, who came to LASC to boost his grades. Roberson, a two-time City 
Times all-star, led the Saints to the city section playoffs at quarterback the 
last three years, each ending in a second-round defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his achievements at Locke, Roberson will utilize his defensive skills 
at safety instead.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel my chances (of making it to a larger college) are better at defense 
than at quarterback," Roberson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberson, combined with Kevin Hopsin, converted back Tim McTyer and 
quarterback Bradley Freeman compensate for the absence of star cornerbacks 
Darryl Cooley and Daryl Cash in the secondary. Cash transferred to Pittsburgh 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebackers Teazel Hall, Christopher Williams and Henry Washington (no 
relation to the coach) account for the middle. Hall, who missed the entire '93 
season with a foot injury, is a key returner. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Bell, Oliver Ross, Eddie Blakely and Derek Rice are the defensive 
linemen. Averaging 6-4 and 250 pounds, this combination is one of the best in 
the conference. Bell, who led the Cougars with 12 sacks last year, is a key 
defensive returner. Roberson and Washington are the only newcomers on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 On offense, freshman running back Jermaine Lewis and Compton College transfer 
Courtney Bell are both key additions to a backfield diminished by the departure 
of '93 Cougar rushing leader Katia Ransom, who is now at San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis was among the top 10 rushers last year in the City section's Coastal 
Conference at Westchester with 633 yards and 8 touchdowns. Bell was a highly 
regarded back at Locke before the days of present star Sirr Parker. Bell hasn't 
played since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the offensive balance is Richard Bowden, the only returning receiver 
from last year. Bowden, who only had seven catches for 80 yards, is likely to 
get more opportunities as a result of the double coverage that converted track 
star Kyhaunn Woods may receive. Woods has been clocked in 4.2 seconds for the 
40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to capitalize on the newly recruited speed will be quarterback Sheldon 
Anderson. Anderson was voted CIF 3A high school football player of the year in 
1991 while at Washington. Providing the protection is a group of returners. 
Brian Henley, Demetrius Brown, Anthony Baker, Semaj Phanor and George Young 
form a stocky line, averaging 270 pounds each.

TACKLING THE ODDS; FOOTBALL: NISSIM LEON'S PROGRAM IN WHICH HE SHARES HIS 
PASSION FOR THE GAME HAS KEPT MORE THAN 50 CHILDREN OFF THE STREETS AND OUT OF 
TROUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The words recognition and notoriety are not a part of Nissim Leon's everyday 
vocabulary. He is more apt to talk about pride, community and, his favorite 
topic, children. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon is president of the Boyle Heights Youth Football Assn. of the King 
Football Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason Leon founded the year-round program seven years ago remains his 
motivation: to keep kids off the streets and out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can do that through football," he said, "then we've won." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon believes football taught him to be a winner, and he hopes it can do the 
same for the 7- to 15-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is not to make professional football players out of these kids," he 
said, "but if that happens, that's great. I just want them to be productive 
citizens in their community." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon, 26, played varsity football at Roosevelt in 1984 and '85, two 2-A City 
Section title seasons for the Roughriders. That football experience has 
provided Leon the lessons he tries to pass on to the 50 to 60 youths in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned discipline, persistence and gained self-esteem during my years as a 
football player," Leon said. "These are all things that these kids need to 
learn to survive in this community." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood harbors a sizable gang population and is racked by poverty, a 
potentially dangerous combination for young minds. So Leon offered football as 
a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never any football program in Boyle Heights, but now the kids are 
out here doing something positive," Leon said. "They need an outlet and they 
need someone to care about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Alongside Leon in his fight to save the children of Boyle Heights are some of 
his childhood friends and teammates, such as Miguel Quintero. 
</P>
<P>
 Quintero, 25, who played varsity football at Roosevelt from 1984-86, has been 
involved in the youth program since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
 He can remember having to travel three miles to Salazar Park as a kid just to 
play a pickup game, because there was no program in the community. "When I was 
growing up, we went far away to play football," Quintero said. "Now these kids 
have a place in their neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 With such a worthy cause, it might seem that sponsors would be clamoring to be 
associated with the program. But that hasn't been the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program owes itself to two people: Manuel Rojas and Nate Holden," Leon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rojas, owner of the local El Tepeyac restaurant, donated $1,500 to get the 
program started. "I cared because this is my neighborhood," Rojas said. "They 
told me if I helped them out, (the program) would last forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Holden, the 10th District city councilman, was instrumental in getting $1,500 
over seven years from the Amateur Athletic Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such meager funding, Leon keeps the program running. 
</P>
<P>
 Each boy pays a $30 sign-up fee that covers insurance. Each year, the program 
finds a medical facility, such as Northeast Clinic this year, to offer free 
physicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Practice is held at Roosevelt High from 6 to 8 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday. 
Much of the equipment -- shoulder pads, pants and jerseys -- are donated by the 
Roughriders. And Leon stores the equipment in his garage. 
</P>
<P>
 And the program's organizers, including Leon, work without pay.  
</P>
<P>
 The lack of parent participation has nagged Leon over the years: "Parents 
don't help out much because many of them are first-generation Latinos who don't 
understand football or don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon does some impressive juggling with his own daily duties to supervise the 
program. In addition to being a full-time student at Glendale City College, he 
supervises a child and family program at County-USC Medical Center. Then he 
heads over to Roosevelt to instruct future Roughrider prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to play football, probably for Roosevelt," said Edward Lavoy, who 
plays for the Midget Team. "I like the sport; it's a good experience for me."  
</P>
<P>
 Lavoy, who attends Hollenbeck Middle School, lives in the Aliso Village 
housing project. Although he is just 13, Lavoy seems to understand the 
importance of the program: "This keeps me from being at home bored or out in 
the street."

 Anti-abortion stance -- An Aug. 10 article in The Times incorrectly implied 
that Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and a few other conservative 
Republicans in Congress support the killing of abortion doctors by 
anti-abortion extremists. Dornan is a supporter of anti-abortion groups such as 
Operation Rescue but he opposes the use of violence.
