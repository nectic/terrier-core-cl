COURT BACKS BAN ON GATED PUBLIC STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles cannot fight crime by allowing homeowner groups to erect 
electronic gates on public streets to keep out unwanted traffic and 
pedestrians, the state Court of Appeal ruled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 21-page decision upholding an earlier ruling by Superior Court Judge 
Robert H. O'Brien, a three-judge appeals panel compared the practice of gating 
public streets in some neighborhoods to medieval feudalism, a system that 
allowed powerful people to control access to designated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the city cannot do is wave a magic wand and declare a public street not 
to be a public street," the panel wrote in ruling against the Whitley Heights 
Civic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The group -- with the approval of the Los Angeles City Council and at a cost 
of $350,000 of its own money -- two years ago erected seven gates across 
streets and sidewalks in Whitley Heights, a 1920s-era hillside neighborhood 
just east of the Hollywood Bowl. The group said the gates were needed to stem 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, as a result of a lawsuit brought by the grass-roots Citizens 
Against Gated Enclaves (CAGE), O'Brien ruled the gates illegal and ordered the 
homeowners not to close them. 
</P>
<P>
 The court decision handed down Wednesday upheld O'Brien's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 It noted that under its agreement with the Whitley Heights homeowners, the 
city had allowed the group to decide who is allowed in and out of the 
neighborhood while taxpayer money was used to maintain streets, sewers and 
storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling affects scores of groups that have sought applications from the 
city to gate their neighborhoods. Forty-three of those applications have been 
approved, but the approvals probably will have to be rescinded, legal experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling does not affect private communities whose streets are not 
designated for public use. 
</P>
<P>
 David Faustian, lawyer for the Whitley Heights group, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Howard, one of the lawyers who represented CAGE, called the ruling a 
victory for the poor and the less powerful.

WHITEWATER AND THE MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Whitewater: Media Frenzy Unavoidable," news analysis, March 12: 
</P>
<P>
 The article on the media frenzy surrounding Whitewater tells us about a 
"meaningless" note found in Vincent Foster's office after his alleged suicide 
that led to a Washington Post article speculating that it linked him to a slush 
fund. We are told that it now appears "it was simply a list of dates the 
Clintons deposited money in a school account for their daughter, Chelsea." This 
is the typical press double-standard when it comes to a Democrat in the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Whitewater tax work and whatever else, what was Vincent Foster -- 
part of the office of White House counsel and a highly paid federal employee -- 
doing keeping track of personal financial records of the Clintons? This is, in 
fact, not an appropriate function for government-paid lawyers and is the kind 
of thing the Democrats tried to string Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson (R-Tex.) up 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 KIP DELLINGER 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
 * Your concern that ". . . coverage of Whitewater could seriously harm the 
President only to have it discovered later that there was no criminal 
wrongdoing" demonstrates your unwavering dedication to journalistic integrity. 
I recall that throughout the Iran-Contra debacle with special prosecutor 
Lawrence Walsh, you almost daily voiced a similar concern over the "coverage" 
effects on Presidents Reagan and Bush. You were vindicated in this pursuit 
because we all remember the headline culminating Walsh's short and 
cost-effective investigation: no criminal wrongdoing found. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Twentynine Palms 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally a moment of sanity, and responsibility in the "media frenzy" about 
Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 And not a moment too soon. Because up to now, every time I turned the TV on 
and listened to the talking heads, the blabbermouths, the poisoned pens, the 
dirt merchants and the all-knowing, self-congratulating politicos -- all they 
did was defend themselves for the crisis that they created. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no Whitewater crisis. There is a media crisis and Republican crisis. 
There is a big, serious crisis of cynicism in America. The public is disgusted 
with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 BATYA DAGAN 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Of the following 10 subjects relating to the challenging problems and 
important reforms we face, list your priorities in order of importance to the 
United States: health care reform; balancing the budget; the trade deficit with 
Japan; crime; jobs; Whitewater investigation; education reform; downsizing the 
federal bureaucracy; welfare reform, and lower taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a feeling an honest and truthful listing of most people's priorities 
would have the Whitewater story in last place and least important. It is 
unfortunate for all citizens that the news media and the politicians of both 
parties continue to play the old game of politics instead of getting on with 
the people's business.

STABILIZING THE PESO -- AND SALINAS' MEXICO; COLOSIO ASSASSINATION ROCKS 
AMERICA'S SOUTHERN NAFTA PARTNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even before Wednesday's assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio in Tijuana, the 
1994 Mexican presidential race was shaping up as the most important vote in 
that country since 1910, when a disputed election set off the bloody Mexican 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that a terrible act of violence has thrown Mexican politics into greater 
uncertainty and turmoil, Mexico's friends in the United States and elsewhere 
must stand firm in support of outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and 
the extraordinary progress he has come to personify. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio, 44, was Salinas' handpicked choice to be the candidate of the 
powerful Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has won -- though not 
without allegations of fraud -- every Mexican presidential election since it 
was founded in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas was counting on Colosio, an economist who studied at the University of 
Pennsylvania, to carry on his economic policies, especially implementation of 
the historic North American Free Trade Agreement. Despite the controversy sur- 
rounding his selection, Colosio was acknowledged widely to be a capable and 
decent man; his death is a loss to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The motive of Colosio's assassin is still uncertain, but the effects of the 
bloody deed are all too apparent. Although the Mexican stock exchange and other 
financial institutions were closed Thursday, a national day of mourning in 
Mexico, many financial analysts fear the assassination will set back, at least 
in the short term, Mexico's economy, which slowly and painfully has been 
recovering from recession and runaway inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming on the heels of a brief but bloody peasant rebellion in Chiapas and the 
recent kidnaping of a prominent Mexican banker, the murder of a leading 
presidential candidate can mean only added pressure on Mexico's still shaky 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why the initial U.S. government reaction was reassuring. In addition 
to appropriate expressions of outrage and sympathy by President Clinton and the 
State Department, Clinton met with Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to discuss 
details of a $6-billion line of credit to help stabilize the Mexican peso. 
</P>
<P>
 Also extremely helpful was Clinton's statement that the U.S. government 
believes Mexican institutions are "fundamentally strong" and will ride out that 
nation's current political turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Such expressions of confidence are vitally important now, not just statements 
from Washington but demonstrations of confidence from Los Angeles, New York and 
the many other financial centers where investors eagerly have pursued business 
opportunities in Mexico these last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors have needed a safe, stable environment in Mexico for their 
investments, and Salinas largely delivered. The recent troubles in the southern 
state of Chiapas are less an indication that his free-market policies failed 
than a reminder of just how much still needs to be done to bring Mexico from 
the Third World to the First -- politically as well as economically. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas and the new generation of young political leaders he brought into the 
Mexican government -- a generation in which Salinas and Colosio were seen as 
bright lights -- have earned the world's confidence. They have had the 
intelligence and foresight to begin to reform a moribund, state-dominated 
economy. They have had the political courage to do it with speed and scope that 
were unprecedented -- and sometimes breathtaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's foreign friends now must show similar farsightedness and courage as 
Salinas and his colleagues try to contain a political crisis that is unique in 
the nation's history. If Salinas' record is any indication, he will move 
decisively to resolve the turmoil. He will need time, but he and his generation 
have come too far, and taken Mexico too far, to turn back now. The United 
States must stand shoulder to shoulder with its good neighbor, helping Mexico 
through a very difficult passage.

ARE SCIENTISTS HARD OF HEARING?; OCEAN PROJECT HAS WHALE LOVERS AND 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS SHOUTING TO BE HEARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A typically modern-day uproar has erupted over a proposal to propagate loud 
underwater sound waves off the Monterey coast as part of an experiment to 
measure global climate change. Fearful the sounds would scare off or even 
deafen whales, hundreds of people have been calling their senators, even as we 
avert eyes from the human homeless on streets and beaches.  
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless the issue deserves scrutiny. Under a program to divert federal 
military money to environmental defense, the Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography in San Diego proposes to place two six-foot-long, barrel-shaped 
vibrators 2,800 feet under the ocean -- one 25 miles off Point Sur in the 
Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and the other off the Hawaiian island of 
Kauai. These deep-sea loudspeakers would issue 20-minute-long low-frequency 
rumbles several times a day at up to 195 decibels. The sounds would be received 
thousands of miles away through the new technique of acoustic thermography. The 
idea is to try to detect any global warning; sound travels faster through warm 
water than cold water. 
</P>
<P>
 Scripps says the sounds would be inaudible to humans on land and would 
represent only a tiny fraction of the sound energy coming from ship traffic, 
not to mention earthquakes and marine animals themselves. "The ocean is a noisy 
place," says David Hyde, project manager, adding that the sound is only a 
little louder than a blue whale's call. 
</P>
<P>
 A challenge has been raised by two sperm whale biologists in Nova Scotia who 
fear that the noise would disrupt the migration, social communication and 
feeding of deep-diving whales, highly dependent on sound for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Scripps concedes the whales would hear the sounds but says the plan includes a 
study of animal behavior: If any harm is detected, Hyde says, the project would 
be halted or changed immediately. The critics counter that whales are 
notoriously hard to study and that any damage, such as gradual deafness, may 
not be recognized until it is too late. They also maintain there are other, 
less intrusive, means of measuring global warming. 
</P>
<P>
 We cannot here adjudicate this scientific dispute. But we urge the National 
Marine Fisheries Service to move cautiously in the permit procedure. First 
public notice of the Monterey Bay plan came only seven weeks ago in an obscure 
item on page 5,177 of the Feb. 3 Federal Register that reported, with a 
deafening split infinitive, an application "to incidentally harass marine 
mammals and sea turtles. . . . " After the uproar the service held an unusual 
public hearing Tuesday and began an environmental assessment. The Monterey Bay 
sanctuary is an important resource, home to 21 species of whale, dolphin and 
other mammals. Scripps wants to start this spring. But some delay may be 
warranted to strengthen safeguards.

NAVAL FACILITIES FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I applaud your coverage of the outcry of nearly 2,000 residents of San Pedro 
against the reuse of Navy surplus housing as a homeless shelter (March 16). It 
is not popular to oppose helping the homeless. Your readers should realize that 
the San Pedro community already has four shelters within two miles of this 
proposed site. Our small bedroom community has more shelters than any other 
portion of Los Angeles. We also have more military housing areas that will be 
subject to the same McKinney Act, which favors homeless institutions above 
other applications for surplus land use. We are fighting to save our community, 
our property and our families' safety. 
</P>
<P>
 We do not oppose helping the homeless. We do oppose being left out of the 
process to determine appropriate use of our neighboring land. 
</P>
<P>
 DANI SAYERS 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Instead of turning over the naval housing on Terminal Island to the homeless, 
it should be turned over to low-income working families. The prime requisite 
being that they must be employed. Perhaps, after living there for a short 
while, they should also be given the opportunity to buy their unit as a condo 
or co-op. This will give the drug-free homeless the opportunity to take a 
low-paying job and still be able to put a decent roof over their families. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I have a serious suggestion to offer to all those kindhearted, unselfish, 
farsighted, charitable citizen property owners and residents living in the 
vicinity of the abandoned Navy housing facility on Taper Avenue in San Pedro, 
who have once again stormed out of the safety of their homes to rally for a 
"good cause" and to protest the proposed conversion of the 27-acre site to a 
center for housing and job training for homeless people. According to the 
report the locals seem to fear a future unbridled invasion by homeless people 
if the project is successful and are united in their belief that their 
community has done all it can and should do to alleviate the homeless problem 
in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 My fellow citizens, you seem to be very disturbed by the prospect of 
"homeless" living within view of you and your families, so what would you all 
think of this: Instead of the proposed housing-educational center, another more 
benign use be made of the site -- a tastefully landscaped cemetery for deceased 
homeless persons.

 * Mayor Richard Riordan's plan to convert Olympic and Pico to one-way 
"super-boulevards" (March 11) is excellent and will significantly reduce 
east-west traffic bottlenecks in the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The various environmentalists and "NIMBYs" arrayed against the plan are 
well-intentioned, but miss the mark.Their continued resistance to improved 
traffic flow throughout the city will not so much encourage Southern 
Californians to use public transportation as induce them to move to Phoenix, 
Denver, Portland and Seattle. Unfortunately those who leave will take their 
businesses (and critical jobs) with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and traffic planners are right to push for conservation and 
a cleaner environment. But their tools should be car-pool lanes and more 
stringent emission standards rather than opposition to the mayor's quite 
sensible suggestions for better traffic flow.

about some "bicycle boulevards" too -- multi-mile residential streets (not 
commercial thoroughfares) dedicated to bicycles, and possibly also mopeds. 
Let's take a lead from our bicycle-aficionado Mayor Riordan, who said in that 
story, "we need to be more innovative."

 * Re your editorial "A Forward Move for RU-486," March 8: "That Roussel Uclaf 
is talking about U.S. distribution is certainly welcome news." Well, I know I 
breathed a big sigh of relief.Now we can abort fetuses in the privacy of our 
own home.  
</P>
<P>
 I am not a member of either the pro-life or pro-choice movement and do not 
consider myself fanatic about the issue of abortion -- it's much too 
complicated and sad an issue. I neither condemn those who choose to have an 
abortion, or those who wish to fight abortion. But let's face it, please: 
Abortion is about ending a human life -- in whatever stage one believes that 
life to be in. It's a very very difficult situation and procedure for anyone. 
The fact that it has been politicized, fragmented and defined as a "women's 
right" surprises and disappoints me. 
</P>
<P>
 And to write that this easier technique is "welcome news" makes my heart 
break. A population that embraces and endorses and practices sexual 
responsibility and education to prevent the need for many abortions would be 
very "welcome news." I think some sensitivity is called for here.

</P>
<P>
 The UC regents, believing that Michael Milken is evil incarnate, have kept a 
$3.3-million gift from him anyway? The regents need only to look in a mirror to 
see who compromised UCLA's integrity. The hypocrisy of the regents' actions 
suggest the problem is not with Milken, but with the embarrassment UCLA faces 
admitting that a university which markets itself as a premier business school 
cannot even negotiate a favorable business contract.These taped lectures are 
marketable only because Milken gave them. Five percent of something is a whole 
lot better than 5% of nothing.

 This violent episode should not obscure or distort what has been happening in

impressive and mostly heartening.Mexico's economy and society have been 
transformed as industry and agriculture, entrepreneurs and workers have all 
been forced to become more competitive. Much remains to be done to improve 
Mexico's economy -- particularly to overcome gross inequities and alleviate 
dire poverty. The next president will also face the challenges of expanding 
domestic markets, reducing trade imbalances, improving rates of national 
investment and attracting more international capital. But Mexico's economic 
progress in recent years has been very significant. 
</P>
<P>
 By the same token, Mexico's governance has lagged behind. Eighty years after a 
revolution fought on the slogan, "Effective suffrage," Mexico in 1994 is still 
very far from achieving truly effective suffrage and equal justice under law 
throughout the national territory. January's uprising in Chiapas and the strong 
national sympathy it has evoked underline these hard facts. 
</P>
<P>
 In significant part because of Chiapas, Mexico's government and political 
parties have been moving toward substantial political reforms to assure 
tranparent and fair elections and to rebuild the legitimacy of Mexico's 
political system. These measures were embraced by Luis Colosio, whose support 
was decisive in moving them from wish lists to negotiated agreements. There 
would be no more fitting tribute to Colosio and no more valuable legacy for 
Salinas than to reinforce and implement these political reforms.

CUT THE CAPITAL-GAINS TAX TO GET MONEY FLOWING AND CREATE JOBS; ECONOMY: 
EVERYBODY WOULD BENEFIT, NOT JUST THE RICH, IF HOME EQUITY, FOR EXAMPLE, COULD 
BE USED TO START NEW SMALL BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID DREIER, David Dreier (R-Covina) is co-chairman of the bipartisan 
bicameral Congressional Zero Capital Gains Caucus and a member of the House 
Rules Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cutting the capital-gains tax is the best way to unlock a flood of cash and 
create private-sector jobs, increase real wages and reduce the federal deficit. 
 
</P>
<P>
 This is critical for California because at 8.7%, statewide unemployment is the 
highest in the nation and 800,000 jobs have vanished in five years. The 60 
largest aerospace firms in Southern California have lost 150,000 jobs alone, 
with 100,000 of those high-paying, high-skill jobs disappearing in Los Angeles 
Country. 
</P>
<P>
 Many laid-off aerospace workers have substantial equity in their homes that 
could be used to start new businesses. But that equity is "locked in" because 
of the capital-gains tax. After discounting for inflation, the real 
capital-gains tax rate facing California homeowners may be as high as 100%. To 
unlock this equity and create new jobs and new tax revenue, Congress should 
immediately allow homeowners to roll over any capital gain that is used to 
start a new business. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress should then dramatically cut the capital-gains tax rate 
across-the-board. In addition to increasing investment and economic growth, 
capital-gains tax reduction will increase worker wages and thus revenue to 
state and local governments. Most important to the Southern California 
aerospace workers who are struggling to adjust to a new era of lower defense 
spending, a capital-gains tax cut will help by increasing capital investments 
that pair new factories with this pool of highly skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the goal of economic policy is to create jobs and increase living 
standards, a zero capital-gains tax would be best. A recent study by the 
Institute for Policy Innovation predicts impressive results in job creation, 
capital formation, economic activity, private-sector wages and government 
revenue. A zero capital gains would result, in the next six years, in an 
additional growth of $1.5 trillion in the total output of the economy's goods 
and services, 1.1 million new private-sector jobs, an $1,884 increase in 
average annual wages for all workers and $25 billion in additional tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Completely eliminating the tax on capital gains might sound far-fetched, but 
it's not a new idea. Back in 1978, when stagflation forced creative thinking, 
Digital Resources Inc. analyzed a zero capital-gains tax. DRI predicted that 
eliminating capital-gains taxes would boost total output, including exports and 
imports, by $200 billion, increase capital formation by $81 billion and create 
3 million new jobs. Just as important from a 1990s perspective, DRI predicted 
that a zero capital-gains tax would increase net tax revenue by $38 billion 
over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve deficit reduction and job creation simultaneously, the best 
approach is to reduce the capital-gains tax rate to 15% and index the rate to 
inflation. The IPI study projects that this would create nearly 1 million new 
jobs, increase domestic goods and services by $1.3 trillion, boost average 
wages by $1,500, create $2.7 trillion in new capital and provide $211 billion 
in additional federal revenues. No other plan can promise comparable 
job-creation and deficit-reduction results. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, as the White House and Capitol Hill begin tackling a new 
budget, job creation is not their top priority. That's because lower 
unemployment rates nationally (never mind that job numbers are much worse than 
just five years ago) have created a sense of complacency and because fiscal 
policy is gridlocked by a perceived trade-off between job creation and adding 
to the federal deficit.  
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom in Washington is that creating jobs will add to the 
deficit and that cutting the deficit will cost jobs. President Clinton's 
first-year economic proposals illustrate his slavish belief in this mistaken 
notion. His $16-billion "stimulus" bill was nothing more than a 
deficit-financed make-work public-sector jobs plan. At the same time, the 
President pushed through a "deficit-reduction" plan that contains the largest 
tax increase in history and will hamper job creation for years.  
</P>
<P>
 These proposals neither solve the problems of high federal deficits and slow 
job creation nor respond to the needs of California. Unfortunately, two things 
stand in the way of the win-win policy of a capital-gains tax cut. First, 
government budget scorekeepers will incorrectly claim that a capital-gains tax 
cut will add to the deficit. Second, capital-gains tax policy is a rhetorical 
weapon of class warfare that liberal Democrats will not easily give up.  
</P>
<P>
 Americans need to be told the truth: job creation and deficit reduction are 
compatible, and the proof lies just a capital-gains tax cut away.

COMMENTARY; PERSPECTIVES ON THE COLOSIO ASSASSINATION; FORGE A TRIUMPH OF LIGHT

 Reports earlier this week had circulated in different quarters about the 
extension of the guerrilla movement beyond the state of Chiapas. The political 
uncertainty involving Luis Donaldo Colosio's campaign prospects and those of 
his companion and rival Manuel Camacho; the threat, in several unpublished 
polls, of an opposition victory emerging; the roller-coaster ride the stock 
exchange was evidently on, without any particularly sensible explanation: This 
series of events showed that the assassination of Colosio did not occur in a 
vacuum.That is what makes it more worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
 The causes will have to be ascertained later. But what is increasingly clear 
is that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his team played sorcerer's 
apprentice: They tinkered with the magical, mysterious procedures of the 
political system built by their predecessors, had them break down, but never 
replaced them with new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The security machinery, the succession mechanism, the loyalties and 
institutions that had guaranteed Mexican stability for so long were obsolete: 
On that count, Salinas was right. But they needed far more than tinkering under 
the hood: a whole new engine, chassis, suspension and wheels were required. 
</P>
<P>
 The modernizing and ambitious young men feared going too far. Because they 
refused to substitute the old ways with new, democratic ones, they are now 
faced with the worst of all possible worlds: the old system in place but out of 
sync and no new system around to keep things rolling.

COMMENTARY; PERSPECTIVES ON THE COLOSIO ASSASSINATION; FORGE A TRIUMPH OF LIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio confronts President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari with the possibility of forging a major democratic breakthrough out 
of tragedy. A new presidential candidate must be named by the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party -- the PRI. The choice is expected to be the president's. 
But he could instead take this opportunity to open the selection process to a 
larger number of voices in the party and in Mexican society. If the outcome is 
the selection of a candidate who can be a true unifying force, an effective 
promoter of Mexico's transition to full democracy as well as a guarantor of 
continuity in the country's recent economic reforms, what happened in Tijuana 
on Wednesday could be transformed from a senseless act of violence to the final 
catalyst -- after Chiapas -- for a great national renewal.  
</P>
<P>
 It is widely known that, within the PRI, Colosio's candidacy for the 
presidency was backed most fervently by elements opposed to deeper political 
reforms that would make elections much more competitive and thus threaten their 
continued hold on power. Colosio's designation as PRI's nominee was seen as a 
major defeat for the "reform" wing of the party, closely identified with Manuel 
Camacho Solis -- former Mexico City mayor, one of the leading presidential 
hopefuls and, since early January, Salinas' unpaid envoy to negotiate a 
peaceful settlement of the Chiapas rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 In sharp contrast to the die-hard, anti-reform elements who seemed to surround 
him, Colosio on many occasions spoke privately about the need to restructure 
his party, to reduce its dependence on corrupt labor and peasant organizations 
and community-level political bosses -- precisely the perpetrators of vote 
fraud, human-rights abuses and economic exploitation who made Chiapas fertile 
ground for the insurrection that finally erupted on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, in accepting the PRI's presidential nomination, Colosio urged his 
party to reject "one single vote" that was obtained through means "outside the 
law." We will never know now how far Colosio, as president, would have gone to 
discipline leaders of his own party who refused to play by new rules of 
democratic competition that are demanded by increasingly large portions of the 
Mexican population. Like his chief political mentor, outgoing President 
Salinas, Colosio may have been unwilling to take the political risks, including 
a Japanese-style split of the ruling party, that translating his reformist 
rhetoric into reality would have posed. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservative forces within the PRI/government apparatus are poised to take 
advantage of the situation created by Colosio's untimely removal from the 
presidential race. They will insist on a tightly controlled selection of their 
version of a "national unity" candidate to replace Colosio, someone who can be 
counted upon to keep the opposition parties "in line," and who can reliably 
deliver to party apparatchiks the public offices and material perks to which 
they have long been accustomed. They will appeal to the Mexican public's deeply 
ingrained conservative impulses: their fear of uncontrolled political violence, 
their thirst for "order" and their belief that strong presidential rule, 
virtually unchecked by legislative or judicial authority, is necessary to keep 
the economy growing and the government running smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 If these reactionary elements prevail, the outlook is for persistent 
election-related turmoil, if not violence, with all the negative consequences 
for investor confidence and advances in social well-being that come with an 
environment of high political conflict and uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican political culture has changed in the last six years. This is 
illustrated by the wave of popular protests unrelated to the rebellion in 
Chiapas that have erupted in many parts of the country since Jan. 1. Among the 
protesters' demands: the removal of corrupt municipal officials, repeal of 
increases in public transport fares, the liberation of "political prisoners" 
arrested for dissident union activities and improvements in low-income housing. 
Any attempt to keep the lid tightly on this caldron of social unrest and 
rapidly rising expectations for greater democracy is likely to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 On the very eve of Colosio's death, the Mexican Congress was approving some of 
the most significant reforms in electoral laws and procedures that have ever 
been proposed by the government and the opposition parties. Still other changes 
that would further equalize the terms of competition and safeguard the 
integrity of the entire voting process may be enacted when the Congress resumes 
its debate, including a more active role for foreign "visitors" (not officially 
recognized observers) in monitoring elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The most fitting tribute to Luis Donaldo Colosio would be the swift and 
unswerving implementation of these changes, backed up by a serious effort to 
cleanse the PRI's own practices and to ensure that those who represent the 
party, at every level, are committed to the kind of election that Colosio knew 
he could win in 1994.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; NOTHING LIKE THE REAL THING; NINETEEN SINGERS AND GROUPS 
TOAST COUNTRY MUSIC AND RHYTHM & BLUES WITH VERY MIXED RESULTS AT THE UNIVERSAL 
AMPHITHEATRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MCA Records' "Rhythm, Country & Blues" on Wednesday at the Universal 
Amphitheatre was a classy, warm, spirited affair that offered a welcome twist 
on the entertainment industry's growing emphasis on career achievement salutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of honoring a single performer, the concert brought together 19 
singers and groups -- from Natalie Cole and Reba McEntire to the Pointer 
Sisters -- to toast two of the richest strains in American pop music: country 
and rhythm & blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding the concept of a recent MCA album of the same title, the idea was to 
show how country and R&B -- though long perceived as appealing almost 
exclusively to white and black audiences, respectively -- have a rich, 
overlapping tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of country music's defining figures, including Jimmie Rodgers and Hank 
Williams, were greatly influenced by the blues, while many soul greats, 
including Ray Charles and Al Green, either drew upon or recorded country songs. 
</P>
<P>
 So it felt quite natural Wednesday when the country and R&B artists joined on 
stage to sing songs from their respective fields, backed by a mixture of rock, 
country and blues musicians led by Don Was, who produced the "Rhythm, Country & 
Blues" album. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the good intentions, the performances themselves didn't always live up 
to the imagination of the concept during the 90-minute set. Not that the 
singers -- including such pairings as Clint Black and the Pointer Sisters on 
"Chain of Fools" and Allen Toussaint and Glen Campbell on "Southern Nights" -- 
were entirely to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to create magic -- or even measure up to the original versions of 
some of the classic songs -- when singers are just doing one or two numbers 
each in a show whose keep-things-moving pacing was dictated by the requirements 
of television taping. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Gill and Gladys Knight -- two of the best voices in contemporary pop -- 
were finished with "Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing" before they seemed even 
warmed up. 
</P>
<P>
 The bigger hurdle was the memory of the original versions. Marty Stuart, 
teaming with the Staple Singers on the Band's "The Weight," proved to be no 
Levon Helm. Patti LaBelle, resorting to her usual histrionics in a duet with 
Willie Nelson on "Crazy," is no Patsy Cline. Mickey Gilley, paired with Ben E. 
King on "Stand by Me," is no Ben E. King. And so forth. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also so little chemistry between surprise guest Bob Dylan and Trisha 
Yearwood on a version of "Tomorrow Night" that you wondered if they had even 
been introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Some moments, however, did work nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole and McEntire were as playful and as comfortable as sorority sisters, 
drawing a standing ovation as they matched each other hot vocal lick for hot 
vocal lick on the old R&B hit "Since I Don't Have You." 
</P>
<P>
 Yearwood, too, proved as effective a vocal partner for Aaron Neville on the 
Patsy Cline hit "I Fall to Pieces" as Linda Ronstadt has on their 
Grammy-winning efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Moore's tribute to the late Conway Twitty, who teamed with him on the 
"Rhythm, Country & Blues" album, was one of the evening's most tender moments. 
He sang "It's Only Make Believe," which was the country star's first national 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
 More than those target moments, however, the real star of the evening was the 
concept itself. The program -- which raised funds for the Country Music 
Foundation and the Rhythm & Blues Foundation -- stands as a challenge to the 
industry to look for other ways to salute the musical traditions that serve as 
the foundation of contemporary pop.

 'Twilight' Does Well in N.Y.: Anna Deavere Smith's revised "Twilight: Los

favorable reviews from New York critics. David Richards of the New York Times 
welcomed "its restless intelligence and passionate understanding" and said, 
"for its appreciation of the singular voice within the howling throng, it will 
be treasured." Jan Stuart of Newsday called it "breathtaking," while Clive 
Barnes of the Post found "genius" in it. Critics for USA Today and Associated 
Press had a few more reservations among their generally favorable reactions. 
Howard Kissel of the Daily News liked Smith's "journalism" but panned the show 
as theater. Correcting an earlier report in these pages, Taper officials said 
21 of the 26 people depicted in the L.A. version of "Twilight" are still in the

MOVIE REVIEW; 'RED ROCK WEST': AN HONEST, STYLISHLY LIKABLE FILM NOIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Dahl's terrific film noir "Red Rock West" brings to mind the Coen 
brothers' "Blood Simple," Carl Colpaert's "Delusion" and his own "Kill Me 
Again" in its clever plotting and wide-open-spaces setting. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also got an admirable something more: a concern for decency, embodied by 
Nicolas Cage's entirely likable Michael. He's so honest that when a friend 
helps him line up a job as an oil-rigger in Wyoming, he blows the chance by 
admitting that he's got a game leg. When stopping for gas in his seedy old 
Cadillac, he resists reaching into an open till for some much-needed cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Temptation a third time around, however, is not exactly a charm. Landing in 
the tiny Wyoming burg of Red Rock, he heads for the local saloon whose 
proprietor (J.T. Walsh) promptly mistakes him for a Dallas hit man, hired to 
rub out his pretty, much younger wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). While it's 
plain to see that Michael is not about to kill anybody, he's in such a moment 
of weakness he can no more resist taking the money any more than he can resist 
Suzanne's offer to double her husband's fee if he spares her.  
</P>
<P>
 Dahl and his co-writer brother, Rick, are endlessly imaginative in coming up 
with escalating plot twists and turns, but each convolution not only heightens 
suspense but also reveals character.  
</P>
<P>
 "Red Rock West," which was rescued from cable through the efforts of San 
Francisco exhibitor Bill Banning, may be a classic B-picture, but it has an 
A-cast, which includes Dennis Hopper as a sly, witty Texan, a man in 
well-tailored all-black Western duds whose folksy drawl proves dangerously 
disarming.  
</P>
<P>
 Cage's naturalness as a nice guy in a big jam lends the film considerable

style to burn.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'D2 THE MIGHTY DUCKS' TAKES ON A MIGHTY BIG CHALLENGE; UNDERDOG 
PEEWEE HOCKEY PLAYERS TAKE ANOTHER SLAP AT GLORY -- BUT SLIP UP IN PURSUIT OF 
THE ORIGINAL'S SUCCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "D2 the Mighty Ducks" isn't nearly as mighty as the 1992 original in which 
hotshot Minneapolis attorney Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) regains his values 
coaching a peewee ice hockey team. "The Mighty Ducks" cleverly managed to have 
it both ways: a movie that suggests winning isn't everything but for sure lets 
its underdogs come out on top. By the finish of "D2" the message seems pretty 
clear: Winning is everything, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of that deservedly successful picture, Bombay and the mother (Heidi 
Kling) of a team member who stands up to him over the issue of cheating to win 
are involved in a budding romance. Logically, any sequel would have to do with 
the flowering of that love, but writer Steven Brill brutally writes her out of 
the script in order to get the Mighty Ducks team back on skates as rapidly as 
possible. Her total absence from the sequel is tossed off as Gordon, on the 
road playing hockey himself in a minor league, nonchalantly remarks on his 
failure to write to her and that her son doesn't see much of his mother now 
that she's remarried. This casual dismissal in the ongoing story of such a 
major, pivotal figure, a caring individual of warmth and strength, starts the 
film out on a sour note. 
</P>
<P>
 Brill, who also wrote the first film, is on to something valid when, a la 
"Rocky II," he deals with the commercialism that engulfs successful athletes; 
you just wish that he had stuck with making this point and developed it fully. 
When an injury sidelines Bombay from the minors just as he's about to make the 
move into the majors, he's in a mood to listen to an offer from Tibbles 
(Michael Tucker), an official sponsor of Team USA, for him to gather up his 
Mighty Ducks, let Tibbles add a few more talented youngsters from around the 
country, and enter an international competition to be held at the brand-new 
Anaheim Arena. The idea is that the coach and kids are to be tempted by the 
sponsor's blandishments -- and the high end of the L.A. lifestyle epitomized by 
Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Such moral concerns come across this time as mechanical and secondary as 
director Sam Weisman piles on the stunts and pranks while the Ducks prepare to 
take on Iceland's Vikings, whose coach (Carsten Norgaard) is so villainous that 
he seems to have stepped right out of a silent melodrama. Despite the 
earnestness and energy Estevez once again brings to Gordon Bombay, "D2" plays 
like a caricature of the original. 
</P>
<P>
 The urge to cash in on a film's success by making a sequel is perfectly 
understandable, but "The Mighty Ducks," by its very concern with values, 
provided a special challenge. In not meeting it by a long shot, "D2 the Mighty 
Ducks" smacks of a sellout. 
</P>
<P>

guidelines: Its language is very mild; its content is suitable for all ages.

MOVIE REVIEW; LOW-BUDGET 'SUTURE' A SCHIZOPHRENIC THRILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The black-and-white low-budget "Suture" is the first feature from San 
Francisco filmmakers Scott McGehee and David Siegel, who have won numerous 
prizes for several of their short films. It's a strange debut: technically 
assured and arty. The assurance is rare for a first feature, the artiness 
isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a psychological thriller without psychological depth. Clay Arlington 
(Dennis Haysbert) meets with his half-brother Vincent (Arthur Towers) at the 
funeral of their wealthy father in Phoenix. The brothers are supposed to share 
an amazing resemblance although -- and here's where the artiness comes in -- 
Haysbert is black and Towers is white. 
</P>
<P>
 The "resemblance" is a joke played straight; it's also meant to clue us to the 
nature of identity, the mysteries of blood ties and all that jazz. When Vincent 
cooks up a scheme to frame his brother for a murder he himself is suspected of, 
the result is something right out of Hitchcock by way of Wim Wenders: Clay, who 
survives an explosion and suffers amnesia, is mistaken for Vincent and 
surgically reconstructed to his brother's likeness. (His post-surgical look is 
the same as his pre-surgical look. Go figure.) Clay, with the help of a 
psychiatrist (Sab Shimono), re-creates a new past for himself -- his brother's. 
</P>
<P>
 McGehee and Siegel draw on many visual and thematic sources besides Hitchcock 
and Wenders -- particularly the John Frankenheimer film "Seconds," which was 
also about a man with post-surgical identity crisis. And yet their style is 
distinctive. They bring a saving humor to this deadpan art piece; they seem 
tickled by the idea of casting a black actor and a white actor as 
near-identical siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they don't really explore the emotional suggestiveness in that casting, 
and so it ends up as a kind of fancy in-joke for aesthetes. McGehee and Siegel 
are filmmakers from the eyes out; they are drawn to the doubling imagery 
because of its emblematic rather than its psychological possibilities. (In a 
film like Ingmar Bergman's "Persona," we got both.)  
</P>
<P>
 They have such a strong and unsettling graphic sense that, without any 
psychological force, the film turns into a kind of abstraction. It could stand 
to be a bit pulpier. Perhaps they were afraid that pulp would turn the movie 
into an extended "Outer Limits" episode? 
</P>
<P>
 The acting is mostly overemphatic and stiff, in the manner of grade D '50s 
sci-fi films, but with an ironic overlay. Example: The plastic surgeon who 
falls in love with Clay, played by "thirty-something's" Mel Harris, is named 
Renee Descartes. That's the kind of joke that plays, maybe, once. Not five 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, McGehee and Siegel have the flair to bring something distinctively new 
to black comedy once they shake out their art-film kinks. "Suture" is the 
archetypal "promising" first feature. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: Unrated. Times guidelines: It includes a fairly graphic 
surgical face reconstruction scene, harsh language and a menacing situation 
with a gun. 'Suture'

HOME TECH / LASER BIN: 'POLYESTER' SMELLS WONDERFUL ON DISC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time to rifle Mom's closet, drag out her favorite pair of spandex 
toreadors, don Dad's chartreuse leisure suit, scrunch down on Gram's favorite 
plastic-covered overstuffed velveteen orange sofa and see how low laser discs 
can go. Or better yet, how high John Waters can rise. 
</P>
<P>
 If everyone's favorite trash director doesn't watch out, he'll give bad taste 
a good name, just by having hooked up with the Criterion Collection, the 
Rolls-Royce of laser discs, to produce a captivating look at his 1981 
"Polyester," complete with two analog audio tracks, a sharp wide-screen 
transfer, archival video material and your own copy of the movies' "first and 
last" Odorama scratch-and-sniff card ($55). 
</P>
<P>
 "Bad taste is universal," the cult director explains about his first real 
mainstream hit. So here you are, authentic, full-fledged Odorama card in hand, 
listening to the kind of audio track that you wish high-purpose, serious 
directors will make explaining their contribution to the fine art of cinema. 
And what do you get? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This cult director sounding just like any real director having a grand time 
explaining just what he and Divine and Tab Hunter & Co. were doing in Baltimore 
unleashing a subterranean view of suburbia on the world. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Polyester' is suburban hell," Waters explains. And watching it again, you 
certainly believe it. Except now, visions of demented dads, salacious teens and 
an odd assortment of bizarre friends and neighbors can be seen weekly, if not 
daily, on this same small-scaled screen. What are "Married . . . With 
Children," "Roseanne," "Hard Copy" and the Menendez brothers, after all, if not 
variations on a Waters' theme? 
</P>
<P>
 But Waters was there first, and his "futile attempt at mainstream 
entertainment," his first R-rated film, with Hunter singing Deborah Harry 
lyrics on the soundtrack, doesn't seem quite so outrageous anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 His more-than off-center view of the world never came about haphazardly. 
"Everything was worked out," he explains. "We don't really improvise much . . . 
it would throw everything off." And improvising would cost too much. Funds were 
so tight that his production manager had to live in the rented house in which 
the film was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, looking back on the film, scene by scene, "all I can see is stuff I wish 
I could change," he laments. Nonetheless, "Thinking it up and just doing it is 
the most fun for me."  
</P>
<P>
 Watching his view of hell ("I love visions of hell, especially visions of 
emotional hell") as the 300-pound Divine turned suburban housewife copes with a 
rather stinking life remains ripe. Especially if you scratch for the proper 
Odoramics -- pizza, new Corvette Leatherette, skunks, flatulence -- when the 
movie cues you. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters does warn that exhibitors who hung onto the unopened cards too long 
couldn't be blamed for thinking skunks, or worse, had taken up permanent 
residence in their warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, Waters bemoans, "the golden age of trash is over because there are no 
more taboos." What's left is hearing and seeing how it all came about, with the 
bonus of Waters on yet another audio track reading from "Shock Value" (on 
out-of-print recordings) and catching "Waters' world" on archival video 
footage.

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: PREACHING THE GOSPEL OF THOMAS A. DORSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much has been written over the years about the great gospel singers, but 
little about the foremost gospel songwriters -- including Thomas A. Dorsey, who 
died last year at age 93. 
</P>
<P>
 When most people hear that name, they probably think of Tommy Dorsey, the 
popular bandleader of the '30s and '40s. But Thomas A. Dorsey was a songwriter 
whose gospel tunes, including "Take My Hand, Precious Lord" and "(There'll Be) 
Peace in the Valley," have been recorded by everyone from Aretha Franklin to 
Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen of his compositions are saluted in "Precious Lord: Recordings of the 
Great Gospel Songs of Thomas A. Dorsey," which has been released in CD by 
Columbia/Legacy's Gospel Spirit label. 
</P>
<P>
 In the liner notes, Tony Heilbut describes Dorsey as gospel's answer to W.C. 
Handy and says he was "perhaps more original than the father of the blues, 
certainly more prolific." By a conservative estimate, he says, Dorsey wrote one 
out of four modern gospel standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey, who was born in Villa Rica, Ga., in 1899, grew up around gospel music 
(his father was a Baptist minister), but he moved to Chicago in his teens and 
joined the blues scene. He toured as a pianist with Ma Rainey and recorded, 
under the pseudonym Georgia Tom, with Tampa Red. 
</P>
<P>
 By his early 30s, however, he had turned his back on blues and concentrated on 
religious songs. One of the reasons for the wide-spread appeal of his music was 
that it wed gospel themes to country and blues musical sensibilities. The 
result was that Dorsey's songs became as popular in white churches as in black 
churches in the '40s and '50s in the segregated South. 
</P>
<P>
 On some of the album's tracks -- especially R.H. Harris' version of "Peace in 
the Valley" -- you can hear early traces of modern soul music. Among the other 
artists featured on the collection: the Dixie Hummingbirds, Marion Williams and 
Bessie Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is Dorsey's voice itself that opens the album -- a recollection of the 
circumstances that led to perhaps his most celebrated song, "Take My Hand, 
Precious Lord." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey was attending a gospel event in St. Louis in 1932 when he learned that 
his wife had died during childbirth in Chicago. Looking for comfort after 
returning home, he sat at a piano and the words of the song simply dropped into 
place: 
</P>
<P>
 "Precious Lord, take my hand  
</P>
<P>
 Lead me on  
</P>
<P>
 Let me stand."  
</P>
<P>
 Other entries in the Gospel Spirit series include the two-disc "The Gospel 
Sound," a survey of black gospel with artists ranging from Mahalia Jackson to 
the Golden Gate Quartet, as well as single-disc packages by such artists as 
Johnny Cash, the Staple Singers and Marion Williams.

TV REVIEW; 'MOSES' MAKES ITS SUBJECT AS ACCESSIBLE AS POSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 According to the biblical record, Moses was a simple shepherd with a speech 
impediment, a reticence to lead, and a fiery temper that flared up when his 
followers became equally reticent. In other words, one of those greats who had 
greatness thrust upon him, as they say. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of Passover, A&E continues its excellent "Ancient Mysteries" series 
with "Mysteries of the Bible: Moses at Mt. Sinai," an accounting of the 
historical basis for Moses' intriguing character and the epic Exodus story. 
</P>
<P>
 Inasmuch as it's possible to provide an extra-biblical account, that is -- for 
as one of the scholars interviewed in this hour points out, desert peoples 
don't leave many traces, and the parched wilderness between Egypt and Canaan 
has yielded few clues for archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the dearth of verifying artifacts and records, then, the academics on 
hand mostly take the Exodus writers at their word and conjecture which 
contemporary landmarks might have been the sites of the ancient events. (Was 
the Red Sea really a big, parted swamp? Will the real Mt. Sinai please stand 
up?) 
</P>
<P>
 Lest the arguments become too arcane, there's also a good amount of 
philosophic focus on just what made the god of the Hebrews demonstrably 
different from competing deities of the time, like Baal. One major departure, 
as set down in the Ten Commandments: "no graven images" -- hence, of course, 
the relative lack of icons for modern diggers to uncover. 
</P>
<P>
 More significant are the differences that continue to affect modern law and 
morality: "God isn't just a god who pays attention to sacrifices and prayer," 
says Rabbi David Wolpe of the University of Judaism. "God cares if I lie to 
you, to another human being, and that's what makes (the developing religion) 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewing a good mixture of Jewish and Christian scholars, achieving a 
healthy balance of belief and skepticism, and offering some terrific Middle 
Eastern scenery besides, "Moses at Mt. Sinai" makes its subject as accessible 
as possible, yet smartly avoids any sense of patronizing the layman. 
</P>
<P>
 Future episodes focus on Jesus in the Galilee (next Friday), Joshua, and Sodom 
and Gomorrah. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Mysteries of the Bible: Moses at Mt. Sinai" at 7 and 11 tonight on A&E.

HAD NO DEALINGS WITH FAILED S&L, CLINTON SAYS; PRESIDENCY: HE ALSO DISTANCES 
HIMSELF FROM WHITEWATER MANAGEMENT AND ASSERTS HE'LL RELEASE LATE '70S TAX 
RETURNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER and JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, in a cool and confident defense of his conduct, declared 
Thursday that he had "nothing to do" with a failed Arkansas thrift institution 
or with the management of the Whitewater real estate venture that have 
bedeviled his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nationally televised press conference, Clinton said he will today release 
his 1977, 1978 and 1979 tax returns to lay to rest questions on the Whitewater 
affair, and he insisted that the matter had not interfered with his efforts to 
reform health care and enact anti-crime legislation and other initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people should know that I and my Administration will not be 
distracted," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton acknowledged that the Whitewater affair had begun to erode his 
popularity among voters but said he was actually surprised that the effect had 
not been worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The press conference came amid a renewed White House effort to dispel 
accusations that the First Family was holding back information on the murky 
Whitewater events. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons are to leave today for a weeklong vacation in Texas and 
California, and the White House did not want to leave an impression that they 
were turning their back on the questions that continue to boil up daily about 
the affair. With his further explanations, the President also hoped to offer 
more support for Democratic lawmakers who must face their constituents during 
the spring break that begins today. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton answered questions for 40 minutes in the East Room -- the majority of 
them on the Whitewater matter -- and made a clear effort to offer the broadest 
defense possible to continuing charges and disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 He disavowed any knowledge of the land venture's management, which he said was 
handled by his business partner, James B. McDougal. He declared he had no 
knowledge of any money from McDougal's Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan flowing 
into either his Arkansas political campaigns or the Whitewater business 
accounts -- two of the chief allegations in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the one new detail, Clinton revised downward his estimate of the amount of 
money he lost in the venture to build vacation homes in the Ozarks. He said he 
now believes that he lost roughly $22,000 less than the $68,900 he has claimed 
for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying he could shed no light on the continuing reports of abuses and 
deceptions, he said, "We didn't keep the books or records. We were essentially 
passive investors," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that when history judges this affair it will shrink to insignificance 
next to what he has accomplished in his first year in office. 
</P>
<P>
 The President looked at ease and smiled frequently, radiating an appearance 
intended to demonstrate his avowed confidence that the allegations will be 
shown to be baseless. 
</P>
<P>
 He also tried to forcefully deny allegations, raised again Thursday by 
Republican Rep. Jim Leach, that the Administration tried to keep federal 
officials from moving toward a criminal investigation of the savings and loan. 
"I have had absolutely nothing to do, and would have nothing to do with any 
attempt to influence an RTC regulatory matter," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach, ranking Republican on the House Banking Committee, released documents 
showing that an RTC official had met with a regional investigator in Kansas 
City on whether Whitewater could be found blameless in Madison Guaranty's 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said Leach had not made accusations about any political appointee of 
the Administration, and asserted that Leach "may be talking about an internal 
dispute within the RTC from career Republican appointees, for all I know." He 
said the people involved were in government before his Democratic 
Administration arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton offered that he overstated his earlier estimate of his losses 
from Whitewater, he said he did not think he would be found liable for 
additional federal income taxes. But he said that if it is determined that he 
has a tax liability, he will pay it. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower figure for losses widens the gap between what Clinton invested and 
lost in Whitewater and what his supposedly equal partners, James and Susan 
McDougal, lost. The Clintons estimate McDougal's loss at about $95,000; 
McDougal says he sunk more than $150,000 into the failed project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons have never explained why the McDougals ate a far greater share of 
Whitewater's losses than the Clintons did, even though the two couples were 
supposed to be 50-50 partners in the deal's profits or losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that he changed his estimate of his Whitewater losses after 
discovering that $20,700 in payments he thought were made on Whitewater loans 
actually went to help buy a cabin for his mother and stepfather. He said he was 
reminded of this when proofreading the manuscript of his late mother's 
autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed that she mentioned there something that I had genuinely forgotten, 
which is that I helped her to purchase the property and what was then a cabin 
on the place that she and her husband, Dick Kelly, lived back in 1981, and that 
I was a co-owner of that property with her for just a few months," Clinton 
said. "After they married, he bought my interest out." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he made an additional $1,500 payment for the Kelley property that 
he had earlier attributed to Whitewater losses. That sum has been subtracted 
from his previous estimate of losses from the land deal, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) immediately said Clinton had been 
"credible" and had "helped himself" with his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he expected special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. to question both 
him and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, about their investments, and he 
promised they would "cooperate with him in any way he decides is appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also said he would cooperate with congressional hearings, and did not 
rule out the possibility that he would testify in Congress on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton held back-to-back news conferences during office hours two weeks ago, 
and Hillary Rodham Clinton has also fielded questions on the matter this month, 
though her responses dealt with her feelings about the matter rather than 
details of the family's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides have indicated that they would not be unhappy if Thursday's press 
conference left an impression that while the press was preoccupied with 
Whitewater, the President was eager to get on with the people's business. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Whitewater related events have continued to bubble each day in 
Washington, Clinton clearly faces a deepening public relations challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 An ABC News-Washington Post poll indicated Clinton's job approval rating has 
slipped 11 points in less than a month and fallen below 50% for the first time 
this year. A new poll from the Time Mirror Center for the People & the Press 
found 67% holding the view that the Clintons were guilty of some wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton defended his initial investment in Whitewater as "perfectly honorable 
. . . perfectly legal." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that we did anything wrong in that at all, and I think we 
handled it in an appropriate way," the President said. "We were like a lot of 
people; we invested money and we lost." 
</P>
<P>
 And he staunchly defended his wife's role as a lawyer for the failed thrift 
when it was seeking state approval of sell preferred stock to shore up its 
shaky capital position. He cited a New York University law professor as calling 
Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison Guaranty within the bounds of legal 
ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton noted that Mrs. Clinton took no money from her law firm for work done 
with the state of Arkansas, saying she "wanted to bend over backward to avoid 
the appearance of conflict" of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton bristled and rose to his wife's defense when asked whether the 
Whitewater affair had eroded his wife's moral authority to speak for the 
Administration on health care reform and other issues.  
</P>
<P>
 "People should not be able to raise questions and erode people's moral 
authority in this country. There ought to have to be evidence and proof," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in her 20 years of practicing law, her ethics and ability have 
never before been questioned.

 POLITICAL FALLOUT: The assassination of leading Mexican presidential candidate 
has shaken the White House and Wall Street (D1). The potential setback in 
political reforms is also being mourned on the streets in Oxnard. . . . "I've 
had a lot of people come by my office who feel that it has been a terrible loss 
for Mexico," said Armando Lopez, an Oxnard business consultant who advises 
Mexico's ruling political party. "Mexican politics has been a subject of 
intense debate in Oxnard for some time," he said. "Now, there's a lot of 
sadness."

 SHAKING FISTS: Fearing an outbreak of fights among student athletes, some high 
school principals in Ventura County have banned the time-honored tradition of 
the postgame handshake (A1) . . . . The ban was adopted in the Marmonte League 
after a basketball player threw a punch following a Camarillo-Thousand Oaks 
game. "It's a tragedy we have to be concerned about kids punching somebody 
out," said umpire Chuck Eskew. But a handshake ban, he said, defeats "using 
athletics to teach sportsmanship and fair play."

 A FISH STORY: Nine juvenile steelhead trout have been captured heading down

Cardenas. He races out every morning to examine the 6- to 9-inch smolts at the 
Freeman Diversion Dam. He's particularly excited to find year-old fish heading 
out to sea, evidence that adults made their way up the dam's "fish ladder" last 
year.

 HOT PROPERTY: Allans Wine and Lotto could never be accused of false 
advertising for its storefront sign: "Millionaire Launch Pad Starts Here." The 
Port Hueneme store just sold a state lottery ticket worth $12.6 million. When 
the ticket is claimed, it'll be the store's sixth millionaire, says owner Glenn 
Sanders. . . . "People think it is a lucky store," he said. But Sanders knows 
better. "It is the volume." Regular customers, from as far away as Santa 
Barbara and Fillmore, push sales to $20,000 a week.

STRONG STORM LANDS ITS FIRST PUNCH IN REGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A powerful Arctic storm moved inland over Southern California on Thursday, and 
officials warned of mudslides in burn areas, severe thunderstorms in the 
coastal valleys, urban flooding and gale-force winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain falling at a rate of more than half an inch an hour was reported in Santa 
Barbara County as the main force of the storm headed for the Los Angeles area. 
Heavy snow was falling in the mountains, threatening to block some of the main 
highways to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Gale-force winds were recorded in several areas, and strong gusts on the 
Westside shorted out power lines during the afternoon, cutting electrical 
service to about 2,400 customers. Fire officials said a small tornado touched 
down briefly in Santa Barbara, flattening a structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said there would probably be some heavy downpours and hail the 
size of walnuts in Los Angeles County before the storm begins to ease sometime 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be nasty," said Debra Rominger, a National Weather Service 
forecaster. "It's a pretty strong one." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspector Rick Moreno, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department, 
said the hardest-hit areas "probably will be those that burned in last fall's 
firestorms. We have no idea how bad it's going to be. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno said fire personnel were at the ready throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've beefed up our forces," he said. "We've deployed extra search-and rescue 
people and several swift-water rescue teams. We want to anticipate the worst." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pasadena Glen area -- where several homes were invaded by mudslides in 
February after brush fires destroyed dozens of homes and stripped hillsides of 
vegetation last fall -- most of the residents left their homes Thursday 
afternoon rather that wait for the mudslides they were sure were coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Barriers were in place -- many of them heavy wooden walls anchored to sturdy 
steel poles that county flood control crews had erected to divert the 
anticipated runoff away from the homes and into newly paved flood-control 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a lot more we can do," Bob Dean, a federal soil conservationist, 
said Thursday afternoon as the first scattered drops began falling from the 
rapidly darkening sky. "We're kind of sitting here now, waiting to be of 
assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Paul, a 65-year-old retiree who lives with his dog, Biff, in an 18-foot 
trailer on the lot where his house burned to the ground last fall, sounded a 
philosophical note. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to stay up on the hill and watch it all fly by," Paul said. 
"I've lived up here for 37 years. It gets exciting at times. We get to see a 
lot of nature, only sometimes nature goes on a rampage." 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, another area where disastrous brush fires during the fall were 
followed my destructive mudslides in February, emergency crews and residents 
did last-minute checks of sandbag barriers, wooden barricades and storm drains 
as the storm approached. 
</P>
<P>
 At Big Rock Drive and Pacific Coast Highway, one of the worst-hit areas during 
previous storms, city employees inspected a new six-foot drainage pipe that is 
expected to handle most of the runoff from the denuded hills above. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulldozers stood ready along Las Flores Canyon Road, another area hit hard in 
February's storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Maurice, a spokeswoman for the city of Malibu, said the city notified 
residents to prepare for another storm, but added: "We don't want them to have 
a false sense of security, because a fire or sheriff official probably won't 
come knocking on their door to tell them to get out. If they feel they are in 
danger, they probably are and should just get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Such warnings are old hat in Malibu, where most residents prefer to stick it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Spack, who lives midway up Big Rock Drive, and was undaunted by the 
thrashing rain that hit by about 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're keeping our fingers crossed, but the city got all the drains in and did 
some hydro-seeding so I am feeling pretty safe about it," Spack said. "But if 
it's more than 3 inches of rain, we're all gonna float to the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said as much as three 
inches of rain is expected to fall in the coastal valleys and along the 
foothills before the storm moves out to the east, probably sometime Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there is a slight possibility of even more rain than that if the cold 
storm from the Gulf of Alaska hooks up with a broad band of subtropical 
moisture currently stretching from Hawaii to Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it doesn't look like that's going to happen, but it could," Thoren 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service said the storm -- unusually cold for this time of 
year -- probably will drop between a foot and two feet of snow in the San 
Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains by Saturday night. The snow level in some 
of the northern ranges is expected to dip as low as 2,500 feet -- about the 
elevation of the floor of the Antelope Valley.

PRESIDENT MOVES TO SHOW SKEPTICS HE'S COOPERATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, his credibility sinking fast in the Whitewater controversy, 
Thursday sought to convince a skeptical public that he has nothing to hide, 
fielding still more questions about the failed real estate development and 
pledging to fully cooperate with inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton declared that he had already provided special counsel Robert B. Fiske 
Jr. with tax returns and 14,000 documents and made available every 
Administration witness he has sought. The President also said he will release 
his tax returns dating back to 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 However, opinion polls show that continuing reports of alleged Whitewater 
improprieties and the President's efforts in the past to divert attention from 
the controversy have left a strong public impression of a cover-up that his 
assurances may have done little to dispel. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton complained that the public is not aware he is fully cooperating. He 
seemed resigned to seeing Whitewater continue as a major controversy that he 
would have to confront while going "back to work doing what I was hired to do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the steady drumbeat of daily Whitewater stories," declared a 
senior Clinton aide shortly before the press conference, "we haven't been able 
to break through to the national audience and convince them we are cooperating 
with the special counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton scheduled the press conference as new polls showed Whitewater 
seriously eroding his popular support. A Times Mirror poll released Thursday 
showed about two-thirds of Americans of all political stripes -- 73% of 
Republicans, 67% of Independents and 59% of Democrats -- believe Clinton and 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton are guilty of at least some wrongdoing. Only 
15% believe they are guilty of serious offenses, while 52% said they think the 
Clintons are guilty of only minor offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, which a senior Clinton aide called stunning, also showed that 52% 
believe the White House has covered up information damaging to the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 The President insisted time and again that he has fully cooperated in the 
Whitewater investigation and said that he and Mrs. Clinton are prepared to 
answer all questions by the special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely has a sitting President been questioned in a criminal investigation but 
Clinton said he would cooperate with Fiske "in whatever way he decides is 
appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration sources suggested that Fiske would take a deposition from both 
Clintons. A special counsel took a deposition from President Jimmy Carter in 
1980 in an investigation that cleared Carter and his brother, Billy, of any 
wrongdoing in connection with Billy Carter's dealings with Libya. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, hoping to stabilize a presidency badly shaken by Whitewater, also 
insisted at his press conference that, despite all the media attention, the 
controversy has not interfered with the Administration's pursuit of a heavy 
agenda of domestic and foreign issues. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that away from the media spotlight it is business as usual for 
health care reform and other issues and that "our Administration is preoccupied 
with the business we were sent here to do for the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the White House has continued to work on health care and other major 
issues. But the Times Mirror poll, conducted March 16-21 among 2,001 adults, 
showed that 81% of Americans think the controversy is disrupting the 
government's effectiveness. The poll had an error margin of plus or minus 2 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton aides privately have acknowledged that Whitewater has demoralized 
the President's staff, absorbed much of its time and energy, and distracted it 
from work on health care reform and other major issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a happy place to be these days and it's not just political, it's 
personal," said one aide. "People are getting hurt and and seeing their friends 
subpoenaed and put on the griddle." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton could find comfort in one category of the Times Mirror poll -- that 
55% of Americans believe the media are paying too much attention to Whitewater. 
But the way he was bombarded with Whitewater questions at the press conference 
left little doubt that there will be no letup in media attention to the 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 People at the White House, said one official, "are resigned to the fact that 
there seems to be no end to Whitewater, it'll just go on and on and on and 
we'll just have to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, speaking forcefully, repeatedly sought to convince the public that he 
already has been fully cooperative with the special counsel and cited comments 
from respected public figures who agree: Sam Dash, who served as counsel for 
the Senate Watergate Committee during the scandal that dogged the Richard Nixon 
Adminstration, and Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), who served on that 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Dash, he said, "contrasted our conduct with previous presidents and said we 
had been highly ethical."  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton quoted Inouye as saying: "I've been experienced in these 
investigations. You folks have claimed no executive privilege. You've fully 
cooperated. No one can quarrel with that." 
</P>
<P>
 The President obviously was perturbed by his plunge in the polls. After rising 
to the high 50s earlier in the year, he has dropped to the mid-40s in the 
latest surveys. But he said that, after reading reports that the media devoted 
three times as much coverage to Whitewater as to health care, "I'm amazed that 
there hasn't been more change in the polls." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing to the audience outside the Washington Beltway, he frequently jabbed 
at the press during the conference and said: "I think what the American people 
are really upset about is the thought that this investment that we made 16 
years ago (in Whitewater) that lost money that did not involve savings and 
loans might somehow divert any of us from doing the work of the country -- 
getting the economy going. . . . "

FLA. JURY URGES DEATH FOR KILLER OF 5 COLLEGE STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took a jury only one vote Thursday to decide that serial killer Danny 
Harold Rolling should be sentenced to death for a string of gruesome sex 
murders that terrorized this college town four years ago, a juror said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's only other option was to sentence Rolling to life in prison. 
Circuit Judge Stan R. Morris will hear comments from Rolling and receive 
written statements from the victims' families on Tuesday before deciding 
whether to impose the jury's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling, a 39-year-old drifter from Shreveport, La., pleaded guilty Feb. 15 to 
five counts of first-degree murder. He clenched his teeth when the verdict was 
read and stared at each juror as they were polled. He appeared to blink away 
tears several times. 
</P>
<P>
 In closing arguments Wednesday, the prosecutor portrayed Rolling as a 
calculated killer; his public defender said Rolling was mentally ill and had 
endured years of physical and emotional abuse from his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Diaz, one of the jurors, said the nearly 5 1/2 hours of deliberations 
were difficult. "As horrific as what he did was, he is still a life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, she said, the jury only took one vote -- and it was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all cried when we took the vote and heard the word 'death' over and over. 
It was not a task we took lightly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury heard more than two weeks of testimony about the slayings, 
mutilations and rapes of the students; Rolling's family life and childhood; his 
mental health; and tapes of Rolling's confessions and songs he has written. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of Rolling's five victims said they were pleased with the verdict, 
but fear their suffering will be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to be haunted with the fear that people will remember this 
killer, even glorify him for the slaughter of our children," they said in a 
statement read in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The college students were slain in their off-campus apartments in August, 
1990, just before the fall semester. Rolling beheaded one of his victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Gladys Taboada, the mother of victim Manuel Taboada, wept at the verdict. Her 
son was stabbed 31 times. "It has not ended," she said. "It will never end."

GIULIETTA MASINA; FELLINI'S WIDOW, STAR OF 'LA STRADA,' 'NIGHTS OF CABIRIA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Giulietta Masina, the wife and leading lady of the late movie director 
Federico Fellini, died Wednesday. She was 74. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Masina was being treated for a tumor at the Columbus Clinic, where she 
had been admitted in October, the hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wide-eyed actress appeared in some of Fellini's best-known films, 
including "La Strada," "The Nights of Cabiria" and "Juliet of the Spirits." 
</P>
<P>
 She returned to the screen in 1985 after an absence of almost 20 years to star 
with Marcello Mastroianni in Fellini's "Ginger and Fred." 
</P>
<P>
 Fellini died in October after a stroke, and a badly shaken Miss Masina was 
hospitalized for exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 Her best-known role was as Gelsomina, the haunting waif who became the 
exploited companion of circus strongman Anthony Quinn in "La Strada," which won 
the Oscar as best foreign film in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Masina, born near Bologna, was the daughter of a schoolteacher, and began 
acting with a university drama group. She got her first break in 1942, starring 
on an Italian radio show in a play written by Fellini, who was a fellow 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 They were married the following year and remained inseparable until Fellini's 
death Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 She made her film debut in a bit part in Roberto Rossellini's "Paisa" in 1946. 
Two years later, Miss Masina won the Italian critics award as best supporting 
actress for her role in Alberto Lattuada's "Without Pity." 
</P>
<P>
 She won the Cannes Film Festival best actress award for her role as a 
prostitute in "The Nights of Cabiria" in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Masina is survived by a sister, Mariolina. The funeral was scheduled for 
today at Rome's Church of the Artists, news agencies said.

SAMUEL TIBBITTS; FOUNDED GROUP HEALTH CARE PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Samuel J. Tibbitts, a nationally recognized Southern California health care 
expert who created innovative cost-curbing group health delivery systems, has 
died. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Tibbitts died in his sleep Sunday in his Burbank home. 
</P>
<P>
 He was chairman of the board of the nonprofit UniHealth America, which he had 
headed since he helped create it in 1988 by merging his Lutheran Hospital 
Society of Southern California and HealthWest. 
</P>
<P>
 Tibbitts also founded PacifiCare Health Systems, one of the nation's first 
major health maintenance organizations, and was a vice chairman of the 
organization at the time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Tibbitts also was a founder and chairman of American Healthcare Systems, a 
group of 32 hospital systems across the country that founded the nation's first 
preferred provider system, PPO Alliance, based in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Tibbitts was a former chairman of the American Hospital Assn., and former 
president of the California Hospital Assn., the Hospital Council of Southern 
California and Lutheran Hospital Society of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than any other person, Sam Tibbitts has shaped and guided the evolution 
of health care over the past 40 years," said Stephen W. Gamble, Tibbitts' 
successor as president of the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The author of more than 100 articles on health care, Tibbitts served as 
commissioner of the national Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals and 
was vice chairman of Blue Cross of Southern California. He was a delegate to 
the White House Conference on Aging and an adviser to former Gov. Ronald Reagan 
and President Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tibbitts' awards were the gold medal of the American College of 
Healthcare Executives, the meritorious service award of the American Hospital 
Assn., the leadership in health affairs award of the Hospital Council of 
Southern California and the award of merit of the California Assn. of Hospitals 
and Health Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 UniHealth America gave him its Pinnacle Award, inscribed: "For his passionate 
concern for the human family and a lifetime contribution toward the enrichment 
of the nation's health care community." 
</P>
<P>
 Tibbitts earned a bachelor's degree in public health at UCLA and a master's 
degree in public health and hospital administration at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 He began his administrative career at California Hospital Medical Center, 
which in June renamed its patient care facility Tibbitts Tower in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Audrey; two sons, Scott and Brett, and four 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services are scheduled for 1:30 p.m. today at the Hall of Liberty, 
Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the UniHealth 
America Foundation, 4100 W. Alameda Ave., Burbank, Calif. 91505.

MURIEL MORSE; EX-CITY PERSONNEL MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Muriel M. Morse, former general manager of personnel for the city of Los 
Angeles and an internationally prominent community volunteer, has died. She was 
80. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Morse, who was named a Times Woman of the Year in 1961 for her 
outstanding public and community service, died Tuesday at Huntington Memorial 
Hospital in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 She served as Los Angeles personnel manager from 1965 until her retirement in 
1978. Mrs. Morse joined the city department in 1939 under Mayor Fletcher 
Bowron, and for many years was one of the highest-ranking women in local 
government in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 After she retired from city government, Gov. George Deukmejian appointed Mrs. 
Morse as the public member of the five-member state Industrial Welfare 
Commission, which regulates the minimum wage in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Morse served for 20 years on the personnel commission for Los Angeles 
County schools. 
</P>
<P>
 She also had a distinguished record as a volunteer, serving as president of 
the Soroptimist Federation of the Americas in 1971, Soroptimist International 
in 1976, and the International Personnel Management Assn. in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, she was president of the Women's Division of the Los Angeles Chamber 
of Commerce, where she organized a community service training program for young 
women. She was also president of the Visiting Nurses Assn. of Los Angeles, the 
Phi Beta Kappa Alumni in Southern California and the Soroptimist Club of Los 
Angeles, and had been active in Business and Professional Women. She worked for 
United Way of Greater Los Angeles for more than 40 years and last year received 
its Special Volunteer Award for her service to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Service is not just the task of finding human needs and giving our time, 
talent and money in improving conditions of our fellow men," Mrs. Morse said in 
1969, addressing a group of volunteers. "We must recognize their individual 
dignity, their special talents, their own responsibility and our mutual goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Helping others demands a sharp self-awareness, which permits us to 
acknowledge an individual and to receive as well as to give. Individuals, 
regardless of circumstances, have as great a need to help as they have for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Service work," she said, "must be in meaningful projects worthy of a woman's 
interest, abilities and imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 Muriel Moreton was born in Stony Point, N.Y. She moved to Santa Monica with 
her family as a teen-ager and graduated from Santa Monica High School. She went 
on to Stanford University where she earned a bachelor's degree, magna cum 
laude, in 1934 and was a member of the honor society Phi Beta Kappa. She 
received a master's degree from Stanford in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 At Stanford, she also met her husband, former Southern California Edison 
executive Barnard A. Morse, whom she married in 1935. The couple lived on his 
family's Altadena estate, built in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her work for the city and volunteer organizations, Mrs. Morse 
taught such subjects as collective bargaining, labor relations and personnel 
management at Stanford, Caltech and USC. She was also president of Scapa 
Praetor, the support group for the USC School of Public Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Morse avidly pursued her hobbies of trout fishing and growing cymbidium 
orchids. "Anyone interested in intellectual pursuits," she said in 1984, "also 
ought to get their hands in the soil." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her husband, Mrs. Morse is survived by two sons, Robert of 
Monarch Beach, Calif., and Barnard Jr. of Edmonds, Wash.; a brother, Douglas 
Moreton of Wickenberg, Ariz., and nine grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is scheduled for 1 p.m. Saturday at St. Mark's Episcopal 
Church in Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to the Muriel 
Morse Endowed Fellowship at the USC School of Public Administration or to the 
Visiting Nurses Foundation of Los Angeles.

<P>
 Two Russian nuclear submarines grazed each other during an exercise in the 
northern Barents Sea without causing damage or casualties, the Russian navy 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both boats returned to base after the accident Wednesday, the navy's press 
service said in a short statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The ITAR-Tass news agency said the two submarines had nuclear weapons aboard. 
The navy said the submarines, along with their weapons, sustained no damage and 
there were no radiation leaks.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: RIVAL'S GUN TRAINING SESSION WILL FEATURE POTSHOTS AT 
ROBERTI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWAD; CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, ; ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 GUNPLAY: A Canoga Park gun store owner has moved his campaign to unseat state 
Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys) onto the shooting range by offering free 
firearm-safety seminars.  
</P>
<P>
 Randy Linkmeyer, 37, owner of Art's Guns, said the seminars are designed as a 
public service but conceded that he intends to campaign at the April 2 events, 
saying he would seek "to use them to my advantage politically." 
</P>
<P>
 The recall has been largely organized and influenced by gun-rights activists 
who have targeted Roberti because of a law he authored in 1989 banning the 
future sale of military-style semiautomatic weapons and requiring the 
registration of those already legally owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Linkmeyer said the seminars are a public service and that he does not intend 
to report the costs as in-kind contributions to his campaign. No mention of 
Linkmeyer's candidacy is made in the ad, which reads: "Randy Linkmeyer Presents 
Family Firearm Safety Day." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad also promises that $10,000 in prizes will be awarded to participants 
who also buy winning $5 lottery tickets. The gun store owner said the prizes 
may include weapons.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Linkmeyer this week also challenged Roberti, who is the target of 
an April 12 recall election, to explain how his views square with those of 
Handgun Control Inc., an organization that is currently operating a phone bank 
to urge voters in Roberti's 20th District to vote against the recall and whose 
leader, Sarah Brady, recently was the featured speaker at a Roberti 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "I challenge Roberti to be honest with the people," Linkmeyer said in an 
interview. "Roberti's agenda on gun control has to be more far-reaching (than 
banning assault rifles), otherwise, why would Handgun Control be supporting 
him?" 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti has insisted that he is a moderate on gun-control issues and 
recognizes the right of citizens to own firearms -- but not "weapons of war," 
as he has characterized the weapons banned under his 1989 statute. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 FIRING BACK: For his part, Roberti has once again trotted out assault weapons 
at yet another news conference to highlight either his fight against the recall 
or his crusade to ban high-powered, military-style guns. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one way to catch the eye of television cameras, at least. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday in Sacramento, Roberti did it again. This time, the Van Nuys Democrat 
was trying to send a message to Assembly members to pass his bill banning 
high-capacity ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a written statement, the bill, if passed, would make California 
the first state in the nation to ban "mass-murder ammunition clips" that allow 
assailants to fire more than 15 times without stopping to reload. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti says he is five or six votes short of the 41 he needs for the bill -- 
which has already passed the Senate -- to pass the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching that goal might be tough, however, because of the opposition from the 
state's No. 1 law-enforcement officer, Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
 In a September, 1993, letter distributed by gun-rights supporters, Lungren 
told Roberti that his bill "holds little promise" of actually banning the ammo 
clips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our office would be pleased to support tightly crafted legislation that will 
actually remove these magazines from circulation and use," Lungren wrote. 
"Regrettably, your bill in its present form, does not do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti concedes that in order to get the bill out of an Assembly committee, 
he had to agree to add a so-called "plinker amendment" to the measure. The 
clause exempts people who shoot guns legally for sport at target ranges. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Lungren pointed out, Gian Luigi Ferri of Woodland Hills was 
just such a "plinker" before shooting up law offices in San Francisco last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Roberti: "I respect the attorney general's opinion. My only suggestion to 
him is to get us a couple of Republican votes and we'll take the amendment 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 More politics as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A PRIVILEGED POST: No one would ever accuse Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead 
(R-Glendale) of being a legislative powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The affable Moorhead is a plodding, behind-the-scenes player who has tended to 
focus on such arcane issues as protecting patents and copyrights and opening up 
electric transmission grids to independent and renewable energy producers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorhead -- who was first elected to Congress in 1972 and was among 
President Richard Nixon's staunchest Judiciary Committee defenders against 
impeachment -- has moved up the Republican ranks through longevity. Despite the 
reservations of some colleagues about whether he was a tough enough partisan, 
last year Moorhead became ranking Republican on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, which handles a wide range of legislation, including health-care 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Moorhead, 71, finds himself in the enviable position of being in line to 
become the senior Republican on two House committees. Rep. Hamilton Fish Jr. 
(R-N.Y.), the leading Republican on Judiciary, has announced he will not seek 
reelection this year, leaving Moorhead next in ascendancy. But Republican rules 
limit members to a single ranking post at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming he's reelected to a 12th term in November, Moorhead insists he's 
staying put. Happily. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Commerce committee is a much more active committee," the veteran 
conservative said this week. "I intend to stay with Commerce." 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, it's too early to say if Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who is 
slated to become the new minority leader, will encourage a switch. Gingrich 
warned ranking members this month that seniority alone won't be enough to 
retain their leadership posts in the next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.), a more forceful figure who halfheartedly 
opposed Moorhead for the coveted Commerce ranking slot last year, declined 
through a spokesman to comment on prospects for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorhead's intent is shared by another influential colleague. Rep. Henry 
J. Hyde (R-Ill.), third in line on Judiciary, said: "I expect to be ranking 
member of Judiciary."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; IN SEARCH OF BETTER DEPUTY TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office at last has released evidence in 
the fatal shooting of a sheriff's deputy by a fellow deputy during an impromptu 
training session on Christmas Day.  
</P>
<P>
 When the Orange County Grand Jury recently decided to go against the district 
attorney's advice to indict in the case, questions were left unanswered.The 
district attorney's release of the information is, of course, better late than 
never. Although the public still does not know why the grand jury refused to 
indict, at least it now has its clearest portrait yet of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, some of the information suggests why training exercises need to be 
conducted in a calm and emotion-free environment. An interview with Sheriff's 
Deputy Brian P. Scanlan, the field training officer who fatally shot Deputy 
Darryn L. Robins, revealed that he had been agitated earlier over what he 
considered a botched California Highway Patrol stop of car theft suspects in 
which sheriff's deputies acted as backup. And then there was that loaded 
weapon, an appalling and still unexplained breach of department policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Brad Gates says a department review of training procedures has 
recommended the "reinforcement" of regulations. Clearly, the evidence shows 
that is needed. Scanlan remains on paid administrative leave pending a 
departmental inquiry, and his future remains to be decided. But whoever is 
conducting training for the department in the future needs to do so in a 
measured environment where department standards are adhered to.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: THOUSAND OAKS STILL TOUGH ON HARDWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dunk it or spike it? Seven of the 12 players on the unbeaten Thousand Oaks 
volleyball team have made the transition from basketball look easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Hartman, the Ventura County basketball player of the year who has signed 
to play for Washington, is a 6-foot-7 middle blocker for the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also playing both sports are Paul Brandt, Mike Friel, Sam Parmalee, Jeff 
Nowak, Ricky Furino and David Grimm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers (6-0) scored the biggest victory in the history of the program by 
upsetting Royal, the top-ranked team in Division II, in five games Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was Royal's first in league play in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders, in fact, had won 66 consecutive matches, never even losing a 
game during that time. MARMONTE LEAGUE

 Playing the Triangle 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the Newbury Park baseball team is a little like watching volleyball. 
After a sideout, rotate. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Smith, Ray Clinton and Matt Cassaro form an interesting triangle. When 
Smith pitches, Clinton plays third and Cassaro plays shortstop. When Clinton 
pitches, Cassaro plays third and Smith plays shortstop. FOOTHILL LEAGUE

 Out of Nowhere 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon High boys' volleyball Coach Ardyce Masters counts herself lucky that 
Pat Backes wasn't a star baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
 Backes played junior varsity baseball as a freshman and sophomore, but when he 
failed to make the varsity as a junior, he gave up the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 This winter the 6-foot-4 senior, who was an accomplished volleyball player in 
his church league, decided to try out for the Canyon volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters had never heard of Backes before this season. Now, he is one of her 
starting middle blockers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call him our gift," she said. "I said, 'Where were you for the past three 
years?' I was shocked -- he's a great player." 
</P>
<P>
 Backes is among the top three players in kills and blocks and helped Canyon 
win its first five matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were missing a middle blocker, so he just filled a massive hole in the 
team," Masters said. "We're an exceedingly complete team with him." WEST VALLEY

 Let's Skip the First 
</P>
<P>
 Taft has started well despite not starting well -- the Toreadors are 4-3 but 
have a nasty habit of surrendering too many runs in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft pitchers have allowed four, four, six, and eight runs in various first 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first-inning blues, I guess," Coach Rich McKeon said. "If we can get 
out of the first inning without giving up a ton of runs we seem to settle down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to solve that mystery right now." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Harry Kenoi, Chatsworth's No. 2 starter last season and a key player in the 
team's drive to the City Section 4-A Division final, has not pitched this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior right-hander has been sidelined by a sore right deltoid muscle. 
Coach Tom Meusborn said there is no telling when Kenoi, who was 6-1 with a 2.36 
earned-run average last season, will recover.

<P>
 But Meusborn has been encouraged with the progress of junior Fred Farzaneh, 
who earned his first victory by beating Roosevelt last week in the Sylmar 
tournament final. "He gets better each time he throws," Meusborn said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Struggling out of the gate has been Chatsworth shortstop Bryan LaCour, who has 
signed with Stanford and was a Times' All-Valley selection last season after 
hitting .446 with 16 doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 After five games, LaCour was hitting only .273. More tellingly, the team lost 
twice and the senior began pressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been trying to carry the team on his back," Meusborn said. "He lives and 
dies with every mistake, and you can't do that. That stuff eats at him." 
</P>
<P>
 Meusborn was encouraged by LaCour's performance last week, when he had four 
hits -- including three doubles -- in 11 at-bats. Chatsworth won all three of 
its games. FRONTIER LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Scouts in Ojai 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff's baseball team won only three games last season and, frankly, Coach 
Steve Blundell wondered if the 1994 team would be much better. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rangers are 4-3-1, thanks mainly to defense (only four errors in seven 
games) and pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior left-hander Mike Walsh is 3-1, and sophomore right-hander Ben Blanton 
has two saves and an ERA of 0.60. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nine years Blundell has lived and worked in Ojai, no Nordhoff player 
has been drafted, but during the first inning of the Rangers' 1-0 loss to 
Moorpark last week, a St. Louis Cardinal scout entered the dugout and 
introduced himself. Walsh proceeded to throw a two-hitter in the losing cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew he had hidden talent," Blundell said of Walsh. "He's got a strong arm 
and we're teaching him a split-finger curve. It's just a building process." 
CHANNEL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Got Any Change? 
</P>
<P>
 You almost expected to see the Rio Mesa hitters digging into their pockets for 
more quarters. But they weren't hitting against a pitching machine, just Oxnard 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans won, 16-0, Tuesday and banged out 20 hits. Four players -- Steve 
Arneson, Chad Snyder, Eric Flores and Vince Roman -- each had four hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Arneson drove in five runs. Snyder also drove in three runs. Roman hit a home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching runners circle the bases is becoming all too familiar for Oxnard 
pitchers. Just two games earlier, they allowed 18 runs against Channel Islands. 
MISSION LEAGUE

 Dead (Heat) in the Water 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into the final race, Chaminade needed first- and second-place finishes 
in the 400 freestyle relay to win a boys' swim meet against Alemany on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade's top team of Sean Feeney, Mike Vercillo, Nick Smith and Kevin Rodin 
won as expected, and the second team finished third, leaving the Eagles and 
Indians dead even, 85-85. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of anticlimactic since we'd come from behind to get something," 
Coach Dale Rodin said. "I guess it beats a loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodin found inspiration with his girls' team, which upset the Indians, 96-74. 
The victory was his first over the Alemany girls. Around the Leagues. . . .

 * The Birmingham boys' track and field team won its 53rd consecutive dual meet

 El Camino Real pitcher Randy Wolf, last season's City Section 4-A Division 
player of the year, dominated opponents last season and has continued his 
remarkable pitching this season. Tuesday, he lost his first game since May. 
Here's a look at Wolf's last seven starts: 07,09,37,09,04,04,04,05 Date 
Opponent (Score) IP H ER BB K 3/22/94 Granada Hills (L, 1-0) 7 5 1 2 8 3/15/94

AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT ORDERS WARNING LABELS FOR UNCOOKED MEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government has ordered that starting within 60 days, raw or partly cooked 
ground meat and poultry products must carry labels with instructions on how to 
safely handle and cook them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The safe cooking and handling labels will help provide essential health and 
safety information to consumers," Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, the 20-years debate regarding this simple, but vital label is 
over," the secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agriculture Department said also that all other not-ready-to-eat meat and 
poultry products must have the labels by July 6. 
</P>
<P>
 After that date, the government will also require nutrition labeling on 
processed meats and poultry products such as chicken franks and corned beef. 
The instructions on the labels will include how to safely store the meats, 
cooking instructions and how to store leftovers as well as preparation of the 
meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The requirement is one in a series of steps by the government to assure food 
safety in the wake of an outbreak of food-borne illness that killed three 
people and made more than 350 ill in the Pacific Northwest in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A consumer group, Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, said the labels 
"will prevent thousands of illnesses and will almost certainly save lives." 
But, it said, further steps are needed to modernize meat production and 
inspection.

EX-UNIVERSAL STUDIOS WORKER FILES SEX HARASSMENT LAWSUIT; COURTS: WOMAN'S 
ACTION IS THE THIRD SUCH CASE AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THREE YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former employee at the MCA/Universal Studios has filed a sexual harassment 
lawsuit, alleging that her male supervisors had groped and fondled her and 
sought sexual favors during her 14 years of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2.5-million suit filed Thursday on behalf of Claire E. Ragge in Los 
Angeles County Superior Court also alleged that she reported the harassment to 
officials at Universal but they ignored her. This is the third sex harassment 
lawsuit filed against the theme park in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of an estimated $600,000 settlement of one suit in October, MCA, the 
parent company of Universal, agreed to hire an independent consultant to review 
the company's harassment policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragge's complaint alleges that her harassment continued until December, when 
she was suspended indefinitely from her bartending job for a complaint by an 
unidentified customer and for allegedly arguing with an unidentified employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was being harassed while they were negotiating the settlement in their last 
case," Ragge, 35, said in an interview. "It obviously didn't change a thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives for MCA/Universal Hollywood, which is owned by the Japanese 
electronics giant Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co. Ltd., declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragge's suit alleged the harassment began in 1982 with one of her supervisors, 
Peter Muendel, fondling her breasts and crotch, embracing her and rubbing his 
body against her buttocks. It also alleged that another supervisor, Rick R. 
Storer, regularly grabbed and pinched her buttocks and once told her during a 
job performance evaluation that she would have received a better rating if her 
breasts were larger. 
</P>
<P>
 Muendel, now the director of food and beverages at the Universal Amphitheatre, 
and Storer could not be reached for comment at Universal. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleged that complaints to company officials in 1982 caused the 
alleged harassers to retaliate against her by cutting back her work hours, 
withholding bartending supplies in an effort to sabotage her job performance 
and by isolating her from other women who allegedly endured similar treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 She filed a sexual harassment and retaliation charge on March 31, 1993, with 
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Fair 
Employment and Housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragge was suspended indefinitely on Dec. 29. "Universal's solution to stopping 
the problem seems to be to be to just get rid of the women who complain," Ragge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to MCA/Universal Studios, 36-page suit names Muendel and Storer as 
well as several Universal executives. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, The Times reported that more than two dozen current and former 
employees said in interviews that they had witnessed sexual harassment or were 
subjected to misconduct ranging from unwanted advances to groping and 
"sandwiching," where two or more men forcibly squeeze a woman between their 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The article cited union and company sources in reporting that at least 23 
employees -- excluding managers and non-union employees -- have been accused of 
sexual harassment since 1990. Seven were fired or suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal officials said the park, which employs 4,000 people each year, had a 
strong sexual harassment policy in place. The alleged harassers tended to be 
low-level employees and supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragge's suit comes just six months after MCA paid an estimated $600,000 in 
September to resolve another sex harassment case involving former employee 
Wendy-Sue Rosen and two supervisors, who then resigned. MCA also paid former 
stage show employee Loretta Miller an estimated $100,000 in October to close 
her case, sources said.

RECIPIENTS OF BREAST IMPLANTS CONSIDER JOINING SETTLEMENT; LAWSUIT: MANY WOMEN 
WITH AILMENTS LINKED TO SILICONE GEL LEAKAGE AWAIT DETAILS OF THE CLASS-ACTION 
AGREEMENT. CALLERS FLOOD TOLL-FREE LINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern Californian women who received breast implants spent Thursday 
pondering whether to participate in a record-breaking, $3.75-billion 
class-action settlement of litigation against silicone gel implant 
manufacturers -- or to pursue lawsuits on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Some indicated they probably would join the settlement, while others said they 
definitely would opt out. But most said they did not yet know enough to make a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "For myself and most of the women I'm speaking to . . . our attorneys are not 
quite sure what to do about this," said Janie Cruise of Corona, who blames the 
implants she got in 1983 for a myriad of ailments, including chronic fatigue, 
short-term memory loss and mixed connective tissue disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is very complex," said Cruise, a former marketing 
representative for a piano company. "There are many more questions than there 
are answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement reached Wednesday in Birmingham, Ala., implant recipients 
could get from $160,000 to $1.6 million, depending on their ages and the 
severity of their injuries. The amount is determined by an elaborate grid that 
is a key element of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fit in very nicely on the grid," Cruise said. But she also expects so many 
women to file claims that the compensation amounts might be lowered, leaving 
her and others with an inadequate recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacquelyn A. Pascal of San Diego said she was scrambling for information. "Two 
doctors told me I may have lupus," another disease that qualifies for 
compensation. "But I need more tests, which I can't afford because I lost my 
job," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 52-year-old former insurance agent said she wanted to have her implants 
removed as soon as possible and was pleased to hear that the settlement 
provided funds for such an operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive accord, announced Wednesday, prompted so many calls to a toll-free 
information line set up by a federal judge in Birmingham, who is presiding over 
the settlement, that it was overrun at one point Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Women can leave their names and addresses at the toll-free number -- (800) 
887-6828 -- and request a copy of the settlement notice. Lawyers said Thursday 
that they expect the wording of the notice to be approved April 4 by U.S. 
District Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. in Birmingham and subsequently mailed. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone also was busy at the Beverly Hills home of Sybil Goldrich, 
co-founder of the Command Trust Network, a nationwide information clearinghouse 
for women with implants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would suggest that any woman with an implant get a copy of the settlement 
document and read it over thoroughly," Goldrich said. "I also would suggest 
that women read it together, set up a buddy system." 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, she said, many women will want to consult with an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "However," Goldrich added, "I would caution women against calling these 
attorneys who are advertising through 800 numbers all over the country, many of 
whom know virtually nothing about implants and are simply signing retainer 
agreements with women and will then refer their cases to another lawyer and get 
a fee for the referral." 
</P>
<P>
 Among factors to consider are one's medical condition and the extensiveness of 
medical records. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a woman can't document any illness at this point, she probably would want 
to join the settlement," because it works like an insurance policy, Goldrich 
said. The settlement provides that if a woman develops one of the medical 
problems listed during the next 30 years, she will be entitled to some 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, lawyers said, a woman who has cancer should seriously 
considering opting out because cancer is not covered under the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Kali Korn, 43, a Los Angeles woman with severe scleroderma and other medical 
problems, has decided against taking the settlement, according to her attorney, 
Sal Liccardo of San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way that she could get enough money under the settlement to cover 
all her medical problems," Liccardo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly a fashion consultant, Korn is now bedridden and needs "around the 
clock attendant care." 
</P>
<P>
 Dow Corning and the other two companies who are the funding the settlement, 
Baxter Healthcare Corp. and Bristol-Myers Squibb, deny that there is any causal 
link between their implants and medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies said they agreed to the settlement, however, because of the 
massive costs of defending thousands of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, a woman does not have to prove a link between her 
illness and an implant. Rather, she simply has to prove that she had an implant 
and provide medical documentation that she developed one of the illnesses 
covered.  
</P>
<P>
 The settlement also provides funds for medical monitoring of women with 
implants.

A DAY OF MOURNING; MEXICAN AMERICANS SPEAK OF COLOSIO'S ASSASSINATION WITH 
EMOTION AND DISBELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton was speaking on the big-screen TV about the horror of 
political assassinations, about how sorry he was, about the solid relationship 
between Mexico and the United States that would not change. 
</P>
<P>
 His words, translated by a newscaster into Spanish, were filtering down to the 
diners at Diana's Mexican Restaurant on a gloomy Thursday afternoon in 
Huntington Park. This was politics, protocol, part of the controlled ritual of 
international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 To many of Southern California's Mexican immigrants, however, the meaning of 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination Wednesday was found 
someplace else, a place often hard to reach with words. 
</P>
<P>
 At Diana's, at the Mexican Consulate where the flags were flying at 
half-staff, in countless homes, talk mixed with emotion and disbelief. It 
seemed that a terrible threshold had been crossed, and danger and disillusion 
lurked on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 "About politics I don't know a lot," said roofer Jose Bernal, 26, a native of 
Aguascalientes in central Mexico. His eyes rose toward the TV that hung above 
the upholstered plastic booths in Diana's front room. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this hurts me, right here," he said, placing his hand quietly to his 
chest and then wiping away tears. His 3-year-old daughter, seated behind a 
mound of French fries, stared at her father, incomprehension in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always going to remember this," Bernal went on. "He was going to be 
president of Mexico! If this can happen to him, what is going to happen to 
Mexico in the future? Look at Chiapas, what happened there. What's happening to 
Mexico? I'm afraid things are just going to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the talk at Diana's, a popular gathering place for many in the Los 
Angeles Mexican American community, was of Mexico's cycle of misfortune that 
started with the armed rebellion in southern Chiapas state on New Year's Day. 
That was the last time that talk of back home seemed to consume people here. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the kidnaping earlier this month of Alfredo Harp Helu, chairman 
of Mexico's largest financial group. He still has not been released. Now 
Colosio, the candidate of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party 
(PRI), who was virtually assured of becoming the next president, had been 
fatally shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, it seemed as if modern Mexico has become mired in a deadly fable the 
likes of which Latin American novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez might write. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like revolution, Pancho Villa, all over again," said Mexico City-born 
Elsa Rodriguez, the manager of this relaxed restaurant with the giant swordfish 
over the bar and the huge oil painting of Diana, the owner's daughter, 
surveying the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the first of January, Mexico changed. After (Wednesday), it is going to 
change again." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Estela Davila, from northern Mexico's Chihuahua state, "We all think the 
same things. We thought that nothing like this could ever happen in Mexico. We 
are not used to these violent acts in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Mexico's past is threaded with violence, but Mexicans point to their 
history with great pride. There was a nobility to, say, the Mexican 
revolutionaries of 1910, glorious warriors who never hesitated to use bloodshed 
toward an end. 
</P>
<P>
 But after decades of political stability, the assassination of Colosio seemed 
the start of a slide into U.S.-style political violence, a savage and 
unpredictable animal that might never again be caged. Never did the popular 
Mexican saying, "Poor Mexico -- so far from God and so close to the United 
States" seem more apt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible over there," said Alfred Almada, a retail manager whose 
relatives hail from Guadalajara and Michoacan. "The government is real corrupt. 
It's dangerous. I won't go there anymore. It's scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more detached observers at Diana's were those who feared reactions 
such as Almada's. Such thinking would be bad for Mexico, they said, and bad for 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "From an economic point of view, I feel bad," said Huntington Park City 
Councilman Raul Perez. "It could cause problems to Mexico. I think there is 
going to be a witch hunt (for scapegoats)." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jessica Maes, adviser to the Huntington Park Chamber of Commerce, said she 
was surprised at all the news coverage that Colosio's death has drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy was very popular," she said of Colosio. "He appealed to the 
low-income people. That's why everybody is taking it so bad. I've seen people 
crying here, they've taken it so personally. They had something to believe in. 
A lot of people did react more than I thought. He appealed to the little 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everybody, however, was shaken by Colosio's death. Several said, in 
essence, that he had it coming. They saw him as just another cog in a political 
system that is essentially corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not justifiable to kill a presidential candidate," said Louis Almada, 
the father of Alfred. "But I think it is the government's fault because of the 
way it picks the candidate by el dedazo (allowing the outgoing president to 
handpick his successor) instead of through democracy. So I think that this is a 
political crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Others saw more straightforward criminal conspiracy in the act. Perhaps the 
narcotraficantes , the drug traffickers, were behind the assassination, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, mostly, it was sadness that shadowed the faces of those who had Mexico on 
their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he really was the only candidate for Mexico," said civil servant 
Norma Inocencio. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could tell who he was by the way he talked to people," added her lunch 
partner, Manuel Mosqueda, an ironworker. 
</P>
<P>
 "He related to people, reached out to them. He was always with the poor. It 
seemed like he wanted to do something for Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's how the talk was going all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really surprised, too, that even American people are asking about it, 
talking among themselves," said Rodriguez, the restaurant manager. "They are 
concerned for Mexico. I guess this shows that Americans and Mexicans are 
sticking together on this."

RIORDAN RECONSIDERS LAPD RAISES; CONTRACTS: ANGRY MAYOR REACTS TO POLICE UNION 
BILLBOARDS SPOTLIGHTING THE THREAT OF CRIME. LABOR LEADERS SAY THE ADS, WHICH 
SHOW A CARJACKING, WILL STAY UP. 
</P>

<P>
 Angered by a billboard campaign intended to frighten the public into 
supporting the Los Angeles police union, Mayor Richard Riordan on Thursday 
backed off from his plan to offer a salary increase for officers and canceled 
upcoming meetings with city negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan pledged last week to present a new contract proposal at a negotiating 
session scheduled for today. But during a meeting with key council members 
Thursday, Riordan's chief of staff said the mayor had decided to reconsider the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor is not going to make any proposal right now," chief of staff Bill 
McCarley said. "He is very disappointed with the billboards and other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Council President John Ferraro, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and Councilwoman 
Jackie Goldberg -- who are members of the city's negotiating committee -- 
decided not to make an offer to the Police Protective League until Riordan 
reconvenes the group. The mayor canceled a committee meeting scheduled for next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 A negotiating session is still set for this morning but it is expected to be 
brief because city officials said they have nothing to offer to the league. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21 billboards, which went up Tuesday, show a woman being carjacked at 
gunpoint. "Warning: This Can Be You Without the Police Dept.," the ads read. 
</P>
<P>
 The billboards are part of a campaign to pressure the city into accepting 
union demands. Brochures highlighting Los Angeles' crime rates were sent to 
tourist officials earlier in the month and a videotape carrying a similar theme 
is being prepared for possible international distribution.  
</P>
<P>
 League officials have said the campaign is designed to hurt the city's tourism 
industry and point out the essential services provided by police. They had 
hoped the strategy would lead to a quick settlement with the city, but the 
tactic appears to have backfired. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, digging in its heels, said the billboards will stay up despite 
Riordan's change of heart. At the same time, union officials said the video 
campaign will go forward only if approved at membership meetings next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The league represents about 7,000 officers ranked lieutenant and below. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a continuation of the bad faith bargaining that the police officers 
have had to endure for close to two years," union President Danny Staggs said. 
"To put out a press release announcing an offer and then not come through with 
it shows some of the poorest leadership I've seen in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they withdrew the offer because of concern that the 
union's protests might adversely affect the city treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Police Protective League has a right to put up any billboard it wants, 
but they have proposed a campaign to hurt the city treasury," Yaroslavsky said. 
"It is only prudent to see what the impact of that campaign is on the treasury 
before moving ahead."  
</P>
<P>
 But there was also outrage at the billboards themselves, especially because 
they were erected after Riordan had announced that he planned to offer the 
officers a raise, the first such offer in the nearly two years of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor has always been supportive of police and public safety but he is 
not going to respond to this kind of tactic," McCarley said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Riordan announced last Friday that he would make a raise offer, union 
members considered canceling the billboards. But they said they went ahead 
Tuesday morning because Riordan coupled his proposed raise with work rule 
changes that the union opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's proposal -- which sources said called for a raise of roughly 6% over 
two years -- also called for changes in the job classifications for detectives 
that would give Chief Willie L. Williams more discretion to transfer officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The union says the changes could return negotiations to square one. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs, a supporter of the union, criticized the city action. 
"This is becoming childish now," he said. "The city has stalled long enough. 
Police morale is at its lowest point. They deserve a contract."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
FACING MISCONDUCT HEARING, LAPD OFFICER RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A veteran Los Angeles police officer resigned on the same day he was to have 
faced internal departmental hearings that would have put him on trial publicly 
on more than a dozen misconduct charges, authorities confirmed this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Walter Ray Bentley Jr. of Granada Hills, a 23-year veteran, worked 
most recently in the department's Juvenile Division before his suspension in 
August.He faced two separate department administrative hearings on 13 charges, 
including stealing pornography from locked evidence lockers and selling 
information he illegally retrieved from department computers to private 
detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the most severe penalty the hearing officers could have imposed was 
dismissal from the force, those hearings have been canceled, said Capt. Eric 
Lillo, commanding officer of the Police Department's Internal Affairs Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fellow officers, who asked not to be identified, said that by retiring 
Monday, the day the hearings were to begin, Bentley avoided having to testify 
against himself in the board of rights hearings -- which are open to the public 
and reporters -- and prevented other witnesses from testifying against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley, 47, remains under criminal investigation for allegedly using his 
power as a police officer to illegally gain access to confidential information 
in department computers. Police and prosecutors said Wednesday that the 
investigation will continue, as will an existing criminal case filed against 
Bentley last summer after Bentley was arrested and charged with possessing 
child pornography and receiving stolen property. He has pleaded not guilty to 
those charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his lawyer, Bentley refused to comment Wednesday on his retirement or 
the allegations lodged against him by the department.

GETS CONTRACT ON 3 FRIGATES LEASED TO TAIWAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard will refurbish three Navy frigates 
that will be leased to Taiwan, a spokesman for an Orange County congressman 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In an agreement worth several million dollars, Taiwan will pay for any repairs 
needed on the frigates Joseph Hewes, Cook and Barbey, said Dale Neugebauer, a 
spokesman for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach).  
</P>
<P>
 The shipyard was targeted in 1991 and 1993 in the ongoing rounds of military 
base closures but was spared both times.

SPEAKING UP : A LOOK AT NOTEWORTHY ADDRESSES IN THE SOUTHLAND.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Julian Bond, educator and civil rights activist, spoke last Friday about the 
historic Brown vs. Board of Education U.S. Supreme Court decision at Loyola 
Marymount University. From his address: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Brown vs. Board of Education "In just the last few months, we have been 
reminded over and over again about the centrality of race in American life. The 
daily news reminds us. Surveys of public opinion demonstrate with crushing 
frequency that many members of the diminishing American majority believe racial 
minorities are less worthy than themselves of inclusion into the national 
community, their cries for justice easily dismissed as special pleading from 
disgruntled and non-competitive complainers. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other side, years and years of endless pleas for justice, turned aside 
time and again, have produced a reaction among many of the dispossessed that 
argues for an end to unanswered cries for inclusion, and a voluntary return to 
the separate but equal world that many imagine existed years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . My grandfather belonged to a transcendent generation of black 
Americans, born into slavery, freed by the Civil War, determined to make their 
way as free women and men. Education was one weapon they used to secure their 
freedom. . . . For (my father), too, education was the means to a larger end -- 
the uplift of his people and the salvation of his race. 
</P>
<P>
 "How fitting, then, that he would be able to assist the NAACP in its legal 
campaign against school segregation, the campaign that culminated in the 
Supreme Court's landmark Brown vs. Board of Education decision, whose 40th 
anniversary we celebrate this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make no mistake, although we have found ourselves in various stages of 
advance and retreat in the 40 years since Brown, its anniversary is cause for 
celebration, not dismay. We celebrate the brilliant legal minds who were its 
architects . . . the brave families who were its plaintiffs, and . . . the 
legal principle that remains its enduring legacy -- in the words of former 
Chief Justice Earl Warren, speaking for a unanimous court, that 'the doctrine 
of "separate but equal" has no place.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On the Promise of Brown 
</P>
<P>
 "It is easy to cast a cynical eye on the status of school desegregation in the 
United States today, or the sorry state of race relations, and minimize the 
significance of Brown. . . . That the quest for meaningful equality, political 
and economic equity, remains unfulfilled today is not an indictment of past 
efforts. It is testament to our challenge.  
</P>
<P>
 "Today, this slave's grandson teaches at the university slave owner Thomas 
Jefferson founded in Virginia. I teach young Americans about the modern-day 
struggle for human liberty. My students are filled with the cynicism and 
despair of their age. For them, these are the worst of times, and my 
documentation of a harsher and more oppressive past does not always convince 
them that these days are better. . . . If the years since Brown did not succeed 
in dismantling segregated schools, those years have seen American preferences 
for segregated education shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . There are those who scoff at Brown. . . . They miss the point of the 
school desegregation movement. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . The NAACP's brief argued: 'These infant appellants are asserting the 
most important secular claims that can be put forward by children, the claim to 
learn and grow and the . . . even more important claim to be treated as entire 
citizens of the society into which they have been born.' . . . That was Brown's 
promise 40 years ago and it remains Brown's promise to us now."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; RED 
CROSS TO CLOSE ITS 7 REMAINING QUAKE CENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Red Cross will close its seven remaining earthquake service 
centers at the end of the month, spokeswoman Peggy Hinz said Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 The number of victims using the service centers dwindled in recent weeks -- 
and did not increase after Sunday's magnitude 5.3 aftershock -- to levels where 
it was unnecessary to keep them open, she said.The Red Cross provided meals, a 
place to sleep and mental health counseling at the centers.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 temblor, the Red Cross has helped more than 32,341 families 
and served more than 1.7 million meals at the centers, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 At the peak of the relief effort, the Red Cross housed 22,004 people at its 47 
shelters.  
</P>
<P>
 The remaining centers are in Glendale, Santa Clarita, Santa Monica, Ventura 
County, the Vineyard Recreation Center in Los Angeles, the UAW Local 645 Union 
Hall in Van Nuys and the Winnetka Recreation Center in Northridge.  
</P>
<P>
 Case workers still are available for people who need help. Victims can call 
the Red Cross at (213) 739-4543.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; EX-CITY 
ADMINISTRATOR WINS $585,000 IN BIAS LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court jury this week found that the city of Pasadena 
discriminated against a former black administrator who did not win promotion, 
was retaliated against when he formed a black employees group and was left with 
no recourse but to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury also found that the discrimination was the result of city policy.The 
jury awarded $585,000 to Eugene Stevenson, including $200,000 for lost wages 
and $300,000 for pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson worked for the city's Health Department. He now works for a private 
company in health administration. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Philip A. Hawkey declined to comment on the specifics of the 
case, saying he had not been briefed by the city's lawyer. But Hawkey said 
affirmative action reforms and other changes, such as diversity training for 
managers and minority training for promotions, had taken care of problems the 
city may have had. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's lawyer, Jeffrey Freedman, said he will review the trial to 
determine if there are grounds for an appeal and most likely make his 
recommendation next week to city officials.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BURBANK; LOCKHEED SEEKS 
FUNDS FROM OTHER FIRMS FOR CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lockheed Corp., on the hook for a massive Superfund cleanup in Burbank, has 
demanded financial contributions from dozens of firms it says also polluted the 
ground water, and is threatening to file a lawsuit next month against those who 
won't pay up. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry and fearful of Lockheed's legal firepower, many of these small- to 
mid-size businesses are undecided on whether to settle or fight, and are 
scrambling to determine if they have insurance coverage to meet Lockheed's 
demands -- which range from $50,000 to $15 million per company and total almost 
$70 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is financial responsibility for purging ground water supplies of 
chemical solvents that over many years have seeped into the vast aquifer under 
the San Fernando Valley, idling Burbank's municipal wells. Lockheed is 
finishing construction of a ground water treatment system that will cleanse 
12,000 gallons of water per minute at a cost the company says will exceed $172 
million.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CASTAIC; 500 INMATES 
INVOLVED IN 4 BRAWLS AT COUNTY JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 500 inmates battled each other for several hours in four separate 
brawls at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho near Castaic late Wednesday and 
early Thursday, but the fighting caused no serious injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence, which broke out between Latino and African American prisoners at 
the jail, is the latest in a series of brawls between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's spokesman said it was unclear what led to the disturbances, but in 
the past authorities have blamed the fights on a power struggle between African 
American and Latino inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Thursday, when inmates battled with broomsticks and razors and were 
stopped by sheriff's deputies spraying rubber bullets, 17 prisoners suffered 
minor cuts and bruises, spokesman Gabe Ramirez said.

AIR SAFETY PANEL CITES TURBULENCE IN SANTA ANA CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stopping short of casting blame, a National Transportation Safety Board report 
released in Washington on Thursday suggests that a fatal plane crash in Santa 
Ana last year might have been prevented if the pilot or air traffic controllers 
had kept an adequate safety cushion between the aircraft and a Boeing 757 
jetliner ahead of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The report focused on the hazards posed by wake turbulence created by B-757s 
and underscored a series of recommendations adopted by the board last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a separate report on the Dec. 15 Santa Ana crash will be forthcoming, 
Thursday's document cited the accident a number of times and the board 
continues to pressure the Federal Aviation Administration to change its rules 
on B-757 wake turbulence. The board, which does not have regulatory power, has 
made 19 safety recommendations to the FAA, among them that the agency lengthen 
the minimum distances for smaller aircraft landing behind B-757s. 
</P>
<P>
 Board records show that there were 51 instances of aircraft caught in wake 
turbulence over the last decade, resulting in the deaths of 27 people and 
damage to, or destruction of, 40 airplanes. The board found that a 
disproportionate number of incidents -- five since December, 1992, resulting in 
13 deaths -- involved wake turbulence from B-757s. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident in Santa Ana occurred when a twin-engine Westwind corporate jet 
was on a landing approach to John Wayne Airport. The jet, which was 2.1 miles 
behind a B-757, slammed nose first into the ground near the Santa Ana Auto 
Mall. All five aboard, including the top two executives of the In-N-Out Burger 
chain, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because of the Santa Ana accident, the board unanimously recommended 
last month that similarly sized corporate jets be kept five miles behind B-757s 
on final approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana accident remains under investigation by the board, but the 
report released Thursday provides the first clues as to what aviation safety 
officials believe was the cause of the crash and how it might have been 
prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way the pilot of the Westwind could have maintained adequate 
separation was to execute significant maneuvers," the report said. Similarly, 
it said that "to prevent compromise of the separation requirement, the 
controller would have had to take positive action to change the Westwind's 
track."

DOCTOR SAYS HE WAS SURPRISED KING SURVIVED BEATING; TRIAL: OPHTHALMOLOGIST 
TESTIFIES THAT THE VICTIM'S EYE SOCKET HAD TO BE REBUILT. DAMAGES OWED TO KING 
ARE AT ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ophthalmologist testified Thursday in Rodney G. King's federal civil rights 
lawsuit that he saw pulverized bone in King's eye socket less than a week after 
his 1991 beating by police and that he was amazed the man survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Charles Aronberg, chief of ophthalmology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 
said he has been King's primary care physician, coordinating much of his 
medical treatment, including a delicate operation to restore a sunken right eye 
socket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised that Mr. King had withstood this and was still alive, and the 
other doctors thought so, too," said Aronberg, who testified for the plaintiffs 
in King's lawsuit against the city and several current and former police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aronberg was the first medical expert called to testify during the initial 
phase of the trial in which the seven-woman, three-man jury will determine how 
much King will be paid for his injuries. The city has already accepted 
liability for the injuries King suffered. In the second phase of trial, the 
jury will determine whether individual defendants will also be liable for 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations to reach an out-of-court settlement have stalled, with both sides 
indicating that such an agreement now seems unlikely. King's attorneys say they 
have reduced their offer from $9.2 million, but thus far, the city has not 
indicated whether it is willing to go higher than $1.25 million. King's medical 
expenses amount to $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Aronberg said he believed King's injuries were consistent with being hit with 
a blunt-force object in the face at least five or six times. 
</P>
<P>
 Aronberg said King was suffering from numerous injuries when he examined him 
five days after the incident. When he touched his face, the doctor said, he 
could "feel the bone dip in very deeply on the right side." King had multiple 
facial fractures, had trouble speaking and could not chew. Delicate surgery was 
required to rebuild his eye socket. 
</P>
<P>
 Aronberg said he examined King before the trial and found he was still 
suffering from dizziness and headaches. Because of the injuries, he said, King 
runs an increased risk of glaucoma, retina detachment and cataracts. He has 
advised King against returning to construction work and has recommended against 
him driving because of reduced concentration, blurred vision and memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
 On cross-examination, Aronberg was asked if the injuries could have been 
caused by a fall. The doctor said some injuries might have resulted from a 
fall, but others would not have. 
</P>
<P>
 After Aronberg testified, King's attorneys put a neurologist on the stand who 
testified that King has suffered from back pains, sleep disturbances and facial 
numbness. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the objections of the defendants' attorneys, U.S. District Judge John 
Davies agreed to allow California Highway Patrol officers Melanie and Tim 
Singer to testify about the police chase that preceded the beating. The married 
officers initiated the high-speed pursuit of King that ended in the Lake View 
Terrace area, where Los Angeles Police Department officers took charge. The 
Singers are expected to take the stand today.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; MISSOURI KOS SYRACUSE IN OT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Guards Adrian Autry and Lawrence Moten carried Syracuse into overtime against 
Missouri on Thursday night, but their backs weren't strong enough to overcome 
the Tigers' balanced scoring and depth. 
</P>
<P>
 With reserve Paul O'Liney scoring five points in overtime, Missouri outlasted 
the Orangemen for a 98-88 victory in an NCAA West Regional semifinal at the 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Melvin Booker and freshman forward Kelly Thames each scored 24 
points to lead five players in double figures for Missouri (28-3), which 
reached the round of eight for the first time since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, whose reserves outscored Syracuse's, 21-4, had to withstand 
outstanding performances by Autry, who scored all 31 of his points after 
halftime, and Moten, who scored 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't real sharp, and I'm not trying to take away anything from 
Syracuse," Missouri Coach Norm Stewart said. "But there were a lot of things 
that we could do better. What this ballclub has is a lot of grit, and it found 
a way to win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri struggled in the first half, making only 35% of its shots, but the 
Tigers went into the locker room with the score tied, 36-36, thanks to 12 
turnovers by Syracuse (23-7). 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the second half, Missouri played like a different team, 
attacking Syracuse's zone defense instead of relying on outside shots as it had 
in the first half. With Booker scoring nine points and Thames eight, the Tigers 
appeared to have control of the game when they opened a 70-59 lead with 4:54 to 
play in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Autry and Moten pulled the Orangemen back into the game. In a span 
of 90 seconds, they combined for 10 points as Syracuse cut Missouri's lead to 
70-69 with 3:13 remaining.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had a (11-point) lead in the second half, and we did not handle that 
well," Stewart said. "But, you've got to give (Syracuse) credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri responded with a rally of its own, outscoring the Orangemen, 7-2, to 
take a 77-71 lead with 1:18 left, but Autry answered with a three-pointer and 
three free throws to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 After Thames made two free throws for Missouri and Autry made a bank shot for 
Syracuse, Missouri survived a near steal by Syracuse's Lucious Jackson and saw 
its chance to win the game in regulation end when Booker missed a five-foot 
shot with four seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in tight games like this all year," said Autry. "You've just got 
to dig deep down inside. For me, the biggest things that kept me going was that 
this could be my last game. I just found a little bit more energy." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't enough in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't be satisfied right now," said Booker, who also had nine assists and 
three steals. "We can't be until the season is over."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; WILDCATS CAGE THE CARDINALS; 
WEST: DEFENSE, REEVES LIFT ARIZONA OVER LOUISVILLE, 82-70. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Arizona center Joseph Blair walked off the court, both arms raised, which 
meant either he was happy or he was signaling another three-point shot by 
Khalid Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair couldn't have been wrong either way, not after watching Reeves deliver 
five three-pointers and help usher the Wildcats into the West Regional final 
with an 82-70 victory over Louisville before 15,157 Thursday night at the 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 2-seeded Wildcats (28-5) will play No. 1-seeded Missouri (28-3) on 
Saturday, with the winner going to the Final Four next weekend at Charlotte, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves made nine of 17 shots and scored 29 points, but it was the Wildcats' 
hyperactive defense that might have won it for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a lot of ways to hurt you," said Louisville Coach Denny Crum. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a deep hurt. Arizona Coach Lute Olson draped two and sometimes three 
defenders on Louisville's 6-foot-9 Clifford Rozier and also made sure Arizona 
contested every shot from distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Add it all up and it was worth Arizona's 12th victory in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves noted that Arizona is playing more loosely despite back-to-back 
first-round defeats the last two years of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm loose," he said. "We don't have to be uptight. We know we're a 
good team." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson paid homage to Reeves' accuracy, but he said the price for this Arizona 
victory was paid in another location. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really made it difficult to score," he said. "All the guys stepped up big 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats, who led by nine points at the half, never allowed Louisville to 
get closer than eight the rest of the way. They sprinted out of sight at 67-52 
in a mini-run punctuated by Blair's hoop after he saved the ball when it was 
bounced off his knee at the baseline, and Damon Stoudamire's second and last 
field goal of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Rozier left, tugging his jersey out of his shorts, his line was 
small -- four shots, one hoop, five points, four turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 For what it's worth, the two common opponents for Arizona and Louisville were 
Kentucky (they both lost) and UCLA (Arizona split, Louisville lost by three). 
</P>
<P>
 The pregame forecast was for it to rain three-pointers, and so it did. 
However, few found their mark, but those that did were sent airborne by Arizona 
launchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildcats were living large from long distance in the first half, which ended 
with Arizona holding a 35-26 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been more, mainly because the Cardinals scored the last six 
points of the half and one-half of Arizona's feared backcourt was as quiet as a 
UCLA supporter in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves kept his part of the bargain with three three-pointers and 17 points in 
the first half, but Stoudamire struggled, missing all four of his shots and 
running off the court at the half without a point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals had 10 points from Dwayne Morton at the half, but Rozier was so 
tightly guarded, he would have had more room to work in a phone booth. Rozier, 
Louisville's power ranger, had just one basket, two turnovers, three points and 
four rebounds at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Crum said the Cardinals just didn't shoot well enough to win, which was hard 
to dispute. Louisville made only seven of 27 three-point shots, one of 12 in 
the first half, when the Cardinals' downward trend was established. 
</P>
<P>
 "On this level, you've just got to make your shots," Crum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire was on a lower level. He made two of 12 shots, but he nailed six 
free throws down the stretch, when Arizona busily worked the clock and got set 
for its showdown with Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not where we want to get," Olson said. "We have more in mind."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; IT'S BECOME A TWO-MAN SHOW 
FOR BOILERMAKERS; SOUTHEAST: PURDUE GETS 44 FROM ROBINSON, 29 FROM MARTIN IN 
83-78 VICTORY OVER KANSAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Zoe and his Dog, that's all Purdue's basketball team really boils down to. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-on-five. It doesn't seem fair, but Glenn Robinson, the Big Dog of West 
Lafayette and the rest of the NCAA, finally had to put his foot down on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody has to inbound the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's Robinson and Cuonzo (Zoe) Martin -- or, more accurately, Cuonzo Martin 
to Robinson for two points or three points or four if there's a foul. Once in a 
while, Martin shoots, too, usually from out past the three-point line. And 
there you have it -- Purdue's offensive game plan, in 25 words or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, Robinson and Martin didn't beat Kansas, 83-78, by themselves in 
Thursday night's Southeast Regional semifinal at the University of Tennessee, 
because together, they scored only 73 points and Kansas scored 78. But Purdue's 
victory didn't require much outside assistance, just a basket and a 
three-pointer by Matt Waddell, a tip-in by Ian Stanback and three free throws 
by Porter Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, it was all Robinson and Martin. Robinson had 44 points, a Purdue 
NCAA tournament record, including 30 in the first half. Martin had 29 points, 
24 coming on eight-of-13 three-point shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Purdue's reputation in this tournament has doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-man team is now a two-man team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like 'one-man team' better," Martin said from beneath a baseball cap tugged 
low on his forehead, apparently in the pursuit of anonymity. "When the other 
team says, 'We got to stop Glenn,' I guess they forget to play the other 
(guys)." 
</P>
<P>
 When that happens, Martin sneaks around, "finding my spots," waiting for a 
stray pass to come his way and then set and fire. His five three-pointers in 
the second half blunted more than one Kansas comeback attempt, frustrating the 
Jayhawks just as Robinson's arm began to tire from overuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson scored Purdue's first 10 points and 16 of the first 19. He hit the 40 
mark with 13:48 remaining in the second half, pushing the Boilermakers to a 
62-52 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Martin carried Purdue down the stretch. As Robinson began to misfire -- he 
finished 15 for 33 for the game -- and Kansas closing to within one (68-67) 
with 6:32 left, Martin sank back-to-back three-pointers and the Jayhawks never 
got closer than three until the waning seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas (27-8) got 20 points from Sean Pearson, 16 from Steve Woodberry and 15 
from Richard Scott. Woodberry and Scott also took their turns attempting to 
guard Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no fault with the way we guarded Glenn Robinson," Kansas Coach Roy 
Williams said. "Richard was so close to him on one three-pointer, he might have 
poked him in the eye. The referee didn't call it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glenn Robinson was 15 for 33. If you asked me before the game if I'd take 
Glenn Robinson going 15 for 33, I'd have said you bet your life."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; USC MOVES ONE GAME CLOSER TO 
THE FINAL FOUR; WOMEN: TROJANS QUELL SECOND-HALF RUN, PULL AWAY TO 85-66 
VICTORY OVER VIRGINIA. 
</P>

<P>
 The USC women's basketball team squandered a 15-point halftime lead but got it 
all back and then some in an 85-66 victory over Virginia on Thursday night in 
the NCAA Mideast Regional semifinals.  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, one victory away from the Final Four next week in Richmond, Va., 
advanced to the Mideast championship game Saturday night against Louisiana 
Tech, an upset winner over No. 1-ranked Tennessee, 71-68, Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Miller's team, winning its sixth in a row and raising its record to 
26-3, let Virginia (27-5) back in the game during the first eight minutes of 
the second half Thursday, but then 6-5 Lisa Leslie and point guard Nicky 
McCrimmon went to work inside and at the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 3,857 at 19,200-seat Bud Walton Arena, Leslie was in customary early 
foul trouble and wound up playing only 33 minutes, but that was enough against 
the Cavaliers, regular-season Atlantic Coast Conference champions and 
runners-up in the ACC postseason tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 45-30 at halftime, Virginia went on a 17-2 run to start the second 
half, tying the score at 47-47 with 13:50 left.  
</P>
<P>
 But at that point, McCrimmon, the senior from New York, took over. She scored 
on a drive to put the Trojans ahead again -- and for good -- and then made a 
baseline jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 And just as Leslie picked up her third foul, Karleen Shields stepped up to 
sink two baskets and Leslie scored on a drive for a 57-48 lead. Virginia never 
really challenged after that.  
</P>
<P>
 Leslie finished the game with four fouls -- as did freshman forward Tina 
Thompson. Thompson and Leslie each had 18 points and Leslie had 16 rebounds, 
Thompson 10. 
</P>
<P>
 USC made 15 of 22 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dug ourselves a big hole, and then Leslie and Thompson totally dominated 
the boards," Virginia Coach Debbie Ryan said afterward. "SC is extremely 
talented and well-coached. They hit some unbelievable shots on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who had been unhappy with her team over the last two weeks, seemed 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played very aggressively at the beginning, got our transition game going . 
. . and then got a little passive in the post when we let Virginia come back," 
she said.  
</P>
<P>
 McCrimmon, who came to USC as a junior college transfer last year, had one of 
her best games. She scored 12 points, had five assists, two blocks and two 
steals. But she finished the game with an icepack on her mouth.  
</P>
<P>
 With 50 seconds left, she was accidentally kicked in the teeth by Virginia's 
Tora Suber, and fell, semiconscious, to the floor.  
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana Tech 71, Tennessee 68 -- The upset was sweet revenge for Coach Leon 
Barmore, who watched the Lady Vols trounce his team in Knoxville on Dec. 22, 
94-60. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, his team won 23 in a row. During most of that streak, Tennessee 
(31-2) has been ranked No. 1, Louisiana Tech in the second 10.

VAN EXEL IS READY FOR CLASS TO BEGIN; PRO BASKETBALL: POINT GUARD LIKELY TO BE 
BIGGEST BENEFICIARY OF JOHNSON'S TUTELAGE AS ERA STARTS AFTER LAKERS' 113-107 
LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lakers had just lost to the Houston Rockets, 113-107, Thursday and 
prepared for the late-night charter flight home and what follows, the opening 
of the Magic Johnson era with a team meeting today. Larry Drew figured those 
few hours at about 30,000 feet would be the best time to talk to Nick Van Exel. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many guys come into the league and as a rookie get the opportunity to be 
coached by the greatest player ever at that position?" said Drew, a Laker 
assistant coach. "That doesn't come often." 
</P>
<P>
 It has come to Van Exel, the young point guard who now will be coached by the 
greatest point guard. Starting in earnest Saturday at practice and then Sunday 
night at the Forum in the first game, the opportunity begins for Van Exel, 
something akin to Einstein tutoring a promising math student. Relatively 
speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing he's going to be able to give Nick, first of all, is a huge, huge 
amount of confidence," said Drew, a friend of Johnson's and former point guard 
himself whom Van Exel credits for much of his early success. "Earvin being 
Earvin and Nick having a chance to play for the best point guard of all time, 
that in itself is a huge confidence booster. It should generate a lot of energy 
in Nick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earvin has been a student of the game for so long. Not only having played 
point guard, but played against the point guards like Nick -- guys quicker and 
smaller -- so he'll be able to sit Nick down and talk to him. You'll see more 
of Nick breaking the defenses down, which I don't think we've let him do. More 
speed and quickness instead of relying on perimeter shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside shooting has become such a prominent part of Van Exel's game that when 
he connected on a three-pointer late in the fourth quarter at the Summit, it 
moved him into second place all-time (95) for a rookie, behind only Dennis 
Scott (125). But quickness is still his greatest strength, the ability to blow 
past his man and drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The contradiction is no greater than that of Van Exel and his new coach. The 
same Magic Johnson he didn't like while growing up in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nope," Van Exel said. "The reason why was that I was from the Midwest, so we 
didn't get into the Lakers much. I liked the Sixers, Bucks and Bulls. I hated 
the Lakers, and I hated Boston." 
</P>
<P>
 Now? He's a big fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yup," Van Exel said. "I became a Magic fan when I played against him in 
summer league this summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Those meetings, mostly in pickup games at UCLA or the Inglewood YMCA, left an 
impression with a second-round draft pick from Cincinnati looking to fill the 
same role Johnson did through five NBA championships. The most prominent memory 
was that everyone on Magic's team was focused and serious. Van Exel, who once 
noted that all-star games are not enjoyable because too many people want to 
have fun at a showcase event, liked that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be exciting, it will be a lot of fun and competitive," Van Exel said of 
the new Laker era. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bertka is 1-2 as interim coach this season, splitting on this trip and 
losing to the Spurs earlier this season after Randy Pfund was suspended for 
bumping an official. "I've had fun," the longtime assistant said. "I enjoy 
that. I'm like Walter Mitty. I hate to lose, though. Mitty never lost." . . . 
Whether Bertka remains the No. 1 assistant to Magic Johnson, as he was for 
Pfund, may be decided today, when Johnson officially takes control with a team 
meeting. The new coach has been speaking very highly of Michael Cooper, his 
former teammate who moves from the front office to the bench. "He's only one of 
the greatest defensive players to ever play," Johnson said. "We need defense. I 
need somebody to teach the young guys how to play defense, and what better man 
to do this than Michael Cooper? I know him, he knows me, we understand each 
other, he's going to do a great job, it's something he's always wanted. You've 
got to go with a winner, and he's a winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Elden Campbell led the Lakers with 25 points, giving him a three-game average 
against the Rockets of 22 points and eight rebounds while shooting 61.4%.

NHL ROUNDUP; SHARKS SWIM FARTHER AWAY FROM KINGS, MIGHTY DUCKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a chance to put something besides 400 miles between the Bay Area and 
Southern California, the San Jose Sharks did something they had never done 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 They won, 2-1, at Toronto to extend their lead to eight points over the Mighty 
Ducks and Kings in the race for the eighth and final NHL playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Elik scored off a rebound 1:42 into the third period to give the Sharks 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning here is really significant for all of us, especially for me as a 
first-year NHL coach," San Jose's Kevin Constantine said. "But all of that 
pales in regards to what we're trying to accomplish: Staying ahead of Anaheim 
and Los Angeles and getting into the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose is 26-33-15 and already is looking forward to a return trip to 
Toronto in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll either be here or in Detroit," defenseman Jeff Norton said. "The nice 
thing about this win is that we know now that we can play against these guys, 
and we know how we have to play against these guys. And getting eight points up 
on the Kings gives us a little leeway now. At six up, lose one and you're back 
on your heels again. This will allow us be a little more relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 2, Tampa Bay 1 -- Bobby Holik and Scott Stevens scored at East 
Rutherford, N.J., as the Devils clinched a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 4, Florida 3 -- Eric Lindros had a goal and two assists at 
Philadelphia, where the Flyers moved to within two points of the Panthers for 
the final playoff spot in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 5, Ottawa 1 -- Shawn McEachern scored twice and Tomas Sandstrom had 
a goal and two assists at Pittsburgh as the Penguins extended their unbeaten 
streak to five. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 5, Chicago 5 -- Brian Bellows tied the score with his 30th goal of 
the season at 14:34 of the third period as the Canadiens rallied from a 
three-goal deficit at Chicago.

IT'S NOT A WORK OF ART AS DUCKS LOSE TO BOSTON; HOCKEY: WILSON UPSET WITH 
TEAM'S EFFORT AS ANAHEIM IS BEATEN, 5-3, TO FALL EIGHT POINTS BEHIND SAN JOSE. 
</P>

 Elbow grease has gotten the Mighty Ducks places they don't belong this season. 
</P>
<P>
 They have won 27 games and stayed in a playoff race with hard work and 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 But take away the work ethic and they're not much. So, Coach Ron Wilson ripped 
into his team for not competing Thursday after they gave up five goals in 11 
minutes during a second-period collapse in a 5-3 loss to the Boston Bruins at 
Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some guys who were just (awful) tonight. Plain and simple, that's 
probably why we have them," Wilson said. "I don't know, maybe the paint has 
come off the spots and the real leopard spots are starting to show." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, coupled with San Jose's victory over Toronto, leaves the Ducks eight 
points behind the Sharks for the final Western Conference playoff spot with 10 
games left. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to play harder than that, especially at this point in the season. 
This is crunch time," Wilson said. "We just didn't want to compete. When that 
happens you're going to get run right out of the building, and that's what 
happened tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks led, 1-0, after the first on a goal by Stephan Lebeau -- probably 
the Ducks' only standout all night. He certainly isn't with the Montreal 
Canadiens anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Wesley scored the first of his two goals for Boston at 3:15 of the 
second, but the Ducks regained the lead on Terry Yake's 21st goal at 5:46. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine seconds later, Adam Oates got the second of his four assists when 
he found Ted Donato with a pass all the way across the neutral zone and a 
confused cluster of Ducks, who watched Donato tie the score, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two minutes later, Glen Murray scored by knocking in a puck that was 
drifting through the slot and Boston led, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson called a rare timeout, and tried to get the players back in the game 
with a speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't respond at all," he said, as the Bruins scored two more times by 
the 13:55 mark. "We weren't competing. We were just standing around. We were 
awestruck by the big bad Bruins. They weren't that big, and I don't think 
they're that bad. So we got intimidated by their tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't compete and didn't work hard, and normally that's a given for 
our team." 
</P>
<P>
 All this against a Bruin team playing without Cam Neely and Ray Bourque 
because of injuries, a team that had a seven-game winless streak, its longest 
in seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just started making one mistake after the other and we seemed to give up 
easily," Wilson said. "We just buckled under the pressure of the Bruins. I 
don't know what you can say, I'm just disappointed in the effort of a lot of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 The players had no illusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not blaming the forwards, I'm not blaming the defense. This is a 
collective loss. Everybody didn't play well tonight," said defenseman Bobby 
Dollas, who was on the ice for only one goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether we make the playoffs or don't make the playoffs, that's irrelevant to 
how we want to finish the year. We can't wait for teams to keep beating San 
Jose or beating L.A. It's eight points now. You have to come mentally and 
physically prepared. Sometimes you have to take an elbow to the head, take a 
hit, block a shot. Tonight there was an overwhelming lack of effort, for 
probably the first time this year."

GOLF / DINAH SHORE TOURNAMENT; LOPEZ SHOOTS 68, SHARES FIRST-ROUND LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In recent years, Nancy Lopez has sometimes been more wife and mother than 
outstanding golfer. Even so, she remains one of the real stars of the LPGA and 
a favorite of the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, an 18-year veteran of the tour and a member of its exclusive Hall of 
Fame, recently made a concession to her career. For the major tournaments, she 
will leave her three youngsters at home and concentrate on golf. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, she practiced iron shots Wednesday until it was too dark to 
see the ball. And the practice paid dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, cooling off a bit after a blistering start, shot a four-under-par 68 
Thursday in the first major of the year, the $700,000 Nabisco Dinah Shore at 
Mission Hills Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The early birdies enabled Lopez to tie Alice Miller and Lisa Walters for the 
first-round lead in the 72-hole event. Japan's Ayako Okamoto and veteran Vicki 
Fergon, who hasn't won in 10 years, are a shot behind at 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group, including Betsy King, Donna Andrews and Jan Stephenson, was at 
70. But Amy Alcott, like King, needing one more victory to qualify for the Hall 
of Fame, faltered with a 74. Defending champion Helen Alfredsson did even 
worse, shooting a 76, and might have trouble making the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders had one thing in common -- they all started on No. 10. Lopez, 
playing with last week's winner, Laura Davies, who had a 70, was in the sixth 
group, but the two others played late in the day, when the greens were crusty 
and spiked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters, who has never won on the mainland, was six-under until her putter 
betrayed her on the last two holes. The Prince Rupert, Canada, golfer, who won 
twice in Hawaii, missed two short putts to finish bogey-bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez chewed up the back nine on the former Old Course, renamed the Dinah 
Shore. She birdied five of the first seven holes and then battled to survive 
despite a series of mediocre wood shots. 
</P>
<P>
 On a gorgeous day in the desert, which is expecting thunderstorms today and 
Saturday, Lopez, always considered an outstanding foul-weather player, put 
herself in an excellent position to win here for the first time since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 She hasn't won since July but decided that if she was going to stay on the 
tour, she would concentrate on the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other players have expressed surprise to see me on the practice tee," she 
said. "But before having a family, I spent long hours practicing. I'm not going 
to play in as many events, so I really want to play well in the majors." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez made birdie putts of eight, four, 30, eight and 18 feet on her first 
nine and didn't have a par putt longer than a foot. She hit probably her best 
shot on the 508-yard par-five 18th. After hitting a five-wood second shot into 
a fairway trap, she had to lay up in front of the lake that surround the green 
and appeared to be facing a bogey. But her sand wedge stopped six inches short 
of the pin and she saved par for a 31 for nine holes on a course other pros say 
is much tougher than a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that it was a struggle," Lopez said. "Now, I will have to go out and 
work on my woods. I think I was overswinging. Last fall when I was 20 pounds 
heavier, I was hitting the ball a long way. Now, I'm overswinging trying to hit 
it as far." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who has eight tour victories including the 1985 Dinah Shore, had an 
up-and-down round. Although she had six birdies, she also had two bogeys. She 
was hitting the ball in the fairway, but her irons kept her in trouble.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: MAGIC GOT BLANKET COVERAGE, BUT WHERE WAS CHANNEL 2? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been said that Magic Johnson and his friend Michael Jordan are addicted 
to the limelight. If that's the case, Johnson got a pretty good fix this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Channels 4, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, plus Prime Ticket, ESPN and CNN, all carried 
at least a portion of his news conference on Wednesday live. And KMPC, XTRA and 
KNX offered live radio coverage, with KMPC and XTRA offering lots of follow-up 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 An L.A. sports story hasn't gotten that kind of media attention since, well, 
the last Magic Johnson news conference. If one of Jerry Buss' motives in making 
the coaching change was publicity, he got what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Ticket, as it should, stayed with Wednesday's news conference almost 
until the end, nearly 35 minutes. The first to pull out was Channel 7, followed 
by national networks CNN and ESPN, then in order channels 4, 13, 9, 11 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Interesting that 11 and 5 would outlast Channel 9, considering it is the 
Lakers' flagship station. But Channel 9 rallied, devoting the entire 
"Lakertime" pregame show that night to the coaching change and also having 
Chick Hearn sit down with James Worthy for a halftime interview. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How embarrassing for Jim Hill, Johnson's close friend, that Channel 2 was the 
only L.A. station not covering Wednesday's news conference. It opted for "Young 
and the Restless." 
</P>
<P>
 No great surprise. Channel 2 gave us "The Price Is Right" and "Geraldo" last 
week instead of NCAA tournament games involving California and Arizona. And on 
Sunday, it preempted tournament coverage while devoting too much time to 
earthquake coverage, staying with it long after other stations had gone back to 
golf, auto racing or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, some Channel 2 viewers were angry that CBS cut away from 
Maryland's victory over Massachusetts to show the end of Syracuse's five-point 
victory over Wisconsin Green Bay and Florida's 22-point victory over Penn. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Sunday, CBS signed off before the end of Louisville's victory over 
Minnesota because it was time for "60 Minutes" in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 But CBS overall didn't do all that badly. It's an impossible job to please 
everyone, particularly in a transient market such as Los Angeles, where not 
everyone follows any particular team. 
</P>
<P>
 At least now the NCAA tournament has taken on some semblance of order, 
although tonight's Indiana-Boston College game will be joined in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 A 64-team tournament is simply too much for one television outlet to cover, 
especially when the first round -- 32 games -- is crammed into a two-day span. 
CBS' contract to carry the NCAA tournament runs through 1997, so don't look for 
things to change. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It took 11 months, but KMPC's Joe McDonnell has finally gained redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Last April 22, McDonnell and Doug Krikorian, who was then his partner, 
reported that Johnson was going to replace Randy Pfund as coach of the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's obvious they had something, but back then they went with their 
unsubstantiated report too quickly, and what followed were denials by the 
Lakers and snickering among their colleagues in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 What was needed was an experienced program director -- this was before Scott 
O'Neil took charge -- to tell McDonnell and Krikorian to curb their enthusiasm 
and their egos and get some substantiation before going with the report. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until a week later that Johnson came on their show and indicated 
that, yes, there was something to the story. 
</P>
<P>
 And now it has come to fruition, with McDonnell claiming he broke the story 
Tuesday night when he called into KMPC's Clipper post-game show around 6:50. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell said he was told by a "friend" in the Laker organization that Pfund 
had been fired after Monday's game against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't make sense because the Lakers had won, but I pursued it anyway," 
McDonnell said. "At first I ran into a brick wall, but eventually I confirmed 
it with three different sources. I wanted to make triple-sure this time." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell's report made the wires and was soon picked up by other media 
outlets, causing the Lakers to change their plans to make the announcement 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 XTRA's Lee Hamilton said he's not convinced McDonnell broke the story. He said 
he got a call from someone at Associated Press in New York about 6:15 Tuesday 
night, asking if he knew anything about Johnson replacing Pfund. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton reached Chick Hearn in Dallas, who confirmed it. Hearn, in an 
interview taped for airing Wednesday night, told Hamilton that he knew Tuesday 
morning, but was surprised that word got out. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Nathanson, who does a syndicated show from Las Vegas, "SportsFan 
Tonight," that is currently being carried by XTRA at 10 p.m., called that 
station about 9:45 after his producer, Charlie Parker, had reached Pfund. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund confirmed that he had been fired, effective immediately. Initial reports 
had indicated that Pfund would coach the team until Johnson took over after the 
current trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, by the way, asked callers Wednesday night if Pfund had been treated 
fairly. The vote was 33-9 that he wasn't. TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 TNT has added Magic Johnson's first Laker game as coach, Sunday night against 
Milwaukee, to its schedule. The tipoff has been moved from 7:10 to 7:20 to 
accommodate TNT, which has Houston-Phoenix at 5. The TNT Laker telecast is 
subject to blackout, but of course Prime Ticket will have the game. . . . 
Congratulations to producer Ron Boscacci for the excellent retrospective on 
Wayne Gretzky that was shown to both Prime Ticket viewers and to the crowd at 
the Forum after Gretzky scored his 802nd goal. The music was "This Is Your 
Life" by the Call. 
</P>
<P>
 XTRA's Joe Tutino also put together a nice piece on Gretzky that was played 
throughout the day on Thursday. . . . The Kings will be on ABC the next three 
Sundays, and Bob Miller will call the first two games, beginning Sunday at 
Vancouver. Amazingly, this is Miller's first network assignment since he did a 
game for ESPN in 1986. You'd think the networks would be clamoring for Miller, 
who is outstanding. ESPN is producing ABC's hockey telecasts and selecting the 
announcers. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Ann Meyers nor Larry Farmer, who both did nice work on the NCAA 
tournament last week, made the cut. The CBS announcing teams left are: Dick 
Stockton and Al McGuire at the West Regional, Greg Gumbel and Bill Raftery at 
the Southeast, Verne Lundquist and Clark Kellogg, East, and the Final Four team 
of Jim Nantz and Billy Packer, Midwest. . . . NBC will have five telecasts, 
three in prime time, of figure skating's World Championships, beginning tonight 
at 8 with taped coverage of the men's final. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC announced that Rick Davis, coach of the Los Angeles Salsa, and Seamus 
Malin will be its World Cup commentators, working with Al Trautwig and Roger 
Twibell. The ABC teams will also cross over and work some ESPN telecasts. 
Twibell, Malin and Davis will call the championship game July 17. Jim McKay 
will serve as host of ABC's coverage, which begins June 18 with the United 
States facing Switzerland at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 XTRA's Jeanne Zelasko made her Prime Ticket debut last Friday, doing a 
well-produced feature on San Diego Padre pitcher Andy Benes. With Prime Ticket 
San Diego going on the air April 18, Zelasko might become a Prime Ticket 
regular. She should. Not only is she talented, but unlike former Laker reporter 
Randi Hall, she is respected by her colleagues in the media. . . . Producer 
Heidi Palarz has put together an excellent feature on Dominique Wilkins that 
will be shown at halftime of the Clippers' game at Atlanta tonight. . . . Oops 
Dept.: A graphic on the 11:30 edition of ESPN's "SportsCenter" Wednesday night 
said Danny Manning and Joe Dumars sat out that night's Clipper-Detroit game 
because of flu. It was Wilkins and Dumars. . . . For the last two years, the 
Clippers, ARCO, AM/PM minimarkets and Smog Pros have been involved in a 
Neighborhood Pride project to help refurbish parks and playgrounds for L.A.'s 
youth. The project will be featured in a special produced by Tony Richards on 
Channel 13 Saturday at 4 p.m. before the Clippers' game at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slam Dunk: the Players' Show," a new show with Scottie Pippen and Ellen K of 
KIIS-FM serving as co-hosts, gets a trial run on ESPN Tuesday at 2 p.m. Derrick 
Coleman and Kenny Smith are contributing reporters. Featured are David Robinson 
and, naturally, Shaquille O'Neal. . . . Also on ESPN Tuesday, at 7 p.m., is a 
two-hour pay-per-view show designed for rotisserie baseball players. The cost: 
$19.95. To anyone who buys this show: Get a life. . . . Then there is 
Karatemania VIII on pay-per-view Saturday at 6 p.m. for $19.95. . . . 
Recommended viewing: The Stanford women's national championship basketball team 
of 1989-90 is the subject of PBS' "Frontline" Tuesday at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Latest rumors on the KMPC sale: Capital Cities will take control May 1, and 
Tom Leykis' name has surfaced as a possible host in the new "smart talk" 
lineup. . . . It's a big golf weekend, with the USA network and NBC covering 
the Players Championship at Ponte Vedra, Fla., and ESPN and ABC televising the 
Dinah Shore tournament at Mission Hills in Rancho Mirage. . . . The Mighty 
Ducks' Todd Ewen, who writes and illustrates children's books, will be on ABC's 
"Good Morning America" Monday about 7:45 a.m. . . . Roberto Duran fights on USA 
next Tuesday at 9 p.m. . . . The Naismith Award winners will be announced 
Sunday at 9:30 a.m. on CBS. . . . The John Wooden All-American team will be 
announced on Roy Firestone's "Up Close" Wednesday on ESPN at 9:30 p.m. and 
midnight.

NEWSWIRE: NORMAN'S 63 LEADS PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP

<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Norman took advantage of a soft, vulnerable course for a nine-under-par 
63 that led an assault on par Thursday in the first round of the Players 
Championship at the TPC course in Ponte Vedra, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The course, once criticized by players as being too difficult, turned docile 
in the ideal conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Norman birdied five consecutive holes and tied the course record 
set in 1992 by Fred Couples, he held only a two-shot lead over Tom Kite, Lee 
Janzen, Jeff Maggert and Colin Montgomerie. Jurisprudence  
</P>
<P>
 Six Hartford Whalers must complete 20 hours of community service during the 
off-season for getting into a fight at a nightclub owned by Buffalo Bill 
quarterback Jim Kelly. Arrested were Pat Verbeek, Geoffrey Sanderson, Marc 
Potvin, Chris Pronger, Mark Janssen and Todd Harkins, along with assistant 
coach Kevin McCarthy. The players, in town to play the Sabres tonight, pleaded 
guilty to trespassing. McCarthy also was charged with trespassing and faces a 
court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Vernon Maxwell of the Houston Rockets was fined $1,500 in Houston after 
pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of illegally carrying a gun in his car. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Municipal Court issued a bench warrant for the arrest of UCLA 
defensive back Tommy Bennett for failing to appear at his arraignment. Bennett 
was to have answered seven charges that included false financial statements, 
perjury, possession of forged materials and grand theft, university police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The referee of a fight Ray Mercer is accused of trying to fix testified in New 
York Supreme Court that he heard a lot of talking but he never heard the 
$100,000 bribe offer Mercer allegedly made. Wayne Kelly said he thought it was 
odd Mercer was accused because it was Jesse Ferguson he reprimanded during last 
year's bout. Hockey  
</P>
<P>
 The NHL Board of Governors voted to adopt a weighted drawing for determining 
the first pick in the annual entry draft beginning in 1995. This year's first 
two picks will be made by the Florida Panthers and Mighty Ducks. Skiing  
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Moe, spurred by finishing ninth in the downhill a day earlier, won the 
men's super-giant slalom in 1 minute 5.74 seconds, well ahead of Roman Torn of 
Canada, at the U.S. Alpine Ski Championships in Winter Park, Colo. Shannon 
Nobis won the women's super-G in 1:11.23, 0.02 seconds ahead of Picabo Street. 
Miscellany  
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's 200-yard relay team of Bill Schell, Brian Retterer, Tyler Mayfield 
and Joe Hudepohl set U.S. records twice at the NCAA men's swimming 
championships at Minnesota. Retterer also set an American record in the 100 
backstroke on the first leg of the 400 medley. Arizona's Chad Carvin also broke 
the American record twice in the 500-yard freestyle. . . . Allegations of an 
effort to conceal NCAA violations at the University of Maine surfaced again as 
Anne R. McCoy, the school's associate director of athletics, charged Mike 
Ploszek, the athletic director, with planning to hide eligibility problems.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; NIT; JONES HITS 14 OF 18 
THREE-POINTERS, SCORES 62 IN KANSAS STATE VICTORY

 Askia Jones scored 62 points in only 28 minutes and tied an NCAA record with 
14 three-pointers Thursday night at Manhattan, Kan., sending Kansas State to a 
115-77 romp over Fresno State in the quarterfinals of the National Invitation 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats (20-12) advanced to New York to face Vanderbilt in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones broke several Big Eight records, including the 61 points scored by 
Oklahoma's Wayman Tisdale in 1983. Kansas State tied an NCAA record for 
three-pointers in a game, making 23 of 36. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones scored 45 points in the second half, and his 14 three-pointers tied the 
NCAA record set by Dave Jamerson of Ohio in 1989. Jones attempted 18 
three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
 With 2:20 left, Wildcat Coach Dana Altman enjoyed a big lead, but put Jones 
back in the game. The Fresno State assistants raised their hands and looked to 
Altman, as if to ask "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jones had already scored 57 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman looked back and said, "He's going after a record." 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Eight mark came with one minute to play, Jones dribbling behind his 
back and driving into the lane for a jump shot.

 The Stanford women's basketball team made the most of its home-court advantage 
Thursday night, defeating Colorado, 78-62, in the NCAA West Regional semifinals 
before a sellout crowd of 7,000 in Maples Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-seeded Cardinal will play top-seeded Purdue, which defeated Texas 
A&M, 82-56, in the regional final at 9 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stanford-Colorado game was a rematch of last season's West Regional 
semifinal in which the Buffaloes ended the Cardinal's hopes of repeating as 
national champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stanford let a 12-point, first-half lead slip away, it made sure 
Thursday's game would not be a repeat of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford led at the half, 41-34, but Colorado went on an 18-10 run to take a 
52-51 lead with 12 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Kaplan then got a defensive rebound and made a layup at the other end to 
spark Stanford's 15-8 run that led to a 66-60 lead with 6:47 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal outscored the Buffaloes, 12-2, in the end to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan, a 6-foot-5 center, scored 16 of her game-high 29 points in the first 
half. Christy Hedgpeth, added 17 for the Cardinal (25-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Jamillah Lang scored 16 points to lead the third-seeded Buffaloes (27-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue 82, Texas A&M 56 -- The No. 13 seeded Aggies, reaching the West 
semifinals in their first NCAA tournament, were overmatched from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M's Kelly Cerny scored first, 20 seconds into the game, but 2 minutes 
20 seconds later, Purdue's Tonya Kirk stole the ball and made a layup. Cerny 
fouled Kirk on the play, Kirk made her free throw and the Boilermakers were off 
and running. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Purdue (28-4) broke away for good with 12:40 left in the half when 
Jannon Roland made a three-point shot to spark Purdue on a 16-5 run over the 
next 6:10. Purdue led, 29-16. 
</P>
<P>
 After Cerny made a layup, the Boilermakers scored the next 10 points to take a 
21-point lead, 39-18, with 3:11 left.  
</P>
<P>
 "We made too many mistakes," Texas A&M Coach Lynn Hickey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue led by as many as 38 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Johnson led Purdue with 23 points and seven rebounds. Texas A&M (23-8) 
was led by 6-4 center Martha McClelland with 15 points.

CHAMPION TEXAS TECH FALLS TO ALABAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was just a matter of time before Texas Tech was finished. Sheryl Swoopes 
isn't there anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Raiders could have used Swoopes, last season's player of the year, 
Thursday night in a 73-68 loss to Alabama at Austin, Tex., in the semifinal 
game of the Midwest Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda Watkins scored 17 points for the Crimson Tide, who used superior 
quickness to run defending national champion Texas Tech (28-5) out of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 An 18-8 burst by sixth-seeded Alabama (25-6) at the outset of the second half 
established control. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama will play top-seeded Penn State on Saturday night in the regional 
finals. The Nittany Lions (28-2) were 64-60 winners over Seton Hall (27-5). 
EAST REGIONAL 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina didn't have Charlotte Smith because of her ejection for 
fighting in a victory over Old Dominion on Sunday, but the Tar Heels (30-2) 
didn't need her in a 73-69 victory over Vanderbilt (25-8) at Piscataway, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonya Sampson hit a go-ahead layup with 1:28 to play, and No. 4 North Carolina 
scored the final 11 points to earn the right to play Connecticut (30-2), a 
78-64 winner over Southern Mississippi (26-5), for the region championship and 
Final Four berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Crawley had 22 points for North Carolina and held Vanderbilt's 
6-foot-10 center, Heidi Gillingham, to 13.

SOUTHEAST REGIONAL; HILL LIFTS DUKE OVER MARQUETTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slowly, Duke was sinking in the Marquette mud bog Thursday night, the same way 
Kentucky did in the round of 32, slogging its way through a 25-point first half 
that needed nothing as much as a good hosing off. 
</P>
<P>
 It was grimy, it was dirty, it was enough to send Duke forward Grant Hill 
screaming at teammates during the intermission, advising them what to do with 
the basketball the next time they had it and Hill didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!" Hill shouted, loud enough for Coach Mike 
Krzyzewski to hear across the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Krzyzewski wasn't fooled for a second. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's his way of yelling at me," Krzyzewski said after Hill scored 16 
second-half points to lift Duke to a 59-49 victory in the NCAA Southeast 
Regional semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's saying, 'You dumb Polack, get me the ball!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ask and you shall receive, Coach K always tells Hill. So Krzyzewski scrapped 
the idea of Hill bringing the ball down the floor each possession and had him 
concentrate on somehow finding a clearing in Marquette's tall blue forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill blazed more than a few trails, including one spectacular drive-and-jam 
over a startled Jim McIlvaine, Marquette's 7-foot-1 center, that sent the crowd 
at Thompson-Boling Arena into convulsions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a question for Grant," said Kryzewski, interrupting Duke's postgame 
news conference. "Grant, did I draw up that play when you drove down the middle 
and dunked over about eight people? I forgot how I drew that play up." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill grinned and said: "I have to give a lot of credit to Coach for than dunk. 
He's taught me a lot about attacking the hoop, the way he played at Army." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course. Air Krzyzewski. The famed Flying Cadet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grant's actually been watching a lot of my old Army films," Krzyzewski 
deadpanned. "I used to punch it down against Navy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill made seven of nine shots in the second half to finish with a game-high 22 
points. Duke (26-5) also got 12 points and five blocked shots from center 
Cherokee Parks, who helped the Blue Devils beat Marquette "at our own game," in 
the words of Warrior Coach Kevin O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Duke played a great basketball game on the defensive end," said 
O'Neill, whose Warriors lead the NCAA in field-goal defense. "We didn't shoot 
the ball well (31.5%), but there's a reason for that. Duke dug in on defense, 
rotated and came at us hard for 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most teams we played this year couldn't sustain that. They'd let up for six 
minutes at a time and we'd get some buckets. Duke never let up. We had some 
good shots at the end, but we were too worn down to make them." 
</P>
<P>
 Marquette, making its first Sweet 16 appearance since 1977, ends its season at 
24-9. Forward Damon Key scored 12 points for the Warriors. McIlvaine scored 11 
on four-of-13 shooting.

<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may well have been a preview of the Western Conference playoff finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Detlef Schrempf scored five of his season-high 27 points in the final 2 1/2 
minutes Thursday night as the SuperSonics, with the best overall and home 
records in the NBA, added to them by surviving a late Phoenix rally in a 
116-106 victory at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Schrempf made 13 of 16 shots, including nine in a row at one point. His dunk 
with 2:16 to play gave the SuperSonics a 107-99 lead, and he followed that with 
a baseline shot with 1:41 left for a 109-100 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley led the Suns with 25 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix cut most of a 27-point third-quarter deficit by playing better defense 
and limited the SuperSonics to 38 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 123, Minnesota 106 -- Hubert Davis scored a career-high 32 points at 
Minneapolis as the Knicks clinched a playoff berth and extended their winning 
streak to 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Bonner matched his season high with 17 points, Derek Harper scored 19 
and Patrick Ewing 17 for the Knicks, who shot 62% in a game that included 53 
personal fouls, five technical fouls and one flagrant foul on New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 123, Washington 117 -- Dee Brown scored a career-high 38 points and 
Dino Radja added 20 for the Celtics, who won in overtime at Landover, Md., and 
snapped a six-game losing streak.

of Denver's 11 blocked shots to pace the Nuggets in a victory at Denver.

SOFTBALL ROUNDUP; EL DORADO GETS SIX RUNS IN SIXTH TO DEFEAT CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Dorado's penchant for playing tough right to the end continued Thursday 
against visiting Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Down two runs, the Golden Hawks scored six in the bottom of the sixth inning 
to steal a 6-2 nonleague softball victory from the Comanches. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado (10-2) was able to avoid extra innings, which have been kind to the 
Hawks; they have beaten Garden Grove in nine innings, Cerritos in eight and 
Troy in 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get their backs against the wall and come out really hard," first-year 
Canyon Coach Chris Schaner said of the Hawks, who have only one senior, pitcher 
Heather Hamer. "They're a tough team; they believe in each other and they work 
real hard at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks never let up against the Comanches (6-4), who lost for the third 
time in five games. It finally paid off against losing pitcher Veronica Lopez, 
who had allowed only two earned runs in 43 innings before Thursday's sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Carrie Jeffries, who pitched two innings before being replaced by 
Hamer (5-1), tripled down the right-field line and scored on Roxie McManus' 
single. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Jenny Miskov singled, and an out later, sophomore Erika Rainey's 
bunt along the first-base line was allowed to roll foul by sophomore Kristy 
Hiatt -- except it stayed fair. That loaded the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikki Hart, whom left fielder Annette Bailey robbed of a hit in her previous 
at-bat, walked to make it 2-2. Then Miskov was safe under the tag of Lopez on a 
passed ball that got no more than six feet from catcher Jamie Al-Moradi. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelli Tom walked and Stacy Schaner had a two-run single. Tom later scored on a 
wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're young, but we have a lot of experience on this team," said Chris 
Schaner, a longtime El Dorado assistant. "We've got 10 girls who play 
year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had told me a year ago we would have two freshman starters in the 
infield, I would have laughed. But I've been pleasantly surprised with the 
caliber of players new to the program." MARTIN HENDERSON

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: COACH PURSUING HIS LOVE FROM DIFFERENT 
DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball's minor leagues are filled with players who toil for years for a 
chance to break into the majors. Rex Peters no longer counts himself among 
those masses, but he still is being paid to pursue the game he loves. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than three years after playing in his final minor league game for the 
Dodger organization, Peters is more than halfway through his first season as 
coach at Chapman University. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters, a former Cal State Fullerton and Orange Coast player, was released by 
the Dodgers after the 1991 season after he reached double-A San Antonio. He was 
a first baseman in an organization flush with first basemen, including a minor 
leaguer named Eric Karros. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved immediately into coaching, first at a high school near Portland, 
Ore., for a season, and then at Chapman to assist then-Coach Gary Henderson 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 After Henderson became an assistant at Pepperdine in July, Chapman promoted 
Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Peters' first year as a head coach hasn't been without frustrations. Chapman 
has a young, inexperienced team -- 19 of 23 players are new to the team, nine 
are freshmen -- and the Panthers lost their first 10 and 12 of their first 13 
games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just tried to stay as positive as we could," Peters said. "If you get down 
on young guys, they might throw in the towel. If you're 0-10 and you throw in 
the towel, you're going to have a real long season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers apparently responded. Since then they have won six of nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the charge have been three community college transfers: right fielder 
Duke Best, center fielder Boyd Sumner and first baseman Donny Disbro. 
</P>
<P>
 Best is batting .325, Disbro is batting .315 and leadoff batter Sumner is 
batting .310 and has stolen 10 bases in 11 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitching staff has been solid. Senior right-hander James Thomas, who 
received a medical redshirt last season after injuring his shoulder, is 1-6 but 
he has a 3.40 earned-run average. Junior right-hander Allistair Ray has a 3.80 
ERA and a 3-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers (7-15) won't have any postseason opportunities. Baseball is still 
technically an NCAA Division I program although it only has two Division I 
teams on the schedule -- Pepperdine, which beat the Panthers, 5-2, Tuesday, and 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Next season Chapman will be a Division III independent. Looking to the future, 
Peters is giving almost everyone significant playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chapman baseball is going to be a good Division III program," Peters said. 
"It's just a matter of when it's going to happen, and I think we're going in 
the right direction." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Gitte Mejer, a 6-foot-2 center on the Concordia women's basketball team, was 
named NAIA All-American for the third consecutive season. Mejer, a senior from 
Aarhus, Denmark, was a second-team selection. She was a third-team pick in each 
of the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejer, who averaged 24.8 points and 9.7 rebounds this season, finished her 
four-year career as the school's all-time leading scorer with 2,176 points and 
rebounder with 973. This season she broke the single-game scoring record twice, 
with 47 points against Point Loma Nazarene and 53 against Biola. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ila Borders, Southern California College's groundbreaking baseball pitcher, is 
scheduled to make two national television appearances April 4, a day after she 
throws out the first pitch before a Freeway Series game at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC Coach Charlie Phillips said Borders' is scheduled to appear on the 
"Tonight Show with Jay Leno" and the "Home Show" on that day. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also scheduled to throw out the first ball before a Dodgers-Phillies 
game April 20. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 1 the "Today Show" plans to air Joe Garagiola's feature on Borders. 
Garagiola put on the gear to catch a few of her pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said she had good stuff," Phillips said. "He turned to me and said, 'I 
know you didn't do it for the publicity because she can throw.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After getting no decision in the Vanguards' 4-3 loss to Pacific Lutheran 
Wednesday, Borders is 2-2 with a 3.15 ERA. In 34 1/3 innings, she has given up 
31 hits, walked 13 and struck out six.

BOXING AT THE IRVINE MARRIOTT; HERNANDEZ SCORES KNOCKOUT OF ALEXANDER IN 
SEVENTH ROUND 
</P>

<P>
 Carlos "Famous" Hernandez is still unbeaten and going strong after an 
impressive seventh-round knockout of Paris Alexander Thursday night at the 
Irvine Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez connected with two blazing lefts in the deciding round of the 
super-lightweight main event. The knockout blow came 2 minutes 6 seconds into 
the round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got one left to the head and the other to the body," Hernandez said. "I 
wanted to knock him out so badly." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez of Bellflower had overwhelmed Alexander in the first six rounds and 
was well ahead on points. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the three judges had given Alexander a slight advantage on points 
in the fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't tired in the round at all, but I may have been resting a little 
bit," Hernandez said. "He was an awkward guy to fight because he would grab me 
and hold on." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory left Hernandez with a 15-0-1 record and hoping for fight with 
Oscar De La Hoya. Alexander of San Francisco fell to 18-7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez had put himself in position for the knockout with a strong sixth 
round. He twice drove Alexander into the ropes with powerful lefts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the semi-main event: 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Bills of Vallejo was a surprise winner in the cruiserweight fight. He 
knocked out previously unbeaten Dwayne Rosette of San Diego with a left hook to 
the jaw 1:32 into the third round. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Rosette's first loss in seven bouts. Bills is 16-17-6. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bantamweight fight, John Vasquez of Huntington Beach made his 
professional debut with a first-round knockout of Pablo Barrios of Mexico, 1:28 
into the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonior Neequay of Ghana won a five-round middleweight bout over Ray Villanuva 
of Carson by a unanimous decision. 
</P>
<P>
 In a featherweight bout, John Ramirez of Oxnard and Manny Nava of Hawaiian 
Gardens battled to a six-round draw.

ROAR OR SOAR; * UNIVERSAL STUDIOS AND MAGIC MOUNTAIN DO BATTLE WITH TWO NEW 
ATTRACTIONS: JURASSIC PARK EXHIBIT AND BATMAN COASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Batman versus Tyrannosaurus Rex. 
</P>
<P>
 A clash of the titans? A script only Hollywood could love? 
</P>
<P>
 No, a pair of attractions at Magic Mountain and Universal Studios, both of 
which are based on popular movies, both of which debut this Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it: "The super-hero and the dinosaur grapple for tourist dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 In the foothills of Valencia, Magic Mountain has erected its most expensive 
coaster yet, the Batman ride, a twisting contraption that features a 
high-speed, suspended design. That means riders are strapped in from above with 
their feet dangling as they embark on a dizzying succession of loops, 
corkscrews and turns. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can feel the blood draining from your head," said Bill Kern, an Anaheim 
coaster fan who took a preview ride and found this experience enjoyable. "You 
can't really relate this to any other coaster. It's amazing the things they can 
do with the technology." 
</P>
<P>
 The same might be said at Universal, where the tour celebrates its 30th 
anniversary with Jurassic Park -- Behind the Scenes. Steven Spielberg has 
donated his private collection of notes, models and gadgetry for an extensive 
peek at the Oscar-winning visual and sound effects that went into this 
box-office monster. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit runs through May and serves as a precursor for yet another 
film-based attraction, a Flintstones stage show that starts in June. 
</P>
<P>
 As an opening act, Jurassic Park packs enough to entertain even industry-savvy 
locals. Housed in sound stage 29, where much of the movie was filmed, it begins 
with the towering park gate. Smoky air and a rumbling score re-create the feel 
of the movie, while overhead lighting grids remind guests that this is a chance 
to look beyond the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked with Spielberg as far as which tricks he wanted to reveal," said 
Don Burgess, who produced the attraction. Such "tricks" garnered three 
technical Oscars earlier this week. "Steven loaned us just about everything in 
his warehouse." 
</P>
<P>
 That includes storyboards and continuation scripts, the blueprints for the 
film. Video monitors show everything from selected scenes -- with commentary -- 
to a discussion between the director and "Jurassic Park" author Michael 
Crichton. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more impressive are the creatures themselves. A full-size velociraptor 
stands overhead. A brachiosaur pokes its immense head through a wall of brush. 
A triceratops lies on its side, breathing slowly. Later we learn that Buster, a 
pet dog, provided the breathing sounds for the film. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a wardrobe display and a section on computer animation. In the 
control room, guests sit at interactive computer panels and pretend to check 
the dinosaur park's perimeter fences and weather forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to get a feel for this," Burgess said, "to understand how 
movies are made." 
</P>
<P>
 The Batman ride, by contrast, seeks to extend the myth of the film. Magic 
Mountain is undergoing a multiyear renovation, dividing itself into themed 
areas. So the new coaster is surrounded by six acres of rusted mock factories 
and sooty tenement facades. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the grime and decay, the greed and avarice of Gotham City," said Kevin 
Barbee, a park designer. "It's a darker vision, something I don't think 
Disneyland would do." 
</P>
<P>
 Guests file through a storm drain. Twists of industrial-gray track rise above 
this bleak landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 From close proximity, the coaster's most noticeable features are its ski 
lift-style chairs. This configuration allows for greater G-forces as the ride 
clatters at 50 m.p.h. through two outside loops -- traveling outside rather 
than inside the looped track -- and something called a "heartline spin." 
</P>
<P>
 "We flip you 360 degrees while your heart stays at relatively the same point. 
You feel as if you're floating," said Jim Seay, the coaster's engineer. "So, 
during the loop you're hitting 4 Gs and then you come into a 0-G spin." 
</P>
<P>
 With no surrounding car and no floor, Batman offers a sensation of flight that 
is particularly vibrant for riders in the front seats. It is a surprisingly 
smooth, if not disorienting, journey. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is over in a blurry two minutes as riders burst through a wall of steam 
into Batman's cave. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the big ending that Hollywood craves. LIAISON: WHERE AND WHEN

PLAYING WHAT HE LIKES; * A RECENT ANTHOLOGY SHOWCASES THE MANY EXPERIMENTS OF 
VETERAN JAZZMAN EDDIE HARRIS, WHOSE FANS HAVE LEARNED TO EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Steve Appleford writes regularly 
about music for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eddie Harris is proud of his recent CD package, "Artist's Choice," which 
examines the veteran jazzman's career between 1961 and 1981 on Atlantic 
Records. But he's not preoccu pied with the CD, nor with the glories of his 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 That 20-year period launched the Chicago-born saxophonist and pianist and led 
to his most popular successes, including the 1961 record of "Exodus," which was 
the first jazz single to sell 1 million copies. There also were such tracks as 
"Listen Here" and "Cold Duck Time," and the 1965 song "Freedom Jazz Dance," 
which has since been recorded by more than 30 subsequent artists of varied 
genres. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris chose the tracks for the anthology, which was released by 
Rhino/Atlantic last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has five newer albums out right now, with more on the way, all of them 
exploring different facets of music that early fans of Harris might find 
surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, in recent years Harris has played blues with Albert Collins, 
recorded bluegrass, Latin jazz, funk and other styles. Not only that, but the 
longtime instrumentalist has been singing , too, "a la Ray Charles and Nat King 
Cole," he says with a smile. So when he arrives Monday at the Common Grounds in 
Northridge, fans may well wonder which Eddie Harris will be on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still encountering purists who think I'm totally off my rocker," says 
Harris, who has come from his home in Los Angeles to a Culver City hotel 
restaurant to discuss his multiple musical directions. "It's easy. I just have 
the mind set to do that. I detest categories. You should follow your mind 
first." 
</P>
<P>
 It goes back to the advice once given him by Billie Holiday, an early champion 
of Harris' playing. He says she told him: "No matter how good you play, 
somebody's going to dislike you. No matter how bad you play, somebody is going 
to like you. The biggest thing is, do you like what you play?" 
</P>
<P>
 To Harris, who as a young man in the Midwest played in bands with such 
innovators as Charlie Parker, Bud Powell and Roy Eldridge, "that makes a lot of 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
 That same attitude, he admits, has sometimes caused him problems with labels 
that have wanted him to follow a consistent hit-making formula and concert 
promoters who want to hear only the hits and not his usual onstage 
experimentation. It has also worked to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was always the case," Harris says, wearing a dark fisherman's cap. " 
'Exodus' came by mistake because I was signed to be a piano player. They said, 
'You sound too weird on the saxophone.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When he finally did record Ernest Gold's "Exodus" on the saxophone, Atlantic 
was convinced, and allowed him his experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris has developed several new customized versions of saxophones, trumpets 
and other instruments over the years for his own use. He also quickly 
incorporated electronic instruments into his music and was an early developer 
of fusion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The musician's tendency toward personal experimentation on stage leads Harris 
to tell audiences: "Don't feel bad if I play something you didn't like. It 
probably didn't occur to you, but I didn't like it either. But I didn't know I 
didn't like it until I started it, because I'm experimenting." He laughs. 
"That's the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz has become too predictable. It's becoming pop music," he says, noting 
that artists are too often crafting one show to be like another, with the same 
song list and choreography. "What happened to jazz, the spontaneity? It went 
out the window." 
</P>
<P>
 His own spontaneity was put to the test several years ago when he arrived at a 
gig in Cleveland with an empty saxophone case. While another musician in the 
audience ran home to bring back his saxophone, Harris just stood on stage and 
talked, and entertained. That experience ultimately led him to release an 
entire album of on-stage banter. 
</P>
<P>
 He explains: "I'm a person, not Eddie Exodus ." 
</P>
<P>
 The Harris performance marks a significant step for the Common Grounds 
coffeehouse, highlighting its regular Monday jazz night with a veteran artist 
who has more than 70 albums to his name. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the show is a $2.50 minimum purchase. The venue already regularly 
brings in such notable players as guitarist Rick Zunigar, a longtime sideman to 
Stevie Wonder; percussionist Brian Kilgore, who has played on more than 100 pop 
and jazz albums, and Bob Sheppard, the current saxophonist for Steely Dan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monday used to be our slowest night," says owner Paul Solomon, himself a 
onetime professional jazz trumpeter. "Then I instituted this jazz policy, and 
now it's one of our biggest nights. There is an audience out there for jazz."

POEM ON THE RANGE; * BAXTER BLACK AND OTHER LITERARY COWBOYS WILL GATHER IN 
SANTA CLARITA FOR A FESTIVAL CELEBRATING THEIR ART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAIL S. TAGASHIRA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baxter Black rushed to the phone and caught his breath as he answered the 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found the dog," he said. "He'd slipped into the barn. Spent the better 
part of two days in there. We'd been pouring a little cement, you see, patching 
some holes outside the barn where the colt had kicked in. Then the dog 
disappeared. . . . Thought he'd been either shot at or run over." 
</P>
<P>
 At his home in Brighton, Colo., northeast of Denver, where his thriving Coyote 
Cowboy Co. is headquartered, Black set time aside from his chores to discuss 
his appearance tonight at the Santa Clarita Cowboy Poetry, Music and Film 
Festival. But the style of his chat was much like his pieces for public radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, who has been called the poet laureate of the lariat, is a modern-day 
Will Rogers and the dean of the cowboy bards. At his 20-acre site, which Black 
calls his "place," he keeps livestock (cows, horses), fattens them up and sells 
them later. When he buys them, they are called "killers" because if he didn't 
buy them, they'd go to slaughter. (He has agriculture interests in Texas and 
New Mexico, but the Colorado ranch is not his main for-profit operation.) 
</P>
<P>
 He writes weekly columns, now in 109 U.S. and Canadian newspapers; shoots 
hourlong video specials for 140 public television stations; writes and 
self-publishes books (more than 150,000 sold at last count), and records 
3-minute weekly shows, laden with humorous commentary, for use by about 140 
stations, including National Public Radio. He also averages 100 appearances a 
year, and tonight, who knows what Black will draw from when he opens the first 
Santa Clarita Cowboy Poetry, Music and Film Festival to be held at Melody Ranch 
Motion Picture Studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a plan, but I have a lot of material," Black said, "and we won't 
know until we get there if we've drawn a bunch of farmers or people who are 
suburbanites who just like cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Clarita will be hard to judge. When I speak in Chino or Santa Maria or 
Brawley, it's different. There you have your vegetable growers and 
cattle-feeders. But now, Santa Clarita might be a little more like Evansville, 
Ind. You don't tell the same stories that would be inside jokes in Fresno among 
the cow business." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally budgeted at $83,000, the event had been set at Hart High School 
until the Jan. 17 earthquake damaged the school auditorium. But when the city, 
the festival's sponsor, requested a $13,000 federal grant, many citizens 
opposed having the event at all, since they felt their tax dollars could be 
better used for the homeless and other matters more pressing than a cowboy 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the festival is on for three days. Planners hope to draw 
buckaroos from throughout California and the West, the way the Cowboy Poetry 
Gathering in Elko, Nev., does every January. In fact, city officials modeled 
this weekend's program on Elko's gathering, after attending it last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to draw from the best-known, best-loved performers," event 
coordinator Cecilia Burda said, "the major artists from all over the country on 
the cowboy poetry circuit." 
</P>
<P>
 Black, 49, has attended every Elko gathering since 1983.  
</P>
<P>
 There's a distinct difference, he says, between a cowboy poetry show and a 
cowboy poetry gathering.  
</P>
<P>
 "A gathering is three guys telling each other stories. It's sort of based on 
reality. It doesn't require a ticket and it's held at a local high school. 
Someone might pick out a theme and the audience wanders from room to room. I 
have always thought of Elko as a gathering," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A show is when someone wants a good crowd and I'm supposed to draw a good 
crowd. I'm not Orson Welles reading to a bunch of blue-haired people in the 
garden, though. My background is medical, and as a former veterinarian, well, 
my subjects are sort of cow-y." 
</P>
<P>
 Black often gets asked to draw from his books of poetry, "The Vegetarian's 
Guide to the Cowboy" and "The Cowboy's Guide to Vegetarians." An excerpt: 
</P>
<P>
 I had planted a garden last April  
</P>
<P>
 And lovingly sang it a ballad .  
</P>
<P>
 But later in June beneath a full moon  
</P>
<P>
 I, forgive me, I wanted a salad!  
</P>
<P>
 When he appears in readings, Black is more widely identified with his opinion 
columns in newspapers such as the Florida Cattleman in Kissimmee, Fla., or the 
Midwest Marketer in Bloomfield, Iowa, than he is with his appearances on public 
TV or radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's virtually no crossover between people who hear me on NPR and people 
who know me as an agricultural columnist," he said, referring to "On the Edge 
of Common Sense," the agribusiness column he describes as "mostly humorous, 
occasionally political, accidentally informative." (Black writes about the 
values and issues affecting cowboys, farmers and ranchers. Recent subjects 
include the Bureau of Land Management, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt 
and the wearing of furs.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite often where I speak, people don't get public radio. But then I might go 
to a city where 70% of the audience listens to NPR. For some reason, there are 
pockets of NPR people -- like smokers in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Listeners familiar with Black's voice who imagine a gray, grizzled, hefty 
Wilford Brimley look-alike will be in for quite a surprise when he steps up to 
the microphone. He is rangy, lean and trim, with a bushy mustache and long 
sideburns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baxter is the classic-looking cowboy," said singer and songwriter Michael 
Martin Murphey, who, much like Black, is a rancher. Murphey lives in New Mexico 
and will bring his band to the festival for two shows Saturday. "He sure 
pleases the ladies. But then it's difficult to be paunchy if you do a lot of 
riding and ranch work." LIAISON: WHERE AND WHEN

 - "What Every American Should Know About American History" by Alan Axelrod and 
Charles Phillips 
</P>

 "My husband and I read it aloud as we drive to work. I was surprised at how 
much I had forgotten about American history. We're using this as a way to bring 
ourselves back up to speed." Dr. Christopher Jessen, orthopedic surgeon and 
medical director at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank

 "I have my medical journals, the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, and the 
hospital trade journals. But what do I really like to read? A James Bond type 
of book. You get that flair, that twisting intrigue." Steven Lavine, president 
of CalArts in Valencia

<P>
 - "Rivers in the Desert: William Mulholland and the Inventing of Los Angeles" 
by Margaret Leslie Davis 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked it up in the wake of the earthquake, trying to understand what we 
were all doing living in this dangerous place. It turns out, it's really a 
story of what the creativity and will of a person and a community can 
accomplish. That's what Los Angeles is, an accomplishment of will and 
creativity. That's what keeps us going." "Rivers in the Desert," an excerpt 
</P>
<P>
 Standing bareheaded in the chill, William Mulholland beheld for the first time 
the breathtaking, spectacular body of water called the Owens River. Gleaming 
too brilliantly to look at directly in the morning sun, the vast expanse 
appeared in the distance like a great, silvered mirror. It meandered down the 
length of the valley where it discharged its waters into a large alkaline lake 
at the lower end. Bordered by lush salt grass, reeds, water birch, and willows, 
the banks of the roaring river were lined in red columbine, orchids, and tiger 
lilies.  
</P>
<P>
 Mulholland's engineering mind could not help calculating -- even amidst all 
this beauty -- that within the Owens River were flowing at least four hundred 
cubic feet of water per second, enough water to provide for a city not of two 
hundred thousand, but of two million people. The distance to Los Angeles was 
overwhelming, but Mulholland knew the Owens River sat at an elevation of four 
thousand feet, whereas Los Angeles lay only a few feet above sea level. The 
water, carried in open and closed aqueducts and siphons, could arrive at Los 
Angeles 250 miles south by power of gravity alone. As (Former Mayor Fred) Eaton 
had told Mulholland earlier, costly pumping plants would not be necessary, and 
not one watt of pumping power would be required. Without a doubt, Eaton had 
discovered the resource that, once tapped, would free their city from 
stagnation.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought you were crazy," Mulholland shouted to his friend over the noise of 
the rapidly moving water. "But our supply of water is indeed in the Owens 
Valley." It was one of the supreme moments of his life, and his thoughts would 
return to it many times, especially during his later years, after tragedy had 
struck.

ART AND ANARCHY; * AN OKLAHOMA FAMILY'S PAST INVADES THE PRESENT WHEN TIME 
ITSELF "GOES A LITTLE NUTS" IN ERIC EHN'S DARK COMEDY. 
</P>

<P>
 Welcome to a day in the life of an ordinary Oklahoma family. But this is no 
ordinary day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an unusual day, in that some of the basic rules of time have been 
suspended," says playwright Eric Ehn, whose dark comedy "AOK (Anarchy in the 
Oklahoma Kingdom)" opens tonight at the Two Roads Theatre. "The father is out 
digging in the garden when he hits a 'timeline' -- and time leaks out, goes a 
little nuts. At one point, the characters are having a present-tense 
conversation, and then the past comes welling up, and they're remembering their 
first date or first betrayal." 
</P>
<P>
 The characters include Justin and Lee, their son Warren (who suffers from 
fetal alcohol syndrome), Justin's daughter by a long-ago affair with next-door 
neighbor Judy, and Lee's grandmother. "In a small Oklahoma town, you never get 
very far from your past," notes the writer, 36, a native of Croton, N.Y. "My 
mother's family is in Oklahoma, and at the end of (my) high school, she decided 
to move back there. So it's kind of a fairy tale place for me -- I know it only 
from the few summers I spent working there." 
</P>
<P>
 The play was brought to director Mark York by a friend with Oklahoma roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I read the first draft, I thought, 'What are we getting ourselves into?' 
" recalls York, who's been working on the piece since last summer. "It's very 
poetic, kind of inaccessible on the page, really artsy and lyrical. But once I 
heard it out loud, it began to make sense and be tragic and funny; it's just a 
ball. Eric is a very adaptable guy -- he likes to collaborate. And we've got a 
wonderful score by John Ballinger. The fun for me has been in the development." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years, Ehn has lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, 
dividing his time between Santa Clara University and San Francisco State, where 
he teaches playwriting. "It's so healthy, teaching undergraduates," he says 
earnestly. "Many of them are new to writing. You have to underline the 
fundamental principles of the craft. A lot of the time, I feel like I'm going 
to school. In graduate school, I think, you lose your simplicity. And theater 
requires simplicity, a sense of play." 
</P>
<P>
 Before moving West, Ehn ran a New York school for physically disabled adults, 
the National Theatre Workshop of the Handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're working with a group with a range of disabilities -- people in 
wheelchairs and blind people -- you have to find physical warm-ups that (adapt 
to) a number of bodies," notes the writer, who has a bachelor's degree in 
English from Yale University and a master of fine arts degree in playwriting 
from Yale School of Drama. "After graduate school I realized I'd been in school 
too long. I was trained to write for hypothetical spaces, abstract reason. It 
was like 'playwriting is so unremunerative, so ephemeral -- why do it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ehn, who was commissioned to write "Gravity's Drain" for the Mark Taper Forum 
in 1992 and served as literary manager at Berkeley Rep from 1991-93, found his 
answer in the work itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to see playwriting as social action -- political -- and I go where 
theater needs to be," says Ehn, who spends one day each week holding 
open-to-the-public workshops at San Francisco's Tenderloin Reflection Center. 
"It may not be the ideal tool of revolution, but it does organize people 
socially. It causes them to come together to create beauty. That reflex to 
assemble, to affirm community, is very powerful, very invigorating. Theater is 
about change: The text is changing, the words are changing, the people are 
changing." LIAISON: WHERE AND WHEN

RISING FROM THE 'MUD'; * THE ALLIANCE THEATRE'S RURAL DRAMA TELLS THE STORY OF 
A SPIRITED BUT SIMPLE WOMAN'S STRUGGLE TO BEAT THE ODDS.

 Lloyd and Mae are not your typical brother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "They live together, and it looks a little incestuous because they grew up 
together -- but they're not blood-related," explains Laura Leigh Hughes, who's 
playing Mae in Maria Irene Fornes' three-character rural drama "Mud," opening 
tonight at the Alliance Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very basic existence," the actress says of the poor, illiterate 
twosome. "They eat, they sleep, they have sex. It's a hollow, base life -- and 
yet Mae's spirit is full and alive, and she wants to express that." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the back story, Mae's mother died when she was a child, and her 
father brought Lloyd to live with them 17 years ago, when Mae was 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the father died, so she and Lloyd were left alone with each other," 
notes Hughes, who has been a member of Alliance Repertory for three years and 
appeared in the company's acclaimed 1991 production of "Rage!" 
</P>
<P>
 In "Mud," her character's pent-up longing and restlessness begins flooding out 
when a neighbor, Henry, is unwittingly drawn into the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mae can speak to Henry in complete thoughts -- he listens to her," says the 
actress, a Pittsburgh native who relocated to Los Angeles with her mother and 
four siblings at age 17. "I like her because she's a strong woman, with a 
hunger for knowledge. Her struggle is to have a better life; she's trying to 
get up and out of this. I identify with her struggle: As a person, there's so 
much I want to know. There are things I've learned spiritually, emotionally -- 
and like Mae, you think, 'I've learned that. Why can't I retain that, to make 
myself better?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes discovered the work of Fornes two years ago, when she contacted an aunt 
in Pittsburgh and asked her to recommend some women playwrights. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wrote back and said, 'Check out the plays of Maria Irene Fornes,' " 
recalls Hughes, who has a sociology degree from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 When she first read "Mud," the actress acknowledges, "I didn't really 
understand it, but it got to me on a visceral level. I'm so tired of seeing 
plays that focus on the men. I wanted to see the woman's focus, her struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Director Lora Zane originally staged a reading of "Mud" last summer at the 
Alliance -- with current cast members Hughes, Scott Campbell and Elkanah Burns 
-- and is a longtime admirer of Fornes' work. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very theatrical; I think she's a poet," says the director, a graduate 
of the Goodman School of Drama and a student in the USC master of fine arts 
directing program. "Her language is heightened, not realistic like Sam Shepard, 
and has that real consciousness. It's very intelligent and to the point -- but 
not in an obvious way. And I enjoy her central female characters: They're very 
complex and powerfully drawn. Mae is a spirited woman in the midst of a dismal 
existence, looking against all the odds to lift herself up." LIAISON: WHERE AND

THEATER REVIEW; COUNTRY PLAY GOES FOR THE CORN; * 'RIPE CONDITIONS' OFFERS A 
MADCAP STORY HEAVY ON RURAL CARICATURES. DESPITE THE NONSENSE, IT'S PURE 
ENTERTAINMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T.H. McCulloh writes regularly about 
theater for The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's an old adage that you can do theater anywhere. Roy Brock smith proved 
that when he opened his California Cottage Theatre in his Sherman Oaks living 
room. The theater is now in its eighth season and going strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe a little too strong at times during his current production of Claudia 
Allen's country comedy "Ripe Conditions." That refers not to the astonishing 
special effects that director Brocksmith has contrived, but to the often too 
highly flavored performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ripe Conditions" is pure country. Brothers Lester (Michael LeBeau) and Buster 
(Michael Liscio) coexist on a farm "somewhere in rural America." They fight 
like wildcats, annoying each other with arguments that have gone on from time 
immemorial, even before mama collapsed while plowing and kicked the bucket. 
Even before third brother Abner ran off with Ann (Ruth Cordell), the object of 
all three brothers' affections. They like to keep things in the family. 
</P>
<P>
 As the lights go up, there's a tornado on the way, literally and figuratively. 
The twister is imminent, but the brothers are more excited about Ann's sudden 
return to town for her own brother's funeral.  
</P>
<P>
 That's the plot, about as silly as a "Hee Haw" sketch. The overboard, 
caricatured acting compounds the play's thinness. Even Brocksmith's kinetic, 
stylized direction, with characters often addressing the audience, points up 
problems. The amazing thing is that it all works. It shouldn't, by any logic, 
but it does. It's a totally entertaining evening, a sure laugher, if you allow 
yourself to relax in to the madness. 
</P>
<P>
 LeBeau's Lester, fey for even the most sensitive country boy, has a continual 
cold and is forever bundled up. Liscio's Buster likes his weather crisp and his 
clothes off. That's how Cordell's passion-smitten Ann finds him, bathing in a 
bucket, as she starts to make herself right at home again -- with both 
brothers.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the twister hits just in time for the first act curtain, and that 
special effect is almost worth the drive to Sylmar Avenue. Its size, volume and 
movement, the theater's host Tuxedo Toby hastens to announce beforehand, may 
feel like an aftershock, but it's only the Cottage's way of shaking up the 
audience. It's astonishingly realistic. LIAISON: WHERE AND WHEN

NOT JUST A PASSING FANCY; FLAG FOOTBALL DRAWS EX-ATHLETES AND OTHERS WHO WANT 
THE FUN WITHOUT THE BRUISES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF PRUGH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He looks like a stand-in for Rudy, the Notre Dame football walk-on who 
inspired the recent movie of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 He stands all of 5 feet, 5 1/2 inches, this wisp of a fellow clad in headband, 
shorts, cleats and a blue jersey numbered "32," with raggedy sleeves that look 
as if somebody had fed them to a document shredder. 
</P>
<P>
 What's Dave Newman -- family man, Mid-Valley YMCA senior program director and 
a 42-year-old -- doing on Pierce College's football field, duking it out most 
Saturdays with guys (some young enough to be his children) who could almost 
stuff him into their hip pockets? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, just watch him play for a flag team named Thunder & Lightning, swerving 
and slithering through his arrayed opponents -- like a lightning bug, 
naturally! 
</P>
<P>
 See him snag footballs tossed by his quarterback, Al Cruz, and leave defenders 
often grasping at air and kicking (or cursing) themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Hear one stripe-shirted official say admiringly of Newman's foot speed: "Man, 
look at those wheels!" 
</P>
<P>
 And listen to Newman's 7-year-old daughter, Tiffani, a wide-eyed face in a 
crowd so sparse it could fit into a minivan, scream excitedly at her playmate: 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my daddy!" 
</P>
<P>
 You see, Dave Newman is a star in the rapidly thickening ranks of Fast Action 
four-man flag football, which consists mostly of ex-high school players and a 
few former collegians and pros on teams nicknamed Dirtbags, Wharf Rats, Barrio 
Dogs and New York Cynics, among others -- the teams grouped competitively by 
skill level. 
</P>
<P>
 He became the premier offensive player last season in Southern California's 
North Division (Woodland Hills), which in one year has doubled from a dozen 
teams to 24 and plays three seasons (spring, summer, fall), each lasting about 
10 Saturdays (including playoffs with South Division leagues that play 
concurrently in Cerritos and Costa Mesa). 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be 6-foot-6 to play basketball," Newman insists, "so why 
should size make any difference here?" 
</P>
<P>
 What Newman lacks in bulk he makes up in speed, savvy and finesse -- qualities 
he honed years ago at Woodland Hills' Taft High School. 
</P>
<P>
 His skills mesh perfectly with a sport that long ago began as "touch" -- then 
"flag" -- football on America's streets and sandlots, where school kids 
eternally huddle up and scrawl pass plays in the dirt or whisper strategy such 
as "You run deep to the trash can, then cut right toward the '79 Mustang." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the average guy's Super Bowl tournament, that's for sure," says Chuck 
Price, a onetime Cal State Northridge quarterback who serves as Fast Action's 
North Division director (and a player, too). He officiated games initially, but 
now he plays because "it's just too much fun." 
</P>
<P>
 "This game," adds Louie Smolkensky of Studio City, the league's local 
commissioner, "is designed so players can go to work on Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 When Price crafted Fast Action's rules (see accompanying box), he insisted on 
no contact and on teams with fewer players than in adult seven-man leagues, 
which allow blocking. 
</P>
<P>
 (Defenders "tackle" by yanking loose either of two "flags," or strips of 
synthetic yellow fabric, snapped to players' plastic belts.) 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the league is a modified spinoff of a program called Air-It-Out, 
organized two years ago with seed money put up by the National Football League 
-- first in Southern California, then in other NFL markets. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a response to "armchair quarterbacks" and "couch potatoes" who tired of 
just watching football and clamored for their own adult league -- not unlike 
those in softball, bowling and basketball. (A 3-on-3 tournament named 
Hoop-It-Up, as well as the NFL's Air-It-Out, are managed locally by Price). 
</P>
<P>
 Besides reducing the risk of injury by outlawing blocking and tackling, Fast 
Action encourages passing on almost every play (in keeping with the name Fast 
Action, passers must throw within 5 seconds after receiving the center snap), 
and everyone is an eligible receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Fast Action shrinks the field (to 50 by 25 yards), compresses each 
game (20-minute halves) and takes the foot out of football: Kicking is banned. 
</P>
<P>
 Most players are men in their 20s and 30s, although the league is open to both 
sexes, 16 and older, provided he or she signs a medical-liability waiver. Those 
younger than 18 must obtain written consent from parents, who also are required 
to sign the waiver. 
</P>
<P>
 And teams that sign up (limit: 10 players per squad) must pay a seasonal 
registration fee of $250 (with a $25 discount for those who pre-register for 
the next season), mainly to cover field rental, liability insurance and 
equipment, while per-game fees of $20 cash per team pay for commissioners, 
officials, scorekeeper and weekly statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 What used to be a sport confined mostly to picnics, beaches or schoolyards now 
boasts players who make fashion statements -- bandannas, earrings, sun visors 
and even glasses -- as well as thirtysomething ex-collegiate football stars 
such as Kevin Williams (USC) and Joe Adams (Tennessee State), who play on a 
team called the 888s. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, there are no more marching bands or dancing cheerleaders or roaring 
crowds to remind them of the way they were. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is an almost empty stadium save for a handful of players' children, 
wives, girlfriends and other hangers-on, but no empty-headedness behind team 
nicknames such as Bayou Boys (many are descendants of Louisiana Cajuns) and 
Marlboro Men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our players smoke -- we light up at halftime," says one Marlboro 
player, Tom Conway, 26, of Valencia, a free-lance electrician for TV shows 
including "Unsolved Mysteries." 
</P>
<P>
 But smoke aside, there's still fire in the eyes and feet of 36-year-old Kevin 
Williams, a USC wide receiver in the late 1970s. He showed flash and dash one 
recent Saturday morning even after working overnight as a Santa Fe Railway 
brakeman on the San Bernardino-to-Los Angeles line. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sport you can play in your 30s -- it helps you stay in shape," 
Williams says during a lopsided victory over the Quick 6, a team composed 
mostly of ex-L.A. Marshall High players who work as clerks in a Glendale 
department store. 
</P>
<P>
 It matters little to Williams, too, that this is a sport without sideline 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got Joe for that," he says, nodding toward Joe Adams, a towering 
quarterback who throws footballs so hard it's a wonder that nobody has to patch 
up the fences nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams grins. "We let Joe do the yelling -- that is, until we know he's 
wrong," he says. "Then we yell at him ." 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, Adams excels at keeping his voice at the decibel level of a 
Boeing 747. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the hell you doin'?" he shrieks at a receiver. "You should be turnin' 
out . Why are you turnin' in ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be outdone on the sideline, Adams' wife, Renee, adds to the cacophony 
when Joe plays defense: 
</P>
<P>
 "Rush 'im, Joey! Take it away! Wheeeee-oooooo! Good hustle!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Fast Action catches on with players (if not yet spectators), the 
league grapples with rough edges. A recent game matched teams difficult to 
distinguish: Both the Ironmen and Cowboys wore black jerseys. Players often 
must ask officials how much time remains because there's no scoreboard clock. 
And because not everyone yet fully grasps all the league's unconventional 
rules, tempers sometimes flare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me three games before I got it down," says one official, Earl Heath, 
who goes about his work good-naturedly, sometimes bantering and high-fiving 
with players. "One week we had to stop three or four times and look things up. 
But all the players are cool about it." 
</P>
<P>
 All day long, Fast Action swirls like a two-ring circus, with games played 
side by side and teams leaving as others arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 At midday, the gray-jerseyed Bayou Boys -- led by their quarterback, Scott 
Aaron -- arrive by car from Lancaster, gearing up for a showdown with "Rudy" -- 
a.k.a. Dave Newman -- and his blue-shirted Thunder & Lightning teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some teams need to carry their plays on cards," says Aaron, an ex-Reseda High 
player, "but we keep 'em in our heads." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bayou Boys' best play? "Fake right, go long," Aaron says. "Every time we 
use it, it works." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Newman, too, gears up -- headband in place, sleeves frayed and 
42-year-old "game face" properly taut. It's clear that this is no Elks Club 
picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the spectators are Newman's wife, Kelly, and children: Tyler, 6; 
Amberli, almost two months ("Born two days after the Northridge earthquake," 
Newman says) and, of course, the irrepressible Tiffani. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly has even brought the family's video camera. And who needs a play-by-play 
broadcaster? After all, there's Tiffani on the scene to make sure everybody 
knows who her daddy is. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bayou Boys don't follow the Newman family's script. They fake right 
and go long. They fake left and go short. They run double- and triple-reverses. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman and Thunder & Lightning put up a gritty fight. They strike often, but 
too late. The Bayou Boys win, 30-21. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, the Newmans' video camera stays packed and unused. Kelly Newman 
says she was too busy bottle-feeding Amberli to shoot game-action footage of 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Newman's "game face" now exudes disappointment. But days earlier in his 
YMCA office, he spoke philosophically about winning and losing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to tell my kids, 'Don't believe anyone who says winning isn't 
important,' " he said. "But I also tell them it's not the only thing that's 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 What matters most to Dave Newman on this game day, then, isn't so much that 
his team finished No. 2, but that he went home No. 1 with Tiffani. LIAISON:

GARDEN OF DELIGHTS; * ELIZABETH J. BERRY SAYS HER BRAND LIBRARY GALLERIES 
EXHIBIT CELEBRATES "THE SEXY, THE SENSUOUS, THE FUN." SOME DARK, FRIGHTENING 
IMAGES OFFER A BALANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

about art for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 To enter the realm of Elizabeth J. Berry at the Brand Library Art Galleries is 
to lose oneself in an ambience of sensuous shapes and colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Constructions and paintings in her installation, "Unfinished Business," draw 
viewers into fruitful gardens, the nature of the four seasons and charming 
visions of camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to promote and support and celebrate the bright, the sexy, the 
sensuous, the fun," Berry said. "If you only look at the dark, the bad, that's 
what you're going to get." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect nirvana here. Although Berry presents images that convey 
life's joy, she also reflects upon some of its ghastly aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Her brightly colored, house-like construction filled with replicas of apples, 
eggs and other earthly delights represents her idealized desire for children to 
be raised in gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 But the piece refers to the "sins of the fathers" and is called "House of 
Incest." A smiling but scary, sun-like father figure stands over the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The shape at the bottom of "Father Box" is a coffin. The face of the father is 
"nasty, creepy," but, Berry said, it "nonetheless is still a life-giving force. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Maleness is not inherently bad, but given the shape of human history, the 
balance between male and female, and within individuals, is out of balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she enjoyed bridging craftsmanship with fine art in her early 
constructions, the power of their implications became frightening to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to distance myself from them, so I started painting," something she 
had not done since she graduated from college in 1981, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally from the East Coast, she lived in Los Angeles for 2 1/2 years 
before beginning a divorce and moving back to Rochester, N.Y., in 1992. "The 
objects are much more constructed. The paintings are a lot more intuitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Berry began a series of egg-shaped images on wood called "Power Shields," 
symbolic forces that served as her protection. The process of making them 
involved a building up and sanding down of many layers of paint and other 
mediums, such as gold or silver leaf. 
</P>
<P>
 With the egg shape as a symbol for generative powers, the womb and blood, "I'm 
exploring aspects of woman-ness," Berry said. Her use of the word "sister" in 
the titles of images relating to the seasons -- such as "Sister Moon Over 
Spring" -- is "a conscious choice to reclaim things for women -- the female 
aspect to them." 
</P>
<P>
 But she is also concerned with larger, inclusive symbolism. In one "shield," 
the egg becomes sperm. "I try to look at the marriage of the forces, not the 
combat in them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional "Angry Woman Shield" and "Crying Child Shield" -- of paper, 
graphite, beeswax, colored pencil and acrylic -- were done after a visit with 
her parents at Christmas last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Memory Shield," which she also began after the holidays, "went through a 
zillion different appearances," Berry said. "Do we protect ourselves by bearing 
memory? Is it a good thing to always mine and unearth? There is depth in the 
layers, but also a glossing over." 
</P>
<P>
 Berry considers the "L.A. Egg" a transition piece, one of the first of her 
less weighty works. 
</P>
<P>
 The egg floats in front of an abstract landscape of lighter, almost pastel 
tones, but they are not entirely joyous. "I see that sky as beautiful, and as 
smoggy, murky sky. The grass is not real green."  
</P>
<P>
 A more recent, cheerful construction such as "Three Sisters" combines 
eggshells with luscious materials -- beads, bells and peacock feathers -- to 
revel in the joys of women's friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Birth of Emma," in honor of Berry's niece, joins wooden eggs with velvet, 
glitter and bird likenesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her latest paintings are the "Receding" shields. "I don't need them so 
much anymore," she said. "The paintings taught me that an awful lot of healing 
can happen on an intuitive level." 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the gallery are assemblages by Gail Tomura. A fine complement to 
Berry's work, Tomura's pieces depict the lighter and darker sides of life with 
"a gracious acceptance of both sides," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomura combines contrasting materials such as burnt matches and glitter to 
express this dichotomy and "to show that they can be compatible and harmonious. 
It is visually beautiful to blend those things together," she said. "The 
tactile quality is so key." 
</P>
<P>
 "Resigned & Gracious" showcases a woman with black hair and brown eyes and, 
like the other work, is "somewhat autobiographical in nature," she said.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: MAKING A POINT; * NEEDLEWORK CAN BE THERAPEUTIC. AND AT 
THIS STORE, YOU SEE A BIT OF SHRINK IN THE PRICES TOO.

 Hidden away -- and still standing -- at the end of Business Center Drive is a 
building housing one of Southern California's largest inventories of supplies 
for a proven method of stress therapy -- needlework. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers come from as far away as Santa Barbara, Riverside and Balboa Island 
to J. B. Unique Needlework Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Judith Bober's reputation for expertise seems to have spread. While I 
was chatting with her, a stitcher from Oklahoma City called for supplies and 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
 This beautifully organized store is strictly for the needlework crowd, not 
knitters or crocheters. Petit point, embroidery and cross-stitch are also 
included, but the emphasis is on needlepoint. 
</P>
<P>
 For beginners or experts, there are hundreds of canvases to choose from. The 
hand-painted patterns run from $10 to $3,500, and European-stamped canvases go 
for as little as $1 for a four-inch square to $400 for one that measures 3 by 4 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who are just learning, canvases that have been pre-worked are a good 
starting point. The floral design in a 30-inch bell pull already has been done; 
just the background needs stitching. These run about $25 and have been spotted 
at various antique stores for well over $100, so by practicing your stitchery 
on the background, you have already saved a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-worked piano seats run from $30 to $100, chair seats from $25 to $60. 
</P>
<P>
 The range of patterns in books, with three to four designs in each one, is 
astonishing. Subjects range from all forms of animals to florals, landscapes, 
castles, birds and clowns. 
</P>
<P>
 There are endangered animals, comical cats and mythical dragons. Many of these 
books are sold at 50% off the cover price. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the store's Bargain Corner, there's a sale every day. Cross-stitch, 
needlepoint, crewel and embroidery kits are 40% to 50% off retail. 
</P>
<P>
 But throughout the store, you'll find sizable reductions on other items. In 
addition to featuring a monthly special, Bober and her silver-haired staff mark 
down items each week. And the wall of the back room displays a dazzling 
selection of yarns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the shop's classes, beginner, intermediate and advanced students mix, a 
practice that Bober says spurs the beginners on. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of conversation that goes on in the classes, and that's OK," 
Bober said. "I tell them they can move their mouths as much as they want as 
long as they're moving their hands."

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SWEET 16; * CELEBRATION IS MAKING A COMEBACK, EITHER WITH 
TRADITIONAL GIRLS-ONLY LUNCHES OR MORE ELABORATE NIGHTTIME PARTIES WITH BOYS, 
MUSIC AND DANCING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every birthday is special, but some seem more significant than others -- a 
first birthday, a Jewish child's 13th, a Mexican girl's 15th -- and are 
celebrated with much fanfare. Somewhere in between is the Sweet 16, making a 
comeback in popularity locally. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to Sweet 16s, there are two camps: the traditional girls-only 
luncheons and the more elaborate nighttime parties with boys, music and 
dancing. The celebrations can be as diverse as your pocketbook allows. 
</P>
<P>
 Parties that are strictly female are "a bit calmer, a bit more relaxing," 
noted Beth Joseph, a Granada Hills High School junior who celebrated her 16th 
birthday with girlfriends at Cafe Bellissimo in Woodland Hills. Singing waiters 
and a woman who analyzed handwriting provided entertainment before the girls 
returned to the Joseph home to open gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's just girls, you can talk," Beth added. "You don't have to worry 
about boys being there. With boys there, it's fun, too, but it's different." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Nachman, who turned 16 in February, had a choice -- either a big 
birthday bash or a special gift. She opted for the gift -- a sporty black Probe 
-- and a small, intimate party with a handful of best buddies and relatives, 
including grandparents from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "She chose to keep it very low-key," said her mom, Rosanne. Michelle, a 
10th-grader at Agoura Hills High School, chose dinner at Cafe Bellissimo 
because the singing waiters provide a festive atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills mom Lorine Dempster wanted daughter Nicole's Sweet 16 to be fun 
while not breaking the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole, who wanted an intimate party, chose seven close friends -- all girls 
-- for a night on the town, which began at a Westlake craft store, where the 
girls painted ceramic boxes. A limousine then whisked them off to dinner at the 
Hard Rock Cafe in West Los Angeles. After a scenic drive back to the San 
Fernando Valley, they had a slumber party at a local hotel, with Mom and Dad 
chaperoning from an adjoining room. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Braemar Country Club, where weddings and Bar Mitzvahs are the usual 
affairs, Sweet 16s are still "pretty low-key," said Lynne LaFond-DeLuca, 
catering director for the Tarzana facility, which had 15 to 20 Sweet 16s last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luncheons, either poolside or in a private room, are popular, maybe with a 
fun theme, like south of the border or the '50s," said LaFond-DeLuca, adding 
that lunches average 20 to 30 people and cost around $400 to $500, not counting 
centerpieces, party favors or entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Party coordinator Karen Freshman, owner of Karen's Kreations in Northridge, 
says Sweet 16s can run anywhere from $250 for a simple luncheon to several 
thousand dollars for more elaborate affairs. If a girl is Jewish and has not 
had a Bat Mitzvah, her Sweet 16 may be a bigger deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Inviting boys "changes the complexion of a party," Freshman noted. "It becomes 
more of a party atmosphere than a girls' social. Girls seem happy to just 
mingle. Many kids would be happy to have a party at home with a deejay." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents will often hire her because they want "something different, something 
out of the ordinary that hasn't been done before." 
</P>
<P>
 For a mystery party, for example, a bus took about 40 boys and girls to dinner 
at a Mexican restaurant, then to a comedy club and finally to a midnight 
showing of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." 
</P>
<P>
 For nighttime gigs, Freshman says, dinner at restaurants is popular because 
the restaurant provides music and the kids can dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-ed parties are usually at night and often include dancing, says Stephanie 
Smooke, a senior at Harvard-Westlake School in Studio City, who had an English 
high tea at a restaurant with about 30 girlfriends and 10 female relatives. 
Entertainment was provided by the restaurant's palm readers. 
</P>
<P>
 While entertainment is fun, it's not really necessary to have a good time, 
Smooke says. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes (a party) fun," she said, "is when you're with a good group of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, a theme makes the event. For example, several Valley ranches and 
stables offer horseback riding, hayrides and barbecues for a down-home cowgirl 
look. One swashbuckling North Hollywood teen-ager made aged-looking "treasure 
maps" to invite guests to a pirate feast aboard the Buccaneer Queen at Ports O' 
Call in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Grace, senior charter sales representative for Hornblower dining yachts 
in Marina del Rey, says cruises range from about $20 per person for lunch 
aboard a Hornblower yacht to $159 per person for a dinner-dance cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the mode, party favors do seem important. Personalized gifts, 
including key chains, mugs and picture frames, are popular, Freshman says. 
Sometimes the favor is also the entertainment, such as caricatures or photo 
souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 When pricing restaurants, Freshman warns, be aware of hidden costs, such as a 
cake-cutting charge or room fee. Local high school students just starting out 
in garage bands may be a low-cost alternative to a more experienced deejay. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman also advises that invitations be mailed rather than flyers that are 
freely distributed. Beyond Cake and Candles 
</P>
<P>
 Popular sweet 16 party themes: 
</P>
<P>
 Casino night: Guests play with chips or tokens. Many casino-type games can be 
rented. You can also hire people to run them. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirate: Held aboard yachts or floating restaurants. Send guests "treasure 
maps" on parchment or singed paper, or stuffed in old bottles and 
hand-delivered. Throw some gold foil-covered chocolate coins on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock 'n' roll, '50s sock hop or ice cream social: Try '50s-style diners, such 
as Big Harv's or Johnny Rockets in Encino, among others. Some waiters 
entertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Western: Outdoor barbecues, horseback riding and hayrides fit this theme. You 
can even have someone teach line dancing if you can find teen-agers who don't 
think it's geeky. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic: Some restaurants, such as Wizardz in Universal CityWalk, play right 
into this theme. Or hire a magician. Invitations can be pulled out of a hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach blast: Bring blankets, picnic baskets, beach balls and shovels for a 
sandcastle contest. Find beaches with volleyball nets. Order long sub 
sandwiches. Write invitations on deflated beach balls or pails. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystery trip: Hire a bus or limo, or enlist other parents to chauffeur. Plan 
several stops: maybe dinner at a pizza parlor, then bowling, followed by 
dessert at an ice cream parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment: Hire a magician, palm or Tarot card reader, caricaturist (some 
will draw on T-shirts) or portrait artist, karaoke equipment, hypnotist or 
comedian. Or go to a play or murder mystery dinner. ROBERTA WAX

TELL ME WHAT TO WEAR; * FOR OBJECTIVE, TRUTHFUL SHOPPING ADVICE, A FASHION 
CONSULTANT'S SERVICES MIGHT BE JUST THE TICKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Cindy LaFavre Yorks writes 
regularly about fashion for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm what the fashion industry calls a rag brat. My father sells women's 
apparel. My mother, a fashion design major, once protested -- and succeeded in 
amending -- the exclusion of go-go boots at my strict parochial school. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I find myself challenged by unsavory fashion trends -- loathsome grunge 
and ill-fitting rayon separates littered with nauseating floral prints. 
Unwilling to wear clunky shoes, floppy bell bottoms and tunic tops so roomy you 
could drive a Buick through them, I begin to worry how to dress hip without 
looking like a grandmother. Rather than panic, I decide to turn to a fashion 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Colella, who operates Head 2 Toe, a fashion consulting business, handles 
my telephone call with enthusiasm and a gentle warning. "Sometimes people 
aren't ready for my advice; they really don't want help, or don't want to hear 
what I have to tell them," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 I reassure her of my receptiveness during a 10-minute conversation. I leave 
out my fashion history and tell her only that I am a self-employed home-office 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
 I explain that I have a great deal of flexibility on what I wear. My wardrobe 
basically consists of clothing to wear to church and nice restaurants, and 
ripped, faded shorts and T-shirts relegated to house painting and gardening. I 
tell her that I tend to buy the same skirt or blouse in a number of colors -- 
black and navy predominate -- and that I need more weekend wear in my wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Colella absorbs the information and says she can envision what I have. We make 
an appointment to meet and shop.  
</P>
<P>
 Colella, dressed in a casual chic black outfit, shows up on schedule at the 
shoe department at Bullock's in Fashion Square Sherman Oaks. She shakes my hand 
and compliments me on my fitted, elongated navy blue vest, white blouse, long 
skirt and navy opaque hose. "Very slimming," she proclaims. Relieved, I exhale 
and silently congratulate myself on a good choice. 
</P>
<P>
 She asks to see my legs. I lift my skirt. She gives my gams a high approval 
rating as a few employees try to stare nonchalantly. She OKs short skirts for 
me, and suggests some of the au courant granny boots (the lace-up mid-leg 
height to wear with leggings or longer skirts). To add some height to my 
semi-petite stature, she recommends a slight heel on my shoes. She suggests 
some casual shoe purchases, since I already have a number of dressy, 
high-heeled pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Our next stop was the petite department, where she has already scoped the 
scene and makes a couple of suggestions. We then head to the junior department. 
A "thirty-something" woman, I express surprise about shopping there and she 
gently urges me to avoid getting old before my time. She suggests long vests 
with leggings, long pleated skirts and even short slim skirts for my diminutive 
but not necessarily skinny body. 
</P>
<P>
 She asks what I have in terms of accessories. I tell her that I have a few 
great pairs of earrings and one long DKNY necklace, a Nordstrom bargain from 
two years ago that is still in style. She suggests a few more long necklaces, 
and I file away the info.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As she shops, wandering from Bullock's to several other clothing and shoe 
boutiques in the mall, she points out garments I should consider, mentioning 
items from my wardrobe that would coordinate well with a new purchase. Her 
memory is excellent and I can almost see the wheels turning in her head. To 
test her judgment, I purposely ask her about items I wouldn't be caught dead 
in. When she diplomatically yet firmly says, "I'm not crazy about that," in 
response to a long, tent-like dress and a loud printed top, I know that I can 
trust her. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike a well-meaning friend who may not brave the truth or even really care, 
consultants make it their business to advise, even if the information is not 
always flattering to a person's taste or inclination. 
</P>
<P>
 One hour -- and $50 later -- we shake hands again and I am off to reconsider 
the items she has recommended. However, my lack of cash isn't in tune with my 
wealth of new advice. I buy a long glass bead necklace -- very hip and trendy 
-- and some matching amber-like earrings, and I'm off, feeling decidedly more 
haute . 
</P>
<P>
 Although Colella affirmed that I am hardly a fashion misfit, I did benefit 
from her advice. She gave me the confidence to try new ideas and showed me how 
to expand on them. She steered me away from the dressy clothes I like but don't 
need. But the most valuable aspect of hiring a wardrobe consultant was 
objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
 A good consultant is obligated to critique your fashion choices more candidly 
and with more interest than a friend who is preoccupied with shopping for 
herself, or a salesperson with a commission to earn. You pay consultants to 
devote their full attention and energy to helping you make sound style 
decisions. By doing so, you can rest assured that you won't be one of those 
women teen-agers pass in the mall and openly giggle over. I know I'm breathing 
easier these days on my way past Contempo Casuals. LIAISON: WHERE TO GO

CARD CRAZE POPS UP; * CLASSES TEACH CRAFTERS HOW TO DECORATE AND CONSTRUCT 
MULTILEVEL ANNOUNCEMENTS AND SEASONAL GREETINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Look out Hallmark, do-it-yourself pop-up greeting cards are the latest craft 
craze. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired of sprinkling glitter and sequins onto flat cards, craft aficionados are 
opting for the element of surprise when sending invitations, announcements and 
seasonal greetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the rubber-stamp craze has mushroomed, people are searching for new 
things to stamp, and pop-up cards are the perfect medium," says Reuben Allen, 
who teaches greeting card classes at the Paper Post in Westlake Village, 
Learning Tree University and Kids at Heart in Northridge. "Pop-up cards are 
perfect, because there are so many surfaces to decorate." 
</P>
<P>
 Pop-up card instructors usually start students with what Lynn Lacey at Stamp 
Into Burbank calls the "idiot-proof card," a simple insert that pops out the 
top of the card. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just take two folded cards and insert them inside each other," says Lacey, 
who has taught pop-up classes for three years. "It's just a simple fold that's 
glued down." 
</P>
<P>
 More advanced techniques that result in three or more levels of action require 
extensive measuring and gluing. "With advanced cards, you need to incorporate 
what I call little support beams that hold the different levels up," Lacey 
says. "If your measuring is off just one quarter-inch, the card just won't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 To overcome that obstacle, Allen distributes up to a dozen patterns at his 
pop-up classes, attended by a dozen or more students. "Castles and houses are a 
popular form people use in the advanced cards," he says. "I had one student 
create a castle that opens up. In the entryway was a Santa Claus, behind him 
some steps and animals, and on the second floor, an elf. And a large clock 
popped out of the third floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always tell students that I want them to outdo me. It happened with that 
card. I think it took her a couple of hours to make it." Allen's beginning 
class also covers the basics of creating an animal figure that surrounds a 
large pop-up mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 For the cut-and-paste-impaired, Lacey sells cut and scored pop-up cards that 
are usually seasonally themed. A package of nine trees or hearts, for example, 
that are ready to decorate sells for $5.99. 
</P>
<P>
 The genre also includes a pop-up box, a veritable architectural masterpiece 
that folds up and can be placed into an envelope. Lacey also sells prefab box 
pop-ups (less than $10) and teaches students how to make their own boxed 
gardens, castles and houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Decorating the cards precedes the actual construction, as it's difficult to 
sprinkle glitter or stamp designs on constructed sections that interfold. Lacey 
says baskets of flowers, bears, balloons, butterflies and bunnies are popular 
subjects. Allen adds that seasonal items -- trees, hearts and pumpkins -- are 
popular as well as "romantic elements, like people kissing, or two kids holding 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise birthday parties are the event of choice for most pop-up designers, 
says Allen, but wedding invitations and birth announcements also lend 
themselves to the startling effects the cards produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen also teaches how to build accordion-fold books, an Asian art that he 
considers the predecessor to pop-up, along with the Japanese technique of 
origami, the art of folding objects out of paper without cutting or pasting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accordion books have hard covers on each side, with panels that accordion out 
on the inside," Allen says. "You can have as many panels as you want. Some fold 
out to eight feet or more." Sizes also vary, he says, from miniature tomes of 
one inch square to larger books. 
</P>
<P>
 The insides are stamped or decorated with drawings or constructed from unique 
papers, such as rice paper. "Accordion books can be thought of as an elaborate 
greeting card," says Allen. "People put cords or ribbons on the spines and give 
them as gifts or use them as decorations. And some people are using small ones 
as lapel pins, tied with a cord and worn on clothing." WHERE AND WHEN

RESTAURANT REVIEW; FOOD ON THE TRACKS; * VINCENT HILL STATION TREASURES ITS 
TRAIN DEPOT ORIGINS, SERVING FRENCH SPECIALTIES IN A CHUCK WAGON SETTING 
</P>

<P>
 It's no secret that this high desert town has become considerably less exurban 
of late. Acton, perched directly above the Antelope Valley, now boasts its own 
Metro Rail stop. 
</P>
<P>
 French cuisine -- one of the necessary trappings of big-city life -- is a 
newfound raison d'etre for Acton's leading restaurant, Vincent Hill Station. 
Never mind that this rustic roadhouse predates Metro Rail by several years. The 
restaurant has enjoyed a renaissance since the earthquake induced local 
commuters to abandon their private vehicles for the train. And the food, if 
memory serves, is better than it has been for quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Rustic has become a restaurant buzzword, but here it applies nicely. The 
restaurant treasures the hand car and the railroad tracks in front of the 
building that recall the days when this building was a working train station. 
The dining room is entered through an authentic-looking all-wood saloon that 
would be perfectly in character in Cheyenne or Lubbock. But Vincent Hill 
Station is no ordinary chuck wagon. The owners honed their craft at Rive Gauche 
Cafe on Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, and they've put together a pleasing 
menu of French standards. You've seen these dishes before, though perhaps not 
in the high desert: escargots Provencal, French onion soup, duck with fruit 
sauce, poached salmon. It's no small comfort to note that all are reasonably 
priced and decently put together. 
</P>
<P>
 The French onion soup, for instance, is properly beefy and nicely crowned with 
melted Gruyere cheese, bubbling down the sides of the tureen like good kid 
food. There's a barbecued pork rib appetizer, but I have requested -- and 
gotten -- a different rib to start the meal: an appetizer portion of the entree 
called pork ribs Vincent Hill. These are a tender, stewed version of baby back 
ribs, five or six to an order, in a spicy broth. Curiously, the dish is spiced 
more like a Chinese dish than a French one. I think I tasted anise in the 
broth, as well as chiles and some aromatic I can't identify. 
</P>
<P>
 The escargots are chewy and classically served in a garlicky parsley butter, 
which would be better with a bit less lemon juice. Mushrooms stuffed with crab 
overdoes it in a different way. The four fat mushroom caps are stuffed with a 
fine duxelles into which finely chopped crab meat is mixed, adding nice flavor 
and texture. But then the mushrooms are smothered in a thick cream sauce, which 
dilutes the juices and adds little but calories. 
</P>
<P>
 All entrees other than pasta come with a good, homey soup or a standard salad. 
The best pasta, for the record, is penne . The little tubes are lightly tossed 
with fresh-tasting goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes. (The other pastas I've 
tasted here are nice, too, but overcooked.) My favorite entree is a Cajun 
version of scampi. The chefs saute large prawns in a light sauce with garlic 
and Cajun spices, and they're perfect with a fragrant mound of rice. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish all the sauces here were as light as that one, though. The grilled pork 
chops, for instance, taste pretty good on their own; they don't need their 
thick, though tasty, tarragon mustard sauce. There's a creditable roast duck in 
a sweet cherry sauce, but this sauce also gets cloying after a few bites.  
</P>
<P>
 Pass on the slices of roast tri-tip, piled up pell-mell on the plate with 
sauce Bordelaise (red wine, shallots and handfuls of chopped parsley). They're 
over-salted. The artfully poached salmon comes blanketed with a ponderous sauce 
based on vermouth, unless you ask for the sauce to be served on the side. New 
York steak -- a good-size cut -- can be had either with sensible glazed 
shallots or a deliriously rich Cognac-green peppercorn sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a real cellar underneath the restaurant, and the owners have stocked 
it with a nice selection of vintage wines from France and California. I have to 
admit astonishment at seeing a $285 bottle of Chateau d'Yquem, one of the 
world's most expensive dessert wines, on this wine list. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad most of us can't afford this ambrosial liquid, because the so-so 
cheesecake, excessively grainy creme brulee and marquis cake (a ladyfinger and 
ganache creation) are nowhere as good as a great dessert wine.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, I wouldn't have been able to partake of the Yquem even with 
an unlimited budget. I had a long drive home, and friends don't let friends 
drink Yquem and drive. Next time, I think I'll ride the rails. LIAISON: WHERE

 POLITICAL FOREST: Seal Beach's Marina Hill section became so thick with 
reelection signs for Mayor Gwen Forsythe that residents nicknamed the area 
"Forsythe Forest." But this week, with Tuesday's city election approaching, 
somebody mysteriously swiped nearly 300 signs citywide for Forsythe and her 
council ally, Marilyn Bruce Hastings. . . . Seal Beach police are 
investigating. Meanwhile, their supporters are busy creating handmade 
replacement placards.

 THE BIGS: Junior amateur golf champion Kellee Booth of Coto de Caza got her 
first chance to tee it up in a professional tournament, at this week's Dinah 
Shore event in Palm Springs (C12). So how did she fare in Thursday's first 
round? A frustrating 43 on her first nine holes. But her second nine, Booth 
showed she can play with the best of them, with a 2-under 34. "It was a 
wonderful experience, just a matter of settling down," she says. She'll have to 
improve that 77 today, though, to make the weekend cutoff. 
</P>
<P>
 RABBI(T) HELP: Bugs Bunny may or may not be Jewish, but he came in handy 
Thursday at the Tarbut V'Torah Community Day School in Costa Mesa. Rabbi Marc 
Rubenstein used him and Tweety Pie, above, in a puppet show to explain the 
meaning behind Saturday's Passover Seder. . . . "We always do a model Seder 
before Passover, sort of a dress rehearsal," says Principal Bernice Gelman. 
"The rabbi and his puppets most effectively brought historical events into 
contemporary life."

<P>
 NEW DUCK TROUPE: If you saw the first "Mighty Ducks" movie, then you'll notice 
a change of uniform for the young team of misfits in Disney's "D2 The Mighty 
Ducks" (F10). First life imitated art, when the Disney NHL hockey team was 
named after the movie. Now art imitates life: The new movie team uses the real 
Mighty Ducks logo and uniform. The movie, filmed partly at Anaheim Arena with 
thousands of local extras, opens at 26 theaters in the county today.

NEW GTE CENTER IN OXNARD TO ADD 650 JOBS; BUSINESS: DECISION BY THE THOUSAND 
OAKS-BASED PHONE COMPANY HELPS OFFSET THE CITY'S RECENT PLANT CLOSURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 GTE California announced Thursday that it will establish a customer service 
center in Oxnard, a move that will bring 650 jobs to a city reeling from a 
spate of plant closures and job losses in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 By September, the Thousand Oaks-based telephone company is scheduled to be 
open for business at a never-used office building at Rice Avenue and Gonzales 
Road, GTE spokesman Mike Raydo said. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE chose Oxnard because it is near the company's Thousand Oaks headquarters 
and because local officials aggressively recruited the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at several locations, but Oxnard has been very proactive and very 
good as far as helping us through the process," Raydo said. "We're happy to be 
staying in Ventura County. There's a good work force here that we can draw from 
and educate." 
</P>
<P>
 GTE will transfer 250 of its employees to the new center and hire 400 new 
workers to staff the facility, which will consolidate work done at GTE offices 
throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there will be no layoffs as a result of the consolidation, nine 
service centers will be closed, including facilities in Camarillo and Newbury 
Park. The 1,300 employees at those centers will be offered jobs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Oxnard center, which will be housed in the 115,000-square-foot Chevron 
USA building in the city's northeast area, will schedule service calls for 
repairs and handle customer billing questions and other inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials see GTE's decision as the product of prolonged efforts to 
lure new business to the city as a way of boosting the local economic base. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the center couldn't have come at a better time. Oxnard is choked by 
double-digit unemployment and has lost an estimated 2,000 jobs in the past five 
years. And in 1992, Abex Aerospace, one of the city's largest employers, 
decided to shut down its Oxnard plant and lay off more than 500 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing Abex was a big blow but I think that this is going to offset a lot of 
that," Councilman Mike Pliksy said. "This is a major conquest, and I think GTE 
now will become the nucleus for a lot of other activity in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Councilman Tom Holden: "This kind of thing doesn't happen by accident. 
We have worked hard to show that Oxnard is a business-friendly place." 
</P>
<P>
 GTE had been torn between setting up its service center in Oxnard and a 
competing site in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 But company officials said they were swayed by a groundswell of community 
support in Oxnard. A full-page advertisement, sponsored by the Greater Oxnard 
Economic Development Corp., ran in a local newspaper, urging GTE to come to 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Chamber of Commerce contacted GTE to answer questions about the 
community and offer other kinds of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County has some natural attractions to it," said Marc Charney, 
president of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. "But I also think a 
good message has been sent out over the past several months. We've extended our 
hospitality to new businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to boosting the local economy, city officials and economic 
development advocates say GTE's move will have other advantages. GTE will bring 
hundreds of clerical and other semi-skilled jobs to the area that pay between 
$10 and $15 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Those workers will spend money and pay taxes in the county, further 
stimulating the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Of equal significance is that GTE will lease a $15-million office building 
constructed in 1990 by Chevron USA but never occupied. Chevron had planned to 
base its Southern California regional headquarters in the three-story building, 
but later decided to move most of its offices to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials say now that GTE has been landed, they can start to work on 
attracting other businesses to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed this very badly," said Steve Kinney, president of the Greater 
Oxnard Economic Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we would have survived if it hadn't happened, but we needed to turn 
the corner and start regaining those jobs that we had lost," he said. "This is 
a good and very substantial first step, but it's just a first step."

TEXACO SAYS IT NEVER CONCEALED MASSIVE '93 SPILL; VENTURA: ATTORNEY REPEATS 
POSITION THAT THE FIRM IS NOT CONVINCED THE GAS CONDENSATE BELONGS TO THE OIL 
COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT and JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Texaco executives on Thursday strongly denied charges that the company failed 
to report the extent of a massive spill of gasoline-like liquid at its lease 
north of Ventura in School Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Texaco at no time has concealed anything with respect to this site," said 
Robert Fuller, an attorney for the oil company. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill came to light last week when prosecutors served a search warrant at 
a Texaco facility in Ventura, looking for documents to support allegations that 
the company failed to report the extent of its January, 1993, spill. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Fuller also denied allegations by state wildlife officials that 
the company probably knew about the magnitude of the spill because it repaired 
a broken pipeline near the spill, estimated at 370,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 That pipeline was repaired in 1989 or 1990 after a worker discovered a mist of 
gas condensate spraying from a small crack, Fuller said. A rubber clamp was 
placed around the crack and a 100-foot older section of the pipeline was 
replaced the next day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller said the pipeline's low capacity would have made it nearly impossible 
for 370,000 gallons of gas condensate to escape from the pipeline. Also, since 
the spill was reported by Texaco in January, 1993, the pipeline has been 
pressure-tested three times and found to have no leaks, Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's press conference by Texaco was the latest twist in a series of 
spills in Ventura County in recent months. Even as Fuller was making Texaco's 
statement in Ventura, a deputy district attorney confirmed that another 
oil-related spill has been uncovered in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 An Oxnard refinery allowed oil and other petroleum products to leak into the 
ground at least four times last year, endangering the ecologically sensitive 
Mugu Lagoon, prosecutor Gregory Brose said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Refinery Co. officials knew the spills were illegal but allowed them to 
continue, Brose said. Officials are not sure how much crude oil and diluent 
were released over the four-month period, but believe it could amount to more 
than 10,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office filed a civil lawsuit earlier this month 
against Tenby Inc. and Hailwood Inc., which jointly own and manage the refinery 
at 3450 E. 5th St., Brose said. Also named is Morley Chase, the chief executive 
officer of both corporations, Brose said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit came about after a yearlong investigation into the refinery's 
practices by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, working with state 
wildlife and water officials, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, prosecutors contend that refinery officials broke state and 
federal laws by allowing crude oil and a liquid used as petroleum thinner to 
flow into soil, ground water and an irrigation ditch near the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also alleges unfair business practices as a result of the discharges 
and seeks up to $110,000 in penalties against the company. Prosecutors also 
want an injunction ordering Tenby to stop the toxic discharges, Brose said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has 30 days to respond to the March 4 lawsuit, Brose said. Calls 
Thursday to Chase seeking a response to the allegations were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Texaco spill, statements by state wildlife officials outline the basis 
for a criminal investigation. In a court affidavit filed earlier this week, 
Fish and Game Warden Holly Ethridge said her investigation showed that Texaco 
knew the pipeline was leaking fuel and tried to conceal it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethridge cited the patched pipeline in supporting her findings, saying company 
officials initially denied knowledge of the pipeline or its repair. She also 
said company officials should have noticed the loss in its daily "pumping 
logs." 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline pumped gas condensate -- a highly toxic and flammable liquid -- 
from one Texaco facility to another. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fuller said Thursday that no discrepancy in the logs had been noticed by 
Texaco. Company officials believe the spill was "very old," occurring over 
several years, rather than a sudden rupture. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fuller again stated the company's position that it is not convinced 
the spilled gas condensate belongs to Texaco, he acknowledged the oil giant is 
prepared to spend up to $1.5 million to clean up the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said they believe they have contained the contaminated soil 
and underground water so that none of it will run into School Canyon Creek, 
which feeds into the Ventura River. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three months, two other oil-related spills and leaks have been 
discovered in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In late December, 84,000 gallons of thick crude oil flowed into McGrath Lake 
near Oxnard. And earlier this month, a 30,000-gallon mixture of light crude oil 
and water flowed from a Unocal oil lease into the Adams Canyon Barranca in 
Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game Capt. Roger Reese said Thursday the powerful storm that hit 
Ventura County Thursday will have no significant effect on any of the oil 
spills. The School Canyon spill has been shored up with containment devices to 
prevent any problems, and cleanup at the Adams Barranca spill is nearly 
complete, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The discharges found at the Oxnard refinery are underground and are not 
migrating in any direction, he said.

COUNTY MAY IMPOSE CONTRACT ON NURSES; LABOR: HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS ARE POISED 
TO TAKE THE FINAL OFFER TO SUPERVISORS. UNION HOPES FOR NEW TALKS TO AVERT A 
STRIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After 11 months of dickering with nurses over pay and seniority issues, 
Ventura County Medical Center administrators are poised to ask the Board of 
Supervisors to impose a salary and benefits package on the health-care workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses at the county hospital have flatly rejected what the county says is its 
best and final offer, and no new contract talks are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 But the local chapter of the California Nurses Assn. -- whose members voted 
Wednesday to authorize a walkout -- is still hoping to avoid what would become 
the first strike of Ventura County's public nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still feel there's room for negotiation," said Tammy Gamblin of the 
California Nurses Assn., which is representing the county nurses in bargaining 
talks for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hope is that the county is re-examining its position and will go back to 
the bargaining table," Gamblin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county proposal would allow hospital administrators to call off nurses 
scheduled to work when the number of patients is low. It also would switch some 
shifts to trim overtime costs and allow managers to lay off nurses from 
individual units rather than strictly by seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 Local union members say the county's offer would undermine seniority rights 
and weaken the quality of patient care at the county's lone public hospital. 
But county officials say they have no more room for negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a reluctance on (the nurses') part to face reality," said Ed McLean, 
Ventura County's assistant director of personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Revenues are down and we need to make substantial changes to keep the 
hospital viable," said McLean, who declined to say how the county would respond 
to a nurses' strike. "And they're basically saying no." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of hospital days attributed to uninsured patients -- money McLean 
said is unrecoverable -- is projected to swell to more than 5,000 this year, 
compared to 1,000 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's final offer would save the hospital $750,000 a year, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But nurses' union members, working without a contract since June, say they are 
being singled out by county administrators who would -- among other things -- 
replace licensed nurses with unlicensed health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 They also complain that the new salary package would cut their pay by 7% and 
allow administrators to lay off nurses with high seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very things that guarantee quality care are the very things being cut," 
said Judith Overmyer, a nurse who also co-chairs the local union chapter. 
"Meanwhile, upper management and administration costs are going through the 
ceiling." 
</P>
<P>
 McLean said it would be "preposterous" to suggest that the hospital would 
replace licensed nurses with unlicensed workers. The county is merely 
requesting the authority to send home nurses when there are low numbers of 
patients, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If an entire unit had shut down one day, we might send home everyone within 
that unit," McLean said. "But that wouldn't affect the staffing in other 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Nurses Assn. began representing the 200 or so registered 
nurses, licensed vocational nurses and psychiatric technicians at Ventura 
County Medical Center in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first contract the nurses association has tried to negotiate with 
Ventura County. It has made no progress in two dozen meetings held since April, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital administrators are adamant about the current offer being the last, 
McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not much else that can be done at this point" other than ask the 
Board of Supervisors to adopt a resolution imposing a salary package without 
the nurses' consent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We either just keep going in limbo like we are, or we go with our last, best 
final offer," McLean said. "We intend to stand by our last, best final offer." 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to say when he would ask the supervisors to approve the contract. 
The request is not up for discussion at the next meeting, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our not being on the agenda next week, we think, is a very positive sign," 
Gamblin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rank-and-file union members said Thursday they hope to avoid a strike, but 
would walk off the job if need be. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we've met (from the county) are roadblocks," said Tim Lowe, a surgery 
nurse with 14 years of experience. "They've said what they want, but they don't 
want to listen to us. It's come to a point now where we have to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Cece Williams, a women's health center nurse with three decades of nursing 
experience, said the county has never bargained in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not secretaries, we're professionals," she said. "This is a (health 
care) practice we believe in. We're serving the minorities and the poor. The 
way we've been treated. . . . We'll do what we have to do."

LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROPOSAL CRITICIZED; VENTURA: RESIDENTS FEAR DEVELOPMENT 
WILL LEAD TO MORE TRAFFIC AND CRIME. IF OKD, 23-ACRE SITE WOULD HAVE TO BE 
ANNEXED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A proposal to build 146 apartments and houses in the east Ventura area for 
poor people is drawing criticism from neighbors who worry that the influx of 
low-income residents will bring traffic and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Saticoy-based Cabrillo Economic Development Corp. wants to construct 80 
apartments and 66 single-family houses on a 23-acre lot just north of the Santa 
Paula Freeway and east of Saticoy Avenue. The area is just outside the city 
limits and would have to be annexed if the project is approved. The nonprofit 
company is the largest private builder of low-income housing in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents near the proposed site say they are concerned that the project will 
decrease their property values. A developer who has an adjacent housing project 
said he is fearful a low-income housing project will hinder the sales of his 
residences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider this to be a nice and quiet neighborhood," said Laura Caskey, who 
moved into the area a month ago from Houston. "I realize all people in low 
income are not bad people, but it could attract some drug activity and crime 
and tend to spill into the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest T. Mansi, the head of Oxnard-based KNM Development, said he will lobby 
city leaders to make the proposed low-income residences compatible with his 
development, still under construction next to the Cabrillo site. Mansi opposes 
the low-income apartments and said another apartment complex in the area 
already has vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The apartments will be trouble," Mansi said. "It will affect our project." 
</P>
<P>
 Three few years ago, however, Mansi's project, which is aimed at 
moderate-income families, was the target of the same type of criticism when he 
sought approval from the city for his 147-house development. City leaders 
allowed his project to go forward, saying Ventura does not have enough 
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo officials point out that they have built more than 650 low-income 
housing units in Ventura County since 1981 and say Ventura is lagging behind in 
the number of low-income housing units it is mandated by the state to build. 
The corporation is also asking for about $1.4 million in financial assistance 
from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as people start hearing about low-income housing they start 
freaking," project architect Nick Deitch said. "You know, everyone's in favor 
of low-income housing, but not in their neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Deitch said Cabrillo officials are trying to target young professionals and 
blue-collar workers who have a hard time buying their first homes or who are 
struggling with high apartment rents.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not looking at poor people, people who don't contribute to our society, 
people who are lazy," Deitch said. "This is for the rookie police officer, the 
schoolteacher and middle management." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Fernandez, executive director of Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., 
said the apartments will be marketed toward families with incomes ranging from 
$20,000 to $40,000, and the houses would be set aside for families with incomes 
ranging from $35,000 to $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to be working with community on planning this," Fernandez said. 
"We are going to seek input from the neighborhood. This is their neighborhood, 
and we want to make sure they have a say-so in what gets built." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez said the initial proposal is to include a five-acre park, child-care 
center and community center in the development. All that could change, based on 
what kind of suggestions neighbors come up with, Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Hilley, a 40-year-old mortgage broker who has lived in the area for 
about seven years, said the success of the project will depend on whether 
Cabrillo carefully screens tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have put sweat equity in their houses and I would hate to see 
that go downhill," said Hilley, who repainted his house, bought a new roof and 
added landscaping. "It all depends on the kind of people who move in." 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrillo officials gave a presentation to the City Council earlier this week, 
outlining their development and asking the council for $1.4 million in grants 
and loans during the next four years. Most of the $23-million project will be 
funded by private investors and federal funds, Cabrillo officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the council members said they are in favor of the project 
because the city needs more housing for the poor, but are not sure of 
contributing a lot of city tax dollars toward the development because they want 
to emphasize revitalizing Ventura's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The residents nearby are going to come unglued, and I'm reluctant to take 
money from the downtown," Councilman Gary Tuttle said. "But there's a need for 
this type of housing. It's going to take a lot of political guts for the 
council to support it." 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to discuss the development in the next few weeks, but 
will not vote on the proposed project until after environmental and engineering 
studies have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez said if the project is approved, he hopes the first low-income 
residents will be able to move into the neighborhood in late 1996.

WEST VENTURA FOCUS: OXNARD; LUNGREN APPEARS ON POLICE CABLE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren made a special appearance on the Oxnard 
Police Department's televised crime prevention show, "Street Beat," Thursday to 
talk about crime and community-based policing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the show usually broadcasts live, Lungren's 23-minute interview with 
Police Chief Harold Hurtt and spokesman David Keith was taped and will air 
April 11 at 8 p.m. on Channel 19, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith said that although the taped interview was brief, Lungren chatted for 
nearly an hour about various crime issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "He talked about community policing . . . about how the criminal justice 
system is not going to do it all," Keith said. "We could have gone all day. We 
only kind of scratched the surface." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones Intercable, which broadcasts the show as a community service, contacted 
Lungren's office about three weeks ago, asking him to appear on "Street Beat." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have met the attorney general before," said Mary McCurdy, director of 
business development for Jones Intercable.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has been a big supporter of programs like these." 
</P>
<P>
 "Street Beat" began nine years ago to provide Oxnard residents with crime 
prevention information. The show airs every Monday night for 90 minutes in 
English and every other Tuesday night in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith said the purpose of having California's chief law enforcement officer on 
the program was twofold: "We want him to know what we do here because it's 
unique, and to have him give his viewpoint on community policing and citizen 
involvement." TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; SCIENCE FAIR STARTS WITH A BIG BANG 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clad in caveman motif, Ivoree Venegas, 11, smashed her toy club on Adolfo 
Sanchez's head as the 12-year-old dressed in a loincloth giggled with glee. 
</P>
<P>
 If the two fifth-graders were going to spend their day dressed as a live 
exhibit at the Santa Paula Elementary School District's annual Science Fair, 
they were going to have a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why it's fun," Adolfo said with a laugh as Ivoree walloped him 
again with the squeaky, plastic weapon. "Tomorrow, I'm going to wake up with a 
lot of bumps." 
</P>
<P>
 Held at Barbara Webster School, the district's science magnet, the fair 
consisted of a building full of individual and class projects, many of which 
were weeks in the making. It included a mix of displays, video presentations 
and live exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, students from kindergarten to fifth grade toured the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair featured a time warp hallway, which began at one end with flashing 
lights that symbolize the Big Bang and ended with the appearance of humans, as 
portrayed by the two battling fifth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 Each room in the maze that was the Science Fair was crowded with projects, 
such as "How Do Seeds Grow?" by first-grade students at Thelma Bedell School. 
</P>
<P>
 A poster propped up behind clusters of leaf-sprouting, dirt-filled plastic 
cups explained the experiment's process of hypothesis and conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Guess: The seeds will make roots. Then the roots will grow and then the 
leaves.  
</P>
<P>
 * "Test: We planted our seeds in the dirt. We put water on them. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Tell: Our seeds grew. The roots grew first. Then the stem grew. Our seeds 
did not all grow at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Bean's chattering second-grade students from Glen City School took about 
an hour to wind their way through the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Compton, 7, a student in Bean's class, said one of his favorite parts of 
the fair was the video explaining the Big Bang. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that was bad !" he said, grinning his approval. "That was cool! It tells 
you all about the universe. It was like being in school, because you are 
learning lots of stuff." CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA FOCUS: OXNARD; JURY QUIZZES JUDGE IN SENTENCING PHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury deciding whether a convicted Oxnard murderer will be put to death or 
spend the rest of his life in prison asked a judge a provocative question 
Thursday: What would happen if it did not agree on a verdict? 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the question, lawyers in the case refused to speculate whether the 
jury in the case of 24-year-old Christopher James Sattiewhite might be 
deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury last month convicted Sattiewhite of first-degree murder and a special 
allegation that made him eligible for the gas chamber. He shot 30-year-old 
Genoveva Gonzales in the head three times Jan. 26, 1992, and left her body in a 
drainage ditch along Arnold Road in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 In his response to Thursday's note from the jury, Superior Court Judge 
Lawrence Storch urged the jurors to concern themselves only with reaching a 
verdict. He told them not to worry about the consequences of a possible 
deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman for the district attorney's office declined to comment, saying 
prosecutors did not want to influence jurors in any way. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard P. Wiksell, one of Sattiewhite's two defense attorneys, also declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In capital punishment cases where a jury cannot reach a verdict, however, 
California law is clear on how the judge shall proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 It states the court must dismiss the deadlocked jury and impanel a new one. If 
the new jury also deadlocks, then the court has the discretion of ordering 
another new jury or imposing a sentence of life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sattiewhite jury, which began deliberations Tuesday, will not meet today 
because of a scheduling conflict by one of its members. It resumes work Monday 
morning. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA FOCUS: CAMARILLO; CONTRACT OF BUSINESS CONSULTANT EXTENDED

<TEXT>
<P>
 A business development consultant, whose contract was set to expire this 
month, has been rehired by the Camarillo City Council to serve the city for the 
remainder of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously Wednesday to extend the contract of Thomas E. 
Flavin, a principal of Business Government Partnership Inc., through 
December.He was hired by the city in October at a cost of $7,500 and will be 
paid an additional $7,500 for the contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they were pleased with Flavin's work and may decide to 
increase his consulting hours starting next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very impressed with his work and his approach," Councilwoman Charlotte 
Craven said. "I would like to see us increase his services to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the city dated March 7, Flavin said he has had talks with 76 
businesses and of those, eight firms have expressed serious interest in 
relocating to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Flavin did not disclose the names of the businesses considering a move. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members, fearing the city was losing its job base, voted last fall to 
hire Flavin, a Camarillo resident who works out of Burbank. J.E. MITCHELL

EAST VENTURA FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; COURTHOUSE PROTESTER FACES NEW CHARGE

<P>
 A trial for a 41-year-old man accused of staging solitary sit-ins at the East 
County Courthouse was postponed Thursday after prosecutors filed an additional 
charge of trespassing, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher McGrath, founder of a fringe political party, was granted the 
postponement until April 14. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested March 1 after repeatedly going to the courthouse office of 
Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard and refusing to leave at the close of 
the business day. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath faces four counts of trespassing and one count of protesting inside a 
court building, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen LaSalle. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath, the founder of the Rock 'n' Roll Party in Simi Valley, remained in 
the Ventura County Jail in lieu of $500 bail, a jail spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the jail, he has refused meals in a protest over what he perceives as 
government atrocities. Jail officials said his weight is down about eight 
pounds since his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, where he represents himself, McGrath asked for the delay so he could 
have more time to prepare his case. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; PANEL BACKS DIVISION OF 67-ACRE PROPERTY 
</P>

<P>
 Plans to build on one of the few vacant properties in Simi Valley's flatlands 
have moved forward as city planners recommended the division of the 67-acre 
parcel among three separate developers. 
</P>
<P>
 The property owners requested the move at Wednesday night's Simi Valley 
Planning Commission meeting after spending six years in a stalemate over how 
the land at Madera Road and Los Angeles Avenue should be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 The property is the site of the annual Simi Valley Days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission's 3-0 vote, which will be forwarded to the City 
Council, would allow for both commercial and residential developments on the 
gateway property. Commissioner Michael Piper abstained and Commissioner Dean 
Kunicki was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate at the meeting focused on conflicting city policies that both limit the 
density of development and call for more low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Silverman, who spoke for property owner Great Western Bank, asked the 
commission to be flexible about the density of the planned development in 
exchange for the construction of a greater number of affordable homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always been encouraged to go for affordable housing, and this 
property is perfect for it," Silverman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners eventually agreed that affordable housing should be a goal 
of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wednesday's approval is a step forward for developers, city planners 
said construction on the property is still years away. MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA FOCUS: WESTLAKE; TEEN-AGER PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN BRAWL 
</P>

<P>
 A 16-year-old Westlake High student who is being tried as an adult in 
connection with an off-campus brawl that left two classmates wounded from 
gunshots pleaded not guilty Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing for defendant James Lee was set for April 6 in Ventura 
County Superior Court.His bail remained at $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the arraignment, prosecutors filed charges against Lee in the 
adult-court system, said Deputy Dist. Atty. John U. Vanarelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee faces one count of assault with a deadly weapon and one count of assault 
with intent to commit great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee and three other Asian teen-agers are charged in connection with a Feb. 3 
melee in which two Westlake High students suffered gunshot wounds. Both 
students have recovered, as have other students who were assaulted with 
baseball bats, 2-by-4-foot boards and other objects. 
</P>
<P>
 The brawl started after Lee and a Westlake football player, Curtis Simmons, 
agreed to fight at North Ranch Park. Lee's attorney has said his client had 
been racially harassed by Simmons because he is Asian. Simmons has denied the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 None of Simmons' friends who showed up at the park to participate in the fight 
has been charged.  
</P>
<P>
 In court Thursday, Lee's attorney suggested that Simmons and some of his 
friends should also be facing criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutor Vanarelli said outside court that authorities are focusing 
their case against the Asian teen-agers "because they brought deadly weapons to 
the altercation." DWAYNE BRAY

 The endowment fund supporting Thousand Oaks' Civic Arts Plaza has topped $3.6 
million, as corporate and individual contributions pick up now that the grand 
opening is just seven months away. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell International, represented locally by the Rockwell Science Center in 
Thousand Oaks and the Rocketdyne rocket engine plant in Canoga Park, on 
Thursday pledged $100,000 to the cultural center.To recognize the gift, 
Rockwell's name will be affixed to a set of box seats in the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 In a flurry of new pledges announced this week, Bank of America upgraded its 
donation from $30,000 to $50,000. The additional gift qualifies the corporation 
for membership in the Founders Circle, a club of major donors with special 
ticket privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recent additions to the Founders Circle include: Westlake Village 
resident Mark Mahone; alliance campaign chairman Stephen Woodworth and his 
wife, Robin; and theater Commissioner Harry Selvin and his wife, Gerelda. 
</P>
<P>
 Founders Circle Chairman Larry Janss recently challenged the Alliance for the 
Arts to raise its endowment goal from $3 million to at least $7 million .

PROPOSED REPLACEMENT GROWTH LAW IS CALLED ILLEGAL; MOORPARK: BUILDING INDUSTRY 
SPOKESMAN SAYS ORDINANCE IS NOT NEEDED. VOTER-APPROVED LIMITS ARE SLATED TO 
EXPIRE NEXT YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed ordinance that would limit growth in Moorpark violates state law 
and is unnecessary in any case, a building industry representative contends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The draft ordinance would replace Measure F, the city's existing slow-growth 
law passed by Moorpark voters in 1986 in response to rapid development in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 But builders argue that there is no justification for a new ordinance, 
pointing out that the present rate of development is not straining city 
services or its water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "State law requires that an ordinance limiting residential construction can 
only be adopted if the city can adopt certain findings of necessity," Dee 
Zinke, executive director of the Building Industry Assn., said at a special 
City Council meeting Wednesday night. "In light of current economic realities, 
we doubt seriously that the city could factually support (that)." 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members conceded that, because of the recession, no major 
developments have been proposed in Moorpark in recent years. But they argued 
that Measure F is due to expire next year, and that an ordinance should be in 
place to prevent unbridled development when the economy does turn around. 
</P>
<P>
 Zinke's statements Wednesday concerned some council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "The statement reads like a cause of action for a lawsuit," Councilman Scott 
Montgomery said. "The vast majority of residents want some sort of 
managed-growth ordinance here, but we've had two lawsuits on Measure F and lost 
both of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to find that another legal challenge would blow the doors off 
of protection, leaving things wide open for development." 
</P>
<P>
 To settle the suits filed after Measure F was passed in 1986, the city agreed 
to exempt one housing development from the permit limits and increase the 
number of building permits issued each year from 250 to 270. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft ordinance would return to the 250 limit. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, it would not allow developers to accumulate permits over time to 
build at a later date. More than 1,300 allotments for permits were issued in 
recent years for homes that have not been built yet, city officials said. The 
new ordinance would wipe those allotments out, forcing builders to reapply. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at the mercy of the marketplace," Zinke said. "Nowadays we build in 
phases. If we can't accumulate allocations with the hope of using them at a 
later date, many projects won't move forward. We're already constrained at one 
end with the economy. Don't make it even tougher at the other end." 
</P>
<P>
 One of two speakers in support of the ordinance was Bob Crockford, who 
co-authored Measure F. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the odds, Measure F won because we were growing out of control," he 
said. "This ordinance would continue to control growth and protect the quality 
of life in Moorpark." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council decided to hold additional public meetings on the draft 
ordinance and asked the city attorney to analyze its defensibility. The council 
will again take public comments on the ordinance at its May 4 meeting.

ELECTIONS / BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; ROBINGS' MANAGER LINKED TO HOSPITAL DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisorial candidate H. Jere Robings has used part of the 
$10,000 he has loaned his campaign to hire a political consultant closely 
linked to a controversial private hospital campaign opposing the expansion of 
the county hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings said he hired Raymond Komar, a former Santa Barbara publicist, as his 
campaign manager in early January because of his writing and research 
background as well as his experience working on other political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign finance reports filed this week with the county elections office 
revealed that Robings so far has paid Komar $5,000 for his services. No other 
candidate in the race has spent as much on a campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have become good friends and his skills and expertise have been a 
tremendous asset," said Robings, who is running for the supervisor's seat being 
vacated by Maria VanderKolk. "I couldn't have done this without him." 
</P>
<P>
 But two of Robings' opponents questioned his judgment in hiring Komar because 
of Komar's previous work on behalf of Community Memorial Hospital and its 
campaign opposing expansion of the Ventura County Medical Center. The private 
hospital considers the county an emerging competitor for private patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised," Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo said. "I think it 
shows poor judgment because of (Komar's) connection to a private hospital. I 
don't think it's proper." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Trudi K. Loh, also a candidate in the race, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it raises the issue of what Community Memorial's involvement is in 
(Robing's) campaign and to what extent he may be beholden to them," Loh said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robings, a critic of the county hospital's plans to add a new $30-million 
wing, said Komar was hired after he had already stopped working on behalf of 
Community Memorial. Komar had been paid indirectly by the hospital to gather 
county records and attend meetings of the county Board of Supervisors, where he 
met Robings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Community Memorial has no interest in my campaign," Robings said. "I have not 
received a nickel in contributions from anyone at Community Memorial or 
affiliated with Community Memorial. They are not part of my campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael D. Bakst, executive director of Community Memorial, said the hospital 
was in no way involved in Robings' campaign and was not even aware that Komar 
had gone to work for him. "Mr. Komar is free to do whatever he elects to do," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings said Komar is being paid to conduct polls, research issues and write 
campaign literature. Although he would not reveal Komar's exact salary, Robings 
said he believed $5,000 was "fair compensation." 
</P>
<P>
 Robings reported a total of $13,770 in campaign contributions this week. Of 
that, $10,000 was a personal loan used in part to hire Komar in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of money Robings has spent so far for Komar's services is 
considered unusual because supervisorial candidates often have campaign 
managers who work for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said his wife is volunteering her time, and former Ventura County 
Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, another candidate, said her campaign manager was 
doing the same. Schaefer declined to comment on Komar's hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh said she plans to pay her two campaign assistants about half of what Komar 
has been paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu rancher Carter Ward, the fifth candidate in the race, could not be 
reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the expense, Robings said he believes hiring someone with Komar's 
expertise will pay off in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a situation where you can tiptoe in and play it quietly," he 
said. "You need to get into it and swing for the fences. And if there are 
people who have the experience and talent to do that, then you hire them."

SCHOOL DISTRICT SAYS BUILDER OWES $245,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Developers of a factory outlet mall in Camarillo should pay the area high 
school district nearly $245,000 to offset the cost of educating new students 
that the project will bring to the area, Oxnard Union High School District 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But developers of the mall have called the request "out of line" and said they 
have reached an impasse in their negotiations with the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're aware of the financial constraints faced by the public schools," said 
Steven L. Craig, president of Newport Beach-based Chelsea GCA. "I think we have 
shown in good faith our willingness to contribute to the community where we do 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 The district claims that the 70-store mall may bring as many as 30 new 
students to the school system, which will cost the district approximately 
$460,000 in one-time expense to create additional classroom space  
</P>
<P>
 The district needs more than the state-mandated 27-cents-per-square-foot fee, 
or about $30,000 in this case, officials said. The district is requesting 
$243,000 in developer fees to be used to buy two new student computer 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not trying to stop the development of the mall," said Bob Brown, 
assistant superintendent for business services. "What we are trying to do is 
secure adequate fees to lessen the impact of this development on our district." 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict, the most recent stumbling block in the development of the 
embattled outlet mall, comes two weeks after the City Council approved the 
project for the second time. The City Council first approved the mall in 
January, 1993, but the project was held up by a lawsuit that ended with a 
judge's order for an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also ordered the city to abandon a deal with the developer that 
would have refunded city sales tax revenues from the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the project again March 9.

LAKERS WAITING FOR NEW COACH; WEDNESDAY'S GAME: WHILE RALLYING TO DEFEAT 
MAVERICKS, 112-109, THEY WONDER WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE TO PLAY FOR MAGIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lakers, caught in the awkward limbo of the post-Pfund, pre-Magic era, will 
find out Sunday what it is like to play for Coach Earvin (Magic) Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who don't already know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was playing for him when I was playing with him," Kurt Rambis said. "When 
he was out on the floor, he was choreographing and orchestrating the offense. 
He made up plays coming down the floor. He kind of winged it. That's the way 
he's been since he was a kid. You'd see him waving his arm, getting players to 
do this and that. He'll have to learn how to do that from the bench, yelling 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not going to be easy, that's for sure. . . . He's going to have to 
take his lumps. He'll make some bad decisions and he'll make some good 
decisions, and he'll learn from it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers -- who needed a furious rally to defeat the lowly Dallas Mavericks, 
112-109, Wednesday at Reunion Arena after trailing by 10 points with five 
minutes to play -- met the news that Johnson is replacing Randy Pfund with the 
typical mix of sympathy for a fired coach they liked and enthusiasm for a 
friend who reminds them of their glory years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am looking forward to Magic," said Vlade Divac, a player who developed 
under the driving tutelage of Johnson before Johnson retired after contracting 
HIV. "He knows a lot about basketball and has a winning attitude and that is 
what we need. . . . It's mixed, though. I still believe Randy's a good coach. 
Management made a decision. That's business. We'll move on. . . . I'm looking 
forward to working with (Johnson) again. Whatever it takes to be the best 
player, I'll do it, it doesn't matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the Lakers know Magic so well, especially the team's young core. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to exciting, just for the fact that growing up I was a big Magic 
Johnson fan and I patterned a lot of what I do after watching him play," Doug 
Christie said. "In some sense, there are a lot of unknowns. We don't know what 
to expect. As a player, he did things a certain way. I'm sure as a coach he 
will, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund got some support from the players, but it was more empathy than 
indignation.

 "I think everybody had two emotions," Rambis said. "One, you were sad for 
Randy and felt bad for him and his situation. And you were happy for Earvin and 
the prospects he might bring to the club. The same things he brought as a 
player, a great work ethic, enthusiasm for the game, an understanding of the 
game, a knowledge of the game. He'll try to relay that to the players." 
</P>
<P>
 James Worthy, a 12-year veteran, has seen coaches come and go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Randy did a great job, but I don't think time was on his side," 
Worthy said. "I think the expectation level was so high. There was a lot of 
teaching that needed to be done. There were a lot of new players in the last 
year. It was just overwhelming for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Worthy will answer to a teammate he won NBA titles with. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be strange at first, but that will be over in about 30 seconds," Worthy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to say how a new coach is going to do especially when it's new for 
him. It's really hard to speculate. I know his attitude, I know he's a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think anytime there's positive change, everybody's excited. The fans will 
be extremely excited. It will give them an opportunity to reminisce and hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bertka, longtime Laker assistant, coach, has been through coaching 
transition after transition. He's handling the team during the two-game interim 
before Johnson takes over, and he'll be there to help him adjust to life on the 
bench, something Johnson never knew much about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Magic is a person who has tremendous qualifications to come in and do the 
job," Bertka said. "He's a very strong personality, and he's actually been 
coaching the game all his life, because that's the way he plays basketball. I 
think he'll be a very positive influence on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Question is, of course, how long can Johnson be content to stay on the bench? 
</P>
<P>
 "It will probably take about 30 seconds," Rambis said, laughing. "That's up to 
him. I've played in these games with him over in Europe, so I know he can still 
play. That's always a possibility.

CUESTA TOO SLICK FOR CANYONS ON WET FIELD; COLLEGE BASEBALL: FIVE INNINGS 
PLAYED UNDER DREARY CONDITIONS END IN A 6-2 WESTERN STATE CONFERENCE DEFEAT FOR 
COUGARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a day even Ernie Banks might have refused to play, the College of the 
Canyons and Cuesta baseball teams decided to give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
 The game went long enough for Cuesta to come off the soggy Canyons field 
soaking wet but with a 6-2 Western State Conference inter-divisional victory 
Thursday. The game was stopped after five innings when the steady drizzle 
turned into a downpour. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuesta (17-9) is in first place in the North Division at 5-2 and Canyons (9-9) 
is 5-4 in the South, but the game doesn't count toward the divisional records. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first season in which the WSC has been split into divisions in 
baseball to reduce travel expenses and to help the conference place more teams 
in the Southern California regional. 
</P>
<P>
 That this game was official was no small feat. Canyons Coach Len Mohney 
thought the playing conditions had deteriorated to the point of no return much 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The umpires) were trying to get five innings in," Mohney said. "They should 
have shut it down by the third. It wasn't like the weather was going to get any 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the action continued until right-hander Harvey Gamboa stranded three 
Canyons runners in the fifth to pick up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamboa, a sophomore from Paso Robles High, allowed six hits, struck out six 
and yielded three walks. He gave up single runs, both earned, in the first and 
third innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuesta broke on top, 2-0, in the first when Bobby Brown led off the game 
against left-hander Tom Manning (1-2) with a single and took second when left 
fielder R.J. Fenolio bubbled the ball for an error. 
</P>
<P>
 Dustin Spencer followed with a bunt single down the third-base line, putting 
runners at the corners. Kenny McMurry lined a single to left, scoring Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 After Gamboa fouled out to first baseman Shane Petrelli, David Beauchamp 
singled to center to drive in Spencer from second. Manning induced Troy Silva 
to ground into an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons got one of the runs back in the bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenolio led off with a walk and reached third on a hit-and-run single by Ari 
Jacobs. Ted Kiester knocked in Fenolio with a sharp single to right. 
</P>
<P>
 But with cleanup batter John Davis swinging and missing at a full-count pitch, 
Jacobs was thrown out at third by catcher Bobby Sherwood on an attempted double 
steal. Gamboa got Tom Nickels on a fly to left to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuesta broke the game open with three runs in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Weeks was hit by a pitch and Sherwood, who played at Burroughs High, 
walked. Jesse Zepeda moved up the runners with a bunt, and Brown knocked them 
in with a double to the wall in right-center field. He scored on a two-out 
single by Gamboa. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuesta scored its final run in the third when Troy Silva led off with a double 
and scored on Sherwood's single. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Pfatenhauer led off the bottom of the inning with a double to left and 
advanced to third when Beauchamp had trouble picking up the ball in the corner. 
He scored on a ground out by Fenolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons loaded the bases with two out in the fifth on two singles and a walk, 
but Davis grounded out to first. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Anthony Chessani pitched well in relief of Manning, allowing only 
three hits in three innings of work.

KINNEY PITCHES NO-HITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoover High sophomore Tina Kinney threw the first no-hitter of her career and 
struck out 10 to lead the Tornadoes to a 6-0 victory Thursday over Eisenhower 
in a nonleague game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinney (6-4), a right-hander, walked one and faced only two batters over the 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first no-hitter by a Hoover pitcher since last year's graduation of 
Nancy Evans, whose 24 no-hitters rank fifth in Southern Section history. Evans 
is now pitching for top-ranked Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith Butler went two for three with a triple for Hoover (6-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover scored three runs in the seventh inning break open the game.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; ALLEGORICAL TROT OVER FAMILIAR, PREDICTABLE TERRAIN; 
SECOND NATURE BY ALICE HOFFMAN ; PUTNAM, $22.95, 254 PAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS GOODRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alice Hoffman, author of "At Risk" and "Turtle Moon" among many other novels, 
comes close to giving the game away very early in "Second Nature." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A fur trapper walking his line in the far north woods finds a person caught by 
the foot in one of his steel snares, the skin-clad youth near death from cold 
and lost blood. The trapper is amazed at the discovery, of course, but while 
taking his unintended prey to the hospital, he is equally amazed by the young 
man's serene expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he'd seen anything like this face before," Hoffman says of the trapper, 
"it was in the chapel at St. Joseph's. . . . To the right of the pews, in a 
dark alcove, there had been a statue made of white wood with a countenance so 
calm it had made him weep." 
</P>
<P>
 The youth compared to Jesus, or at least some saint, turns out to have been 
raised by a family of wolves after an airplane crash of which he, at age 3, was 
the sole survivor. Reunited with the human race, he seems unable to speak; he 
makes not a sound at the New York hospital to which he is sent, frightening the 
staff -- who call him the Wolf Man -- with his silence, his stillness, his 
preference for raw meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolf Man is neither particularly feral nor particularly heroic -- like the 
reported Wild Child and Rome's wolf-suckled Romulus, respectively -- but in 
Hoffman's hands he becomes a compelling figure nonetheless: more humane and, in 
some ways, more plainly human than the people he meets. We know that's going to 
be the case the moment Hoffman portrays the Wolf Man as Christlike: The main 
question, thereafter, is what form his crucifixion will take, and whether 
Hoffman can pull it off with grace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Second Nature" is not yawningly predictable, as one might assume given that 
the general course and moral position of the novel are evident from the first 
pages. Hoffman's premise is awfully familiar -- we know we're going to 
encounter the nature-versus-nurture debate -- yet she downplays that aspect of 
the book by focusing less on the Wolf Man than on the characters who surround 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal among them is Robin Moore, who sets the story in motion by 
liberating the Wolf Man, on impulse, from the hospital (she had heard of his 
existence from her brother, one of the Wolf Man's doctors). 
</P>
<P>
 Robin, newly separated from her policeman husband, takes the Wolf Man home to 
her small, isolated town on Long Island, and before long he has learned to 
speak, read and work alongside Robin in her off-and-on landscaping business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolf Man -- now referred to as Stephen, because he has remembered his name 
-- doesn't intend to alter others' lives, but his presence is like a powerful 
magnet rearranging hopes and expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy, Robin's ex-husband-to-be, becomes intensely jealous when he learns that 
Stephen is living in his old house, and notes too that Stephen is a superb 
physical specimen, running for miles and miles simply for the pleasure of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Dick, Robin's cantankerous 91-year-old grandfather, finds in Stephen the 
only person capable of understanding him, the Wolf Man showing an exceptional 
reverence for age and experience. 
</P>
<P>
 And Robin, for her part, can't help falling in love with Stephen, drawn to his 
strength, loyalty and integrity. Robin's love is requited -- fortunately for 
her but unfortunately for him, because love compels Stephen to stay in 
unfamiliar territory and thus become a natural scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen's crucifixion isn't literal -- he's simply accused of committing a 
series of increasingly heinous crimes in his adopted town. For a time one may 
wonder whether Stephen is indeed responsible, the wolf in him unable to control 
his predatory habits. But Hoffman scotches that possibility by her idealization 
of the Wolf Man and introduction of another character who fits, 
stereotypically, the killer-among-us profile. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a notable false note in "Second Nature," but not vital because the 
other characters are thoroughly convincing in all their confusions and 
ambivalences. It's a major theme in the novel, although rarely explicit, that 
while "men think about right and wrong . . . wolves have to know." 
</P>
<P>
 The fairest way of judging a book, I've long believed, is to determine, first, 
whether it succeeds on its own terms, and second, whether those terms are 
sufficient to the book's themes. "Second Nature" defies such analysis, however, 
for although both questions can be answered in the affirmative, the novel never 
takes off or reveals new insights into human nature. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as much an allegory as a novel, and as allegory, it forces characters and 
events to conform to the author's moral vision rather than letting the 
characters create a vision for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Call "Second Nature" a qualified success: technically accomplished, but 
hampered by a story that can only lead, without significant modification, down 
a conventional path.

THEATER REVIEW; THE IMAGINARY OPENS DOORS IN EVENING OF ONE-ACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What is this? A show at Teatro Cometa, home of the only ongoing grass-roots 
Latino theater company in the county, and nary a Hispanic surname in the 
program? 
</P>
<P>
 Es verdad. But while the opaquely titled "An Evening of One-Acts" may be at 
Teatro Cometa, it is not by Teatro Cometa. That group may be no more, and so, 
filling the void, Revolving Door Productions has stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 Revolving Door, indeed. While Cometa's Chicanismo was a welcome injection into 
the generally white theatrical bloodstream, it proved as ungainly as the 
theater's boxy, backbreaking bleacher seating. 
</P>
<P>
 The seating remains, and the young company is taking stumbling baby steps. But 
this is more than just a group of friends getting together to do a show, which 
is the impression Cometa left you with. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a method behind the seemingly mad conjunction here of Kitty 
Johnson's oft-revived Kentucky romance, "Strawberry Envy," Michael Zittel's 
alienation comedy, "Man and His Ego," and Joel Beers' absurd Alaskan adventure, 
"Cry Wolf." 
</P>
<P>
 While the trio is intrinsically theatrical, it is also joined by a notion of 
the imagined made flesh on the stage, or at least the imagined dominating what 
seems to be real. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nice surprise, since we count on a through-line from a play, but not 
necessarily from an evening of them. Whether the plays work is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's 10-year-old "Envy" first appeared at L.A. Actors Theatre with Laurie 
O'Brien as Emily, a woman swooning for a slow-on-the-draw strawberry vendor 
while pulled in another direction by her imaginary lover in an ice cream suit. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien's effortless charm is what kept the piece buoyant, and what subsequent 
stagings have lacked. Here, Lynnae Hitchcock brings a little charm and a touch 
of eros to this fantasy-reality dalliance, but it's not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Lamprinos delivers a modest hick, and Devon May talks big as the 
imagined lover under Joel Beers' direction, but any magic is severely hampered 
by austere staging, guitarist Pat Gallagher's sloppy opener ("Strawberry 
Fields," of course) and the space's black walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Those walls aren't what you want for a Kentucky countryside, but they're just 
fine for the cooped-up bachelor apartment setting of "Man and His Ego." 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, one character (Chris Dalu's Man) imagines another (Chris Egger's 
Ego); or rather, a part of the interior self makes a stand, on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalu's guy regrets that he seems to be blowing it with a woman he likes but 
isn't sure he wants to pursue. Ego, with bulging pecs and slicked hair, is wary 
of any commitments and tells his Man in no uncertain terms to stay independent 
and stick with quick sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Ego, it seems, has never heard of AIDS, which may be part of Zittel's 
subliminal message. But such a crude arrangement for dramatic conflict has to 
be sustained by more surprises, more wit and more nerve than Zittel and 
director Bradley A. Whitfield manage. 
</P>
<P>
 Before it ends far too abruptly, Beers' "Cry Wolf" seems like it might be the 
best-of-show. 
</P>
<P>
 The imagined beings here are wolves, a pack of them supposedly roaming the 
Alaskan bush near an expedition group. The group itself is a total culture 
clash, including: eco-sensitive Jesse (Jeff Vandenburgh), a National Geographic 
magazine writer and his photographer partner, Sarah (Shannon McDuff) and the 
guides-hunters, led by steely-eyed Rice (Nick Boicourt Jr., who also directs), 
trigger-happy Carney (an over-the-top Whitfield), the creepy Elsa (a funny 
Jennifer Bishton) and fellows named Mr. Smith (Lamprinos) and Mr. Jones 
(Beers). 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse is shocked at Rice's, Carney's and Elsa's casual bloodthirstiness, but a 
reference to James Dickey's "Deliverance" sets us up for a similar situation 
where urban man gets in touch with his killer instincts.

THEATER REVIEW; NO ORDINARY 'CAROUSEL,' AN EXCELLENT ONE; THIS INTENSELY SMART 
VERSION TAKES ONE OF THE DARKEST SHOWS FROM THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICAN MUSICALS 
AND TURNS IT INTO OUR OWN 'BLUE VELVET.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From the moment the orchestra begins its off-kilter waltz at the Beaumont, we 
know this is no ordinary "Carousel." Instead of the carnival bustling to the 
opening rhythms, there is a haunting line of gray factory women moving like 
zombie automatons at a long weaving machine. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the big clock strikes 6 and the drones are set free to change into 
vibrant youngsters in the twinkling amusement park, standard crowd-scene 
merriments have already lost their innocence. These are not stock-happy 
19th-Century New England town folk in a revival of a Rodgers & Hammerstein 
chestnut. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, except for some shocking weaknesses in several critical roles, there 
is not a speck of stock about this intensely smart and magnificently reinvented 
"Carousel." Nicholas Hytner, who first staged it to enormous acclaim in London, 
has re-cast all but one part for Lincoln Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Hytner is going for an ensemble drama with music here, using Richard Rodgers' 
ambitiously extended musical set pieces to propel the dark story, and 
understating, as much as possible, the tendency of Oscar Hammerstein's book to 
turn to preachy pap. The acting is relaxed and remarkably natural for a 
musical, and everyone -- not just the superb dance chorus in Kenneth 
MacMillan's mostly splendid and thoughtful balletic choreography -- knows how 
to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Crowley's sets, morphing on a computerized turntable, are almost 
inconceivably beautiful: deeply poetic visions of a fishing village enveloped 
in a universe of perpetual night blue.  
</P>
<P>
 Hytner has taken one of the very darkest shows from the golden age of American 
musicals and turned it into our own "Blue Velvet." Beneath the pretty lawns and 
behind the jolly clambakes is Billy beating his loving wife, Julie, while she 
claims it doesn't hurt at all. Decent women are cynical about dull marriages. 
There is heartless lust, rough justice, an anti-hero who kills himself, cycles 
of poverty and violence that seem unlikely to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carousel," which came after the breakthrough of "Oklahoma!" and before "South 
Pacific," was Rodgers' favorite score, and Eric Stern's orchestra reminds us 
why. The show goes boldly into the developing territory of integrated story, 
music and dance.  
</P>
<P>
 There is the courageous "If I Loved You" -- a 12-minute love duet in 
contrary-to-fact subjunctive where the lovers never actually sing together. 
There's the 17-minute fairground ballet, dangerously close to the finale, where 
Sandra Brown, an American Ballet Theatre dancer with a blissfully expressive 
attack and a taffy spine, shows Billy how his troubled daughter may be turning 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there is Billy, the carnival barker, who feels trapped by his 
marriage to Julie, but is almost saved by news of her pregnancy -- and delivers 
an exhilarating soliloquy about "my boy, Bill." Hayden, a Juilliard graduate 
who became a sensation in this role in London, stresses the man's vulnerability 
over his brute qualities, using his baby-faced youth to suggest a man who still 
might possibly change his future. But Hayden has surprisingly little sexual 
presence for such a stud, and his voice -- a tenor in the baritone role -- 
lacks power, low notes and pitch accuracy when pushed.  
</P>
<P>
 Sally Murphy makes a light, unexceptional but pleasant Julie, but the 
secondary couple -- Audra Ann McDonald's terrific and lusty Carrie and Eddie 
Korbich's stuffy Enoch -- steal the show. Fisher Stevens has a contemporary 
sense of menace that may strike some as anachronistic -- and he growls instead 
of sings -- but his villain Jigger is an entertaining wharf rat. 
</P>
<P>
 Agnes de Mille would not have approved of the empty male ballet tricks that 
derail Louise's coming-of-age anguish. But the rest of the choreography, 
created by MacMillan just before he died, gives the sailors a lusty hornpipe 
for "June Is Bustin' Out All Over" and has the bad boys insinuate themselves 
through "Blow High, Blow Low" as if stomping bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 More typical than such humor -- and more important than the vocal weaknesses 
-- is the fearless, uncompromising power of the production. We may argue 
whether such a sure commercial hit, co-produced by Cameron Mackintosh and first 
staged in London, belongs in a nonprofit house. Perhaps producers worried that 
a Broadway audience would be afraid of the dark. They can relax now.

MUSIC REVIEWS; WILLIAMS SHOWS HIS TECHNICAL MASTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Effortless precision: It seems to thrill a lot of people. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist John Williams displayed it in abundance before a packed Ambassador 
Auditorium Wednesday, in the first of his two recitals there on successive 
nights.And he allowed nothing to disturb the calm surface created by his 
technical mastery. 
</P>
<P>
 The music was never clogged with the demands of effort, never troubled with 
rhythmic stress or harmonic pull, never flexed with the curved tension of an 
extended phrase. Calm fluidity ruled the waves, but this was a shallow ocean. 
The Australian guitarist, dressed in rugby tee and corduroys, revealed a 
mellowness that wouldn't have disrupted a dinner conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 With the considerable aid of some unsubtle but warm and detailed 
amplification, Williams was able to project a myriad of color and articulation 
and to take on the most demanding technical passages with an unperturbed and 
quiet polish. Not once all evening did he play a passage at a true forte -- 
that is, what would have been a forte without the miking. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Coast premiere of Peter Sculthorpe's 10-minute "From Kakadu," a 
singularly tame and tonal work from this often adventurous composer, served as 
his centerpiece. Its four brief movements speak with a folksy and repetitive 
simplicity, slowly turning over ideas as if rays of light in a prism. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the first half featured Williams' transcriptions of a Vivaldi 
Concerto (Opus 3, No. 9) and six Scarlatti sonatas, played with little regard 
for the niceties of phrasing. The entire second half was devoted to the minor 
pleasantries of Paraguayan guitarist-composer Augustin Barrios Mangore's short 
pieces, which provided all the shimmering tremolos, pretty harmonics, showy 
intimacies and carefree tunes required.TIMOTHY MANGAN

MUSIC REVIEWS; LEWIS PRODS EAR UNIT TO STRETCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When George Lewis picks up a trombone, anything is liable to happen, and 
something liberating usually does. For the virtuosic musician, who has ably 
bridged the jazz and new music worlds for nearly 20 years and is now teaching 
at UC San Diego, improvisation is more than an idle concept. It's a way of 
being, a license to explore the gray areas between existing musical genres. 
</P>
<P>
 At Lewis' appearance Wednesday with the California EAR Unit at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art, the hosting ensemble found itself recharged and reformed. 
With the world premiere of his exhilarating work "In the Mix," Lewis asked 
members of the group to stretch far beyond his sparse vignettes of 
notes-on-paper that provided a loose structural grid. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis is far more fluent in the mysterious ways of improvisation than the EAR 
Unit, but the group rose to the occasion nobly. In short, Lewis played the wily 
house guest who showed up and rearranged the furniture, leaving the place in a 
beautiful mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Lewis' piece, which took up the concert's second half, 
counteracted the opening work, Mark Waldrep's "Thrown Doors," a noisome 
electro-acoustic affair that suffered from an unbearable cuteness of being. In 
it, cellist Erika Duke-Kirkpatrick and flutist Dorothy Stone were interrupted 
by "random access accompaniment" -- sampled material of such irrelevance as new 
age drivel, heavy metal guitar, and natural sound bites. This kind of 
post-modern patchwork shtick is stale news by now. It added up to bad old wine 
in a recycled bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more impressive in the first half was Eric Stokes' "Whittlings," a kind of 
Bali-meets-Kansas City concoction, in which a bluesy set of four notes are 
permutated in an ironically folksy minimalist fashion. Virko Baley's 
"Dreamtime" celebrated life during dream states, in an adventurous piece full 
of jauntiness, delirium and existential dread. 
</P>
<P>
 Following that eloquent portrait of a fitful sleep, the EAR Unit came fully 
alive, embracing music of the moment after intermission. The iconoclastic Lewis 
did the honors of egging them on and waking them up.JOSEF WOODARD

MUSIC REVIEWS; CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY IN RADIANT OUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Great music-making always balances passion and precision, instinct and 
intellect. In the chamber-music arena, only a few ensembles maintain such 
balances consistently. 
</P>
<P>
 The spring, 1994, tour group from the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center 
-- seven major players, without a pianist or a singer -- is a member of that 
elite. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-year hiatus, it returned to the Irvine Barclay Theatre on 
Wednesday night, was scheduled at Pepperdine University in Malibu Thursday, and 
plays tonight on the Queen Mary in Long Beach Harbor, under auspices of the Da 
Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's College. Given the many musical joys 
delivered at Irvine, a trip to Long Beach would be a wise investment, and no 
risk at all. 
</P>
<P>
 All by itself, the playing of clarinetist David Shifrin could justify that 
trip. Now the group's artistic director, Shifrin still makes music as 
compellingly as he ever did. His unselfconscious but utterly authoritative way 
with Mozart's A-major Quintet, K. 581, in association with violinists Ani 
Kavafian and Carmit Zori, violist Paul Neubauer and cellist Fred Sherry, proved 
revelatory to both mind and heart: Its thoughts moved in an irresistible sweep 
at the same time that its sounds held the listener in thrall. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the four-part performance approached that level. At the 
conclusion, all the players came together for a radiant and faceted reading of 
Ravel's Introduction and Allegro. At the beginning, violinist Zori and harpist 
Nancy Allen revived a cherishable, virtually unknown "Fantaisie" by Camille 
Saint-Saens with great affection and effortless virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
 At program's center, flutist Ransom Wilson, with Neubauer and Allen, made 
beauteous sense out of a work that often goes unclarified -- Debussy's Sonata 
for flute, viola and harp -- tying together what we have sometimes perceived as 
loose ends, creating an emotional scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 This, then, turned out to be more than a handsome performance; it became an 
essay in textures and a probing of nonverbal meanings. Chamber-music 
performances always aim in this direction. Sometimes they achieve the goal. 
</P>
<P>

concert of the season, tonight at 8 in the Queen's Salon aboard HMS Queen Mary 
in Long Beach Harbor, sponsored by Chamber Music in Historic Sites. (310)

RESTAURANT REVIEW; RAFFAELE WILL HAVE TROUBLE KEEPING UP WITH THE PREGOS; 
POSITIONED SQUARELY IN THE DOMAIN OF MANY POPULAR BEVERLY HILL RESTAURANTS, THE 
ITALIAN EATERY HAS A LOT TO LIVE UP TO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raffaele, a small, fairly decent, slightly pricey Italian restaurant, has put 
itself in a tough spot: on Little Santa Monica Boulevard between Bedford and 
Camden in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes it a block from Da Pasquale, the quintessential neighborhood 
Italian cafe, and around the corner from both the well-conceived Il Pastaio and 
the consistent, long-lived Prego. 
</P>
<P>
 Raffaele has its pleasures, but also its flaws. In a less restaurant-rich ZIP 
code, customers might well take the time to navigate Raffaele's contradictions. 
But 90210 customers, given the spate of more-polished options, are more likely 
to go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The room is pleasant enough -- deep and narrow with a comfortable banquette 
along one wall. But pale pink walls are closely packed with sentimental, pastel 
faux-Renoirs in huge gilt frames. There are fresh flowers on each table, and 
back on the counter, the requisite display of Italian oils, vinegars and wines, 
including a Gargantuan bottle of champagne.  
</P>
<P>
 The menu is essentially the menu: a nearly ubiquitous constellation of 
antipasti, pasta and entrees augmented by a handful of specials. Ingredients 
are of high quality; preparation is generally adept. Prices are a bit high -- 
especially when one orders the specials, which are substantially higher than 
anything on the menu. I'm still thinking about the appetizer made with 
stunningly fresh, lightly grilled scampi. Compared to those fat, sweet shrimp, 
a perfectly good bresaola with shavings of Reggiano Parmigiano is dull. I wish 
the fresh Manila clams would come in a broth rather than a thick tomato sauce, 
but the flavors are sharp and lively. 
</P>
<P>
 Salads run the gamut from underdressed to sopping; a Caesar is downright dry 
while a tricolore salad swims in a brown balsamic vinaigrette. At lunch, I'm 
delighted by a bright, fresh calamari salad. Another salad, capricciosa , with 
roasted bell peppers, grilled eggplant, shredded carrots and goat cheese is 
also juicy and good, if a bit garbled. 
</P>
<P>
 I have the most consistent luck with pasta. At first, I am disappointed that 
the "basil sauce" on my rigatoni with chicken and mushrooms turns out to be a 
tomato sauce allegedly spiked with basil leaves. But it's a fresh tomato sauce, 
the chicken is tender and after a few mouthfuls, I'm a fan. I'm also converted 
to Raffaele's capellini with fresh chopped tomatoes and large grilled scallops. 
</P>
<P>
 Polenta con salsiccia here is made with a virtuous if uninspired chicken 
sausage, and served with rather too-cooked spinach. Veal scaloppine with a 
creamy mustard and porcini mushroom sauce is fine. A dinner special, Norwegian 
salmon, is awfully small, overcooked and, we discover when we get the bill, 
awfully expensive -- $19. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's not on the menu, the chef prepares me a lovely chicken piccata, 
the fileted white meat pounded, tender and topped with thin slices of peeled 
lemon. I have a choice of vegetables or pasta and choose pappardelle, flat, 
chewy flaps of pasta in a marinara sauce. All told, it's a classic, satisfying 
plate of food. Such flexibility in the kitchen is exactly what can and should 
build up a loyal clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The service is friendly enough, but there are service-related 
misunderstandings. We are rushed one night to finish our appetizers, and for no 
good reason: Our next course is the aforementioned Caesar salad, so dry it 
could have sat for hours without wilting. 
</P>
<P>
 Wine is $4.50 a glass on the menu, $5 on our bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious misunderstanding occurs when two of us order double decaf 
espresso. On this particular occasion, I'm up all night thanks to the "decaf," 
and so, I discover several days later, was my friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing like a lost night of sleep to chill one's ardor for a restaurant, even 
for a restaurant that makes such a killer chicken piccata. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raffaele, 9634 Little Santa Monica Blvd., Beverly Hills, (310) 276-4466.

ART REVIEWS; ISERMANN: MUTATIONS OF ART AND DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Isermann has long been a connoisseur of 1950s and 1960s kitsch: atom 
clocks that would be at home in Denny's along any interstate highway; boomerang 
coffee tables boasting a rec-room insouciance; flower-power paintings rendered 
in the ice blues and pinks once so dear to suburban teen-age girls armed with 
matching Princess telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's kitsch was yesterday's mid-cult pretension and will be tomorrow's high 
style -- resurrected first by the subculture and then by the canny omnivores 
who purvey such things to those willing and able to put up hard cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Isermann revels in the irony of such cultural recyclings and cross-generic 
mutations of design into art -- and back again. But he does so without the 
cynicism that informs the neo-Pop work of Peter Halley, similarly concerned 
with bankrupt styles and inherited vocabularies, or Ashley Bickerton, who 
investigates the blurred boundaries separating the commodity from the art 
object. 
</P>
<P>
 For those unfamiliar with Isermann's lattice-work panels, bean-bag chairs, 
shag rug "paintings," stained-glass windows and other decorative objects -- all 
rendered courtesy of a period palette that is half-poignant and half-seductive 
-- a mini-retrospective at Sue Spaid Gallery showcasing work of the past decade 
is revelatory. 
</P>
<P>
 It suggests the extent to which Isermann's recuperative aesthetic has itself 
been reformulated as a style by a number of younger artists and provides a 
context for his newest creations, a series of hand-pieced, fabric wall hangings 
concurrently at Richard Telles Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught somewhere between patchwork quilts and modernist paintings, the new 
works are visually dazzling. The zig-zagging florals, intricately interrupted 
plaids and concentric pinwheels enact Isermann's familiar slippages, while 
openly embracing certain feminist strategies that have long been buried here. 
Marked, like all of Isermann's work, by unrepentant beauty and under-recognized 
complexity, they secure the artist's position as the Watteau of thrift-shop 
rococo. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sue Spaid Gallery, 7454 1/2 2 Beverly Blvd., (213) 935-6153, through March 
30; Richard Telles Gallery, 7380 Beverly Blvd., (213) 965-5578, through April 
16; both closed Sunday and Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 * Landfill World: Anything overwhelming commands attention by virtue of 
sensory overload: too big, too loud, too much. It's a cheat only if there's 
nowhere else the work wants to (or can) go, as with Frank Stella's hyperbolic 
reliefs of the 1980s, Robert Longo's sculptural hysterics and many of Cady 
Noland's aggressively low-brow scatter pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Rhoades' new work overwhelms but does so as a means to an end. That is 
not to suggest the artist doesn't take his sweet time alternately frustrating 
and mesmerizing an audience, who is confronted with an excess of weirdly 
dysfunctional stuff custom-crafted for urbanites in the throes of one or 
another transitional crises. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking Styrofoam bookcases; area rugs made of stapled yellow index 
cards; bedroom and kitchen ensembles made of cardboard boxes swaddled in sheets 
of yellow legal paper; pick-up truck seats covered in yellow sheepskin with 
bananas stuck in the folds; a combination ceramic kiln and stereo made of tin 
foil; plastic waste buckets; paper bushel baskets; discarded burrito wrappers, 
and enough ersatz, domesticated, would-be landfill to cover every square inch 
of the Rosamund Felsen Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 This back-handed paean to home improvement is quite pointedly titled "Swedish 
Erotica and Fiero Parts." The Fiero, a short-lived model introduced by Pontiac 
in 1984, was an American product fabricated to marry Japanese efficiency and 
Italian style; a yellow one is parked in the gallery's lot. A commercial flop, 
the car emblematizes sham design. It also represents a desire to cultivate a 
rarefied aesthetic impossibly at odds with an indigenous style. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swedish Erotica" works similarly here. It conjures a U.S. company whose name 
capitalizes upon the allure of European sex films of the 1960s -- from "Wild 
Strawberries" to "I Am Curious (Yellow)" -- in order to market home-grown 
sleaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "I Am Curious (Yellow)" might be the subtitle of this show, with its surfeit 
of yellow and its spiraling references to another borrowed Swedish aesthetic, 
the tremendously successful Ikea chain, which peddles prefabricated furnishings 
to Americans equally enamored of a national tradition of handcrafting and a 
murky vision of Continental high style. 
</P>
<P>
 With sweaty intensity, Rhoades redoubles our double fixation. Ironically, his 
fervor illustrates the politics of inauthenticity while arguing for the 
artist's passion for his tools, his materials and the fabulous (if essentially 
useless) things he can do with them.

 * Just Watch It Grow: Amid the world-weariness, pathos and anger that too 
often double as the stuff of art, Daniel Wiener's lack of attitude is cheering. 
As a descriptive term, no-attitude does not imply no-nonsense. On the contrary, 
in Wiener's case, it suggests an unadulterated pleasure in making things and 
watching them grow. 
</P>
<P>
 And grow Wiener's sculptures seem to do, before our disbelieving but riveted 
eyes. At Food House, a yellow, blob anchored to the floor grows into a 
delicate, golden mesh studded with tiny jewels (like nothing so much as a 
mermaid's negligee) and then into a psychedelic basketball hoop, perfectly 
designed for a team of perpetually stoned mice. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, a stuffed orange tube of fabric segues into a quartet of spindly 
wires twisted into the ceiling's rafters and then, without warning, into a pair 
of Flying Wallenda-type figures who dive-bomb their way onto a stunningly 
ornamental sweep of wire -- a looped, wrapped, coiled affair that trails off 
into thin air like skywriting glimpsed a moment too late. 
</P>
<P>
 As an artist, Wiener incarnates multiple roles. He is an alchemist, turning 
base materials such as dyed muslin and wire into all manner of wonders; a 
storyteller, whose particular perversity is a disdain for narrative, and a 
sculptor occasionally more interested in color than form. Thoroughly 
unexpected, his work is an uncommon delight. 
</P>

<P>
 * Wonder Words: Cascading dots of red, yellow and blue slip in and out of deep 
space -- imploding, exploding or simmering like stars in a galaxy whose time is 
up, or like molecules dissolving into a gaseous haze. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of simulacra of the word wonder triumphantly skip across, dissolve into 
or hide behind their transparent screens. Or, they slink to the bottom in a 
heap, as if defeated before given the chance to prove themselves worthy of the 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a trick Michael Gonzalez performs at Thomas Solomon's Garage with a few 
sheets of layered plastic, some fasteners and a supermarket shelf full of bags 
for Wonder English muffins and hot dog buns. Wonder Bread is indelibly 
associated with '60s optimism, with a drive toward biological, economic, 
interplanetary and psychic expansion. Gonzalez attempts to inject these myriad 
associations with a sly critique of the utopian aspirations of 20th-Century 
art. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, he doesn't get too far. He pokes a bit of fun at everyone from 
Jean Crotti to Andy Warhol, but poking fun is not what Gonzalez does best. What 
has distinguished his work in the past is a recalcitrant -- and, indeed joyful 
-- inventiveness that short-circuits the irony and thereby complicates the 
critique. 
</P>
<P>
 The formal manipulations enacted here simply aren't up to Gonzalez's own 
standards. They destine the work to be rather ordinary. 
</P>

THEATER BEAT: SUPPRESSED TENSIONS SURFACE IN 'RAPTURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Hare's "The Secret Rapture" at Theatre 40 is an engrossing drama full of 
subtle characterization and sophisticated ethical quandries. Yet it also has 
moments of good old-fashioned suspense. So even though the players in this 
bare-bones production aren't all up to the task, Hare triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
 A very British look at the suppressed tensions between two sisters and several 
significant others in their lives, "The Secret Rapture" tackles complex 
philosophical questions of obligation and duty without sacrificing the 
interpersonal drama. It's about the imperative of truth, as well as the ties 
that bind. 
</P>
<P>
 Isobel (Ann Hearn), the enigmatic central character, runs a small design firm 
with her boyfriend Irwin (Andre Barron). Her sister Marion (Carlyle King) is a 
government minister married to an evangelical businessman (Webster Williams). 
The siblings' lives are complicated when their father dies, leaving behind an 
alcoholic young wife (Rachel Davies) whom Isobel takes in. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Secret Rapture's" essential subject is the loss of purpose, a theme that 
plays itself out in different ways with several of the characters. As in Hare's 
"A Map of the World" and "Plenty," personal desires are pitted against the 
needs of others, with consequences that are not only ambiguous but unavoidably 
painful. 
</P>
<P>
 Hare's 1988 play, which is due out this year as a feature film starring the 
highly regarded stage actress Juliet Stevenson and Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, 
belongs to the women, or rather it should. But it's the men who deliver the 
admirably and appropriately restrained performances in director Stephen 
Tobolowsky's intelligent production. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Secret Rapture," Theatre 40, Beverly Hills High School, 241 Moreno 
Drive, Beverly Hills. Mondays-Tuesdays, 8 p.m. Ends April 19. $10. (213) 
466-1767. Running time: 2 hours, 25 minutes. 'The Blue Angel' Goes to Boston 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 What is it about a nerdy man and a sensuous woman? The combination has long 
been a staple of Western literature. Beyond the good vs. evil conundrum, it 
seems to stoke our fantasies (and fears) of sexual and moral escapism. And 
that's certainly the appeal of "The Night Angel," a flawed but provocative play 
in an intermittently compelling production at the Open Fist Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the pubs of pre-World War II Boston, William Piana's adaptation of the 
Heinrich Mann novel "Professor Unrath" -- the same work on which the film "The 
Blue Angel" was based -- has both milieu and character going for it. But the 
story of the lonely professor and the siren singer gets bogged down by a 
misplaced and unrelieved sense of its own weighty undercurrents. 
</P>
<P>
 As a parable of repression and indulgence, "The Night Angel" ably pits an 
archetypal female character against a familiar male persona. The interest isn't 
so much in what will happen -- we know it will end badly, if not how -- but in 
watching the intellectual man reduced to total subjugation and humiliation. 
Libido liberates, then destroys, while Lola emerges unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for all the symbolism, there's something missing. "The Night Angel" 
isn't Expressionistic, but it's not realistic either. Instead, Piana's 
adaptation is waylaid between the two styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherri Stone Butler is the winningly zaftig Lola, an equal opportunity vamp 
who's just as happy ensnaring school boys as toying with the affections of 
cloistered academics. Marc Sandler is convincing as the uptight Dr. Rath, the 
kind of guy who listens to Delibes and Puccini arias in his study and breaks 
out in a cold sweat when he comes near anything female. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the theatricality of this amorality tale is diminished by 
director Dalene Young's lugubrious pacing. And the game supporting ensemble 
isn't seasoned enough for this kind of material. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Night Angel," Open Fist Theatre, 1625 N. La Brea Ave., Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends May 7. $15. (213) 882-6912. Running time: 2 
hours. 'Bluefish Cove' Quaint but Viable 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The late Jane Chambers' "Last Summer at Bluefish Cove" at Theatre Geo is a 
perennial of lesbian theater that's been much seen in L.A., including a 
20-month run in 1983 and a 1985 revival. The only surprise now is that a 
top-notch cast can still make this rigged melodrama work. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in a summer beach colony in 1980, the play focuses on eight women: three 
couples, one single and a stray straight woman named Eva (Dey Young), who just 
happens to rent the one vacant cottage for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the innocent Eva doesn't know what kind of Garden of Eden she's 
gotten herself into. And just as predictably, she falls for the loner Lil (the 
singularly magnetic Denise Crosby), who happens to be dying of a brain tumor 
(gals, get your hankies ready). 
</P>
<P>
 The setup is so pat, you can tell what will follow from the outset. As the 
women gather for a party at Lil's, we recognize the stock personalities: the 
rich older woman Sue (Maree Cheatham) and her kept bimbo Donna (Sarah Ann 
Morris); the handy-around-the-house sculptor Annie (Martha Gehman) and her 
loves-to-cook partner Rae (Rachel Chagall); the closet-case doctor-author Kitty 
(Jane Elliot) and her suffering girlfriend-secretary Rita (Mary Cadorette). The 
rest of the play consists primarily of the couples (and the audience) watching 
Eva and Lil's doomed romance move toward its inevitable tear-jerker ending. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, "Last Summer at Bluefish Cove" is a slice of domestic life, 
notable only because such views still aren't usually of exclusively female 
households. Just under that surface, however, it's a classic journey toward 
self-fulfillment, as the initially passive Eva gets a grip on who she is and 
what she wants. "I think she was a feminist," Eva says early on. "She assumed 
that I was in charge of my own life." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how innovative Chambers' play may have been when it was first 
staged, the expansion of lesbian literature since that time makes it now seem 
quaint. But this staunch ensemble, under Dorothy Lyman's competent direction, 
brings so much humanity to these characters that you can almost forgive the 
play its excesses. Besides, it's still a regrettably rare treat to see so many 
strong women's roles onstage at once. 
</P>

Hollywood. Thursdays-Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends May 8. $22. (213) 466-1767. Running

SEND IN THE SONDHEIM; MUSICAL THEATRE COMPANY DEBUTS WITH 'NIGHT MUSIC' AT THE 
GEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The idea began percolating about six years ago, when "Forbidden Broadway" was 
playing at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo. George Quick and Beth Hansen 
had mounted the wild lampoon of mainstream musicals and were thinking about 
their futures. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, they started into the practical stuff -- demographics, finding a 
pool of actors -- determining the basic feasibility of the dream. But it wasn't 
until recently that the long-time local stage veterans (who continued with 
their Saddleback ventures, including the praised "Sweeney Todd" and "Christmas 
With Sal & Amanda Gecko") finally put their plans for a troupe into dress 
rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, their fledgling Costa Mesa-based Musical Theatre Company is about to 
unveil its first production, Stephen Sondheim's "A Little Night Music." It 
opens at the Gem Theatre in Garden Grove tonight and will continue for three 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision to do musical theater was foremost a personal choice; it's 
something we love," said Quick, who is directing. "We also realize that musical 
theater is popular, so we're optimistic we can succeed." Still, he stressed, 
they want to do more than "just commercial, vapid entertainment. We want 
theater that is really immediate and alive." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Hansen also want the Gem for their home base, and if they get it, it 
would fill a gap created when GroveShakespeare folded last year and left the 
playhouse without a full-time occupant. Quick said officials of the City of 
Garden Grove, which owns the building, are evaluating the Musical Theatre 
Company's proposal, which is still in the vague, initial stages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like Garden Grove because it's centrally located," Quick said. "The 
demographics say it would be good. We want to attract people from L.A. (County) 
as well as O.C." He said the company has been developing a mailing list that 
currently includes about 18,500 residents of the two counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Their plans for the Gem might include bringing in various groups with 
different specialties, Quick said, "like a classics company, a children's 
theater group, maybe modern drama. We'd probably look at new and existing 
groups for the Gem" -- and perhaps for the nearby Festival Amphitheatre, also 
owned by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the city doesn't accept their proposal, Quick said he and Hansen would be 
willing to keep renting the Gem on a show-to-show basis. Actually, Quick and 
Hansen's plans for the company itself are pretty fluid. Although they plan to 
do four shows this season, they haven't set dates or even decided which shows 
they will be. Among those being considered: "Man of La Mancha," "The Mystery of 
Edwin Drood" and "Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris." 
</P>
<P>
 In coming seasons, though, the company -- which would like to cast a mix of 
professional and amateur actors in its productions -- expects to focus on 
Sondheim, a personal favorite of Quick and Hansen's. The choice of "A Little 
Night Music" as their maiden offering reflects their goal, Quick said: "It has 
uplift, so it's good for spring, but it's also thought-provoking." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen plays Desiree, a Swedish actress at the center of the musical's plot 
line. Her tricky relationship with the already-married Fredrik gives Sondheim 
the opportunity to explore, as is his custom, the checkered aspects of love. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Little Night Music" was inspired by Ingmar Bergman's moody comedy "Smiles 
of a Summer Night."  
</P>
<P>
 "There was much more of a dark undercurrent in the film," said Quick. "As a 
musical, it's definitely lighter, but there's a rumbling about what's going on. 
There's a darkness below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly aware (of the film) and use it to inform me as a backdrop, but 
I approach the musical as a separate piece." 
</P>
<P>
 The show is further distinguished, he noted, by music written entirely in 
three-quarter time or variations thereof. Among the songs is one of Sondheim's 
most popular, "Send in the Clowns," which is sung by Desiree. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I really like about Sondheim tends to be more complex" than "Send in the 
Clowns," Quick said. "But as it fits into (the history of) the musical theater, 
it's one of the best, most elegant ballads ever written. It's certainly his 
best known, and it does surprise you when it comes up." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Musical Theatre Company's production of "A Little Night Music" by 
Stephen Sondheim opens tonight at 8 at the Gem Theatre, 12852 Main St., Garden 
Grove, and will continue through April 10, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 
p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m. $18-$24. (714) 636-7213 or (714) 668-9284.

'TRIO' PAYS HOMAGE TO TROUBLED TCHAIKOVSKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's one of the most extraordinary stories in classical music: The intense 
relationship between Tchaikovsky and his wealthy widowed patron Nadezhda von 
Meck. Despite 13 years of intimate correspondence, the two never met. 
</P>
<P>
 Their liaison has been touched on in film, including Ken Russell's 
characteristically idiosyncratic 1971 biography "The Music Lovers." Now, San 
Francisco choreographer Robert Sund has made it the focus of a new ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tchaikovsky Trio," set to the composer's Piano Trio in A minor (1881), 
premieres on Ballet Pacifica's mixed bill tonight and Saturday at Irvine 
Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Sund, a former San Francisco Ballet soloist, created the dance last summer 
during the local troupe's third annual choreographer's workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do something to pay homage to Tchaikovsky," whose music is 
integral to every ballet dancers' career, Sund said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The legendary composer's life presented plenty to explore. Tchaikovsky had a 
brief, profoundly unhappy marriage to Antonina Milyukova, whom he nevertheless 
continued to support until her death in an insane asylum. His homosexuality may 
have contributed to his nearly lifelong, morbid depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was his epistolary intimacy with the widow von Meck. While she 
generously subsidized much of his career, they corresponded voluminously. But 
she insisted that they never meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked for nothing in return except his beautiful music," Sund said during 
a telephone interview from Memphis, where he was choreographing another new 
dance for Memphis Concert Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 Sequences in the four-person ballet representing the couple's relationship are 
"full of innuendo, emotion and a lot of love," Sund said, but, dancers 
portraying them "don't really see each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Characters representing the composer's wife and a composite figure 
representing "the male influence in his life" complete the period-costumed cast 
of "Tchaikovsky Trio," Sund said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neoclassic in style, "it's a non-narrative ballet, really just suggesting 
Tchaikovsky as a person," he said, adding that he chose the "melodramatic," 
"very personal" Tchaikovsky Trio partly because the composer had dedicated it 
to a close male friend, Moscow Conservatory director Nicolai Rubinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main inspiration for me is always the music," Sund said. "The idea for 
the ballet was right there when I listened to this piece." 
</P>
<P>
 ("Tchaikovsky Trio" is one of three works to be danced to recorded music. The 
fourth work, "Liebeslieder Waltzes," set to the Brahms score, will have live 
accompaniment: two pianists and the John Alexander Singers, a group of 18 
student and professional singers organized and to be led Saturday by Alexander, 
conductor of Orange County's Pacific Chorale.) 
</P>
<P>
 After beginning to put the work together, Sund became aware that the breakup 
of his 12-year marriage to San Francisco Ballet principal Evelyn Cisneros also 
figured into the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting over the divorce when I choreographed this ballet," he said, 
"and I sort of related to the idea of a man struggling with a relationship with 
a woman, and the idea of . . . having a wonderful relationship with a woman you 
don't really know -- or who isn't present -- and yet not getting along with the 
woman you're with. 
</P>
<P>
 "This came out while I was working on the ballet. I suddenly realized: 'Wait a 
minute -- this is what I'm going through.' It was therapeutic, actually." 
</P>
<P>
 Debate over Tchaikovsky's death in 1893 continues. One school contends that he 
succumbed to cholera after carelessly drinking water that had not been boiled. 
The other asserts that he committed suicide over a rumored affair with the 
nephew of a Russian aristocrat. 
</P>
<P>
 However the composer's life ended, Sund ends his ballet with a "sculptural 
tableau" of the four dancers' bodies, meant as a monument to the immortality of 
Tchaikovsky's music. 
</P>
<P>
 "He faces, for one last time, the wife character, the von Meck character, and 
the male influence," Sund said, "and then goes off to the great beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tchaikovsky Trio" has been added to Ballet Pacifica's permanent repertory, 
and may be acquired by the Norwegian National Ballet, said Sund, a principal 
dancer with the Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle before joining the San 
Francisco Ballet in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 While he now spends most of his time teaching and choreographing in Europe and 
Japan, he said his two weeks in Orange County for the workshop were well spent. 
The project provides emerging dance-makers with the time, facilities and 
dancers to create new works. 
</P>
<P>
 Sund said Ballet Pacifica director Molly Lynch "made it possible for me to 
feel very comfortable and able to think about what I had to do, rather than 
worrying about a lack of time or funds or poor facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 * Ballet Pacifica presents the premiere of "Tchaikovsky Trio" by Robert Sund 
tonight at 8 and Saturday at 2:30 and 8 p.m. , at Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 
Campus Drive, Irvine. Also on the program: "By Lamplight" by Rick McCullough, 
"Personal Statement -- Common Knowledge" by Tina Gerstler and "Liebeslieder 
Waltzes" by James Jones. A discussion about the making of a ballet will follow 
each evening performance. $12-$15. (714) 854-4646.

MUSIC REVIEW; CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY IN RADIANT OUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Great music-making always balances passion and precision, instinct and 
intellect. In the chamber-music arena, only a few ensembles maintain such 
balances consistently. 
</P>
<P>
 The spring, 1994, tour group from the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center 
-- seven major players, without a pianist or a singer -- is a member of that 
elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning after a three-year hiatus, it returned to the Irvine Barclay Theatre 
Wednesday night, was scheduled at Pepperdine University in Malibu Thursday, and 
plays tonight on the Queen Mary in Long Beach Harbor, under auspices of the Da 
Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's College. Given the many musical joys 
delivered at Irvine, a trip to Long Beach would be a wise investment, and no 
risk at all. 
</P>
<P>
 All by itself, the playing of clarinetist David Shifrin could justify that 
trip. Now the group's artistic director, Shifrin still makes music as 
compellingly as he ever did. His unself-conscious but utterly authoritative way 
with Mozart's A-major Quintet, K. 581, in association with violinists Ani 
Kavafian and Carmit Zori, violist Paul Neubauer and cellist Fred Sherry, proved 
revelatory to both mind and heart: Its thoughts moved in an irresistible sweep 
at the same time that its sounds held the listener in thrall. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the four-part performance approached that level. At the 
conclusion, all the players came together for a radiant and faceted reading of 
Ravel's Introduction and Allegro. At the beginning, violinist Zori and harpist 
Nancy Allen revived a cherishable, virtually unknown "Fantaisie" by Camille 
Saint-Saens with great affection and effortless virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At program's center, flutist Ransom Wilson, with Neubauer and Allen, made 
beauteous sense out of a work that often goes unclarified -- Debussy's Sonata 
for flute, viola and harp -- tying together what we have sometimes perceived as 
loose ends, creating an emotional scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 This, then, turned out to be more than a handsome performance; it became an 
essay in textures and a probing of nonverbal meanings. Chamber-music 
performances always aim in this direction. Sometimes they achieve the goal. 
</P>
<P>

concert of the season, tonight at 8 in the Queen's Salon aboard HMS Queen Mary 
in Long Beach Harbor, sponsored by Chamber Music in Historic Sites. (310)

STORM BLAMED IN FATAL CRASH; WEATHER: OXNARD HIGH SENIOR IS KILLED IN THE 
ACCIDENT. MORE RAIN IS EXPECTED AND OFFICIALS STILL WARN OF POSSIBLE MUDSLIDES 
IN BURN AREAS. 
</P>

<P>
 A wind-driven storm from the Gulf of Alaska that brought heavy rain to Ventura 
County on Thursday and contributed to a fatal car accident in Oxnard was 
expected to drop more rain today, with flash floods still possible in areas 
scarred by last year's wildfires, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several car accidents occurred across the county during a wave of heavy 
downpours Thursday afternoon, including the fatal wreck in Oxnard that left a 
17-year-old high school student dead and his classmate in serious condition at 
a local hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Duff, a senior at Oxnard High School, was killed when he lost control of 
his car in the pouring rain and skidded into a traffic signal post on Ventura 
Road, authorities said. His passenger, 15-year-old Jeffrey Wedemeyer, was in 
stable condition, said a spokeswoman at St. John's Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Duff was driving 60 m.p.h. in a 45 m.p.h. zone when his 1988 Volvo spun out of 
control, Oxnard fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, about 90 people sought refuge from the rain at an emergency 
warming shelter run by the American Red Cross, officials there said. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol reported several road closures because of 
weather conditions. Potrero Road from Camarillo State Hospital to the Thousand 
Oaks city limits was closed because of rock slides, a mudslide shut down Santa 
Clara Avenue between Central Avenue and Friedich Road just north of Oxnard, and 
snow and ice closed a portion of California 33 near Wheeler campground, the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters predicted fast-moving, intermittent showers for parts of the 
county today as the powerful storm moves inland, with rain tapering off late 
tonight or early Saturday. Temperatures were expected to hover in the mid-50s 
and lower 60s during the day, dropping into the upper 40s tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm was expected to drop one to two inches in coastal areas and up to 
four inches in the mountains before clearing out this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is certainly the best chance of getting some heavy rain this season," 
said Harry Woolford, a meteorologist with Weather Data Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered showers began around noon Thursday, growing heavier in the early 
evening as the sky darkened. Snow began falling on Frazier Mountain in the 
afternoon, and flakes were expected to dust local mountains at elevations as 
low as 3,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the Ventura County coast, powerful winds prompted authorities to issue a 
gale warning for outer waters beyond the Channel Islands and a small craft 
advisory for areas closer to shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would not be a good idea to go out in your dinghy," said National Weather 
Service meteorologist Nick Leivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest danger posed by the storm was for flash floods and mudslides in 
fire-scarred areas near Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park and along Pacific Coast 
Highway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency officials issued a series of warnings about possible flooding, 
though only minor flood problems had been reported by late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for five major burn 
areas in Southern California, including the Greenmeadow fire. The warning was 
downgraded late Thursday, but a flash-flood watch remained in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "This storm would definitely have the potential (for a flash flood)," Leivers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 County fire officials issued a low-level alert early Thursday requiring 
firefighters at all stations to inspect their equipment and to be prepared to 
answer flooding calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a readiness call, to be prepared for higher levels of activity," 
said county fire spokeswoman Sandi Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 At four county fire stations, firefighters were prepared to offer sandbags to 
residents living in areas left bare by the Greenmeadow fire. Homeowners can 
receive up to 50 sandbags each, though only one person had picked up sandbags 
at the Thousand Oaks station by late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said they believed most residents were already prepared from 
previous storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Sheriff's Office of Emergency Services said they had begun 
no formal disaster preparations, but were giving weather updates to the county 
fire department and a disaster coordinator in the city of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sheriff Larry Carpenter issued a statement urging parents to keep their 
children away from flood channels, streams and rivers, which could quickly 
swell with runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff's search-and-rescue teams were placed on standby and helicopters 
were equipped to rescue flood victims. Two flight crews would be working 
through the weekend at the sheriff's heliport in Camarillo until the storm 
passed, said crew chief Ron Stufflebeam. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fatal car accident in Oxnard, Duff was pronounced dead as firefighters 
tried to extricate him from the mangled car. Rescue crews worked through 
pounding rain to remove Wedemeyer from the vehicle.  
</P>
<P>
 The car "spun out sideways and slammed hard into the post," said Oxnard Fire 
Captain Robert Bradley. "When we got on scene (Duff) had a very faint pulse, 
but he couldn't hang on." 
</P>
<P>
 At an open house at Oxnard High School Thursday night, administrators 
announced Duff's death and asked for a moment of silence during a gathering in 
the gymnasium. The program was later cut short as shocked students and school 
staff headed home early. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and teachers said Duff was a varsity football player and a member of 
the track team. Duff's mother is the principal at Sierra Linda School in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very responsible kid. He was very well-liked," said social studies 
teacher Chuck Cordes. 
</P>
<P>
 With the predictions of more wet weather today, agricultural officials were 
hoping the storm would help the county make up for a low amount of rain so far 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the storm, the county had received only 68% of the normal rainfall for 
this point in the rainy season, which runs from October to the end of April, 
said John Weikel, senior engineer with the county Flood Control District. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually storms this late in the season don't affect us a whole lot because 
they're normally followed by warm weather. But this storm is supposed to be 
exceptionally cold. That could be harmful to our celery and strawberry crops," 
said Earl McPhail, Ventura County agriculture commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rain helps most of the other crops, but for the short terms we have to 
worry about disease and decay problems with celery and strawberries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times correspondents Matthew Mosk and Maia Davis contributed to this story.

MIKE DOWNEY: COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; MISSOURI HAS A 
LOT TO OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Missouri is my kind of school. I pulled for Missouri to defeat Syracuse in the 
overtime segment of Thursday's NCAA basketball tournament game at the Sports 
Arena, which it did, 98-88. I will pull for Missouri to defeat Arizona for 
Saturday's West Regional championship, so Missouri can make the Final Four. Go, 
Mo, go.  
</P>
<P>
 OK, so maybe I should try harder to be neutral. I apologize up front to 
Arizona people. Arizonans play good ball, too. So maybe I shouldn't have 
enjoyed that amazing three-point basket by Missouri's Kelly Thames that took 
that crazy bounce. And maybe I shouldn't be rooting for Mizzou's Melvin Booker 
to go to the Final Four so he can keep wearing his Final Four cap and stop 
fibbing that he isn't really thinking about the Final Four. Don't be handing us 
that stuff, Melvin. 
</P>
<P>
 All I can say is, I like people from Missouri. I like people from Missouri the 
way other people like people from Wisconsin.  
</P>
<P>
 I like the University of Missouri and wish I had gone to school there. I like 
actors like Brad Pitt and Tom Berenger, who did go to school there. I like 
actresses like Kate Capshaw, who went there before she married that movie 
director who won all those Oscars the other night. I liked Sam Walton, who 
built all those Wal-Marts. I liked Marlin Perkins, who liked all those wild 
animals. I liked Tennessee Williams, who went to Missouri, not to Tennessee. I 
have no idea where Missouri Williams went.  
</P>
<P>
 But poor old Missouri doesn't win many of these NCAA things. Not many 
basketball championships. Not many football championships. What can I tell you? 
Missouri is seriously overdue. Norm Stewart has been trying to coach Missouri 
to a national basketball championship for so long now, I'm pretty sure it's 
since Mark Twain held season tickets. Missouri is sick of Duke. Missouri is 
sick of Michigan. Missouri is sick of waiting. Missouri is ripe.  
</P>
<P>
 That's why it was sort of surprising the way Stewart's Tigers reacted after 
winning Thursday's game. They played their hearts out. They did some of the 
best passing I have ever seen. And they never lost their cool when Syracuse 
came at them with a wild rally that dragged the contest into overtime. They 
kept getting big baskets from Big Game Thames and from Melvin "I Just Bought 
This Cap Because I Liked the Color" Booker.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet after winning, the winners weren't jumping up and down.  
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said, "I don't know why they're not jumping up and down. Maybe they're 
just tired. They did a lot of jumpin'." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the time they spent jumping trying to block the shots of one Adrian 
Autry of Syracuse, who snoozed his way to halftime with zero points, then 
loosened up after halftime with a cool 31. This did not include one basket that 
would have put Autry in the Western Heritage Museum of famous shots. He made it 
from his knees with 1:01 remaining in regulation, and it would have given the 
Orangemen the necessary points to win the game. If only the referee had let it 
count.  
</P>
<P>
 That one was one of the game's two stupendous shots. The other came shortly 
after halftime, when Missouri was in the process of pulling ahead. A Syracuse 
player had just rejected one shot by batting it toward the seats, in the 
general direction of famous Syracuse alumni, including Dick Stockton and Jim 
Brown. This forced the Missouri players to hurry, inbound and shoot the ball in 
time to beat the 35-second shot clock.  
</P>
<P>
 Thames took aim. His long, long three-point shot struck the rim and the 
basketball went boinnnggggg, like a diver off a springboard, maybe 10 or even 
15 feet in the air, higher than the shot clock. Ten astounded players watched 
it drop right back through the net, hardly disturbing the twine.  
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, Thames, who needed only 30 minutes to score 24 points, threw 
down a monster, NBA All-Star Weekend kind of dunk that put Missouri even 
farther in front, 51-42.  
</P>
<P>
 "The coach told us to take it to the basket, just go up strong," Thames said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hey, he goes up any stronger, he pulls a Shaquille and rips down the 
backboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri was well on its way to its first regional title game in 18 years. 
Last time the Tigers reached a regional final, Norm Stewart was hoping for a 
congratulatory phone call from President Ford. He has been waiting a long time 
for a season like this season, one that nearly got away from him when Syracuse 
scored eight points in 35 seconds and nearly won the game in the final minute 
before overtime.  
</P>
<P>
 It was time for the Tigers to start thinking about tomorrow, about those Final 
Four possibilities. Right, Melvin Booker? You don't really mean what you said 
about, "I don't think we're thinking ahead to the Final Four," do you, Mel? I 
mean, not sitting there with that Final Four cap above your ears.  
</P>
<P>
 Melvin claimed, "I like this hat. It's a nice color. That's why I bought it." 
</P>
<P>
 No, sorry, Melvin. Nobody is buying that. But you be proud of that cap. 
Thinking about the Final Four isn't anything to be embarrassed about. Missouri 
people have been thinking about it and thinking about it and thinking about it. 
Come to think of it, so have Arizona people.

A STAR IN HIS OWN RIGHT; WILKINS DOESN'T BELIEVE HE GOT HIS DUE IN ATLANTA, 
WHERE HE RANKED AMONG NBA'S BEST BUT NEVER TOOK HAWKS TO A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Dominique! Dominique! Dominique!" screamed the crowd behind the barricades as 
Dominique Wilkins boarded the Clipper team bus after a recent game at the 
Houston Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the way they're yelling, you'd think he was a movie star," said a 
security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins isn't a movie star, but he elicits the same type of response because 
of his flashy dunks. 
</P>
<P>
 The ninth-leading scorer in NBA history, Wilkins was flying long before Air 
Jordan took off, winning two slam-dunk championships and an NBA scoring title. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilkins, an eight-time All-Star who is headed for the Hall of Fame, 
believes he hasn't gotten the respect that Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and 
Michael Jordan received because he is perceived as a one-dimensional player and 
hasn't won an NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I never felt that I got respect," Wilkins said. "The fans were 
always great to me in Atlanta, and my peers around the league knew what kind of 
player I was and they gave me my respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me angry sometimes because it was almost like I wasn't there and I've 
been up among the league's top players for a long time and have never gotten 
the credit for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins' peers agree. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Nique gets shafted," Jordan told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last 
season. "He's among the top five players in the league, but because he's the 
star of the show, he gets blamed for everything. . . . If the Hawks ever won a 
championship, or even came close, that stuff would stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilkins helped the Hawks put together four 50-victory seasons in the 
1980s, they never advanced beyond the Eastern Conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta, which already has clinched a playoff spot, got off to the best start 
in team history under new Coach Lenny Wilkens this season, and Wilkins believed 
he finally had a chance to win an NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost that opportunity, though, when the Hawks traded him to the Clippers 
last month for disgruntled forward Danny Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trade was unjustifiable," Wilkins said. "No one has found a reason why it 
happened. It wasn't because of my abilities. Maybe it was a contractual thing. 
If you want to win a championship, you win it now, you don't try to plan for 
later. That doesn't make any sense. I don't have any idea what they were trying 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, whose scoring average decreased from 29.9 points last season to 24.4 
with the Hawks this season before the trade, said the Hawks asked him to shoot 
less, then criticized his production after he was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted me to change my game at the beginning of the year for the 
betterment of the team, and I've never had a problem with adjusting my game to 
the style of basketball we needed to play," Wilkins said. "But I don't think I 
got credit for that because after I left Atlanta they said my productivity was 
down and that I wasn't scoring as much. But I thought I was having a great 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the plays we ran in Atlanta, I wasn't involved in the offense. 
I was like the fourth or fifth option, and I was still getting 24 or 25 a 
night. And after the trade was made it was like, 'You could tell Wilkins was 
fading.' I was getting 24 a night. What were you people talking about? But I 
can still score with the best of them. Most guys around the league will tell 
you I haven't slowed down at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of Wilkins, who had played his entire 11 1/2-year NBA career 
with the Hawks, sparked protest among Atlanta fans. An Atlanta newspaper 
published a special section on Wilkins, and a TV station sent a crew to Los 
Angeles with Wilkins to record his Clipper debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in Georgia for so long that it was hard for him to leave," said 
Wilkins' wife, Nicole. "He really felt hurt. They handled it poorly. They 
didn't tell (him of the trade) directly, they tried to do it through me. He 
thought, after 12 years, he deserved at least that." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins hasn't sulked, though, since joining the Clippers, averaging 30.3 
points, 7.3 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 1.3 steals in his first 12 games. He has 
scored 30 or more points in eight games and has led the team in scoring nine 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disappointed at the beginning, but as I look back on it, I just have to 
move on with my life," Wilkins said. "Life is full of changes and you have to 
make the best of the changes. Actually, I think it was the best change of my 
career because sometimes when you're at a place for so long you get 
unappreciated because they're used to seeing you all the time. I like to look 
at the positive side of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clippers said after the trade that they hoped Wilkins would 
finish his career with the team, Steve Kauffman, Wilkins' agent, said last 
weekend that Wilkins would test the free-agent market at the end of the season 
because he has been unable to work out a deal with the Clippers. Wilkins is 
reportedly seeking a $21-million, three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking about it, but I don't let it affect my ability to play," Wilkins 
said. "I leave that up to them and see what they want to do and go from there. 
If you're serious about winning, you do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bob Weiss, who coached Wilkins for three seasons in Atlanta, 
says Wilkins, 34, has improved with age. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd think that 21 was his age, not his number," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade has revitalized the Clippers, who are 6-6 in the 12 games Wilkins 
has played since joining them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing he's given us is just an enthusiastic lift," Weiss said. 
"All the uncertainty is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Said rookie forward Harold Ellis: "Before the trade, everybody was uptight. 
But everybody is relaxed now. Everybody is feeling good about themselves. 
There's a much better atmosphere. People didn't even talk before, everybody was 
mad at each other. We have a totally different attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who were averaging 101.5 points before Wilkins arrived, have 
averaged 110.8 since. And the scoring averages of guards Ron Harper and Mark 
Jackson have also gone up because they have more open shots because Wilkins is 
routinely double-teamed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dominique has lifted everybody's game up because he's that good," Jackson 
said. "What I do best is get guys involved, and it's certainly good to have a 
guy who can flat-out score. He's a joy to play with, no question." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks, who won their first five games after the deal, said Manning is a 
better team player than Wilkins, because he's not so reluctant to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Danny's not open, he gets rid of the ball -- boom , it's in your hands," 
Hawk center Jon Koncak told Sports Illustrated. "I know it makes me a much 
better shooter to get the pass when I expect it rather than with two seconds on 
the shot clock after someone has dribbled and weaved and spun and couldn't get 
their shot, then flicked it to me and said, 'Launch it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins dismissed the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was uncalled-for," he said. "Of all the guys in this league, (for) Koncak 
to say something. . . . I was very disappointed in him for saying something 
negative. The trade was done, just leave it along. I could see if it was 
anybody else, a legitimate player." 
</P>
<P>
 The leading scorer in Hawk history with 23,292 points, Wilkins faces his 
former team for the first time since the trade when the Clippers play at 
Atlanta tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be emotional to the point where the fans will be happy to see me," 
Wilkins said. "But as far as playing against them, I'll treat (the Hawks) like 
I treat everybody else." 
</P>

 Wilkins has expanded his shot selection since suffering a torn right Achilles' 
tendon in January of 1992. Although the injury cost him a spot on the 1992 U.S. 
Olympic basketball team, it probably extended his career. Once known primarily 
as a dunker, Wilkins takes more three-point shots now. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people thought I could never come back and that my career was over, 
but I'm a competitor and I was going to come back, no matter what," Wilkins 
said. "It was a tough nine months (of rehabilitation). It made me more serious 
about my game and about me as a person. It gave me more focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins returned from the career-threatening injury to have one of his best 
seasons in 1992-93, finishing second to Jordan with an average of 29.9 points.

BANK IS SUING MCNALL, SEEKING $28.3 MILLION; HOCKEY: SUIT CLAIMS OWNER OF THE 
KINGS DEFAULTED ON A LOAN, BUT HIS SPOKESMAN SAYS, 'WE DISPUTE THE DEBT EVEN 
EXISTS.' 
</P>

<P>
 In another sign of growing business woes, King owner Bruce McNall is being 
sued in federal court in New York for $28.3 million by a Dutch-owned bank that 
alleges he defaulted on a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by The Times, European American 
Bank in Uniondale, N.Y., last week alleged that McNall personally owes $27.8 
million in principal on a loan, interest totaling at least $442,864 and 
unspecified costs and fees he is required to pay under an agreement with the 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
 A McNall spokesman disputed the bank's allegations Thursday. "We believe the 
suit is totally without merit, and, in fact, dispute that the debt even 
exists," spokesman Ron Iori said. A lawyer for European American Bank declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of New York, 
said that European American Bank and McNall entered into an amended loan 
agreement as of Feb. 1, 1992, with the principal amount set at $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall was required under the terms of the note to make monthly installment 
payments of $320,000 due Dec. 1, 1992, and Jan. 1, 1993. "McNall failed to make 
the necessary payments as required by the note and thus defaulted under the 
terms of the note and the amended loan agreement," the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
 European American Bank is a subsidiary of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. based in the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit does not specify what McNall used the money for, but in an 
interview last month McNall said one transaction the bank had financed for him 
in the past was his 1988 acquisition of Wayne Gretzky in what arguably remains 
professional hockey's biggest trade ever. McNall paid Edmonton Oiler owner 
Peter Pocklington a total of $15 million in the deal for Gretzky and two other 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing European American in the February interview, McNall said he was no 
longer involved with the bank. "They were the bank that financed the Wayne 
Gretzky deal. They're long gone. That's way back when," McNall said then. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit comes as McNall is working hard to wrap up a $60-million deal in 
which he plans to sell 65% of the Kings to Los Angeles telecommunications 
entrepreneur Jeffrey Sudikoff and partner Joseph Cohen. The move is largely to 
help McNall shed a loan with Bank of America, which had extended him $90 
million in loans and a line of credit. McNall is scheduled to continue 
operating the team as something of a managing partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospective owner Cohen said last week that the transaction was on schedule to 
close by the end of this month. Previously, the projected closing date had been 
the end of February. Sudikoff, chief executive of IDB Communications, added in 
an interview Saturday that he was comfortable with the deal's progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The European American lawsuit also follows a Times report this month detailing 
a number of other McNall business problems, including a separate lawsuit 
alleging he defaulted on a loan made by a Torrance bank, a court order obtained 
by Twentieth Century Fox attaching McNall assets for money he allegedly owes 
the studio and various late payments by his companies. 
</P>
<P>
 People familiar with McNall's financial situation have attributed the problems 
to such factors as softness in the rare coin business, where he is one of the 
world's major players, a steep debt load, losses from a Toronto football team 
he controls and an inability to exploit the Kings' popularity because of an 
unfavorable Forum lease. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall has denied he is having financial problems. A settlement is pending 
with the Torrance bank. McNall's dispute with Fox includes a suit he has filed 
against the studio alleging it mishandled the release of one of his films.

LOOK WHO'S A PROSPECT; AFTER CHECKERED PAST, THOMPSON'S BASEBALL STOCK RISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jason Thompson isn't plugging away in the San Diego Padres' farm system for 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in Class-A ball making $1,000 a month; that stinks," said Thompson, who 
expects to join the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes when the Padres break spring 
training. "Barry Bonds gets a check for $300,000 a week, so he makes more in an 
hour than I do in a year." 
</P>
<P>
 And Thompson, an outstanding student who might eventually enroll in law 
school, didn't choose professional baseball for the game's intellectual allure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've turned into an idiot," the Laguna Hills High School graduate said. "You 
play every night for 150 games, hang around guys in the same context every day 
. . . I used to think I was intelligent, but I've lost all of my vocabulary. 
I'm just not using it. What do you say on a baseball field?" 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who needed an auto club Triptik to get through college -- he went to 
USC, Saddleback, Pepperdine and Arizona -- had other options. He's only four 
classes away from a degree in finance, he had a 3.4 grade-point average in 
college and he thinks he could hold his own in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's still playing baseball because someone wants him to, and when you've 
had so many doors slammed in your face and overcome long odds to get where you 
are, it's only natural to play out the string, see how far you can go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any pressure," Thompson said by phone from the Padres' 
spring-training complex in Peoria, Ariz. "A lot of guys are supposed to be 
great from the start and they play with a lot of pressure, but me, heck, no one 
expected me to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go to practice and see 130 guys on the field, including six other guys at 
your position, all fighting to get where you want to go, and you think you'll 
never make the major leagues. But I'm just going to play hard and see what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Good things finally began happening last year for Thompson, who hit .353 with 
20 home runs and 74 runs batted in at Arizona and was named a second-team 
All-American by the Baseball Coaches Assn., quite an accomplishment for a 
walk-on. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-handed first baseman was a ninth-round pick of the Padres and hit 
.300 with seven homers, 26 doubles and 38 RBIs for San Diego's short-season 
Class-A team in Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 But until 1993 . . . well, it's no wonder, when asked about his background, 
Thompson chuckles and says: "It could get ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, now 6 feet 4, 205 pounds, didn't become a varsity starter until his 
senior year at Laguna Hills. Despite his .350 average in 1989, he hardly stood 
out on a 25-4 Hawks team that included Chris Sheff, Mike Helm and Mike Smedes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one four-year college or community college coach wanted Thompson. He 
enrolled at USC in the fall of 1989 and tried walking on to the baseball team 
but was cut after a two-day tryout. 
</P>
<P>
 Pondering his future over Christmas break, Thompson decided to call Jack 
Hodges, his high school coach who had been named head coach at Saddleback 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges assured Thompson that he'd have a chance to play, so Thompson 
transferred. He had a good-enough year at Saddleback in 1990 (.299, six homers, 
30 RBIs) to earn a partial scholarship to Pepperdine, which he jumped at. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was overwhelmed that somebody wanted me," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wave coaching staff was underwhelmed by his performance, though. 
</P>
<P>
 A zero-for-31 streak, which grew into a three-for-60 skid, dropped his average 
below .200, and the right fielder finished batting .231 with three homers and 
29 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine Coach Andy Lopez told Thompson after the season that he could 
return, but that he wouldn't figure in the team's 1992 plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave me a chance and I couldn't come out of it," Thompson said. "I hit 
.231 with an aluminum bat -- that's terrible. I could understand Lopez's point. 
I had to make a decision, but I didn't really have anywhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Schellenberg, a family friend and Saddleback assistant, did. He had some 
contacts at Arizona and made a few calls. Lucky for Thompson, the only good 
weekend he had all season for Pepperdine came against Arizona, when he was 
eight for 12 with a homer in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona Coach Jerry Kindall didn't offer a scholarship but did offer Thompson 
a roster spot. So it was off to Tucson, where Thompson did most of his 
development during a redshirt season in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got to Arizona, I didn't know if I could play the game anymore," 
Thompson said. "But Jerry Stitt, the hitting coach there, was really good for 
me. I wasn't mechanically sound, but we worked on one thing a week and spent 
most of the year in batting practice. I did well, and I didn't have a chance to 
fail in games. That helped my confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson played in Alaska that summer, then returned to Orange County for a 
few tuneup games before heading back to Tucson for his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked bigger, stronger and more confident," Hodges said. "He played in a 
summer-league game against us and hit three of the longest home runs I've ever 
seen at Saddleback. I told him then, 'You're ready.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson was a smashing success last season at Arizona. The designated hitter 
was a first-team All-Pacific-10 Conference selection and was Arizona's winner 
of the Pac-10 medal, an annual award honoring the school's outstanding senior 
athlete for his or her citizenship, academic performance and athletic ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a rocky road, going from a guy who was cut by USC, told he wasn't 
good enough at Pepperdine, to the point where a professional organization 
thinks you're as good as there is," Thompson said. "It was really scary, 
because at times I felt like I was out on a boat by myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's ship finally came in, though. His transformation from .231 hitter 
to college All-American can be attributed, in part, to his physical 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges said Thompson was "a little gangly, a little awkward," in high school, 
but a weight training program he began at Saddleback helped Thompson grow from 
a scrawny, 6-1, 150-pound high school junior to a powerful 22-year old today. 
</P>
<P>
 Mental maturity also played a major role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was unstable at Pepperdine -- I couldn't handle failure," Thompson said. 
"I'd go 0 for four and carry it into the next day. But at Arizona, it was all 
confidence. They kept saying, 'You can hit, you can hit, you can hit.' I struck 
out seven straight times there once but it didn't matter. I knew I could hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I reached a stage of maturity. At some point, around the age of 21, I 
finally realized it takes more to play this game."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; ANGELS MIGHT ASK TO RELEASE OWEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, who can't afford to trade for a top-quality middle infielder, are 
thinking of asking ownership if they can release Spike Owen and keep Mike 
Brumley. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen, acquired from the New York Yankees in December for pitcher Jose Musset, 
has struggled this spring. He is batting only .095 and has defensive 
deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Brumley, on the other hand, is batting .350 with a team-leading 10 runs batted 
in. He can play every infield position and center field and left field. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision on whom to keep would be easy, the Angels say, if it weren't for 
Owen's contract. Owen is guaranteed $4.25 million the next two seasons, and the 
Angels are responsible for $500,000 each of the next two seasons. It's unknown 
whether the team would be willing to eat the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a tough spring," said Brumley, who went three for four Thursday 
with three RBIs. "I've heard some trade rumors, and I'm trying to figure 
everything out. I've just decided to get myself ready to play in the big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'll be there, but in what colors, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels can't keep Brumley, and instead stick with Owen and Rod Correia 
as their utility infielders, they probably will trade Brumley to the Oakland 
Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have expressed interest in infielder Jose Oquendo of the St. Louis 
Cardinals or Jose Vizcaino of the Chicago Cubs, but decided the acquisition 
would be too costly. They instead are expected to start the season with second 
baseman Kevin Flora. . . . Angel reliever Craig Lefferts easily had his most 
impressive outing of the spring with a 1-2-3 inning, lowering his ERA to 18.00. 
"There's too much talent on this club not to be winning, even in spring 
training," Lefferts said. . . . Bo Jackson was interviewed Thursday and will be 
featured on ESPN's "Up Close with Roy Firestone." BOB NIGHTENGALE

NO CHARGES FOR UC RIVERSIDE WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Riverside County District Attorney's office will not prosecute members of 
the UC Riverside women's basketball team in connection with a fight on March 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem was that there was a fair amount of conflicting information 
given," said Tim Searight of the district attorney's office.Searight said the 
decision was made last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Riverside players Jennifer Newsome, 22, and Monica Vargas, 21, were 
engaged in a scuffle with several team members at a restaurant near the school. 
Vargas sustained a concussion as a result of the altercation and filed charges 
against team member Tawanna Terry. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsome and Vargas both left the program in the past year after disputes with 
teammates and Coach Debi Woelke. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside program was the subject of a Times story in October in which 
several players, particularly Newsome and Vargas, criticized Woelke and the 
program. Athletic Director John Masi investigated the complaints and took no 
action. ARA NAJARIAN

RAIDERS MAY END UP IN DODGER STADIUM; PRO FOOTBALL: DAVIS CONSIDERS OPTIONS, 
INCLUDING TEMPORARY MOVE. COLTS TRADE JEFF GEORGE TO FALCONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Raider owner Al Davis said Thursday that uncertainty over Coliseum repairs has 
prevented the team from mailing 1994 season-ticket invoices, a task that should 
have been completed nearly two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said that he hopes to keep the Raiders in the Coliseum but that recent 
earthquake damage there has forced him to consider other options. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those options is to temporarily move home games to Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Another would be to listen to offers from other cities once Davis is convinced 
that the Coliseum will not be ready. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he will not issue an ultimatum or disclose a timetable for his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still in Los Angeles, and we want to stay in Los Angeles," Davis said 
during his annual interview session at the owners' meetings here. "But there is 
a tremendous cloud of uncertainty relative to the Coliseum, and whether it can 
be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's more scary is that you don't know what will happen if there is another 
big aftershock." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he has refused to mail season-ticket invoices for two reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't be fair to the fans, not knowing if the Coliseum is ready," he 
said. "And when it is repaired, we're not sure how many seats there will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Coliseum officials have said they are unsure whether the $33 million in 
repairs will be completed in time for the opening of the Raider and USC seasons 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davis said he wonders if simple repairs will be enough to turn the 
facility into the first-class facility he once envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of only two stadiums in the league without luxury boxes. Until the 
capacity was reduced to 68,000 last year, it's 90,000-plus seats were rarely 
sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the environment forces you to act -- in 1980, it forced us to act," 
Davis said, referring to the first steps in a move from Oakland that was 
completed in 1982. "We have been unfair to our team and our organization for 
the last six or seven years." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis intimated that Dodger Stadium would be ideal because of its clean 
environment, which is missing around the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "A while ago we recommended that they turn the area around the Coliseum into a 
nice park environment, lots of lights and fences and kiosks, make it a real 
nice place to bring your family," Davis said. "But you know, that 'Rebuild LA' 
group, they could have done that but they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bob Graziano, Dodger vice president for finance, the team has not 
been contacted by Davis or city officials about a possible Raider move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position has been that if city or county officials ask us to accommodate 
a football team on a short-term basis, we would consider having them, providing 
it would not disrupt our baseball season," Graziano said. "But there have been 
no discussions at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said that he will decide in the next few weeks whether to pursue a lease 
with Dodger Stadium or phone officials in other cities who have contacted him, 
seeking the team. 
</P>
<P>
 He is already holding an offer from officials in Oakland to allow the Raiders 
to play there until the Coliseum is repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said that for reasons he would not discuss, the Rose Bowl is not an 
acceptable option. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings ended with nearly as much important player movement in one day as 
there had been in the entire previous month. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quarterback Jeff George was finally traded, as expected, by the 
Indianapolis Colts to the Atlanta Falcons for first- and third-round draft 
picks this year, and a conditional second-round pick in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 George didn't do his image much good after being asked about his problems 
playing for his hometown Colts. "Jesus went back to his hometown and he was not 
well received (either)," George said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wide receiver Anthony Miller became a Denver Bronco when the San Diego 
Chargers chose not to match a four-year, $10.5-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers also lost veteran linebacker Gary Plummer, who signed with the 
San Francisco 49ers for $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers apparently did not think Miller was worth the problems his 
contract would cause under the salary cap, and were worried about Plummer's 
age, 34. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Beathard, Charger general manager, countered by acquiring backup 
receiver Tony Martin from the Miami Dolphins for a fourth-round pick. "Anthony 
Miller did some awfully good things for us," Beathard said. "But if you have a 
chance to get better at a couple of other positions, you have to take that 
chance."

7-DAY NOTICE TO VACATE RAMS PARK WILL CREATE 'HARDSHIP,' RAMS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Rams acknowledged Thursday that they have been notified to vacate the 
premises at Rams Park no later than March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The football team and the city of Anaheim had been trying for months to 
renegotiate a new lease. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, Ram executive vice president, said in a statement that the 
seven-day notice from the City of Anaheim and the Magnolia School District to 
vacate the old Juliette Low School would create an "extreme hardship." 
</P>
<P>
 But school district Supt. Paul S. Mercier said the Rams should not be 
surprised and that the team made its own decision to leave by not signing a 
lease extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think anybody who looks at what has gone on over the months of negotiations 
can hardly characterize this as the poor Rams are being evicted," Mercier said. 
"I don't see this as a difficult IQ test. The Rams say they don't want to sign 
the lease. They're the ones walking away." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' statement did not say whether they would actually leave the facility 
by March 31. Shaw said he will meet with the team's attorneys today to discuss 
options. T.J. SIMERS and MATT LAIT

 Once, they were young. 
</P>
<P>
 At 20, one almost can't remember how it felt to be an 18-year-old freshman on 
Michigan's Fab Five. 
</P>
<P>
 It felt incredible. 
</P>
<P>
 It felt sort of the way Maryland feels now. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight in the Midwest Regional, the remaining Fab Four meet Maryland's Fab 
Two Plus Three, an improbable entry that starts two freshmen and three 
sophomores, finished the regular season by winning four of its last 12 games, 
then caught fire in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, when the Wolverine pups made their first run into the NCAA Final 
Four, all five of Maryland's starters were in high school, rooting them on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did see those guys playing in the NC-double-A," said Maryland point guard 
Duane Simpkins, then a senior at DeMatha High in suburban Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, you had to feel a little proud of them because they went out on a 
limb and at the same time, they made it look good. They were cocky and 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "But a lot of people at this point in time feel that since we looked at them 
and we were in high school and everything, we're kind of like in awe. But I 
know we don't hold them in awe. We're here to win this thing, like they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that anyone would admit it if he was in awe, but without Chris Webber, 
playing in the NBA, the Wolverines are now merely good, no longer scary. 
</P>
<P>
 They finished second in the Big Ten, No. 11 in the final Associated Press 
poll. Arkansas is the big dog in this regional, the Wolverines merely seeded 
No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't blow out anyone to get here, either. Pepperdine had two leads on 
them in the last 1:39 of regulation in their first-round game. Michigan slid by 
Texas to get here as center Juwan Howard, a single tower now, had 34 points and 
18 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say we're not intimidating as we were the last two years because we 
don't have a guy who blocks shots or who's big in the paint like a Webber or 
who takes up space," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it wasn't just Webber that we lost. We lost Eric Riley, Michael Talley, 
James Voskuil. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Without those guys, it's not like we're trying to prove things to people. 
Still and all, we're in a good mood. We feel like we're playing good Michigan 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Michigan ball isn't what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The cockiness remains, the trash talking, the calf-length trunks, black socks 
and sneakers. But a lot of points, rebounds, blocks and dunks walked away with 
Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its youth, Maryland bears only a passing resemblance to the Fab Five. 
All the Michigan freshmen were nationally recruited stars, enrolling in a 
program that had won an NCAA title two years before. 
</P>
<P>
 Their precocity was frightening. One of the upperclassmen they forced to the 
bench, Riley, was a No. 2 draft pick of the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maryland kids were recruited with the promise that they would play right 
away. They joined a downtrodden program, racked by years of scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Their top player, freshman of the year Joe Smith, was considered too skinny at 
6 feet 9 and 210, and ranked behind the stars of his class -- Rashard Griffith, 
Rasheed Wallace and Marcus Camby. 
</P>
<P>
 Once at Maryland, though, Smith started putting up numbers. He averaged 19 
points and 11 rebounds. In two games of the NCAA tournament, he has scored 51 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask someone who has been there, a surprising freshman and a mixed bag of 
underclassmen still don't add up to a Fab Five. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone's upset," Michigan's Ray Jackson said. "I just think 
everyone wants their own identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see Maryland as a totally different team than we were coming in. They're a 
good team in the same sense that we were, but they're made up of totally 
different players. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's no animosity or bad feelings because of that." 
</P>
<P>
 In college basketball, your last hurrah comes up quickly. Howard and Jalen 
Rose are considering leaving after this season. 
</P>
<P>
 If they do, the five will be two. What was will be a memory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game, mighty Arkansas, seeded No. 1, meets UCLA-slayer Tulsa, 
seeded 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Hurricane rained three-pointers on the Bruins and second-round 
victim Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson rumbles a warning: Don't miss. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they fall, you're in trouble," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they don't fall, then things change."

MEN'S NCAA TOURNAMENT / EAST REGIONAL; BOSTON COLLEGE IS DOING MORE THAN JUST 
KEEPING COURT TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Malcolm Huckaby, Boston College's deep-thinking senior guard, was watching 
ESPN the other night when he heard the announcer start talking about "watch" 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Huckaby understood it -- and let's face it, how hard can it be to 
understand anything on ESPN? -- a watch team gets invited to the NCAA 
tournament, loses its first- or second-round game, collects its commemorative 
souvenir wristwatches and quietly returns home. 
</P>
<P>
 That was supposed to be Boston College this year. The ninth-seeded Eagles 
would lose to No. 8 Washington State in the opening round of the East Regional 
or, if they survived the first game, get thoroughly beaten by top-ranked North 
Carolina in the next round. Back to Chestnut Hill they would go, wearing their 
new timepieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, well, instead of being a watch team, the Eagles (22-10) have become the 
team to watch as the regional semifinals begin tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College, which disposed of the mighty Tar Heels, now faces another 
basketball institution, this time Bob Knight's Indiana Hoosiers (21-8). 
Afterward, No. 2-seeded Connecticut (29-4) plays No. 3 Florida (27-7), but 
there is little doubt which game is attracting most of the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing against the Huskies and Gators, but the underdog theme plays well this 
time of year. Connecticut and Florida were expected to be here. That's why the 
NCAA selection committee awarded them such high seedings. Indiana, seeded 
fifth, and Boston College weren't such sure things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were on Cloud 9 for a couple of days, but I think we're back down 
now," Eagle Coach Jim O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three seasons ago, Boston College was 1-15 in the Big East Conference, and 
O'Brien was fighting to save his job. Even this season there were whispers that 
he could get the pink slip. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came the NCAA invitation, the school's first since 1985, followed by 
the victories over Washington State and North Carolina. At last, vindication. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last three years, we've been watching the NCAA tournament from our 
dorm rooms," Huckaby said. "It would have been a shame to go all four years 
without getting here." 
</P>
<P>
 Since beating the Tar Heels, the Boston College players have been treated like 
royalty back home. If guard Gerrod Abram receives any more congratulatory 
backslaps, he'll have to be treated for welts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around campus, it's been just like a dream," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before the Eagles arrived here, hunkered down in front of a VCR and 
started watching tapes -- eight, and counting -- of Indiana's motion offense 
and its recently improved defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really not that gifted as athletes, but they're very smart," Huckaby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that isn't to say the Hoosiers are five dorks with slide rules and 
sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Alan Henderson, who averaged 23 points and 12 rebounds in Indiana's 
two tournament victories, will give Eagle center Bill Curley (20.3 points, 8.9 
rebounds) lots to think about. Hoosier guard Damon Bailey and forward Pat 
Graham, who have been hobbled by injuries in recent weeks, said they're feeling 
much better these days. And then there's Knight, who was kind enough to remind 
everyone last week that he still knew a thing or two about the game. He proved 
it, too, as Indiana took the mystery out of Temple's matchup zone Sunday at 
Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are the Hoosiers buying any of this miracle-on-Chestnut Hill stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at the (Boston College-North Carolina) tape, and it wasn't a 
fluke," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Knight said that his assistants were told to pay careful attention to the 
Eagles in that game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt there was a very, very definite possibility of Boston College beating 
North Carolina," he said. "Boston College really had some strengths that really 
fit into North Carolina's weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the compliments, Boston College's Abram said he isn't sure the rest of 
the country is convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think none of us are going into the game thinking we're afraid of 
Indiana, or nothing like that," he said. "We're still going into the game as 
the underdogs. We beat North Carolina and everybody who picked North Carolina 
is now picking Indiana to win. So that's just keeping us going." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Connecticut is considered the favorite in the second game. The 
Huskies feature one of the nation's top five players, junior forward Donyell 
Marshall, whose 19.5-point, seven-rebound tournament averages actually have 
been questioned by some Connecticut followers. He averaged 25.4 points and 8.8 
rebounds for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at it, 19 points from anyone else would be a good night," 
Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall is the centerpiece for the Huskies, but not the only player who can 
cause damage. In all, four Connecticut players -- Marshall, Donny Marshall, 
Doron Sheffer and Ray Allen -- are averaging in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida features one of the premier backcourts with Dan Cross and Craig Brown.

PACKING A BIG PUNCH; BREA-OLINDA CATCHER MIKE BRAMBILLA HAS WORKED HARD TO 
BECOME ONE OF THE TOP POWER HITTERS IN THE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Brambilla stopped packing his bag and sat upright on the bench in front 
of his gym locker as he pondered the loaded question last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of the Brea-Olinda High baseball team asked Brambilla, their 
hot-hitting junior catcher, if he was going to hit a home run against Orange 
League archrival Valencia that day. Although Brambilla was swinging the bat 
well, he did not want to jinx himself with lofty predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 He figured the best thing to do was go with the standard line, "I'll do my 
best." Brambilla knew that to tell his buddies anything else might sound like 
boasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, honesty is the best policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Yeah, I'll hit one today,' " Brambilla said. "I'm a power hitter, 
that's my strong point, so I said I would." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he short-changed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambilla went well beyond his expectations with a home run, a triple, a 
double and four runs batted in as the Wildcats routed Valencia, 20-4. His 
attempt to hit for the cycle ended in his final at-bat when he grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a prodigious performance. Brambilla was anything but surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go to the plate, I look at the pitcher like, 'I'm better than you, you 
can't beat me,' " he said. "I get the feeling like nothing can stop me." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the time, Brambilla is correct. 
</P>
<P>
 A relentless worker and bursting with confidence, Brambilla, now a 17-year-old 
senior, has turned himself into one of the county's premier long-ball threats. 
He is the muscle in the offense for Brea-Olinda (6-2, 0-2 in league play), 
which is ranked ninth in the county and travels to Anaheim today for a league 
game at 3:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've totally dedicated myself to the game," Brambilla said. "I think that's 
why I've had the success I've had." 
</P>
<P>
 Brambilla, 6 feet 2, 195 pounds, is off to a torrid start, batting .519 (14 
for 27) with four home runs (tied for the county lead) and a county-leading 17 
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really proud of how fast I've started," Brambilla said. "I worked hard 
coming into the season to have a better year than I had last year, and I 
expected to, but I didn't think it would happen so quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Or with as much impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Powered by his two-run home run, Brea-Olinda defeated Simi Valley Royal, 9-5, 
in a championship semifinal of the El Segundo tournament March 10. The Wildcats 
defeated Edison, 7-3, for the championship March 12 as Brambilla had a homer, a 
double and four RBIs in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
 The impressive numbers, Brambilla said, have not come easily. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his normal practice time with the Wildcats, Brambilla also 
receives hitting lessons from Nelson Straley, the hitting coach at Ocean View 
High. For two hours every weekend, they work on refining Brambilla's swing to 
produce the most punch. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very talented kid who works hard," Straley said. "He deserves every 
bit of the success he's having." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the eye-opening numbers, Wildcat Coach Steve Hiskey said he did not 
expect anything less. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell just by looking at some guys if they can hit, and he's one of 
them," Hiskey said. "(The coaching staff) knew he would be able to hit at this 
level since he was a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is just one of those guys who usually produces." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had no doubts about Brambilla's ability, Hiskey kept him in the 
program's lower levels until last season. Hiskey said the Wildcats' varsity was 
dominated by talented seniors during Brambilla's freshman and sophomore 
seasons, and he would have only watched from the Wildcat dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 But last season, Hiskey relied on the lower levels because the entire roster 
from the previous season graduated. When his chance finally arrived, Brambilla 
went deep. 
</P>
<P>
 He was selected first-team all-league after batting .375 with six home runs 
and 23 RBIs. Brambilla tied for fifth in the county in home runs and threw out 
about 45% of runners who attempted to steal. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Brambilla won the Wildcats' Big Stick award, which is presented 
each season to the player who leads Brea-Olinda in extra-base hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't nervous (entering last season) because I've played a lot (of 
baseball)," Brambilla said. "I don't think I would have been prepared for 
varsity ball, or had as good a season, if I didn't play a lot before." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to keep an edge following his solid junior season, Brambilla played in 
organized leagues for top players under 18 in the summer and fall. 
</P>
<P>
 He has received letters from several colleges, but has no concrete plans for 
next season. Brambilla, who dreams of a career as a major league catcher, hopes 
to be selected in the June amateur baseball draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Straley believes Brambilla's dream might become reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a big kid who can hit for power," Straley said, "and any time a catcher 
can hit for power, people are going to be interested."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; SATISFIED THAT PITCHER IS OK, TEAM WILL TRADE 
FOR YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Angels informed the New York Mets on Thursday night that they will trade 
first baseman J.T. Snow for starter Anthony Young and are expected to complete 
the trade today. "Things have crystallized," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, whose trade talks with the Mets stalled a week ago when Young 
sustained a pulled groin muscle, are now satisfied that he is healthy. Young 
pitched two shutout innings Thursday against the Montreal Expos, and scouts 
Matt Keough and Moose Stubing turned in rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi relayed the information in a private meeting with Manager Buck Rodgers 
and the coaching staff after the Angels' 8-5 defeat to the San Francisco 
Giants. Bavasi received overwhelming support that the trade should be made  
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, desperate to find another starter for a pitching staff that is 
yielding a major league worst 8.16 ERA, made Young their top priority nearly 
two weeks ago. They wavered when Young injured his groin, but all of their 
medical reports indicate that he is sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching for the first time since March 13, Young gave up only one hit in his 
two-inning stint. He threw 28 pitches, 21 for strikes, and induced five ground 
balls from the eight batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt OK," Young told reporters, "but it's still not 100%. I had no problem 
pushing off. . . . For not throwing in 10 days, and coming back with two solid 
innings, I was happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The only unfortunate aspect of his outing, Young realizes, is that he pitched 
well enough to be traded. He wanted to stay in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, thrust in the national limelight last season with a major league record 
27-game losing streak, is 1-0 this spring with a 1.64 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 With Snow's departure, Eduardo Perez will be moved to first base for the 
Angels, allowing Dwight Smith and Bo Jackson to platoon in left field. Young 
will become the fourth starter in the rotation. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 Left fielder Kevin McReynolds of the New York Mets was hit behind the left ear 
by a pitched ball during a split-squad game against the Montreal Expos at Port 
St. Lucie, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 McReynolds, who hit a three-run homer in his first at-bat, was struck by Expo 
pitcher Tim Leary in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
 McReynolds never lost consciousness, although he was carried off the field on 
a stretcher and taken to a local hospital for observation. The Mets said they

 The winners of the American League's East and Central divisions will have the

winners of the National League's Central and West divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement signed between the players' union and the owners' Player 
Relations Committee, the AL East and NL West winners will have the home 
advantage in the league championship series if they advance that far. If a 
wild-card team wins in the first round, the home field would switch to the 
winner of the other series.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; LASORDA, CLAIRE SAY PARK BELONGS IN MAJOR 
LEAGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though neither would say the exact words, Manager Tom Lasorda and Executive 
Vice President Fred Claire suggested Thursday, in their strongest terms yet, 
that Chan Ho Park belongs in the major leagues and probably will make the 
team's opening-day roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, a rookie from Korea, is scheduled to start today's game in West Palm 
Beach, Fla., against the Montreal Expos. But Lasorda said that even if Park has 
trouble today, it will not alter the manager's opinion of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I've seen enough," Lasorda said. "I think he's got the stuff to pitch 
in the majors, yeah. That's my evaluation." 
</P>
<P>
 Claire said that he does not disagree with Lasorda's assessment of Park, who 
throws four pitches, has given up only two earned runs in 14 innings and has 
struck out 11 in four appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the quality of his pitches, they are of major league caliber," 
Claire said. "We're not at the point where we are announcing the pitchers who 
will make up our staff, but both Chan Ho and (1993 No. 1 pick) Darren Dreifort 
have shown us major league ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're fortunate enough in having here are the two top pitchers in the 
amateur baseball world last year. Not just two pitchers -- the top two." 
</P>
<P>
 So Park and Dreifort, who would be a reliever, both are near locks to start 
the season with the Dodgers? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the picture is pretty clear," Claire said. "The only thing they have 
to do is keep pitching, stay healthy and we'll make the decision we have to 
make. They are certainly on the path, and they are showing us what we want to 
see." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda has said all spring that the five veteran starters returning from last 
year's rotation would almost certainly be the five who start in this year's 
rotation, but he left room to possibly maneuver Park, who also could be a long 
reliever, into a starting spot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive game, the Dodgers fell behind, in the first inning, 
7-0, before rallying to win, 14-9. The Dodgers shelled Marlin pitchers for 16 
hits, including a first-inning grand slam by right fielder Raul Mondesi. TIM

PASEANA HAS LEG INJURY, WILL SKIP OAKLAWN AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paseana, the two-time Eclipse Awards winner, has suffered a splint-bone injury 
in her left foreleg and will be sidelined for about 30 days. The injury will

WIZARD, BIG REDHEAD TEAM AGAIN; BASKETBALL RECORDINGS OF WOODEN, WALTON ALSO 
LESSONS IN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The old guy and the middle-aged redhead have been some duo. 
</P>
<P>
 One molded young men into the greatest winning tradition his sport has ever 
known. The other became the best player in America. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wooden and Bill Walton. Is it really 20 years since they took their act 
to the top of the polls? 
</P>
<P>
 So much has happened. Larry and Magic have come and gone, and there have been 
five coaches at UCLA who couldn't handle an impossible assignment. The game is 
not the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe it is. That's the message from the famous UCLA coach and his famous 
pupil who, two decades after dominating college basketball, are back together 
again. Not on the court, of course. On cassette and compact disc. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden, 83, and Walton, 41, through the help of Reseda producer Harvey 
Kubernik, have reunited to record their impressions of the game and how it 
serves as a metaphor for winning in life, too. They talk about dribbling and 
defense, passing and the press -- the brains of basketball. But, most of all, 
they talk about practice and preparation, discipline and determination -- the 
backbone of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "They both wanted to give something back to the game," Kubernik said, "and 
this is more than just a sound bite." 
</P>
<P>
 Hours more, in fact. The two separate double recordings -- Wooden's "A Life In 
Basketball" and Walton's "Men Are Made In The Paint" -- were distributed by New 
Alliance Records in Los Alamitos and hit the stores in late February. The 
recordings comprise about six hours of expertise sprinkled with musical 
interludes that reflect the rhythm of the fast-paced game. The Walton music was 
provided by ex-Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek. Walton always likes to have good 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Kubernik, a pioneer in spoken word recordings, planned to include 
only Walton. He picked the redhead/Deadhead/talking-head after hearing him 
interviewed on radio and television. This wasn't Bill Walton circa 1973. "He 
didn't have the stutter of the Walton I had remembered," recalls Kubernik, 
president of BarKubCo Music, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, Kubernik, anxious to branch out beyond his traditional recording circle 
of counter-culture poets and alternative musicians, envisioned in Walton 
someone who symbolized winning and a proven work ethic. "I knew I could go the 
distance with him," Kubernik said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walton, instantly enthusiastic about the project, suggested Kubernik include 
Wooden. Walton called "Coach," and the answer was immediate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it for Bill," Wooden said. "We've been very close." 
</P>
<P>
 That news may stun longtime Bruin fans. As one former player put it: "Nobody 
gave Wooden more trouble than Walton." It was Walton, after all, whose numerous 
off-court acts of rebellion and defiance in the anti-Vietnam War era 
exemplified the growing generational rift between Wooden and the new brand of 
student-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 Walton was everything Wooden wasn't -- outspoken, flashy, risky. But that was 
1973. The years have mellowed Walton. He still loves basketball, Bob Dylan, the 
Grateful Dead, but now he's part of the Establishment, a commentator on NBC. 
Nobody is happier about that than Wooden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised at his success," said Wooden, who lives in Encino. "Bill 
has worked hard for everything. When he makes up his mind, he can do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other end of the mutual admiration society, Walton said: "I learned so 
much from him." 
</P>
<P>
 Making records with Walton and Wooden is the culmination of a Kubernik dream 
that goes back decades. He approached record executives in the 1980s with the 
idea of recording athletes but never got anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one said I was crazy but a lot of people in decision-making positions just 
felt that sports couldn't be explained in an audio form," he said. "They didn't 
think an audience existed." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Kubernik explained, basketball fans have been bombarded with 
spectacular highlight videos or tedious books. Placing the essence of the game 
into an audio form, he argued, makes basketball come alive. Kubernik, with help 
from friends and poets, posed questions to Walton and Wooden. The questions 
were edited from the recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Bill it was very important that the record not come out too tight, too 
edited," Kubernik said. "It has to sound like a real conversation." 
</P>
<P>
 Kubernik also thought it was important that the questions come from him, an 
outsider, as opposed to a basketball expert who wouldn't properly sympathize 
with the fan's perspective. "Because I never wore a jersey," he said, "it 
sounds different than some in-house production." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, both Walton and Wooden become repetitive, especially the coach who 
likes to cram in one of his favorite cliches -- "failing to prepare is 
preparing to fail." Kubernik admits this is no editing error. "Basketball is a 
game of repetition," he said. "By the second or third time you hear something, 
it does register. That's how you learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Walton calls it allowing the flow of the game to "enter your subconscious." 
</P>
<P>
 Music plays the same role in Walton's life, just as it did during his playing 
days. That's what made the record so right for him. As a player, he often 
persuaded the teams he played for to broadcast some of his favorite songs 
during warmups and timeouts to pump him up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music, like basketball, is a free-flowing expression of your mind," Walton 
said. "They both go so fast to the next movement, the next note." 
</P>
<P>
 Walton devotes some of his tape to explaining his love for music, especially 
the Grateful Dead. And even Wooden accepts the correlation. "The great teams 
and individuals execute with the rhythm we find in all musical forms," Wooden 
wrote as a tribute to Walton in the liner notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Bruin legends also appreciated the chance to lay out some X's and O's, 
examining everything from blocking out defenders to making the proper bounce 
pass. The game today, they acknowledge, is loaded with glitter and showmanship 
but largely devoid of fundamentals and teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tape, Wooden explains that most games he coached were often won during 
the practices, which were meticulously organized. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I miss about basketball, not the tournaments and championships," 
he said, "but the execution during practice." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the excessive celebrations that take place after spectacular 
plays diminish the dignity of the game. "I don't like all the high-fives," he 
said. "I expect them to feel good, but the individual is drawing too much 
attention to himself and away from the team." 
</P>
<P>
 His teams were known for holding rather subdued victory celebrations. "I 
didn't want them acting like fools," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is tough for Kubernik to act subdued these days. After landing Wooden and 
Walton in his first collaboration with sports figures, he's not sure what he 
can do to score again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do you go after you've won the NCAA title your first time out?" he 
said.

OXNARD'S RODRIGUEZ WILL ATTEND UCSB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gabriela Rodriguez of Oxnard High, the third-place finisher in the girls' 
3,200 meters in last year's state track and field championships, has made an 
oral commitment to UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez chose Santa Barbara over Big West Conference rival UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really close when it came down to making a decision," Rodriguez said. 
"I liked both schools, but I just got a feeling when I was at Santa Barbara 
that that was where I wanted to go. The fact the ocean is right there didn't 
hurt, either." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez has personal bests of 5 minutes 9.8 seconds in the 1,600 and 
10:52.34 in the 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
 She placed third in the 3,200 in last year's state finals. 
</P>
<P>
 In cross-country, Rodriguez finished ninth in the 1993 state Division II 
championships. JOHN ORTEGA

ALL IT TOOK WAS A LITTLE MAGIC FOR LAKERS TO BECOME A HOT TICKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lakers might not have hired Magic Johnson as coach with the intention of 
boosting ticket sales but, with his first practice still a day away, that has 
been the immediate impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Team officials said Thursday that about 2,800 tickets were sold in the last 
two days for Johnson's coaching debut Sunday against Milwaukee at the 
Forum.About 2,200 were sold Wednesday, the day the introductory news conference 
was televised live across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers are 24th in the league in average attendance -- ahead of only 
Dallas, Philadelphia and the Clippers -- at 12,815 a game. The nine Sunday home 
games so far have drawn an average of 12,705. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, only about 700 tickets remain for the Bucks, who would normally 
be a poor draw. Also, TNT has added the game to its national schedule. Within 
the last two days, the Lakers have also sold 1,800 seats for the eight home 
games after Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants to see Earvin in his first game, but what happens after that 
is predicated on how the team plays," said Bob Steiner, spokesman for owner 
Jerry Buss. "We like to see this kind of rush on tickets, but reiterate, that 
is not why we hired Earvin." 
</P>
<P>
 But. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "If it becomes a byproduct," Steiner said, "so much the better." SCOTT

FIGURE SKATING / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; ELVIS STOJKO GIVES CANADA ANOTHER MEN'S 
TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A motorcycle-riding martial arts expert who was named for Elvis Presley became 
the king of men's figure skating Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking over where compatriot Kurt Browning left off when he retired this 
winter, Elvis Stojko gave Canada its fifth men's title in the last six years at 
the World Championships at Chiba, Japan, with a technically superior freestyle 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 For technical merit in a program that included a quadruple toe jump done in 
combination with a triple toe, Stojko, 22, received one perfect score of 6.0 
and eight 5.9s from the nine judges. His artistic marks ranged from 5.7 to 5.9. 
</P>
<P>
 The only man who beat Stojko at the Winter Olympics, Russia's Alexei Urmanov, 
finished fourth after falling on a quadruple toe jump. France's Philippe 
Candeloro was second, and Ukraine's Viacheslav Zagorodniuk was third. 
</P>
<P>
 The best U.S. finish was national champion Scott Davis' seventh. Aren Nielsen, 
sixth after the technical program, landed only two triple jumps and dropped to 
13th. Because no U.S. man finished among the top three, the United States again 
will be represented by only two men in next year's World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's competition, which resumed late Thursday night (L.A. time) with 
the technical program, lost another medal contender when China's Chen Lu 
withdrew because of a stress fracture in her right foot.  
</P>
<P>
 The only U.S. competitor remaining is Michelle Kwan, 13, of Torrance, who 
finished fifth Monday in her qualifying group.

40-YEAR FACELIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Athletic administrators at Cal State Northridge considered remodeling portions 
of the school's football stadium for years, and the Jan. 17 earthquake has 
forced them to finally act on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The stadium, which is more than 40 years old, sustained major damage to the 
covered west bleacher section and press box above it during the 6.8 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The back four braces pulled out of the ground and the structure was bent and 
falling forward," Northridge Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said. "There was the 
possibility of fixing it if the steel and footage passed inspection, but the 
structural engineers were very concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 So this week that portion was dismantled and removed by cranes. 
</P>
<P>
 The east bleacher section has some cracks but no major damage, Hiegert said, 
so it will remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stadium was a concern of ours for years," Hiegert said. "It was a 
temporary facility when it was put in and it needed serious attention. Nobody 
really knows how old it is except that it's more than 40 years old, maybe even 
50." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's graduation ceremony will be held in the stadium in June, by which 
time the rubble will be gone, Hiegert added. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hoped that the press box and covered bleachers will be rebuilt before 
the start of the football season in September. 
</P>
<P>
 As yet there is no cost estimate, but most of the money will come from 
athletic department fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the stadium's best feature remains its adjacent parking lots, 
which used to be dirt. They were paved and used for student parking after the 
school's main parking structure collapsed in the quake.

SHE SAID, HE SAID / ANN CONWAY AND PATRICK MOTT: OSCAR ALWAYS LOOKS GOOD IN 
GOLD, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF US? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 S eductive but simple. Slinky yet sensible. Those are the catch phrases that 
came to mind on Monday night when we watched the fashion parade on the Oscar 
telecast. Come to think of it, the same words could be applied to the awards 
ceremony. The whole climate was meaningful and elegant . Did it hail a New Age 
of Innocence ? We know you're dying to hear our take on the glad rags ogled by 
1 billion people . . .  
</P>
<P>
 SHE: What would I wear to the Academy Awards, given the opportunity to wear 
any of the get-ups I saw on Monday night? Tough call. I loved Sharon Stone's 
less-is-more-look, a sleek black flared number with dramatic neckline. Very 
California. Goldie Hawn's scanty cream silhouette was also a knockout, but I'd 
need two years (10 years?) with a personal trainer to sport that one. Give me 
Emma Thompson's shimmering silver pantsuit. It was very Old Tinseltown. High 
glamour. Very Norma Desmond. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: What would I wear if I could have my pick of any of the outfits? Geez, I 
kind of liked that backless white Vera Wang gown that Marisa Tomei had on and . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Oh. Sorry. Lost my mind for a second. Heck, I'd settle for looking as good in 
a tuxedo as Tom Hanks does. I was glad to see that most of the guys at the 
ceremonies realized that there's really no improving on the basic tux design. 
Christian Slater, Pete Postlethwaite and Liam Neeson wore entirely black 
outfits (Slater and Neeson didn't even wear ties), but for the most part the 
gents recognized the appeal of blazing white underneath all that black. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides -- forgive me for repeating this truism -- at a formal affair, the 
guys aren't supposed to attract attention. They're supposed to provide a clean 
background to accentuate the women they're with. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Unless they sport exotic whiskers like Cruise, Pacino and Keneally. Then 
they stand out. Who's Keneally, you say? None other than Orange County's own 
Thomas Keneally, author of the book "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Academy Awards, the Irishman who hails from Down Under wore a new tux 
purchased at Fashion Island Newport Beach by his wife, Judy. Keneally 
accessorized it with gold-edged black studs and cuff links imprinted with the 
UC Irvine seal. (Keneally is a distinguished professor of English and 
comparative literature at UCI). 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Keneally searched high and low for her outfit, begrudging every minute. 
"I'm not much of a shopper," she confessed the day before the Academy Awards. 
She trucked to Fashion Island and came up with a zero. "Everything seemed too 
small," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a stop at the Escada boutique at South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, paid off. 
There, she found a glorious midnight-blue satin skirt with matching embroidered 
organza blouse. Accenting her outfit with sentimental pieces of jewelry -- 
including a gold bracelet engraved with "Love Conquers All" (a gift from Tom at 
the premiere of "Schindler's List") -- she looked like a million. 
</P>
<P>
 Their daughter, Jane, 26, wore a simple long brown dress that buttoned down 
the front and was slit up the side. Jane didn't get to go to the awards 
ceremony. She watched it at a party staged at Spielberg's Amblin Studios in 
Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: I wanted to kiss Winona Ryder (for a reason apart from the obvious one) 
because she had the guts to give the designers a miss and go with an old, but 
spectacular, vintage gown. She actually apologized for it to one interviewer, 
saying she knew it was a '40s-era dress and didn't know where it came from. Who 
cared? She made a lot of the more trendy women look thoroughly minor league. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad a few of the guys couldn't have followed that example. What is it with 
this banded-collar-and-no-tie stuff? Do Cruise, Antonio Banderas, Jeff Bridges, 
Johnny Depp and Gabriel Byrne think they're being dangerously rebellious or 
something? They looked like they rolled out of bed, threw on the tux and forgot 
to put on a shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: It eliminates the need for a tie. I think they're sensible, simple, and 
yes, seductive. Banded collars make a woman want to slip her fingers inside 
them, make sure her sweetie's neck isn't getting too warm. 
</P>
<P>
 I got a hoot out of Whoopi. Loved her quick-change act from chocolate velvet 
gown to licorice Armani tux. Next time I hit a gala, I think I'll tote an extra 
gown. I'll wear the first one -- a black number, natch -- through the dessert 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, just before they bring on the Peach Melba, I'll slip into a shocking 
red number just to see if anyone notices. My bet is my husband, Bob, will say, 
"What'd you do to your hair?" 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Even better: "Did you suddenly lose weight?" 
</P>
<P>
 Turnabout being fair play, how about this: Before they haul out the cognac, I 
duck into a convenient phone booth and remove my stylish, perfectly correct 
Perry Ellis tux and climb into an Armani and a shirt with a banded collar. Then 
someone will look at me and say, "Were you wearing long underwear when you 
first came in?"

RIPPLE EFFECT; DESIGNERS FIND INSPIRATION FOR THEIR SWIMWEAR IN THE NATURAL 
HUES OF FLORA AND FOAM, SAND AND SURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to swimwear, the tide has turned from neon and glitz to natural 
looks that blend in with the sand and sea. 
</P>
<P>
 For women, last year's glittering Vegas-style swimsuits with their metallic 
trims, rhinestones, faux pearls and other sparkles have taken a dive. The new 
suits are more simple, with rougher textures and little or no ornamentation. 
Some styles even look as if they had been hand-woven out of straw (they're 
actually made from high-performance fibers that only look primitive). 
</P>
<P>
 Men's swim trunks have lost their Day-Glo hues and shiny fabrics. Their suits 
are getting back to basics, with classic cuts and materials made from brushed 
nylons and nylon blends that look like soft cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 Swimwear for both sexes has followed fashion's obsession with natural hues. 
Burgundy, hunter green, beige and brown are colors not normally seen in 
swimwear, where brights tend to dominate, but this year suits are awash in 
earth tones. 
</P>
<P>
 To eyes accustomed to electric colors and glitter, the suits are plain but 
never dull. They get their interest from texture. Women can find everything 
from bikinis to maillots in materials that have been puckered, embroidered, 
woven and crocheted. 
</P>
<P>
 Natalie Walker, who designs swimsuits for Too Hot Brazil, Sessa, Citrus and 
Sassafras, was inspired by the new wave of woven swimsuit materials for several 
of her collections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Natural as a color and theme is everywhere," Walker says. "People like it 
because it's . . . very different from what's in their closet." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker's "Natural Fiber Suits" for Too Hot Brazil are primitive-looking, and 
the theme carries through to a coordinating grass skirt. The suits are made of 
a stretchy fabric that blends natural fibers (wool and caucio) with modern 
synthetics (spandex, nylon, polyester). 
</P>
<P>
 "The (suits) look like they could have been handwoven in Bali," Walker says. 
</P>
<P>
 The maillot, string bikini and two-piece with underwire top and a high-waist 
pant, come in dark and light tan mixed with white or black (about $90 at 
Everything but Water in Brea Mall and Crystal Court, South Coast Plaza in Costa 
Mesa). 
</P>
<P>
 Swimwear designers haven't shown this much crochet since the '70s, but these 
textured suits are different. The old suits were crocheted of cotton yarns; the 
'90s styles call for blends of nylon and Lycra that hold their shape and color. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the addition of Lycra, we can make things fit 300% better," Walker 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Popcorn weaves, Jacquard patterns, floral embroidery, mesh and crochet are all 
looks that have carried over from clothing to swimwear, according to Michelle 
Jaureguy, manager of Everything but Water in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crocheted suits are blowing out of here," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hot sellers: Sessa's brown mesh one-piece ($65), Take Cover's hunter 
green or burgundy one- or two-piece with puckered floral embroidery (about $70) 
and Tango Rose's beige crocheted two-piece ($74). 
</P>
<P>
 Flesh-colored lining keeps the suits from exposing too much, Jaureguy says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look see-through, but they're not," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suits look as if they're made of suede and leather. Tonga introduced two 
styles, a one-piece and bikini, made of cocoa-colored pseudo-suede and adorned 
with Indian-style embroidery (about $75 each at Everything but Water). 
</P>
<P>
 Like the women's crocheted styles, men's swimwear also recalls the '60s and 
'70s, according to Mario Pasillas, assistant manager of Newport Surf & Sport in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Trunks have a vintage look thanks to classic drawstring styling, earthy colors 
reminiscent of old Hang Ten shirts and '60s-style side stripes and pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Gotcha designed a '60s-inspired suit in red with a bone-colored stripe down 
the side ($35), and Billabong created a trunk in army green with blue side 
stripes made of a nylon blend that's brushed to look like cotton ($39), both at 
Newport Surf & Sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earth tones are smoking," Pasillas says. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's suits have seen the same change in hues. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '80s we were into neon and really bright florals. Everybody's toned 
down," says Julie Zozaya, buyer for Cinty's Swimwear in San Clemente and owner 
of Julie's Beachwear in Del Mar. "They're into the fall colors." 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 1 seller at Cinty's: a crocheted halter maillot by Sessa in natural, 
sand, black or red ($58). 
</P>
<P>
 "What's cool is the crocheted, puckered fabrics, the tiny florals and all the 
macrame stuff," Zozaya says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suits have taken the plunge all the way from glitz to grunge. Many 
swimsuit companies carry suits made of material that looks like plaid flannel 
but is made for withstanding water. One grunge bikini by De la Mer comes in a 
red or blue plaid ($50 at Barely There Swimwear in Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really soft," says Nancy Lee, owner of Barely There Swimwear. "They 
feel like PJs."

 More Than Beauty 
</P>
<P>
 While "ethnic" jewelry might simply be aesthetically pleasing for those of us 
living in the urban world, it serves a deeper purpose for the tribespeople who 
wear it. The metal cuts, the pendant shapes and the stone selection can 
symbolize pride or protect one from nature's hostile ways. For the Tuaregs of 
the Sahara, "carnelian is believed to aid in healing wounds and averting the 
evil eye," according to Patricia Korzec of the Bowers Museum Gallery Store. 
There the Tuaregs' silver work is on view and for sale, with pieces ranging 
from $35 to $600. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-Contained 
</P>
<P>
 Guys, it's all in the pockets. What's in them doesn't matter so much, as long 
as they're there. The cargo pant is the newest recycled idea, offering the 
functional style so in line with recent tastes. "This pant is of the grouping 
that's defined by a slimmer silhouette with fuller detailing," says designer 
Natalie Rigolet of 24-7. The Santa Ana label offered a shorter version of its 
long cargo pant for summer (about $45) in brushed canvas and fine wale 
corduroy. "It might have a military influence," she adds, "but please don't 
call it new punk." Check. 
</P>
<P>
 A Knockout 
</P>
<P>
 The sports-gear-into-street-chic trend of late is turning up some pretty 
serious contenders -- such as the satin boxing shorts and mini skirt from 
Playmate of New York (about $50). The line is the junior wear offshoot of 
Global Ghetto. "I always felt boxing shorts were a cool item," says designer 
Skat Smith. "Satin works really well for clubbing at night . . . and day, too." 
The two-tone bottoms come in hunter green, burgundy, purple and -- the hippest 
of shades now -- powder blue. Response has been so great that Smith is 
considering a pair in pink. 
</P>
<P>
 Tying Two On 
</P>
<P>
 With much of fashion assuming an innocence, or at least a youthful image 
reserved for schoolgirls, it's no surprise hairstyles should react likewise. 
Braids and pony tails offer the "freshest look" right now, says stylist Kenneth 
Michael. "Some young women haven't worn their hair this way since they were 
12!" He notes that many models are popularizing the 'do because they're in 
between last season's short cuts and growing it out. "It's just very 
whimsical." ROSA APODACA

SLEEPLESS IN LOS ANGELES AS QUAKE CONTINUES TO HAUNT US; HEALTH: IRRITABILITY, 
FLASHBACKS AND TROUBLED SLEEP ARE SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS OF POST-TRAUMATIC 
STRESS. BUT HAVING THE SYNDROME IS NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF OR TO KEEP SECRET, 
EXPERTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By BETTIJANE LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 4:31 a.m. Jan. 17, Rose Gillespie was flying out of her bed, suspended so 
high she couldn't grab onto anything -- not even her dog, Amber, who sleeps 
nearby but was levitating in another direction. 
</P>
<P>
 They survived, but more than 50 adored pet fish died in the Northridge quake, 
said Gillespie, a resident of Simi Valley and a crisis counselor at Van Nuys 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 She's still stressed out, and so are lots of other folks. "It's two months 
since the quake and our hospital hot line still rings off the hook with people 
in awful emotional distress," she said. "Some feel compelled to sleep fully 
clothed. Others sit up all night near the front door, flashlight in hand, until 
they fall asleep in that position. Even I'm still grieving; I go to my fish 
room every morning to spend time with my buddies . . . but nothing's there." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Sherman Oaks, psychotherapist Marian Garrett hasn't had time to 
grieve. 
</P>
<P>
 When she went to bed Jan. 16, she owned a canyon home, an investment condo and 
a practice she conducted from a nearby office. She lost it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Home, condo and office were red-tagged, unsafe to enter, most possessions 
inside bashed. 
</P>
<P>
 For Garrett -- imprisoned in her house until she was rescued through a window 
by neighbors who heard her screams -- the quake was no small event. But it 
turned out to be just the beginning of a larger ordeal involving endless 
investigators, insurance people, paperwork, claims, assessments of loss and 
attempts to reconstruct her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she rented an apartment and immediately began to see clients again, 
Garrett said she saw in herself "classic symptoms" of post-traumatic stress. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, she had trouble sleeping, concentrating, felt numb and couldn't 
enjoy the things she usually did. "A fine meal with friends suddenly meant 
nothing; I withdrew from people, I was irritable, my tolerance level was low 
and my resiliency seemed gone." Now she's coming out of it and realizes that 
many are suffering the same symptoms, but don't realize what's happening to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, mental health experts say, thousands of people across 
Southern California have struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder, a 
condition that can arise in anyone who survives a life-threatening event. 
Specialists who have studied the aftereffects of disasters stress that is 
nothing to be ashamed of. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 14th annual meeting of the Anxiety Disorders Assn. of America last 
weekend in Santa Monica, a panel of specialists was convened hastily to explain 
the nature of the disorder, which occurs as a result of suffering through a 
terrifying event that is outside the range of usual human experience. 
</P>
<P>
 It is caused by a feeling of genuine threat to one's life, to the lives of 
one's children; by sudden destruction of home or community; by seeing people 
hurt or killed without warning, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Post-traumatic stress disorder does not reflect on one's character or 
personality, they emphasized. Those who develop it simply experienced a greater 
threat to life, more fear, terror and helplessness than others who may have 
been nearby during the same event. 
</P>
<P>
 Symptoms include flashbacks, avoidance of anything that reminds the person of 
the disaster, numbness and unresponsiveness to the outside world, startled 
reactions, irritability and hypersensitivity, troubled sleep, inability to 
concentrate or finish tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some survivors enter a dreamlike state that can last for moments or days, 
during which the person behaves as though the event is happening all over 
again. Others experience aggressiveness that goes beyond irritability into 
explosive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The best way of dealing with the symptoms, the panelists said, is to accept 
them, understand them and talk about them soon after the disaster so that the 
stress can be alleviated. 
</P>
<P>
 (Experts say that for diagnostic purposes, during the first 30 days after any 
disaster, all the above symptoms are considered part of normal crisis reaction. 
If symptoms persist beyond 30 days, they can be diagnosed as post-traumatic 
stress disorder. After 90 days, the condition is considered chronic.) 
</P>
<P>
 Panel moderator Bonnie Green, professor of psychiatry at Georgetown 
University, explained that in addition to anxiety, depression and anger, people 
who have lived through disasters have also developed increased physical 
problems and have taken more sick leave than usual from their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 She said younger and middle-age people are more prone to the disorder than 
older people. Usually in control of things, younger people suddenly experience 
utter helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
 After a disaster, they bear the pressures of coping with work that must be 
done -- including caring for children and/or elderly parents, finding shelter 
or making the existing shelter safe, dealing with repair workers, insurance 
inspectors and contractors -- all while resuming the "normal" life of going to 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies of children in disaster areas show that youngsters often suffer the 
same symptoms as adults, Green said, but that parents generally underestimate 
the disaster's negative effects. "Children themselves report more symptoms than 
their parents report for them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Charles B. Marmar, psychiatry professor at the University of California, 
San Francisco, and director of the post-traumatic stress disorder program at 
the San Francisco VA Medical Center, said the onset of the disorder is related 
only to the specific trauma the person witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
 He offered these predictors for who might develop PTSD: The more horrendous 
the event, the more poorly people will hold up afterward. The more distress a 
person feels at the time of the event, the more difficulty he will have later 
in dealing with it. The more a person dissociates at the time of the event -- 
with feelings of being in a dream state, or floating, or watching themselves 
from outside their bodies, or losing a sense of time -- the worse they will do 
in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the above is anything to be ashamed of, nor is it anything you can 
help or change, the experts emphasized. It is simply what happens to people 
exposed to life-threatening events where the event itself -- and the 
aftereffects -- are extremely distressing. 
</P>
<P>
 That was part of the message given by David W. Foy, professor of psychology at 
Pepperdine University, who offered a personal account. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the quake hit, my wife's feet hit the floor, running for the children. 
I, on the other hand, lay completely still, making a structural assessment of 
the soundness of our roof." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither reaction was right nor wrong, he said. A "crisis reaction" is usually 
one of three things: You can do something actively to deal with the crisis, you 
can run in an attempt to escape it, or you can freeze in a kind of paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Such reactions are not decisions, he said, and cannot be planned. "Many combat 
veterans are alive today because they froze and were unable to move. Others are 
alive because they fled. Others are dead because they did either of these two 
things. None of the responses say anything about you as a person." 
</P>
<P>
 Foy, an expert on post-traumatic stress disorder in Vietnam War veterans, said 
he has debriefed 2,000 victims of the Northridge earthquake. Many had witnessed 
"large objects crashing all around them, many were literally thrown out of bed, 
some thought they were being assaulted. More than 75% perceived that their 
lives were seriously threatened," Foy said. In the Malibu fires, less than 15% 
of the people he debriefed felt a threat to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Foy said the characteristics of the event, not the population that endures it, 
are the best predictors of post-traumatic stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the Jan. 17 earthquake, neither age, personality type nor any other 
individual factor was a predictor of who would develop PTSD. The big factors 
were what kind of dwelling you were in and how close you were to the 
epicenter." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, two months after the quake, Foy said, "a lot of people are still 
immobilized. But a lot of others, less severely exposed, are saying, 'We're 
tired of hearing your stories; why aren't you up and running again?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Foy said that is not a fair question. "What's needed is an extended period of 
time for people to regain their strength, resources and to finish recovering 
from this event. They are fatigued, losing sleep, it's an effort for them to 
concentrate." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, they have not yet really begun to cope with the insurance 
problems, the paperwork, the Federal Emergency Management Agency people, the 
contractors, and the estimates and repairs that must be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones who were less exposed, who don't have as much work to do or as much 
recuperating -- they're the ones who are saying 'Let's get this all behind us.' 
" Survivors Need Sympathetic Listener, Vocal Support 
</P>
<P>
 Just as it takes months or years to rebuild damaged buildings, it takes time 
to grieve over losses and rebuild lives. Here are some suggestions from the 
L.A. County Department of Mental Health on how to cope with crisis and stress 
after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Respect a friend or family member's need for privacy and private grief. 
</P>
<P>
 * Listen and empathize. A sympathetic listener is important. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spend time with the traumatized person. There is no substitute for personal 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 * Offer assistance and sympathy. Voiced support is critical. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't tell traumatized people that they are lucky it wasn't worse. 
Traumatized people are not consoled by such statements. Tell them instead that 
you're sorry such an event occurred and that you want to understand and assist 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remember that you're experiencing normal reactions to a distressing 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Talk to people. Talk is healing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eat well-balanced meals and get lots of rest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use the free crisis counseling that is available by phone or in person at 
Disaster Assistance Centers and from many area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 For Help 
</P>
<P>
 If the quake is still causing you emotional distress, counseling may help you 
recuperate faster. Below are some disaster assistance centers where free 
counseling is available by telephone or on a walk-in basis, with no appointment 
needed.

IN THE SWIM; VELVET? RAFFIA? THESE AND OTHER UNCONVENTIONAL FABRICS ARE HITTING 
THE BEACH. AND IN HUES-PINE AND WINE ANYONE?-YOU NEVER IMAGINED.

 In a switch sure to spell relief for many women, swimwear designers this year 
seem more fascinated with fabric than body parts. Instead of cranking out 
amazing new ways to expose legs, waists, busts and bottoms, they have unleashed 
their creativity on textures, patterns and colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been talking big bust pads and push-up bras for a couple years," says 
Natalie Walker, designer of the Sassafras, Sessa, Citrus and Too Hot Brazil 
labels. "Now, the latest thing to talk about is fabric and how that's taking 
the big jump." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for new ways to draw consumers to the racks, designers have turned 
backward and forward for fabric inspirations -- from Woodstock to rain forests, 
from menswear to MTV, from wallpaper to seed packets, from Hollywood heydays to 
European runways. The result: sensual suits reflecting anything from the call 
of the wild to the call of the Gap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything has texture, either printed or real," says Anne Cole, designer of 
the collection bearing her name. "A swimsuit is a tiny third of a yard. It 
pushes the envelope daily to think what it is you want to do. When you think of 
Lycra or cotton-Lycra, that's not enough to inspire you, so lately there are a 
lot of twists and turns." 
</P>
<P>
 Cole takes the natural road with linen-Lycra whipped into a beige and navy 
color-blocked maillot. She also goes for bare-bones simplicity in a thermal 
underwear-inspired fabric, dyed tangy lemon or hot pink, used for a 
lingerie-style maillot decorated with one tiny bow. It is an update of the 
popular Cole of California suit introduced 10 years ago in slick nylon tricot. 
</P>
<P>
 Other labels take an even bigger leap back in time -- to free spirits swathed 
in velvet, velour, crochet, macrame, patchwork, tie-dye and daisies. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Piccone, designer of RX, Body Glove and aneponymous label, turns 
hand-crocheted white cotton into bikinis. There are also hand-crafted tie-dyed 
suits, each one a little different, she says. Some of her two-piece suits are 
strewn with daisy appliques; others come in pine green and aubergine panne 
velvet trimmed with antiqued gold brooches. 
</P>
<P>
 In defense of winter jewel tones on the beach, Piccone says: "They are unusual 
colors for swimwear. But I think they are very easy to wear. They look good on 
a lot of skin types." 
</P>
<P>
 Color is definitely an issue this year. Will women trot off to sea and sand in 
what some see as sportswear colors -- burgundy, brown, beige, hunter green -- 
or will they snub them for time-honored beach hues, such as turquoise, red and 
yellow? 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Nickerson, president of La Blanca swimwear, is betting on basic beach 
colors. "I am sure there are seven chic ladies in Southampton who want brown or 
olive," he says. "But in real life, I think people want the fun colors. They 
make a person feel young." 
</P>
<P>
 Among La Blanca's summer lineup is a bright coral two-piece in a 
diamond-shaped Jacquard accented with diamond-shaped silver snaps. The fabric 
has a lot going for it in addition to its color. The nylon-Lycra blend with the 
feel of cotton "gives women a sense of security," Nickerson says. "The 
thickness, the pattern and the texture tend to flatter." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of companies are flattering figures with earthy tones and textures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gottex lineup includes tribal and animal prints in cinnamon, cayenne, 
coffee and chocolate -- dusted with gold. A matching bikini and strapless beach 
dress are fashioned in one of the season's more exotic fabrics: a 
camel-colored, high-textured raffia, rubber and Lycra blend. 
</P>
<P>
 Bendigo International, with a trio of logos (Bendigo, Gold Coast and Cheekie), 
introduced a similar sexy fabric three years ago. It surfaces this summer in 
solid or checkerboard-patterned suits and a simulated grass skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Bendigo's summer lineup also includes plaids. The California beach girl 
variety is a brightly colored gingham textured with puffed flowers. The more 
sophisticated variety is a one-piece suit with sweetheart neckline in a bronze 
ribbed and Jacquard combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies borrow plaids and stripes from menswear departments or from 
"your boyfriend's closet," as Tony Johnson, vice president of Shok, calls it. 
Last year, the company introduced brushed plaid fabrics. This year, a Shok 
bikini is encircled in wine and cream menswear stripes and garnished with a 
"texture-driven" macrame flower. 
</P>
<P>
 As proof that you can have it all this summer, Mossimo takes plaid to the 
limit. For women who like their boyfriends' closets, bikinis come in a vintage 
Lycra-flannel. And for those who like their swimsuits strictly feminine, there 
is a trompe l'oeil plaid-velvet and mesh maillot.

INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT: DANGEROUS CURVES?

 Is Anna Nicole Smith the Edy Williams of the '90s? The statuesque -- and these 
days, Rubenesque -- former Guess? model was a fleshy vision, preening and 
posing before a gaggle of excited paparazzi at Movieline magazine's post-Oscar 
bash Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voluptuous is one thing," noted one guest, "but don't you think she's put on 
a few pounds?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, she did look a little overinflated compared to all the skinny young 
things in slinky black slip dresses. Better make that the Anita Ekberg of the 
'90s. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith can take solace in the fact that she's offered up as the epitome of 
curvy womanliness in Mirabella's April cover story, "The Return of the Real 
Woman." So there. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and pass the Lactose-Free Ultra Slim-Fast. Reality is so overrated, don't 
you think?

 Is Nothing Sacred?: After launching glow-in-the-dark boxers and a prepackaged 
week's worth of clean underwear, the Joe Boxer company is now taking its show 
on-line. We recently spotted the San Francisco-based label's name on the 
Internet computer service. Subscribers were asked to share their weirdest and 
wackiest torn-and-tattered undies tales with owner-designer Nicholas Graham. He 
needs the anecdotes for a book on -- what else? -- underwear, to be published 
by Chronicle Books in '95. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're inviting everyone to share their best stories in underwear cyberspace," 
marketing director Denise Slattery said.

<P>
 Uh, we think we'll just keep our fly zipped. But the rest of you blabbermouths

 Radical Chic: While former activist Angela Davis lives a quiet life as a 
university professor in Santa Cruz, a new generation is busy immortalizing her 
as a fashion icon. Davis said she was "astounded, shocked, surprised" by Vibe 
magazine's March fashion spread, "Free Angela," in which actress Cynda Williams 
plays the Afro-wearing '70s firebrand. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is concerned that photographer Albert Watson's mock documentary loses 
sight of the political statements the clothing and hairstyles of that era 
represented, she told the Washington Post. Still, she said, "I can't say that 
I'm totally critical." And with good reason. She never looked better.

 If Only the Clothes Were as Thought-Provoking: A German court Wednesday banned 
Benetton's ad showing buttocks and limbs tattooed with HIV Positive. We pass 
such a billboard, set atop a Mormon bookstore on Santa Monica Boulevard, 
several times a day and have yet to be offended, but the court said the Italian 
company's campaign breached German advertising laws and was in bad taste.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the battle is already brewing over Benetton's latest bit of 
agitprop -- an ad featuring a photo of the blood-stained clothes of a soldier 
killed in Bosnia. That one's been banned in Croatia. 
</P>

 Oh, a Model and a Rocket Scientist: The recent opening of fashion photographer 
Marco Glaviano's exhibit at Bowles Sorokko Gallery in Beverly Hills was 
sprinkled with models. Jennifer Flavin (sans Sly Stallone) came to see pals 
Tatiana and Analisa, whose lovely images are featured in several of Glaviano's 
photographs. Tatiana, wife of gallery owner Sere Sorokko, had just returned 
from the Paris and Milan shows, where she trotted the runways of Christian 
Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Balmain, Gianfranco Ferre and Giorgio Armani. 
</P>
<P>
 When her modeling career ends, she said, she might "work for NASA." Tatiana 
studied physics at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Engineering before 
signing with Elite modeling agency. Her husband seems to have other plans. "I 
think a family might be a better idea," he said.

 Terror Tactics: Need a little reminder to follow your skin-care regime? How 
about a 5-by-7 glossy that magnifies your enlarged pores, broken capillaries, 
sun blotches and crows feet to 15 times their natural size?  
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese company Shiseido's latest high-tech approach is designed to 
strike fear in hearts of lazy girls like us. The cosmetics company uses a 
fiber-optic lens to photograph different parts of the face, which are then 
transmitted to a TV monitor of sorts. Within 60 seconds, the machine prints out 
a color replica of dirt-clogged pores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It generates incredible retail," a Shiseido saleswoman said. No kidding. The 
Multi-Micro-Sensor is touring Shiseido counters around town through July. No 
purchase necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Location, Location, Location: Merchants and residents of Beverly Hills were 
invited to unload everything from suits to shoes Thursday at the Rodeo Drive 
Committee's second annual Clothing Drive. Proceeds go to Transition House, a 
project of Skid Row Development Corporation. The drop-off point? The vacated 
Chanel boutique at Dayton Way. Only the best for these castoffs.

 When Trends Collide: Sharon Stone may have been right on track with her '30s 
movie star look at the Academy Awards this week. That would certainly explain 
the paradoxical proliferation of unfettered breasts (Goldie Hawn, Madeleine 
Stowe, Ellen Barkin, Geena Davis, Marisa Tomei and Winona Ryder) and little 
white gloves (Winona Ryder, Kate Capshaw and Marisa Tomei). Claudia Schiffer, 
we noticed, left the gloves at home. Guess her new five-carat diamond 
engagement ring had to breathe. Inside Out is published Fridays.

BEHIND THE SCENES; FROM HER CLOSETS COME 200 YEARS OF VANITY AND EXPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People have been wearing clothes for more than 100,000 years, not just to 
cover themselves, but to improve their appearance, express how they feel and to 
react to their society. To show how clothing reflects the social and economic 
pressures of its time, the Multicultural Awareness Committee of Chapman 
University in Orange presented a fashion show depicting "200 Years of Women's 
Herstory" last week, in honor of Women's History Month.

BEHIND THE SCENES; FOR BEST SUPPORT OF CHARITIES, THE SPOTLIGHT IS ON WINNING 
COMBINATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Academy Awards fever heated up Orange County on Monday as supporters gathered 
to help their favorite charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 450 people who attended a party for the Assistance League of Newport-Mesa 
received the red carpet treatment at Atrium Court in Fashion Island Newport 
Beach, while 300 people glammed it up at Planet Hollywood in Santa Ana to 
benefit the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Imitating the glitterati of Hollywood, star-studded locals dressed to pop the 
klieg lights. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Assistance League's "Night of the Stars," women wore a range as wide as 
a 70-millimeter big screen: from two-piece silk pantsuits and short skirts to 
cocktail suits and formal gowns. Men added distinction to their traditional 
black tuxes with colorful cummerbunds and shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Cystic Fibrosis "Evening With Oscar," guests donned hip chic. Armani 
and Versace captured the award for tuxedos with a twist (tieless tuxes in 
green, fuchsia and purple caught the spotlight). Women spent the evening in 
sequins, look-at-me hats and flashy jewelry raided from their safe-deposit 
boxes.

INTO THE NIGHT / BILL HIGGINS: BLUES CHICKS AND SUEDE FRINGE DONE L.A. STYLE

 The Scene: Rhythm, Country & Blues, a benefit concert at the Universal 
Amphitheater with a tented party afterward. The show springs from a similarly 
named fusion album that joins country and R&B singers in duets. "To me, R&B and 
country are just different versions of American soul music," said MCA Music 
chairman Al Teller, who conceived the idea. "This is the wellspring of some of 
the great music of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Songwriter Bob Neuwirth described the audience as, "ropers, 
dopers and people who start work at 2 a.m." They didn't get invited to the 
party. From the show came Patti LaBelle, Ronnie Milsap, the Staple Singers, 
Vince Gill, Trisha Yearwood, the Pointer Sisters, Marty Stuart and Sam Moore. 
Among the 1,000 guests were Bonnie Raitt, Byron Allen, Alan and Marilyn 
Bergman, Charlie Sexton and MCA Music execs Richard Palmese, Bruce Hinton, 
Kathy Nelson and Tony Brown, who said the show made him realize, "R&B was built 
on rhythm and songs, while rap and hip-hop is built on attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Subject of Discussion: Bob Dylan's performance. Even by Dylan standards this 
was one weird outing. Paired with Trisha Yearwood, he sang in a key all his 
own. She pretty much just watched. "There was no rapport," said Sam Moore, of 
the legendary R&B duo Sam and Dave. "He didn't reach out to Trisha, and I don't 
think he reached out to the audience. What was he there for? That's what I'd 
like to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Mode: An awesome cultural gumbo that included serious cowboy hats, slick 
black suits, tight black dresses and suede fringe jackets. One woman described 
the mix as "major blues chick, country, Nashville finery and the L.A. version 
of all of the above." 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: A fear-no-cholesterol buffet from La Cuisine of fried chicken, chili, 
collard greens and ham hocks and macaroni and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: Concert tickets were sold to the public for $18 and $32. Those 
who bought benefit tickets paid $100, $250 and $500. Proceeds will be split 
between the Country Music Foundation, a cultural research organization, and the 
Rhythm and Blues Foundation, which is housed in the Smithsonian Institution, 
and preserves R&B music and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "The reason they work together, country and rhythm and blues, is 
they're both people music," said Ronnie Milsap. "They both tell simple stories 
of everyday folks."

CREATING DRAMA WITH HISTORY IN ONE EASY LESSON; BOOKS: AUTHOR DANIEL J. 
BOORSTIN DOESN'T THINK THE PAST NEEDS TO BE BORING. THAT'S WHY HE FOCUSES ON 
THE LIVES OF REMARKABLE INDIVIDUALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Historian and author Daniel J. Boorstin has studied the American heart and 
soul for more than half a century. As he surveys the terrain today, he sees a 
disturbing decline, both in public life and in the private sphere, of what he 
calls "the amateur spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Before amateur became virtually a synonym for unskillful , it carried a 
meaning closer to its Latin root: amator, or lover. It is to this definition 
that Boorstin remains passionately devoted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amateur spirit has been much maligned," Boorstin, 79, says in a telephone 
interview from his home in Washington, D.C. "I think the amateur is a lover, a 
person who does something for love. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democracy," he adds, "is government by amateurs." 
</P>
<P>
 If Boorstin is an amateur in spirit, he is not in deed. He was Librarian of 
Congress for 12 years, director of the National Museum of History and 
Technology, senior historian of the Smithsonian Institution and professor of 
history at the University of Chicago for 25 years.  
</P>
<P>
 With a body of work that includes his trilogy "The Americans" (the third 
volume, "The Democratic Experience," won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 
1973), plus "The Discoverers" and "The Creators," his most recent opus, 
Boorstin has written some of the most widely read histories of the past several 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow author Harrison E. Salisbury wrote in his review of "The Creators": 
"Not often in our contemporary world do we meet a man who evokes the expression 
'polymath.' Indeed, we shy away from this concept -- the man whose knowledge 
passes freely across eras, arts and disciplines. But it is clear that Boorstin 
is such a man." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fortunate in that I never had to make a living from writing," Boorstin 
says, a situation that has allowed him to pursue only those book projects that 
interest him and to write broad-ranging books for a general audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the first stage of his writing career, Boorstin distinguished himself 
as a prescient observer of the American scene, from Colonial times ("The Lost 
World of Thomas Jefferson," 1948) to the present. 
</P>
<P>
 Three decades ago, Boorstin wrote "The Image," a still-relevant chronicle of 
the rise in this century of the public-relations industry and the concomitant 
dominance of the news by "pseudo-events," calculated "for the immediate purpose 
of being reported or reproduced." 
</P>
<P>
 Most press conferences, highly publicized "anniversaries" of events or 
institutions -- even orchestrated press "leaks" from government sources -- 
qualify as "pseudo-events," under Boorstin's definition. 
</P>
<P>
 The processes Boorstin documented have accelerated in the decades since. He 
thought of updating "The Image," but decided that his examples and the 
conclusions he drew still hold true. 
</P>
<P>
 With "The Discoverers," published in 1983, Boorstin ventured into world 
history, outlining the search for knowledge over the centuries. "I thought 
perhaps it was time to grow up, and de-provincialize myself," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Discoverers" was the inspiration for a film of the same name now playing 
in IMAX theaters in Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 His venture into world history continued with "The Creators" (1992), which 
followed the development of the arts through the ages. As he approaches his 
80th birthday, Boorstin is at work on the third book of the series, which he 
calls "The Seekers." 
</P>
<P>
 The topic of the new work flows from the previous two. All the accumulated 
knowledge and the works of art, Boorstin says, beg a question: "So what? What 
does it all add up to?" The current work will be about "the search for 
meaning," and the ways in which Western peoples have sought self-knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Boorstin's most expansive works occupy him for long stretches. The three parts 
of "The Americans" took 25 years to research and write. "The Discoverers" and 
"The Creators" each took about nine years. He works closely with his wife of 
more than 50 years, Ruth, who is his primary editor. ("Without her, my books 
would be twice as long and half as readable.") 
</P>
<P>
 "Every book is a kind of experiment," Boorstin says. "There's a special 
satisfaction in writing a long book, in that you hope to grow. You must learn 
in the course of it. That's the challenge of the historian, to keep learning. 
If other people enjoy it, that's a dividend." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Boorstin's personal challenge to expand his own knowledge is balanced 
by his desire to make a book compelling to the average reader. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the case of nonfiction, people know how it turned out," Boorstin says. 
"You have to create suspense within the limits of the facts. That's what the 
good historian has to do, to create a drama." 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a common thread through Boorstin's writings on history, it's that 
he is less likely to focus on politics and war than on the telling details of 
individual lives, and the technological and social developments that shape 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Two examples from "The Americans: The Democratic Experience" are men whose 
impact was very different in effect yet similar in scope. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Christopher Columbus Langdell, who took over in 1870 as dean of Harvard 
Law School, who invented and introduced the concept of "case law." Langdell's 
approach replaced the application of grand legal principles. The new emphasis 
on the factual minutiae of law as it had been applied in previous cases 
produced a sea change in legal practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was naturalist Clarence Birdseye, who went fishing one day in 
sub-freezing temperatures, caught a fish and set it on the ice until he was 
done. When he got home and threw the frozen fish into a pail of water, he was 
startled to see it revive and start swimming again. The incident prompted 
Birdseye to develop the frozen-food company that bore his name. Decades later, 
as Boorstin wrote, nearly every home in America contained a 
refrigerator-freezer unit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boorstin has served books not only as an author, but also as Librarian of 
Congress, a post he held until his retirement in 1987. As librarian emeritus, 
he maintains an office in the library, although he continues to do his writing 
and research in his home. 
</P>
<P>
 As librarian, he has always been a keen observer of the advance of technology, 
and particularly its effects on the dispersal of images and information. Always 
quick to make the distinction between "information" and "knowledge," Boorstin 
remains skeptical about the much-heralded information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Information tends to drive knowledge out of existence," Boorstin says, and 
the coming rain of "pseudo-facts" only makes it more important "that we anchor 
ourselves in the printed word." 
</P>
<P>
 Boorstin is often asked if he fears for the future of books, but he jokes that 
as one who receives regular royalty checks in the mail, "I can bear witness to 
the fact that people are reading books." 
</P>
<P>
 The fear is predicated on the "displacive fallacy," he said: "They assume that 
the new technology is going to drive the old one out of existence." 
</P>
<P>
 Some predicted that "when movies came in, nobody would read a book anymore. 
That was not the case," Boorstin says. What happens, he continues, is that new 
technology "forces people to find niches for the old technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone once remarked to him that the Library of Congress is "the world's 
largest collection of bad books," Boorstin says, "and that is true, because 
we're a free society. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one definition for freedom, that images are allowed to compete. 
Libraries remain so important as reminders of how many efforts and reaches 
people have made."

AFTERMATH OF AN ASSASSINATION; COLOSIO SLAYING CASTS A SHADOW; LATIN AMERICA: 
MURDER OF LEADING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC 
FUTURE OF MEXICO. STILL, MANY U.S. EXECUTIVES REMAIN CONFIDENT IN NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By This story was reported by Times staff writers Nancy Rivera Brooks, James 
Flanigan, Michael A. Hiltzik, Chris Kraul and Patrick Lee. It was written by

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The assassination of leading Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo 
Colosio raises questions about the country's economic future and threatens to 
stem the flow of new investment needed to continue Mexico's economic reforms, 
at least in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
 But executives of U.S. businesses that have already invested heavily in Mexico 
-- as well as officials of the Clinton Administration, which has staked 
considerable prestige on the success of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
-- expressed confidence in the underlying strength of Mexico's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainty prevailed in the wake of the shooting, which came on the heels of 
a January uprising in the southern state of Chiapas and the kidnaping of a 
prominent Mexican banker. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio, the handpicked successor to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, was 
an important symbol of continuity for foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the main question is, who will replace Colosio: someone likely to 
continue the economic policies of Salinas, or a more populist candidate who 
would be less amenable to foreigners? 
</P>
<P>
 The other key question: Was the shooting the random act of a madman or the 
latest act in a systematic rebellion against Mexico's status quo? The latter 
raises the specter of political upheaval, which would tend to scare away 
foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Significant investments will probably be delayed until the answers are known, 
analysts said. And that could be critical to a nation that has staked its 
economic future on luring foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's assassination will "slow down economic growth and investments and 
cause people to stand back and take a deep breath before coming down," said 
Tony Ramirez, vice president of Made in Mexico, a Chula Vista-based consultant. 
"But it won't stop U.S. investment. There is too much to gain." 
</P>
<P>
 Several U.S. firms -- from car makers to banks to toy companies to tour 
operators -- said they would not be deterred from expanding their business in 
Mexico, which remains a promising market, particularly under NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Maizel, a fund manager and president of LM Capital Management in La 
Jolla, said he was besieged with phone calls Thursday from worried investors in 
Mexico -- as well as from pension fund managers wondering if this would be a 
good time to buy Mexican stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican government "will have to do a lot of bridge repairing to get this 
off the minds of investors," Maizel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, among institutional investors attending a Mexico City conference 
Thursday, "the feeling was clearly, (the shooting) was an aberration from 
Mexican history . . . and compared with other countries around the world, it is 
still a stable environment," said Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda, a UCLA urban planning 
professor who addressed the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the assassination sent shock waves through many of the 2,200 Mexican 
maquiladoras -- foreign-owned border factories, the vast majority of which are 
American -- as well as other American-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert S. Jezak, vice president and general manager of Mattel toy maker's 
giant Tijuana maquiladora, said the killing casts a pall over the future of his 
company's operations in Mexico as well as those of every other foreign company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel let down and ashamed because we saw a bright future with NAFTA, and 
now we see that the internal struggles are beginning to take precedence over 
the economic growth of the country," said Jezak, whose 2,000 employees make his 
factory one of the largest foreign-owned plants in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's the work of one assassin with a vengeance, then things will settle 
down. But if it's a greater story, then people will stay nervous and (the 
assassination) will begin to have an impact on their lives as well as 
livelihoods because as the political scene changes in Mexico, the economic 
scene has always changed with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the killing is not likely to cause any company to close up shop and 
head back across the border immediately, officials said. U.S. exports to Mexico 
were $41.6 billion in 1993, the Commerce Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad turn of events, but for us, at the moment we don't see any change 
in our business," said Donald O'Neal, spokesman for Hughes Space & 
Communications, a Hughes Aircraft subsidiary that has invested hundreds of 
millions of dollars in the Mexican communications satellite business in the 
last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Major American banks planning to open subsidiaries south of the border 
generally said the assassination would not affect their plans. "It's seen as a 
political event, not an economic one," said a spokesman for Chase Manhattan 
Corp. "I don't think our extending credit to Mexico will be affected by this." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's assassination throws into question the timing of an upgrade to 
Mexico's credit rating, crucial to wooing pension funds and other large foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the international credit rating agencies were inclined to take a long view 
of Mexico's potential. Moody's and Duff & Phelps were not disturbing their 
speculative credit ratings for Mexico's bonds; they were impressed by what they 
and international economists called Mexico's "institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Moody's rates Mexico's debt securities as Ba2 and Duff & Phelps gives Mexico a 
BBB rating. 
</P>
<P>
 "While Duff & Phelps will continue to monitor events closely, Mexico has 
sufficient international reserves and other tools to weather this shock and 
keep the long-term economic strategy in place," said David Roberts, head of 
international ratings for Duff & Phelps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin Lindow of Moody's said that Mexico's "weak economy and overvalued 
peso" would have to be changed in the aftermath of the latest violence. Like 
many others she saw the government taking action to boost economic activity, 
even if this were to cause the peso to decline in the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
 To help Mexico weather any immediate financial market jitters from the 
assassination, the United States on Thursday set up a $6-billion credit line, a 
so-called swap facility.

NORTHROP TO CUT 3,000 FROM WORK FORCE; AEROSPACE: MOST PINK SLIPS IN LATEST 
ROUND OF REDUCTIONS WILL BE HANDED OUT AT FACILITIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Northrop Corp. is eliminating another 3,000 jobs this year, principally in Los 
Angeles County, another grim reminder that the aerospace industry continues to 
face an unrelenting retrenchment certain to cause additional damage to the 
Southern California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop plants in Pico Rivera, Hawthorne, El Segundo and Palmdale will 
account for 2,500 of the job losses, while the company's facilities in 
Massachusetts, Georgia and Illinois will account for the rest, a Northrop 
spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The cutbacks will trim about 10% of the work force of 30,000 Northrop had at 
the start of the year. Northrop employment peaked at 48,200 at the end of 1987, 
before cutbacks in the B-2 bomber program started, and before the firm lost the 
competition to build the advanced technology fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop said the latest cutbacks were driven by the need to cut costs, 
streamline operations and reduce production in line with lower defense 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The Century City-based firm said 700 of the 3,000 workers have already left 
their jobs. Northrop is cutting 1,000 jobs in Pico Rivera, 1,000 in Hawthorne, 
300 El Segundo and 200 in Palmdale and at Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County, the nation's defense capital, is not likely to crawl out 
of its economic trough until early next year, although California at large 
could emerge from its lengthy recession by the second quarter of this year, 
said UCLA economist Larry Kimbell. 
</P>
<P>
 California will lose another 80,300 aerospace jobs over the next six years, 
coming on top of 155,500 losses since 1985, Kimbell predicted. By the end of 
the rout, the state would be left with 147,100 aerospace jobs, he said, adding, 
"The outlook remains very negative." 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop disclosed the job cutbacks in Chairman Kent Kresa's letter to 
shareholders in its annual report, in which he recalled that several years ago 
the firm began efforts to consolidate divisions, vacate facilities and cut 
operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sadly, we also have had no choice but to reduce our valued work force," Kresa 
wrote. "However wrenching these decisions have been for everyone affected, we 
simply must reduce our costs ahead of projected declines in revenues." 
</P>
<P>
 Since defense spending peaked in 1985, the Pentagon's annual budget for 
procurement has plummeted from $118 billion to just $44.5 billion this fiscal 
year, adjusted for inflation. And the annual budget for research and 
development has dropped from $40.5 billion to $34.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The job losses Northrop disclosed Thursday reflect the budget cutbacks enacted 
two years ago, because it takes about that long for federal funding to wind 
through the long pipeline to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Flaming, president of the Economic Roundtable, a privately funded economic 
research group, said the aerospace bust has been accompanied by a period in 
which Los Angeles County has lost other high paying industrial jobs as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see much happening that will replace these aerospace jobs with jobs 
of equivalent quality or put these people back to work," Flaming said. "These 
aerospace jobs have buying power in the local economy and tax paying power that 
supports local government services." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the aerospace industry will continue to drag down the economy, there 
are wild cards that could substantially improve the outlook in Southern 
California, experts say. Earthquake reconstruction efforts fueled by federal 
assistance are providing a short-term burst of spending. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, it is impossible to measure the impact of new small 
high-technology firms that are likely to be founded by former aerospace 
scientists and engineers. There is anecdotal evidence that such growth has 
begun, but measuring its potential remains difficult, according to Flaming. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, it appears that high-paying aerospace industry jobs are being replaced 
mostly with jobs in the service sector or non-durable manufacturing companies, 
such as apparel firms, Flaming said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimbell also said that many of the $15-an-hour manufacturing jobs being lost 
in aerospace are being replaced with temporary or part-time jobs that make the 
employment picture look better than it really is. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimbell said the glut of unemployed workers will be cleared by individuals 
leaving California, dropping out of the work force or taking lower paying jobs. 
The other possibility -- the creation of new high-paying jobs -- is not likely 
to offer real hope to the jobless for several years, he said.

SMALL WINS BIG AT AWARDS FOR AD AGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Small is getting very big in the ad business. So big, in fact, that a string 
of recent successes by smaller ad agencies could nudge the rest of the industry 
to return to its roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night, one small agency proved -- for the second consecutive year -- 
that it ranks among the giants in Southern California. Stein Robaire Helm, a 
7-year-old agency, walked off with the West Coast's premiere ad prize at the 
28th annual Belding Awards. It won nine "Belding Bowls" -- more than twice as 
many as any other firm. Last year the firm also won the most awards at the 
event, sponsored by the Advertising Club of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the evening's biggest winners were all small firms. Another tiny 
Venice agency, Livingston & Co., won five Belding Bowls -- mostly for its 
anti-smoking ads. The next biggest winner -- with four prizes for its offbeat 
print ads -- was a Santa Ana-based agency, M Group/Acme Advertising, whose 
27-year-old founder was working out of his parent's living room a few years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 These results not only show that some of the best advertising is being created 
at small agencies but that these tiny agencies pose genuine threats to their 
larger rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, too, there has been a whirlwind of activity in recent months of 
big advertisers hiring smaller, creative ad shops. Earlier this week, Burger 
King dumped its giant agency and hired a much smaller firm. Coke was also so 
unhappy with its giant agency, McCann-Erickson, that it turned to the Beverly 
Hills talent firm, Creative Artists, for its ads -- many of which are created 
by free-lancers. And several car makers -- including the Saturn division of 
General Motors -- have recently turned to smaller agencies for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larger clients are now going with the best agencies -- no matter how small 
the shop," said Steve Hayden, co-chairman of the Belding Awards and chairman of 
the Los Angeles office of BBDO Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Although generally short on experience, small agencies are often deep on 
desire. And unlike giant ad firms, most small agencies guarantee that their top 
creative executives will review almost all work bearing their name. "Nothing 
goes out the door here that one of us (partners) doesn't put our stamp of 
approval on," said Jean Robaire, executive creative director of Stein Robaire. 
</P>
<P>
 All three of the agency's partners were formerly with Chiat/Day, the huge 
Venice ad firm that used to sweep the Belding competition each year. Chiat/Day, 
which won two Belding Bowls on Thursday, has grown in 26 years from a tiny 
boutique into a $1-billion international agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many small ad shops, Stein Robaire is regarded as an agency on the edge. 
The big prize at Thursday night's ceremony -- the "Sweepstakes" bowl -- was 
awarded to the firm for an offbeat magazine ad it created for a former client, 
the maker of Teva sandals. The ad, which shows a young man sail boarding, 
features only the lower half of his body -- and focuses on his sandals. A small 
headline next to the flashy photo says: "When you die, they'll put you in a 
nice suit and shiny shoes. As if death doesn't suck enough already." 
</P>
<P>
 While the ad campaign ran last year, sales increased 63%, said Jean McPherson, 
marketing manager for Deckers Outdoor Corp., which is the licensee for Teva. 
</P>
<P>
 But ads by small agencies can sometimes be too edgy for clients. For example, 
one of Stein Robaire's newest clients, Wienerschnitzel, recently rejected this 
self-mocking ad slogan that the agency suggested: "The only restaurant where 
you have reservations after you eat." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps no small agency turned more heads Thursday night than M Group/Acme 
Advertising, a one-man shop from Santa Ana that won four Belding Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 "At large agencies, good ideas often get diluted down before the client even 
sees them," said Sakol Mongkolkasetarin, who was laid off from two shuttered 
Orange County agencies before setting up his own ad shop two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Mongkolkasetarin won awards for print ads he created for Pacific Snax Corp., 
which makes rice cake snacks shaped like popcorn. The headline to the ad reads: 
"Imagine if Uncle Ben married Orville Redenbacher."

FHA ANNOUNCES A REDUCTION IN RATE FOR MORTGAGE INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving toward a more aggressive housing policy, the Clinton Administration on 
Thursday announced a reduction in FHA mortgage-insurance premiums that should 
enable hundreds of thousands of additional families to become first-time home 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The mortgage insurance premium, now 3% of the loan amount, will be cut to 
2.25%, providing savings of $750 on a $100,000 mortgage over the life of the 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Housing Administration loans are typically purchased by lower-income 
home buyers who have trouble qualifying for regular financing. Typically, they 
put down 3% to 5% of the price of the home, compared to as much as a 20% down 
payment under regular financing. The FHA insures the loan, so the mortgage is 
paid if the owner goes into default. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are to rekindle the dream of homeownership, we can no longer be 
spectators," Assistant Secretary for Housing Nicolas P. Retsinas told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 On a nationwide basis, as many as 270,000 more families, including 63,000 from 
the West Coast, would qualify to get home mortgages, according to an estimate 
by John Tuccillo, chief economist at the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Community groups welcomed the FHA announcement, but said it was more 
significant as a symbol of the new policy direction by the Administration than 
in its direct effect.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's refreshing that there is recognition that the FHA has been lagging the 
conventional market, and these are steps on the road to improvement," said 
Deepak Bhargava, legislative director for ACORN, an organization of community 
activist groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, he said, regular lenders had become more flexible than 
the FHA in providing insured mortgage loans to low-income people and minority 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the FHA is trying to take a leadership role again, he said, noting: "This 
is not a revolution, but it will help." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of mortgage insurance "has been as a serious impediment to low income 
families trying to get a first home, and lowering the rate is a positive step," 
said Alan Fisher, executive director of the California Reinvestment Committee, 
which includes 120 organizations active in issues involving affordable housing 
and fair lending. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our point of view, this should be helpful in rural California," Fisher 
said from his headquarters in San Francisco. "But in metropolitan California, 
however, much as the dream may exist, people can't afford homes, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Special attention is needed to encourage apartment construction to provide 
affordable housing in metropolitan areas, Fisher said.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: AFTERMATH OF AN ASSASSINATION; A CRISIS CAN LEAD IN 
THE BULLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tragic death of Luis Donaldo Colosio cast new gloom over Wall Street and 
other world markets on Thursday, pushing the Dow industrials down 47.88 points 
to 3,821.58 and virtually guaranteeing that prices on the Mexico City exchange 
will plunge 4% or more when trading reopens today. 
</P>
<P>
 But many big American and European investors, searching for perspective in the 
wake of Colosio's assassination in Tijuana, were reminded Thursday of other 
recent political and social crises that have since become historical footnotes 
to bull markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Tian An Men Square? When the Chinese ruthlessly quelled student 
unrest in the summer of 1989, Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock index quickly plunged 
from 3,000 to 1,800. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, five years later, the Hang Seng is at 9,320 -- three times its level 
before the Tien An Men massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 By recalling the usually transitory effects of national tragedies on financial 
markets, Wall Street veterans admit that they risk appearing callous -- 
minimizing the widespread human suffering such events can cause. 
</P>
<P>
 But the simple truth is that the successful investor generally is the one who 
keeps his or her wits when most others are losing theirs. "Your job as a money 
manager," says Mark Howlowesko, research director for the Templeton mutual 
funds, "is to take advantage of fear." 
</P>
<P>
 For current and would-be investors in Mexican stocks, the issue today will be 
whether share prices reflect too much -- or too little -- fear of a future 
without the 44-year-old Colosio, who most likely would have won the Mexican 
presidency in the August election. 
</P>
<P>
 The government said Thursday that the Mexican Stock Exchange would definitely 
open today, after Thursday's closure in mourning of Colosio. The Bolsa stock 
index, which closed at 2,543.57 on Wednesday before Colosio was murdered, is 
expected to drop at least 4% at the opening because many Mexican stocks traded 
on the New York Stock Exchange dropped by that amount or more on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 While Colosio's murder was a tremendous shock, however, analysts say the 
Mexican market may not be as vulnerable to a huge decline from its current 
level, if only because the Bolsa has already plummeted sharply from its 
all-time high of 2,881.17 on Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors in Mexico have already been jolted this year by a still-unresolved 
Indian uprising in the country's southern Chiapas state, by the threat of a 
surprise presidential run by a rival to current President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari, and by the kidnaping of one of the country's leading bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the growth of the Mexican economy in 1993 was the slowest in seven 
years, raising concerns that the economy could easily be tipped into 
full-fledged recession. Corporate profits have fallen, and no recovery is 
expected before the second half of this year, assuming the economy picks up 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this has weighed on stock prices. By late last week, with the Bolsa at 
2,363.01, many U.S. money managers were arguing that the Mexican market could 
lose another 10% or so before stabilizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there were signs on Thursday that foreign investors, at least, aren't 
willing to let Mexican stocks go into a free fall from here, despite the 
political and social upheaval that may follow Colosio's death. 
</P>
<P>
 In London early today, traders were talking about Mexican phone giant Telmex 
dropping as low as $53, from Wednesday's close of $63.75 on the NYSE. But the 
stock's low Thursday was only $58.25, and it rallied from there to close at 
$60.125, off $3.625 for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, an analyst at the U.S. branch of a major Mexican brokerage said 
most of his American institutional clients weren't panicked about the Mexican 
market's next possible move. "Most of them were just asking, 'How are people in 
Mexico viewing this,' " the analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, he said, the brokerage's Mexican clients were asking the reverse 
question -- "How are foreigners viewing this?" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the foreign investors' view may be much more important now than that 
of the Mexicans themselves. Much of the selling at the Bolsa so far this year 
has been by domestic investors, who have been far more worried about the 
Chiapas uprising, in particular, than their foreign counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Many foreign institutional investors, by contrast, have tried to retain their 
long-term view of Mexico's promise, which has led them to push billions of 
dollars of direct investment into Mexico. It's crucial that that money flow 
continue, because Mexico cannot grow without it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Bratt, director of global equities for the Scudder Funds investment 
giant, notes that "it's very important to stress that Mexico has made fantastic 
progress over the last five years" in opening its economy and building an 
industrial base for future growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's death, while painful for the nation, doesn't undo the past five 
years, Bratt says -- any more than Tian An Men Square undid China's economic 
progress up to that point. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, an analyst representing a major European brokerage said 
Thursday afternoon that a conference call with 90 major foreign institutional 
clients earlier in the day revealed little panic, and much understanding of the 
risk-to-reward ratio in Mexico now. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we found was that foreign investors were prepared to hold on to their 
positions in Mexico," said the analyst, requesting anonymity. Many of them, he 
said, have a difficult time believing they should run away from a market that 
now sells for about 13 times estimated 1994 earnings, making it the cheapest of 
any Latin American market. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, some analysts believe Colosio's death could ultimately help 
Mexico by unifying his ruling PRI political party behind a successor 
presidential candidate, and by bringing more voters over to the PRI in 
sympathy. Fear of violence also could lead rival parties to tone down their 
rhetoric, allowing the public mood to calm. Government spending aimed at 
jump-starting the economy will probably be accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Templeton's Howlowesko, who admits feeling queasy about the still-high levels 
of many global emerging stock markets today after their surge in 1993, said he 
was fishing for opportunities among U.S.-traded Mexican stocks on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 When the market was depressed last year on worries that the NAFTA treaty 
wouldn't pass Congress, Howlowesko says he used those fears to his advantage, 
and bought Mexican stocks. "I'd use this as an opportunity as well," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's important to add that Howlowesko isn't a raging bull on the Mexican 
market overall. It's more a stock-by-stock situation, he says, the way 
investing is supposed to work. 
</P>
<P>
 In their frenzy to own stocks in emerging markets in 1993, many investors 
forgot the inevitably high risk and thought only of the opportunities, 
Howlowesko says. If your outlook truly is long-term, that one-eyed view may 
work. The problem is that when trouble hits, and these markets plunge, many 
long-term investors turn out to be so in name only. Mexico's Market Turmoil The 
Mexican stock market, closed on Thursday in mourning for assassinated 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, is likely to plunge when it 
reopens today, traders say. Yet many American and European investors don't 
believe that this year's political crises have damaged the country's long-term 
economic promise. Foreign belief in Mexico is crucial, because the heavy flow 
of money into the country since the mid-1980s has helped rebuild the economy 
and fuel the stock market's boom. Foreign Capital Has Piled In Foreign direct 
investment in Mexico annually since 1983: in billions of dollars: 1992: $37.47

</P>
<P>
 Assassinations and other political and social crises can wreak havoc with 
financial markets in the short run, but their effects can blow over with 
surprising speed. 
</P>
<P>
 When word of the attack on President John F. Kennedy reached Wall Street on 
Friday, Nov. 22, 1963, the stock market began a free fall. The New York Stock 
Exchange closed early, but not before the Dow Jones industrial average had 
plunged 21.16 points, or 2.9%, to 711.49. 
</P>
<P>
 The market was closed on the following Monday for Kennedy's funeral. When it 
reopened Tuesday, Nov. 26, fears of panic selling quickly dissipated. Instead, 
buyers swarmed, convinced that the policies of new President Lyndon B. Johnson 
could keep the economy moving ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow surged 32.03 points or 4.5%, to 743.52 on that Tuesday. The market 
continued to rally briskly in 1964, with the Dow reaching 874.13 by Dec. 31.

 Former Keating Associate Settles SEC Charges: Robert J. Kielty, a former 
associate to Charles H. Keating Jr. settled charges with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission alleging fraud connected to the failed Lincoln Savings & 
Loan Assn.In an administrative proceeding, the SEC said Kielty, former general 
counsel and senior vice president at American Continental, Lincoln's parent 
company, agreed to a cease and desist order barring further violations. Kielty 
neither admitted nor denied the charges. The SEC said the proceeding stems from 
Kielty's alleged involvement with American Continental's failure to disclose 
material information and thus cause false and inadequate disclosures on the 
company.

 Unocal Expects to Settle Lawsuit: The suit, filed by the California attorney 
general, involves petroleum leaks at the company's Guadalupe oil field near San 
Luis Obispo.The Los Angeles-based oil and gas producer said it expects to pay 
an unspecified amount in civil penalties. The penalties are expected to have no 
material effect on its financial condition, the company said. The company said 
it expects to take a $25-million charge in the first quarter for the write down 
of facilities, estimated abandonment costs and remediation expense at the oil 
field.

 Virgin Interactive's IPO Postponed: Virgin Interactive Entertainment PLC's 
initial public offering of 16% of its shares has been "indefinitely postponed," 
according to CS First Boston, the underwriting syndicate that was to have 
managed the offer.Virgin officials said that over the last few days the firm 
was approached by two major companies with separate proposals to take 
substantial strategic stakes in its fast-growing business. They said the IPO 
was postponed in order to evaluate the proposals. Virgin's Irvine-based 
American arm is considered one of the best-positioned game publishers.

IBM CHAIRMAN TELLS STRATEGY FOR NEW MARKETS; UPDATE: HE SAYS PRODUCTS WILL FIT 
THE CLIENT-SERVER TREND. ANALYSTS HEAR LITTLE NEWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 IBM Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr. on Thursday delivered a broad outline of 
the company's strategy, saying its products are changing in ways unseen since 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerstner said IBM has found further areas where it could save money, but does 
not anticipate cutting more jobs than previously announced. 
</P>
<P>
 He said International Business Machines probably will never again see the 
level of profitability that mainframe computers once brought. He said the 
decline of IBM's gross margin, to 38% from 55% in less than three years, was an 
"economic shock the equivalent of the Los Angeles earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerstner's hour-long speech to Wall Street analysts contained little that was 
new to those who follow the company closely. IBM's product announcements and 
annual report, sent to shareholders last week, had presented most of what he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerstner promised last summer to bring the company's strategies together in a 
simple outline. In doing so Thursday, he answered criticism of a remark he made 
last year, that "The last thing IBM needs right now is a vision." 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Bob Djurdjevic of Annex Research called Thursday's speech "much ado 
about nothing, from the sense of change." 
</P>
<P>
 It reflected the growing complexity of the computer industry as much as the 
problems and opportunities IBM now faces. Gerstner noted, for instance, that 
some customers are saying they want the pace of technological change to slow 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not betting the company on any one technology or gizmo," Gerstner said. 
"That's not to say we don't have a secret weapon or two under wraps. . . . We 
cannot reduce what IBM must do and is doing to a sound bite or slogan." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he tried. "IBM's mission is to be the most successful and 
important information technology company," Gerstner said. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM will aim to bring its innovations to market more efficiently and play a 
leading role in the mutual advances of computers and telecommunications, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he detailed how IBM is changing the way it interacts with 
customers. He said the company is increasing its business in developing markets 
such as China's and using its large size to save money for itself and 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most significantly, Gerstner announced that IBM will change all of its 
products to be used in so-called client-server networks. In that environment, 
computer brainpower and data is spread through many machines, not concentrated 
in one, as in a mainframe system. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses have been shifting their computers to client-server systems for 
several years. The failure to capitalize on that trend was "the single most 
important mistake IBM has made in the last decade," Gerstner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerstner addressed the analysts after the stock market closed Thursday. IBM 
stock finished the day at $56.375 a share, down 87.5 cents, on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

GTE CHOOSES OXNARD FOR NEW OFFICE SITE; WILL ADD 650 JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 GTE California announced Thursday that it will establish a customer service 
center in Oxnard, a move that will bring 650 jobs to a city reeling from a 
spate of plant closures and job losses in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of the Thousand Oaks-based telephone company said they chose Oxnard 
because it is close to the company's Thousand Oaks headquarters and because 
local officials aggressively recruited the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE will transfer 250 of its employees to the new center and hire 400 new 
workers to staff the facility, which will consolidate work done at a number of 
GTE offices throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees will schedule service calls and handle customer inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there will be no layoffs as a result of the consolidation, GTE will 
close nine service centers in Southern California, including facilities in 
Huntington Beach, Cerritos and Pomona. Employees at those centers will be given 
the option of relocating. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials see GTE's decision as the result of the city's longstanding 
efforts to lure new businesses. Oxnard has lost an estimated 2,000 jobs in the 
past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major conquest, and I think GTE now will become the nucleus for a 
lot of other activity in the area," Oxnard City Councilman Mike Pliksy said 
Thursday.

 Amgen Suit Dismissed: The Thousand Oaks-based biotechnology firm said a 
federal judge in Los Angeles has dismissed a class-action shareholder lawsuit 
that charged Amgen and two senior executives -- Chairman Gordon Binder and 
Senior Vice President Lowell Sears -- with securities laws violations. 
Plaintiffs' lawyers and Amgen requested the dismissal after reviewing the 
records of Amgen and various securities analysts and concluding that it was 
inappropriate to pursue the case, Amgen said. No payment or settlement was made 
by Amgen, the company said.

DOW OFF 48.37; BOND YIELD AND GOLD PRICE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surging long-term interest rates, combined Thursday with reaction to the 
assassination of Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, fueled a 
selloff on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.37 points. It ended at 3,821.09, 
after recovering somewhat from a 65-point loss earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's key 30-year bond yield shot up to 6.95% from 6.89%, pushing 
down prices, which move in the opposite direction, 11/16 point, or $6.88 per 
$1,000 in face amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Losses cut a wide swath through the stock market, and broader market indexes 
were lower as well. The New York Stock Exchange's composite index fell 2.32 to 
257.96. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks lost 10.83 to 
786.78. The Standard and Poors 500 fell 4.19 to 464.35. On the American Stock 
Exchange, the market value index slipped 3.72 to 469.66. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume was heavy at 303.8 million shares, up from 281.6 million 
shares traded Wednesday. In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered 
advancing ones about 10 to 3 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 The rout in the stock market began with the opening bell, as bonds extended 
losses that began late Wednesday after several banks raised their prime lending 
rate. Soaring commodity prices, Mexico's political turmoil and other bearish 
news unnerved the already jittery credit market. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by the rise in gold prices, the Commodity Research Bureau index -- used as 
a barometer of inflation trends -- soared 0.74 to a nearly four-year high of 
230.84. 
</P>
<P>
 Precious metals accelerated their rally. Gold and silver futures vaulted 
higher on buying linked to the assassination news in Mexico, fresh overseas 
demand and nagging inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold jumped $4.60 on the New York Comex to $391.60, the highest price for a 
near-term contract since late November, 1989. Silver gained 9.4 cents to finish 
at $5.725 an ounce. Since March 8, silver has gained 56.5 cents an ounce, or 
11%. Gold has risen just 4% since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising commodity prices routinely upset the bond market because inflation eats 
away the value of fixed interest-bearing investments. Moreover, the bond 
market's worries have grown since the Federal Reserve began tightening credit 
conditions this year, with the stated purpose of keeping a lid on inflation 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got these forces that on their own would not take down the market, but 
pushing them all together . . . creates a very nervous environment," said Peter 
McTeague, market strategist at MCM MoneyWatch in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed announced its latest interest-rate increase Tuesday, nudging up its 
target for the federal funds rate 1/4 point to 3.5%. The funds rate, the 
interest on overnight loans between banks, remained at 3.5% Thursday, unchanged 
from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Major banks have followed the Fed's rate increase by pushing up their prime 
lending rates 1/4 point, to 6.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The inflation and interest-rate concerns came against a backdrop of 
uncertainty over the implications of the Colosio assassination. Colosio, the 
leading Mexican presidential candidate, was expected to win Mexico's Presidency 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the stock market's performance in the next few sessions may 
determine if there has been a significant change in investor psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far on these downdrafts we have not had a follow-through," said Jonathan 
Dodd, market analyst at Dean Witter. "As long as that continues, the market can 
stay intact." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican financial markets were closed on Thursday. In New York, Telefonos 
de Mexico's benchmark American depository receipts fell 3 5/8 to 60 1/8 and was 
the volume leader on the New York Stock Exchange, following a delayed opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Mexican stocks fell in heavy U.S. trading as investors reacted to 
Colosio's killing, included glassmaker Vitro, which dropped 1 to 20 1/2, and 
construction company Empresas ICA which ended off 2 1/4 at 25 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks were big losers after a report that Sanford Bernstein & Co. 
downgraded the group's rating. General Motors fell 2 1/8 to 58 3/8; Chrysler 
fell 2 to 56 1/8; Ford slid 2 to 61 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold shares gained, with Newmont Mining up 1 1/4 to 58 1/2, Homestake Mining 
up 7/8 to 22 5/8, Battle Mountain Gold up 1/4 to 12, Sunshine Mining up 1/8 to 
2 3/8, American Barrick up 1/2 to 25 3/4 and Placer Dome up 1/4 at 25 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Capital Cities/ABC fell 16 to 702 3/4. Philip Morris announced a $10-billion 
libel lawsuit against ABC, alleging that false and defamatory statements were 
made on television about cigarettes being "artificially spiked" with nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
 * The stocks of economically sensitive companies were sharply lower. 
Caterpillar was off 3 7/8 at 116 7/8; International Paper fell 7/8 to 69 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Media Vision shrank 10 1/2 to 11 after announcing price cuts and saying it 
was delaying delivery of one of its multimedia products until the second 
quarter, and said the delay would "significantly impact" its first-quarter 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mobile Telecommunications Technologies surged 4 5/8 to 20 1/2 on news of a 
joint venture with Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 * Loral gained 3/8 to 41 3/8 after it announced it is forming a limited 
partnership with Qualcomm to own and operate a satellite wireless communication 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were mixed in overseas trading. Shares fell sharply in London, with the 
Financial Times 100-share average dropping 33.6 points to close at 3,121.7. 
Tokyo's Nikkei average ended 75.8 points higher at 20,037.90. In Frankfurt, the 
DAX-30 average edged up 0.55 point to finish at 2,161.68. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks fell sharply in Hong Kong on profit-taking. The Hang Seng index ended 
down 144.78 points at 9,320.75. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell sharply against most currencies on continuing worries over the 
Clinton Administration's Whitewater affair and the heavy stock and bond market 
losses. In addition, dealers said Mexico's political turmoil contributed to the 
nervous climate. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar dropped to new 1994 lows against the mark, closing at 1.6655 marks, 
up from Wednesday's 1.6805 marks. 
</P>
<P>
 The greenback ended at 104.45 Japanese yen, down from 106.25 yen on Wednesday.

CONSORTIUM TO PUT $1.8 BILLION IN PHONE SYSTEM; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: 
PARTNERSHIP, TO BE KNOWN AS GLOBALSTAR, WILL INVEST IN SATELLITE-BASED NETWORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A worldwide consortium of 10 telecommunications companies, including PacTel 
Corp., announced plans Thursday to invest in a $1.8-billion satellite-based 
telephone network aimed at undercutting competitors' costs by simplifying the 
connections between Earth and space. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Loral Corp. and Qualcomm Inc., the partnership, called Globalstar, will 
offer cheap rates by taking advantage of existing networks operated by local 
phone companies, such as the regional Bell operating companies and their 
foreign counterparts.It is expected to begin operating in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the new partners is PacTel, the Walnut Creek, Calif., wireless 
communication company that on April 1 will be spun free of Pacific Telesis 
Group, also the parent company of Pacific Bell. PacTel will invest $37.5 
million for an 8.3% stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Forging worldwide telecommunications links, either by satellite or by 
fiber-optic technology, has grown into an intense focus of competition, as 
governments and private companies seek to develop information networks. 
</P>
<P>
 By using existing local ground networks to beam calls to an international 
satellite network, the Globalstar system will be able to use fewer and less 
complex satellites than other mobile communications systems, its developers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Loral and Qualcomm's partners are the United Kingdom's Vodafone, France's 
Alcatel Espace, Italy's Alenia Spazio, PacTel and Space Systems/Loral of the 
United States, the South Korean companies Hyundai and Dacom, and Deutsche 
Aerospace in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 For PacTel, soon to be AirTouch Communications, this agreement marks the first 
major foray into long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it is independent of the local California phone company, it will be freed 
of restrictions on offering long-distance service. PacTel will have exclusive 
rights to provide mobile service in the United States, Japan, six other 
countries and the Caribbean region.

 More Banks Raise Lending Rates to 6.25%: Additional major banks matched the 
industry's trendsetters and raised prime lending rates following this week's 
offensive by the Federal Reserve aimed at staving off inflation.Consumers 
should feel the pinch of a higher prime rate because interest rates on many 
credit cards, mortgages and small-business loans linked to this figure will 
rise. On Wednesday, Citicorp's Citibank, the nation's largest bank, led a 
string of major banks raising the prime rate. Many banks followed Thursday, 
including BankAmerica Corp., Wells Fargo, Mellon Bank, NationsBank and Union 
Bank.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: CHILD ISSUES HIGH FOR PRODUCT SAFETY CHIEF

<TEXT>
<P>
 Earlier this week we talked with Ann Brown, the new chairwoman of the U.S. 
Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 She came to the interview with a package of 12 jumbo crayons imported from 
China by Concord Enterprises of Los Angeles -- the first product recalled under 
her tenure. Although labeled "non-toxic," the yellow and red crayons contain 
hazardous amounts of lead, Brown said. The crayons may be returned to stores 
for refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the commission is testing 25 other crayon brands imported from 
China. Results are expected within a few weeks, and recalls will follow if lead 
is found. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining the commission March 10, Brown was vice president of the 
Consumer Federation of America and chairwoman of Public Voice, an nutrition 
advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 We asked Brown to discuss her goals for the agency, which has a reputation 
among consumer groups for sluggishness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Consumer organizations say commission inaction in recent years has forced 
Congress and state governments to legislate remedies. Congress is considering a 
toy-labeling bill identical to a proposal the commission rejected last year 
against the recommendation of its own staff. In California, the Legislature is 
weighing a ban on sales of substandard baby cribs, because the commission 
hasn't done so. What's your response? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A The consumer groups are absolutely correct. The commission has a terrific 
staff, but it has not been listened to. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things I've done since getting to the commission is try to 
invigorate the staff. I've been there 10 days, and I've had two brown-bag 
lunches with the (department) directors. I've opened the elevators. The staff 
had to use a special key card to open the elevators, and they weren't allowed 
to come in nights and on weekends. Imagine! Someone wants to work on a weekend 
and they sat on that. 
</P>
<P>
 I said: 'Bring me your ideas. Take risks.' We've got all sorts of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q For example? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Swimming pool (drownings) are a problem in California, Arizona and South 
Florida. Of course, what we need are barriers separating the house and the pool 
. . . fences are not enough. There's something we did with playgrounds. We put 
out a booklet -- we didn't make it a rule -- that gave requirements for 
playgrounds. Even though it's not mandatory it has become the standard for home 
playgrounds. So, one of the staff said, 'Why can't we do the same thing for 
swimming pools?' 
</P>
<P>
 This is what you call back-door rule-making. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q This is not something you have the authority to mandate, is that correct? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A We don't have the authority to mandate (barri ers). I think you have to push 
the envelope a little. 
</P>
<P>
 These (commission) pamphlets take on the force of law. They (contractors and 
equipment manufacturers) are concerned about product liability. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q What about products you can regulate? Various consumer organizations have 
been pushing for safety rules for baby walkers, cribs and 5-gallon, industrial 
buckets that are reused for household chores. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Buckets are a very serious problem for children between the ages of 8 and 14 
months. Children are a little top-heavy at those ages, and the buckets are 
sturdy and don't tip over. A child can drown in three inches of water. 
</P>
<P>
 We are going to be taking action on buckets. Labeling is one thing we can do. 
We may have to have performance standards so buckets tip when a kid falls in. A 
kid drowns every week, so we have to work as speedily as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 (Regarding) baby walkers -- that's a real puzzle. One time on a radio program 
I suggested that they be banned (because toddlers are hurt when walkers roll 
down stairs). The calls came in: 'Take away my husband but don't take my baby 
walker!' So I don't know. People are so dependent on them and love them so. It 
may be possible to redesign them so they are more like bouncers, or put them on 
a tether. 
</P>
<P>
 (As for substandard cribs), we have a couple of ideas on how to motivate 
consumers to turn in old cribs. We haven't met with manufacturers yet, but I 
think (working with them) is the way to go. One of my staff people is . . . 
sounding them out on the idea of being involved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q What else is on your agenda? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Other issues are Venetian blind cords and strings on children's clothing. 
The statistics are showing there are (strangulation) deaths. We don't have 
hundreds. What we are seeing with Venetian blinds is more cords and more 
deaths. The numbers are creeping up, and I feel this is an important area. 
</P>
<P>
 The strings on children's garments are interesting because they've tried to 
approach those deaths by what you do about the cribs or the playground 
equipment so there aren't any gaps (where strings may get caught). But if you 
did something about the strings, then you wouldn't have to go to each 
individual place where (an accident) happens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q In Los Angeles, with its large immigrant population, non-English-speaking 
consumers have been injured because they cannot read warning labels. Some 
consumer organizations would like to see bilingual labels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A I think labeling is sometimes overused to the extent that you say, 'We've 
labeled it, therefore we've taken care of (the problem).' But my instinct is 
that any time we do a label, it would have to be in Spanish and English. I 
think we have so many people who speak Spanish as their first language that we 
have to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q It seems that many if not all of your concerns -- deal with children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Absolutely. I have to be careful not to make them my whole priority. I'm a 
mother, a grandmother and a professional in children's safety. When I made my 
list of priorities -- and you have to prioritize, I can't make the whole world 
safe -- the children's things just stuck out.

 Film/Video: Live Entertainment and Carolco Pictures, two closely tied 
companies, are merging in a deal that will give Live shareholders up to 29% of 
the new entity. Carolco once held as much as 53% of Live, but the shares were 
turned over to Carolco investors Pioneer, Italy's RCS Video and Canal Plus as 
part of a financial bailout.Those investors now own 42% of Carolco's voting 
stock and 56% of Live's voting shares. Carolco is the producer of such films as 
"Cliffhanger." Live is best known as a distributor of home videos. Mario Kassar 
will serve as chairman of the new company, to be called Carolco Entertainment 
Inc. Separately, Live will seek a buyer for a specialty retail chain and a 
German video distribution company, which will result in a onetime loss of $30 
million. JAMES BATES

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: DOUGLAS, REUTHER JOIN FORCES AGAIN

 With Hollywood film production already running at a feverish pace, add another 
competitor to the power rolodex. Actor/producer Michael Douglas on Thursday 
announced that he has formed a company with veteran entertainment executive 
Steven Reuther. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Reuther Productions is negotiating with possible equity partners, in 
addition to working on a domestic distribution agreement. One source denied 
speculation that the company is close to a striking a deal with Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas, whose production credits include the Academy Award-winning "One Flew 
Over the Cuckoo's Nest," is disbanding his Columbia Pictures-based Stonebridge 
Entertainment. Reuther, who recently resigned as president of New Regency 
Productions, previously worked with Douglas on "War of the Roses," "Made in 
America" and "Falling Down."

 Lyle Lovett has another new partner besides actress Julia Roberts -- PolyGram 
Music Publishing Group. Lovett is the first major performer signed by the 
company's new president, David Simone, who has been brought in to bolster 
PolyGram's roster in the publishing area. 
</P>
<P>
 PolyGram beat out larger companies such as Warner/Chappell Music for the 
Lovett catalogue, which has been administered by Criterion Music. Ken Levitan, 
his manager, says Lovett chose PolyGram because of his friendship with Simone, 
who used to work at MCA, and because PolyGram offered "a wonderful environment 
as a place to house Lyle's songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovett's recording contract with MCA is not affected by the deal. Simone says 
he plans to work with other divisions at the London-based conglomerate, 
including PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, to find new ways of exploiting songs 
by Lovett and other publishing clients -- including U2, k.d. lang and the 
Cranberries.

 As Tom Hanks accepted the best actor Oscar for "Philadelphia" on Monday, 
former TriStar Pictures Chairman Mike Medavoy watched from a hotel room outside 
Palm Springs. Medavoy, who gave the go-ahead to the film at TriStar, says he 
left town to escape all the Oscar hubbub. 
</P>
<P>
 After arriving at his hotel, Medavoy says he spent most of the evening 
"watching the stars and just gazing out into the air." He switched on the 
telecast just in time to catch Hanks' emotional acceptance speech. After a 
half-hour, and not feeling well, he "turned off the TV . . . and went to 
sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Medavoy, who left TriStar two months ago, says he is in no hurry to rejoin 
Hollywood's rat race. But that doesn't mean that he's turned a totally deaf ear 
to the pitter-patter of little paws. 
</P>
<P>
 He confirmed published reports of business conversations with Peter Hoffman, 
the former Carolco executive who heads the production/dealmaking firm 
Cinevisions; and Arnold W. Messer, who used to run Columbia/TriStar 
International. Medavoy says he has also met with "foreign entities," though he 
refused to identify the companies or the nature of the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of looking at everything to see what I should do, and want to do," 
he adds.

 American films may not be much in evidence at the upcoming Cannes Film 
Festival, based on recent reports. But organizer Julie Sisk says the American 
Pavilion definitely will return. 
</P>
<P>
 The pavilion is a lively gathering place for industry-oriented panel 
discussions, celebrity appearances (this week's Oscar winner for best actress, 
Holly Hunter, opened the center last year), the crowded bar scene and the 
nighttime parties, including a raucous New Line Pictures event last year for 
"Menace 2 Society." 
</P>
<P>
 Sisk says she is still lining up sponsors. Also at issue is whether the 
pavilion will return to its usual location next to the festival headquarters, 
since organizers are considering a change of venue. Either way, says Sisk, the 
show will go on.

 Count Bruce McNall as one forgiving guy. The Los Angeles Kings owner and 
sometime movie producer was conspicuously not absent from the exclusive Vanity 
Fair party on Oscar night, even though he's accused in the magazine's current 
issue of being a former coin smuggler. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall has downplayed the significance of events described in the magazine. A 
spokesman says that the Kings owner came to the party because he was invited. 
McNall spent much of the evening with a fellow ice hockey magnate, Walt Disney 
Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 Other East/West Coast powerbrokers at the party, co-hosted by producer Steve 
Tisch and Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter: Advance Publications' S.I. and 
Donald Newhouse, financiers Ronald Perelman and Marvin Davis, QVC Chairman 
Barry Diller, Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, Universal 
Studios Chairman Tom Pollock and Robert Daly and Terry Semel of Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 From Washington there was presidential spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers and political 
power couple James Carville and Mary Matalin. Behind the scenes Hollywood 
figures included producers John Davis, Joel Silver, Ted Field, Leonard 
Goldberg, David Friendly, Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, and talent agents 
Jim Wiatt, Jay Moloney and Rick Nicita.

that the Eagles could produce, market and distribute the album on their own 
without the help of a major label. Note: Hits magazine is a weekly music

CREDIT LYONNAIS POSTS $1.2-BILLION LOSS; BAILOUT PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 French state bank Credit Lyonnais, owner of Santa Monica-based 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, said its net loss more than tripled to about $1.2 billion 
in 1993 and disclosed a state-engineered bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 A bank spokesman said the loss -- the largest in French banking history -- was 
mainly due to real estate problems, with a relatively small amount set aside 
for problem entertainment loans. Credit Lyonnais has been plagued by losses on 
loans in the 1980s to a batch of now-defunct or ailing Hollywood companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the state-sponsored bailout, Credit Lyonnais will receive an infusion of 
$833 million with a possible second infusion later in the year. Under the plan, 
nearly $7 billion in bad real estate loans were taken off Credit Lyonnais books 
and put into a state-controlled shell company. 
</P>
<P>
 The net loss was higher than predicted by most banking analysts. It compared 
with a loss of about $320 million in 1992. The bank, however, said it expects 
to be close to break-even this year, with a return to profit in 1995, and said 
it expects profits to reach more normal levels in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit Lyonnais has until 1997 to sell MGM, which it took over in 1992 after 
former owner Giancarlo Parretti defaulted on loans made by the bank. The bank 
is currently trying to rebuild the studio under a new management team led by 
former Paramount Pictures Chairman Frank Mancuso, former Creative Artists 
Agency agent Michael Marcus and former Warner Bros. executive John Calley. The 
bank is being advised on MGM by Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael S. 
Ovitz. 
</P>
<P>
 The French government, which owns a majority of Credit Lyonnais, plans to 
privatize the bank, probably next year or in 1996. The moves to clean up the 
bank's ailing balance sheet are being made in part to improve its financial 
condition once that happens.

LAWSUIT OFFERS RARE LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD DEALINGS; TELEVISION: A POWERFUL 
PRODUCER BUTTS HEADS IN COURT WITH HIS FORMER REPRESENTATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the short-lived comedy series "The Famous Teddy Z," actor Jon Cryer played 
a neophyte talent agent learning the ropes in the back-stabbing world of 
behind-the-scenes Hollywood deal makers. 
</P>
<P>
 The show bombed, but a real-life version is now playing out in a Los Angeles 
court battle that pits powerful TV producer Matt Williams against his former 
representatives, Agency for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who is credited with creating both "Roseanne" and "Home 
Improvement," is suing APA over breach of contract and is seeking to cancel the 
lucrative commissions that his production company owes the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 APA denies the claims, and has filed a countersuit alleging that Williams and 
his partners purposefully sabotaged the relationship to avoid paying money owed 
APA. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit is unusual not only because it provides a rare glimpse into the 
eye-popping financial earnings of one of Hollywood's hottest TV executives, but 
also because it brings to light one of the industry's most obscure but 
controversial practices -- paying so-called "package commissions" to agents for 
matching writers, producers and talent in TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, agents used to earn a 10% commission if they placed their client on 
staff or in a role on a TV show. But in recent years individual commissions 
have been eclipsed by packaging commissions, where agents earn a much higher 
return, drawn from the show's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between Williams and APA apparently went sour shortly after 
APA agent Rick Leed left the agency to become president of Williams' production 
company, Wind Dancer. Leed subsequently informed APA that Wind Dancer would not 
be renewing its representation agreement with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Leed had shepherded Williams' career from the time he was an obscure 
off-Broadway playwright in New York to his free-lancing days on "The Cosby 
Show" and through development and production of "Roseanne" and "Home 
Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 During that seven-year period, APA estimates in court documents, Williams 
earned more than $30 million, including $18 million for his deal on "Roseanne." 
Williams spent only one year as executive producer of the show before a run-in 
with Roseanne Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams also has earned $10 million so far from "Home Improvement," according 
to the APA documents, which project that he could receive $100 million from the 
show over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is able to earn such enormous sums because he owns a percentage of 
the "back end" of both shows, which are hugely profitable in syndication. "Home 
Improvement" could become the second most profitable TV show in history, 
generating gross syndication revenue of $500 million to $750 million, depending 
on how long it stays on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 In their case, Williams and Wind Dancer say APA isn't owed commissions because 
it tried to thwart its former client by withholding services on "Home 
Improvement" after Leed served notice that Wind Dancer was not renewing its 
representation agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though APA no longer represented Wind Dancer, the production company says 
it was still obligated to help furnish material, writers, directors and actors 
to the series. Williams and Wind Dancer say such "servicing" is the only way to 
justify the packaging commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bitterly worded lawsuit, Williams and Wind Dancer claim that APA agents 
would show up on the "Home Improvement" set only to try and poach clients. 
Things apparently got out of hand when one APA agent allegedly annoyed star Tim 
Allen by hanging around his dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, APA sees what happened quite differently. The agency says 
the lawsuit is simply a "coercive attempt" to force it to reduce "commission 
payments fully earned and vested years ago" for "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 According to APA, when negotiations failed, Leed tried to strong arm the 
agency by withholding $730,000 in commissions it is also owed for "Roseanne" 
based on a $7.3-million profit payment made to Wind Dancer last December. 
Furthermore, APA alleges that Wind Dancer interfered with its relationship with 
the Walt Disney Co. by leaning on the studio not to pay any further packaging 
commissions for "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 APA says that it is entitled to commissions for "Roseanne" and "Home 
Improvement." because they were developed during the term of the agreement 
between Williams and the agency and that all attempts to continue serving the 
shows were blocked by Williams.

DISNEY LIMITS RETIREE HEALTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Walt Disney Co., reeling from continued losses at Euro Disney, is 
tightening eligibility requirements for retirees' health care benefits among 
its 70,000 employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new Disney policy, a worker must stay with the company until at 
least age 55 to be eligible for continued coverage after retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are the latest cost-cutting moves at Burbank-based Disney, which 
is reeling from losses at its Euro Disney resort in France. Disney's 
half-ownership of the troubled attraction cut $514 million from its bottom line 
last fiscal year. Euro Disney is undergoing financial restructuring, and the 
effects are reverberating throughout the company. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the Euro Disney losses, Disney is widely believed to be 
reconsidering whether to proceed with the $3-billion Disneyland Resort project, 
which would add a Westcot theme park and several hotels to Disneyland in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 In the theme park division -- the company's largest and most profitable sector 
-- Disney recently took the uncommon move of dismissing 60 middle managers at 
Disneyland in Anaheim and 300 at the Walt Disney Resort in Orlando, Fla. 
Disneyland workers said in a recent company poll that they believe 
penny-pinching has reduced the quality of the park for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule strikes particularly hard at the 45,000 workers in Disney's theme 
park division, because so many started in high school or college, climbed 
through the ranks to middle management and are still more than a decade from 
age 55. 
</P>

GRUMMAN BOARD AGREES TO NORTHROP BUYOUT TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a move that appears to open the door to Northrop Corp.'s takeover offer, 
the directors of Grumman Corp. Thursday authorized the company to begin 
discussions with Northrop to "clarify" its $2-billion bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Grumman specifically said it was seeking to negotiate a merger, the 
announcement marks a clear departure from the firm's initial position of not 
wanting to entertain any bid from Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
 After Martin Marietta announced a negotiated agreement to buy Grumman for $55 
per share earlier this month, Northrop made an unsolicited offer of $60 per 
share and signaled that it was willing to go higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased with their decision and look forward to further discussion," 
Tony Cantafio, a Northrop spokesman, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Marietta officials already are irked that Grumman provided additional 
financial information to Northrop earlier this week. A team of executives, 
including Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa, visited Grumman headquarters in 
Bethpage, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 After that visit, Martin Marietta Chairman Norman Augustine complained in a 
letter Wednesday that the visit by Northrop executives and Grumman's sharing of 
information was a violation of a confidentiality agreement with Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Revealing obvious uncertainty and concern, Augustine wrote to Grumman Chairman 
Renso Caporali that "I certainly hope that Grumman remains committed to the 
merger agreement which we entered into in good faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Caporali, however, questioned whether Grumman could ignore a higher bid. 
Caporali asked in a letter to Augustine how his company could prove in court 
that a higher bid by Northrop would result in irreparable injury to Grumman.  
</P>
<P>
 Grumman's announcement Thursday came in another letter sent to Northrop, which 
was filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission. That letter was in 
response to a Northrop request on Wednesday that Grumman not erect any 
additional acquisition barriers to Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin has a so-called lockup agreement in which Grumman pay Martin $50 
million if it accepted a higher rival bid. Northrop has contended that that 
agreement is illegal.

WHEN HANDSHAKES BECOME UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT; HIGH SCHOOLS: VENTURA COUNTY 
LEAGUE BANS THE PRACTICE TO AVERT POSTGAME FIGHTS. CRITICS SAY KEY LESSONS ARE 
LOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It is the very symbol of sportsmanship -- the victors and the vanquished 
shaking hands at the end of a bitter contest. Evert and Navratilova. The 
Trojans and the Bruins. Grant and Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a series of scuffles between high school teams in eastern Ventura 
County, officials in the Marmonte League say they are sacking the symbol to 
save the sports. 
</P>
<P>
 From tennis matches to baseball games to swim meets, competitors in the 
league, which includes schools in Simi Valley, Camarillo and the Conejo Valley, 
are now forbidden to shake hands after contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics complain that the new policy, enacted earlier this month, is also a 
symbol -- a disturbing though perhaps apt one in an era of bratty tennis 
players swearing at line judges and coaches hurling chairs onto basketball 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them to ban it is bad for sports," said Billy Miller, a junior who plays 
football and basketball at Westlake High School. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, high school sports events around Southern California have 
been marred by violence between opponents. Punches were thrown as fans mobbed 
the field after a 1990 football game between Dorsey High and Banning High. 
Football players from Costa Mesa High and Laguna High engaged in a 
third-quarter melee in 1991. And last year, a Harvard-Westlake soccer player 
was charged with assault for kicking an opponent in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some high school sports leagues have scrapped postgame handshakes 
in especially tense circumstances. The Marmonte League appears to be the first 
to abolish the practice altogether -- in all sports, for boys and girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals of the eight schools in the league, which encompasses mostly white, 
middle-class bedroom communities, voted unanimously to ban postgame handshakes, 
encouraging handshakes before games instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the prohibition) is promoting sportsmanship, but an honest 
sportsmanship rather than just going through the motions," said the man who 
proposed rule, Camarillo High School Principal Terry Tackett, who is a former 
baseball coach. "I don't want to play someone and have them beat me up for 40 
or 50 minutes, then have to tell them they played a good game. I'd rather tell 
them good luck before the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics don't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about resolution," USC philosophy professor Dallas Willard said of the 
postgame handshake. "It recognizes that in the competition feelings are 
aroused. There is hostility. But the idea is now the game is over and the two 
sides come back together. . . . Without it, there is no resolution. You carry 
the resentment or the feeling of domination off the field with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches in neighboring leagues voiced similar opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're that far gone, we shouldn't be playing at all," said Darryl Stroh, 
football and baseball coach at Granada Hills High School in the Northwest 
Valley Conference. "If kids can't handle losing, then we aren't doing our job. 
Overcoming the adversity of losing is part of growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 But scuffles broke out after several Marmonte League basketball games this 
past season -- including one in which a player threw a punch during the 
handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 No players have been hurt in any of the outbreaks, but cautious principals in 
the league want to make sure they don't escalate into the kinds of brawls that 
marred a 1984 baseball game between Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks high schools. 
That fight started with the handshake and ended with five players being 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics agree that safety of the players is a top priority, but argue that 
coaches should have the discretion to handle volatile situations as they arise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally think if there is any misconduct, coaches ought to be fired," 
Camarillo softball coach Darwin Tolzin said. "If the coaches can't control 
their players, they need to get different coaches. My personal opinion is: I 
think handshaking after the game is fantastic. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley baseball coach Mike Scyphers agreed. He cited a game his team 
played this month against Edison High of Huntington Beach. During Edison's 8-1 
victory, the two coaches noticed friction between the teams and agreed to call 
off the postgame handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's a good way to handle it, but the coaches have to be very 
observant," Scyphers said. "I like the sportsmanship, that we shake hands. But 
they don't do it in the big leagues and they don't do it in college. I'm not so 
sure if someone is beating you pretty good that you want to go shake their 
hands anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think when you've got a great ballgame, and it's 3-2 and well-played, 
I'd like to see the kids shake hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Some local observers see the decision as a quick fix that fails to address a 
deeper problem: the postgame flare-ups themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a shame," said John Aylsworth, whose son Steve plays basketball 
at Westlake. "I think the kids need to understand how to (conduct the 
handshake) appropriately rather than just prohibiting it entirely." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA sociologist Jeffrey Alexander said the Marmonte League principals are 
sending the wrong message to their athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, the decision seems to give a certain legitimacy to the 
aggressive behavior by giving into it and saying, 'We're tying our hands 
because we can't do anything about it,' " Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Crowley, commissioner of the Southern Section of the California 
Interscholastic Federation, the governing body of high school sports in the 
state, said a rule similar to the Marmonte League's was proposed for all of the 
region's 400-plus schools a few years ago, but was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry a league had to make that decision," Crowley said. "It says that we 
need to get back to what athletics are all about, ethical conduct, 
sportsmanship, fair play, all the things that we perpetuate in our code of 
ethics." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Sullivan, a spokesman for Little League Baseball in Williamsport, Pa., 
declined to comment specifically on the Marmonte decision. But he characterized 
the postgame handshake as one of the most important parts of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the aims of Little League is to teach kids how to win and how to lose 
with dignity," he said. "The handshake at the end of the game signifies true 
sportsmanship and friendship. To me, it's the beginning of the second half of 
the game, the part you carry away with you." 
</P>
<P>
 But Harry Edwards, a sociology professor at UC Berkeley, said that if 
abolishing niceties such as handshakes is needed to preserve high school 
sports, then it should be done without regret. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards, a noted sports sociologist, added that too many youths are scared 
away from athletics by the threat of violence from off the field, saying some 
boys have quit teams rather than travel into unfriendly neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing of developing sportsmanship is all well and good, but the mere 
connectedness they get from the fact that they still want to come out and play 
ball -- that becomes the critical point," he said. "The rest has to be 
considered gravy." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the rule has not made much of a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Thousand Oaks boys' volleyball team stunned Simi Valley's Royal High 
in a fiercely fought match on Tuesday night, snapping Royal's 66-match league 
winning streak that had lasted more than five years, opponents sought each 
other out through the fans who had streamed onto the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Some players even hugged.

ASSASSINATION AGAIN BRANDS TIJUANA AS A LAWLESS CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In the shantytown where Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio 
fell mortally wounded in the dirt, the children gathered discarded campaign 
signs and blood-stained pebbles as mementos Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 And the adults talked about fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the rest of Tijuana, the people of Lomas Taurinas were coming to grips 
with the Wednesday assassination of Colosio, who was widely expected to become 
Mexico's next president and who had campaigned here moments before his death, 
promising to help this hillside neighborhood of hovels and rutted dirt roads. 
</P>
<P>
 His murder was a grievous blow to a city that has been battered by escalating 
street violence intertwined with allegations of political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's assassination came three weeks after a deadly gun battle on a busy 
boulevard pitting federal police against state police officers who were 
allegedly protecting a drug lord. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very afraid," said Juvenita Manzano, 56, who lives in the squatters' 
development that is a stronghold of Colosio's Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, or PRI as it is known. "The last couple of weeks with the drug 
shootings, and now this tragedy, I don't understand it. The question the people 
are asking: Why did he have to die, when he was going to help the people?" 
</P>
<P>
 Across town, in the Plaza Rio shopping mall with a Denny's restaurant and 
trendy department stores that embody the new face of Mexico, marketing manager 
Ceasar Leal, 63, observed: "There is so much violence in Baja and in Mexico. 
What happened here yesterday, what happened in Chiapas, what happened with the 
drug shooting -- it's like going back 40, 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tijuana," he continued, "is coming apart, like Chicago during Prohibition. 
Politically speaking, people are so passionate -- and that is dangerous. The 
problem is that the government tells us nothing about what is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Leal echoed the doubts, uncertainty and conspiracy theories that were swirling 
around an increasingly turbulent Mexico on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 His words had particular resonance for Tijuana and Baja California, an 
opposition-controlled state with a history of tension with the PRI government. 
</P>
<P>
 Tijuana has tried hard to emphasize its little-known side, portraying itself 
as a modern metropolis with a population approaching almost 2 million, a 
youthfully energetic municipal administration and a burgeoning arts scene. 
</P>
<P>
 But, unjustly or not, the assassination has once again branded Tijuana as a 
lawless, sinister border town. 
</P>
<P>
 And in conversations on the street Thursday, it seemed as if the assassination 
was the explosion at the end of a long-simmering fuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been insistent about the high levels of criminality in this state," 
said a somber Jose Luis Perez Canchola, the state's human rights ombudsman, 
during an appearance on a radio talk show. "There has been apathy and 
disinterest on the part of the police in attacking this escalation of crime. . 
. . This is a call of alarm that should concern us greatly." 
</P>
<P>
 Until Wednesday, lawlessness in Tijuana had been synonymous with drugs. The 
city is the home base of the powerful Arellano drug cartel, which is suspected 
in a three-year wave of murders and brazen shootouts -- including the notorious 
slaying last year of the archbishop of Guadalajara. Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas 
Ocampo and six others were killed when they were caught in a drug-related 
shootout in the parking lot of Guadalajara's international airport, authorities 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the government has said the cleric was shot by mistake, doubts and 
politically tinged conspiracy theories linger here because the Arellanos remain 
at large. They continue to run the Tijuana cartel and allegedly were behind a 
shootout on March 3 that left five people dead -- including the commander of an 
elite federal unit that was hunting the Arellanos and a state police officer 
who was alleged to have been guarding a top cartel lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 That shootout left Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel stuck with a major corruption 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffo was the target of openly partisan criticism Thursday among some Colosio 
supporters, who blamed the state and city for failing to provide sufficient 
security for the slain politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffo responded that security was the campaign's responsibility and that local 
authorities had provided all the officers that were needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the political concerns that swirled here Thursday, the emotions 
expressed over Colosio's killing also were heartfelt. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lomas Taurinas, still strewn with confetti and bloodstains from the 
previous day's events, the crowd grew at a memorial service Thursday afternoon. 
As night fell, there was talk of renaming the neighborhood for Colosio. And 
there was talk of the fear that grips the neighborhood and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something is terribly wrong in Mexico," said Jose Antonio Rique, 43. " The 
government does not tell us the truth. . . . Who is behind all of these 
terrible things that are happening?" Working-Class Roots 
</P>
<P>
 Background on Luis Donaldo Colosio, who was gunned down Wednesday at age 44: 
</P>
<P>
 * Education: Degrees in economics from the Monterrey Institute of Technology 
and the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: The oldest of six children, he spent his childhood helping his 
father, a rancher, in the small town of Magdalena de Kino in the northern state 
of Sonora. He relied on scholarships and other help to get him through college. 
</P>
<P>
 * Political inspiration: Like President Clinton, who was inspired by shaking 
President John F. Kennedy's hand, Colosio said he decided to go into politics 
when he shook the hand of President Adolfo Lopez Mateos on a trip to Mexico 
City awarded him for having the best grades throughout high school. 
</P>
<P>
 * Political style: Usually shy and tense until he mounted a platform and 
started to speak to supporters -- usually poor people. Then the words would 
start to flow easily, he would relax, and he related to his listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 * Career: Managed President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's 1988 campaign, guiding 
him to a narrow victory over Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in an election that foes 
decried as tainted. Before being named a candidate, directed the government's 
$3-billion-plus Solidarity program, which built roads and brought electricity 
and running water to remote communities but which critics said was designed to 
perpetuate the party's grip on power. 
</P>
<P>
 * Personal: Married to Diana Laura Riojas, an economist. Two children, newly 
born Mariana and Luis Donaldo, 7.

GAS PIPELINE BLAST RIPS N.J. NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A huge natural gas pipeline exploded early Thursday into a 30-story fireball, 
incinerating eight apartment buildings as 1,500 residents fled for their lives 
from a fast moving wall of flames. 
</P>
<P>
 One person died from a heart attack and approximately 60 were injured when the 
high-pressure pipeline ruptured just after midnight with a roar that some 
eyewitnesses said resembled that of a tornado. Officials said that as of 
Thursday evening 40 people were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said the fact that it took flames seven to 10 
minutes to reach the apartment complex was the chief reason lives were saved. 
</P>
<P>
 The force of the blast hurled people from their beds, disintegrated cars and 
left a huge crater. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire engulfed large portions of the Durham Woods complex, a collection of 
two- and three-story brown-brick townhouses and garden apartments near the 
pipeline operated by Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was (awakened) from my sleep. It sounded like thunder, but it just wouldn't 
stop," said Sharon Sawczak, 24, a medical secretary. "It just kept getting 
louder and louder and louder. Everything in our apartment was just orange. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were just running with babies in their hands, with animals, were 
running out of there, leaping in their cars. It just felt like it was following 
you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminded me of a King Kong kind of movie where people are just running in 
every direction, not knowing what they are doing -- just grabbing kids, people 
falling, tripping, running, people just scattering in every direction to just 
get out of there," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 In the panic and the pandemonium, some people ran barefoot down railroad 
tracks. Others sought refuge in nearby woods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran over streams and fences and I found myself at the Shell gas station," 
said Amolika Tikekar, 26. "It was bright out like daylight, but it was brighter 
than daylight." 
</P>
<P>
 "We just thought it was like a hurricane. The fire was going around in a 
circle," said Melanie Garcia, 15, who sprinted down the railroad tracks with 
two companions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was running, running for my life," said Chris Pennachio, a registered 
nurse. "My feet are so sore as I ran down the tracks. . . . It was almost like 
a rolling flame, rolling down the tracks. The explosion was unbelievable. It 
sounded like a tornado swirling and then when I looked up, it was like a 
towering inferno in the sky." 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 500 people took shelter in Edison High School about two miles 
from the blast site. Families, separated by the night of terror, staged tearful 
reunions in the school's parking lot as trucks rolled up with supplies from the 
American Red Cross and donations of food and clothing from area residents and 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said scores of people were taken to area hospitals for treatment; 
most had minor injuries. The one confirmed fatality was a 32-year-old woman who 
died of a heart attack, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman, who toured the scene Thursday, described what she witnessed as being 
like "ground zero at a nuclear blast." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to believe there had been anything there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At what was left of the apartment complex, firefighters spent the day pouring 
water on smoldering ruins that were punctuated by still-standing brick 
chimneys. As the rubble cooled, search dogs were led through the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals found no bodies, but some structures were vaporized by the 
explosion and intense heat, raising fears among some rescue workers that people 
may have been incinerated. 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate cause of the pipeline's rupture was not known as multiple state 
and federal investigations commenced. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is this pipeline will not be reopening until we have firm 
answers," said Edison Township Mayor George Spadoro. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline is buried seven feet underground and covered by boulders, but the 
force of the blast tossed the boulders into the air and the flames could be 
seen more than 20 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors on Thursday checked the other gas pipelines that run beneath 
Edison, an industrial and suburban community of 67,000 people. Texas Eastern 
has three pipelines that run beneath that section of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 The portion of the pipeline that blew up was installed in 1961 and was 300 
yards from the apartment complex. The 36-inch-diameter pipe is the largest size 
of natural gas transmission line allowed in populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said the line was last inspected in 1986 and that routine 
maintenance had not revealed any problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 24 hours after the blast, state officials said they were still not sure 
of the death toll. However, they said they expected few fatalities, with the 
majority of those missing eventually turning at the homes of friends and 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional searches were planned for today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're cautiously optimistic," Spadoro said. "But we need answers."

MEXICO'S PRESIDENT CALLS FOR CALM AS COLOSIO IS MOURNED; AFTERMATH: SALINAS 
CLOSES DOWN BANKS AND STOCK MARKET AS NATION GRIEVES. ALLEGED ASSASSIN 
CONFESSES. CLINTON CONDEMNS THE MURDER AND PLEDGES U.S. SUPPORT.

<P>
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari called for calm and unity in his country 
Thursday as shocked, angry Mexicans mourned Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling 
party's assassinated presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of grieving people filed past Colosio's body, which lay in state at 
the headquarters here of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI as it is 
known. 
</P>
<P>
 After a private, afternoon service at a fashionable funeral home in the south 
of the city, Colosio's remains were to be cremated today in keeping with the 
Mexican custom of quick burials, as bodies are generally not embalmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas declared a national day of mourning, closing banks and the stock 
market, although schools remained opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "The loss of Luis Donaldo Colosio is the deepest call for Mexicans to remain 
united, to revive our consciousness as a people of great moral strength," the 
president said in a televised address to the nation. "I call on all my 
countrymen to share their indignation with serenity and calm." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday's assassination appeared to be tearing at the already loose 
seams that unite Mexico and the ruling party. Colosio supporters openly accused 
his rival and possible successor, Manuel Camacho Solis, of having a role in the 
candidate's death. 
</P>
<P>
 In other key developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Political uncertainty prevailed as Mexicans, for the first time in more than 
six decades, confronted the prospect of selecting a replacement presidential 
candidate for the historically stable ruling party. The decision may not be 
made until after the Easter holidays, although factions already began disputing 
the worthiness of various individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Washington, President Clinton expressed his condolences, condemned the 
assassination and urged Mexicans to forge ahead in their efforts to improve 
their economy. The Administration also offered Mexico limited law enforcement 
and economic help, while seeking to dispel doubts about the country's 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Tijuana, at a crowded news conference, Atty. Gen. Diego Valades said 
Mario Aburto Martinez, 23, an industrial mechanic, had confessed to killing 
Colosio on Wednesday after a campaign rally in the border city. He said nothing 
about a possible motive and refused to answer questions. Tests on the gun and 
Aburto's hands show that he alone fired the gun, Valades said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation, including an autopsy, shows that Aburto fired two shots 
from a Brazilian-made Taurus .38-caliber revolver, fatally wounding Colosio in 
the head and abdomen. Valades said the case is not closed, adding that Salinas 
ordered him to find the full truth. 
</P>
<P>
 * International investors appeared to react calmly to the assassination and 
the possibility of a Camacho Solis candidacy. Grief, Suspicion 
</P>
<P>
 On the day after Colosio's assassination, questions flew about Mexico's 
presidential campaign security measures, which traditionally are more lax than 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 After Colosio had finished his campaign speech and walked about 30 feet into 
the crowd toward his vehicle, Aburto emerged from the crowd on the candidate's 
right side and shot him at point-blank range in the temple, Valades said. 
Colosio was shot a second time in the stomach as he crumpled to the ground, but 
the first shot was the fatal one. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's murder was the third significant blow this year for Mexico, a 
country that prides itself on political stability. His death follows a Jan. 1 
peasant uprising in southern Mexico and the kidnaping earlier this month of a 
prominent banker. Neither matter has been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans were devastated by their country's first major political 
assassination since 1928, when Alvaro Obregon, the anti-clerical 
president-elect, was killed by a religious fanatic. 
</P>
<P>
 At party headquarters Thursday, mourners like Guadalupe Guerrero, a 
34-year-old widow in a faded green T-shirt, sobbed with grief. Her face swollen 
and anguished, Guerrero said, "I think of the loss of my own husband and I 
share this great pain with Mrs. Colosio." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the capital, people were subdued, shocked at the candidate's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sad, because this is not the way we do things," said Miguel Palestina, 
a 33-year-old computer programmer. "Elections were coming up. This should have 
been done with votes, not arms. Many people are discontented, tired of 
candidates who make promises and do not keep them. I worry that this will come 
down to armed revolt." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds at PRI headquarters mixed their grief with fury. 
</P>
<P>
 Clenching her fist, Avelina Laguna, a 52-year-old secretary from the city's 
northern suburbs, angrily cried, "Unjust, inhumane men. They should throw the 
book at them. . . . We must demand justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Other angry Colosio supporters questioned security measures in Tijuana, the 
largest city in Baja California, one of only three states with an opposition 
party governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel defended local and state police, noting that security 
for the candidate is the responsibility of Mexico's equivalent of the Secret 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Tijuana provided the eight police cars the campaign requested, and state 
judicial police were on call, he said. "The campaign was given all the security 
it asked for." Political Uncertainty 
</P>
<P>
 Coming five months before the Aug. 21 federal elections, the assassination of 
Colosio -- the 44-year-old former social development minister -- raised 
questions about the presidential succession in a country where, for 65 years, 
power has passed peacefully among members of a single political party -- the 
PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bullet against Colosio was a bullet against the system," said economist 
Rogelio Ramirez de la O. "It was against the notion that Salinas wanted to 
prolong a personal style of government that has been very effective but very 
biased against small people." 
</P>
<P>
 The assassination, he said, increases the pressure for democratic reforms, 
even at the price of opening the political system to the point that an 
opposition candidate might win the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates of eight other parties indefinitely suspended their presidential 
campaigns and joined the orderly crowds at the PRI headquarters compound, its 
high-rise buildings draped with Colosio banners. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas said party officials had agreed "to act responsibly" without 
specifying what that means. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's PRI successor probably will not be chosen until after the 
traditional Easter week holidays, a well-informed source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular former Mexico City Mayor Camacho Solis appeared to be the candidate 
most likely to succeed Colosio, although the name of campaign manager and 
former Education Minister Ernesto Zedillo was also mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers were surprised in November when Salinas, exercising the 
traditional prerogative of the outgoing president, chose his protege Colosio 
over his longtime friend Camacho Solis, 48. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio was considered a compromise candidate between Camacho Solis, an 
advocate of political and social reform, and Treasury Minister Pedro Aspe 
Armella, an inflation-fighter committed to free-market economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Camacho Solis' status has risen as he negotiated with southern 
rebels. However, a peace agreement has not yet been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, in rejecting the possibility of a maverick presidential bid 
challenging Colosio, Camacho Solis said that peace was more important to him 
than the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the peace envoy's ongoing rivalry with Colosio has also tainted 
him, provoking criticisms that he lacked party discipline. He also has powerful 
enemies inside the PRI, many of whom blame him for Colosio's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kill him, kill him," the crowd shouted, as Camacho Solis arrived at Colosio's 
funeral. Earlier in the day, mourners gathered at PRI headquarters chanted, 
"Colosio, si ; Camacho, no." Market Reaction 
</P>
<P>
 International investors reacted calmly to Colosio's assassination and the 
possibility of a Camacho Solis candidacy. Mexican stocks dropped about 5% on 
light volume in international markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The international community views Camacho favorably," said Kristie King 
Etchberger, an analyst at D. A. Campbell Co., a Los Angeles brokerage with a 
large Mexican stock portfolio. "There was more concern about a split in the 
party."  
</P>
<P>
 That split may be inevitable, said economist Ramirez: "The PRI has been 
fatally wounded. It has lost all prestige, what little it had." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, investors felt reassured that the peso would remain stable. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, Mexico received good news when Salinas announced that the 
nation had joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Darling reported from Mexico City and Rotella from Tijuana. Susan Drommet of 
The Times' Mexico City Bureau also contributed to this report.

<P>
 For years, Frederick West and his family appeared to live a rather ordinary, 
even dull, English life at 25 Cromwell St., in a three-story row house on a 
quiet, working-class street. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the police went searching for West's 16-year-old daughter, Heather, who 
the Wests said ran away seven years ago. They found her body buried beneath the 
back yard patio. And, the more they looked, the more they found, uncovering the 
remains of eight more women. 
</P>
<P>
 Now West, a 52-year-old construction worker, is in Her Majesty's Prison here, 
charged with nine murders dating to 1977. And there may be more. 
</P>
<P>
 The digging continues, and police plan to move later to a house around the 
corner where West lived with his first wife and their 12-year-old daughter. 
Police have been unable to locate them. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 25 Cromwell St., already dubbed by Fleet Street the "House of Horrors," 
has joined the most notorious addresses in Britain's rich serial murder lore. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the rare Briton, indeed, who cannot identify 10 Rillington Place as the 
home where John Reginald Halliday Christie strangled 12 women from 1943 to 
1953, or 195 Melrose Ave. as the place where Dennis Andrew Nilsen strangled or 
drowned most of his 15 young male victims from 1978 to 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 And who can forget the ones who got away? 
</P>
<P>
 Jack the Ripper slit the throats of five prostitutes in London's East End in 
1888, touching off a debate over his identity that continues to this day. And 
Jack the Stripper was a psychopath who killed seven prostitutes in London in 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 For the British, a people proud of having one of the world's most civilized 
societies, uncivilized murder has long captured the national imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this country of 50 million people counts only about 600 homicides a 
year, about the rate in New York City, it has a remarkable history of serial 
killers, one surpassing any other country in Europe and one well tended by 
Britain's tabloid press. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that Britain has been bedeviled by these characters over 
the years," said Anthony Busuttil, a professor of forensic medicine at 
Edinburgh Medical School in Scotland. "These things have become almost part of 
the folklore of our country." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1946, in an essay titled "Decline of the English Murder," George 
Orwell acknowledged the pleasure that he and his countrymen received from 
reading about the ultimate crime in the comfort of their drawing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 A really good murder, Orwell wrote, would take place "in a semi-detached 
house, which will allow the neighbors to hear suspicious sounds through the 
wall." The perpetrator would be a little man "living an intensely respectable 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Orwell also lamented a decline in juicy cases from what he called "the great 
period in murder, our Elizabethan period, so to speak," from 1850 to 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as he was writing those words, John Christie was ushering in a new 
era of homicide at 10 Rillington Place. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Amiel, the British author of the 1977 book "By Persons Unknown," 
suggests that it is precisely her country's civility that denies psychopathic 
killers an outlet for their urges. In less civil societies, such as Stalin's 
Russia or Hitler's Germany, there is "legitimate room for the ambitions of 
deranged people," she wrote recently in the Sunday Times of London. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Britain, "the notion of people who seem to behave just like us, with 
the exception that they are carefully carrying out the murders of other human 
beings, is quite riveting," she says. "Part of our attraction to horrible 
murders is, I think, our need to get a good shudder." 
</P>
<P>
 The events at 25 Cromwell St. have certainly given the British public, and 
people around the world, a good shudder. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is the setting, a quintessentially English community on gentle 
hills 100 miles west of London. Gloucester is one of England's treasures, a 
place of tea shops and abundant history where Beatrix Potter set her children's 
story, "The Tailor of Gloucester." 
</P>
<P>
 Gloucester's 100,000 residents trace their roots back 2,000 years, to the 
city's founding as an outpost of the Roman Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 William the Conqueror built the first castle here, in 1068, and Henry III was 
crowned 200 years later at St. Peter's Abbey, a glorious church that still 
stands as the center of a strong tourist business. Buried beneath the abbey is 
the body of Edward II, the victim of, yes, a murder in 1327. 
</P>
<P>
 The West family house is a drab, narrow and, as Orwell seemed to have 
predicted, semi-detached home whose occupants seemed to be respectable people. 
About the only thing that sets No. 25 apart from other houses on Cromwell 
Street is the window frames, which West painted a grass-stain green. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood, next to Gloucester's tidy downtown, is what the British call 
a "bedsit," because many residents rent rooms to students and others seeking 
temporary, low-cost shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wests too rented part of their house to boarders. In fact, at least one of 
them, Shirley Anne Robinson, 18, was found in the soil beneath the house. She 
was, say the London papers, "heavily pregnant" at the time of her death. 
</P>
<P>
 The case began late last month with a tip to Gloucester police about the 
disappearance of Heather West, prompting them to obtain a search warrant for 
the house, where they began looking for her body. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors and relatives said Heather, one of Frederick West's 10 children, had 
been missing since 1987 and that the Wests said she had run off with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 West, a short, burly man with a head of curly black hair, was arrested a day 
after the search began. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't kill her!" he shouted as he was escorted away. 
</P>
<P>
 Police tore out the patio stones that West had installed in his 60-foot back 
yard, then used ground-penetrating radar to detect what turned out to be the 
skeletal remains of Heather and Robinson, buried four feet below the surface. 
Then the remains of a third woman, in her 20s, was found. 
</P>
<P>
 West's basement floor was removed, and 12 days after the search began, nine 
sets of remains had been found. His wife, Rosemary, was questioned and 
released; her attorney says she knew nothing and was "deeply shocked and 
upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Knight, 62, a professor of forensic medicine at the College of 
Medicine at the University of Wales in Cardiff, has been brought in to study 
the remains. 
</P>
<P>
 In the history of British murder, Knight is something of a legend. The author 
of several crime novels in the 1960s, including "The Thread of Evidence" and 
"The Lately Deceased," he is known to enjoy "murder parties" at which guests 
act out and solve whodunits. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight has taken the remains to his laboratory, where it will be weeks before 
he is able to determine the identities of the victims or the causes of death. 
The 70-member investigative team is fielding dozens of calls daily from worried 
families of missing persons; nearly 100 of those believed to have been lost 
have been located -- alive -- through public appeals stemming from the case. 
Publicity about the hunt in West's yard has led to reunions of loved ones in at 
least 80 families. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the police will take their shovels to 25 Midland Road, where West once 
lived with his first wife, Rena, and their daughter, who are still missing. 
Then they will dig into a vacant field outside of town, where the special radar 
detected irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 Understandably, many Britons wonder how so many people could simply vanish. 
For years, locating missing people fell to charitable groups rather than 
police. Scotland Yard only recently established a missing persons department. 
</P>
<P>
 Four police investigators have been assigned to answer the never-ending 
questions from the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily headlines scream of scoops in the case, using catch phrases such as 
"Garden of Death" as well as the more common "House of Horror." 
</P>
<P>
 In their battle for circulation, some papers have published appeals to people 
who knew West, hired him to do work on their houses or have photographs of him 
to contact them. 
</P>
<P>
 David Canter, a professor of psychology at Surrey University and author of a 
book on serial killers, defends Britain's curiosity about 25 Cromwell St., 
arguing that ghoulish cases "can refresh our understanding of what it means to 
be human." 
</P>
<P>
 When the world's media "no longer think a 'house of horrors' is a newsworthy 
story, that will be the end of civilization as we know it," he wrote recently 
in the Sunday Times. 
</P>
<P>
 For Terence Morris, a criminology professor at the London School of Economics, 
the Cromwell Street case fits the serial killer profile. Virtually all such 
criminals in Britain's history have been men. Their victims, often single and 
lonely, usually lived on society's margins. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in that category are vulnerable," Morris said. "These are the people 
who can disappear and not be missed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Morris said this case has elements that make it different. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Britain's serial killers have tried to dispose of their victims' 
bodies. Dennis Nilsen, who is serving a life prison term for killing 15 men, 
was discovered only when his victims' dismembered bodies blocked the sewer 
system. John Haigh, hanged in 1949 for killing eight women, dissolved his 
victims' bodies in acid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of considerable criminological interest to find multiple sets 
of human remains," Morris said. "I can't recall a case quite like this one." 
</P>
<P>
 If more bodies are found, the case could become the worst serial killing in 
British history. Nilsen's 15 victims are the highest toll, followed by those of 
Peter William Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, who killed 13 women during a 
five-year spree in the late 1970s. Sutcliffe is in a mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the interest in the West case has been generated by the appearance of 
normality on Cromwell Street and the lack of an identified motive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling is that it could happen on anybody's street," said Russell Trott, 
a local reporter for BBC-TV. "People feel close to it, without actually 
visiting it." 
</P>
<P>
 But visit it they have, by the hundreds. Some have handed bouquets of flowers 
to police guards, who dutifully place them against the front of the house. 
Others have their pictures taken with the house in the background. When one of 
the street signs was stolen as a souvenir, police removed the wrought-iron 
black number plate on the front of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just such a major topic of news," said Zoe Slatter, 23, explaining why 
she and two friends came, with their cameras, from 45 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors and questions spread through the neighborhood and across the pages of 
newspapers, fed partly by police reluctance to reveal too much about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Were the Wests, as some suggest, into kinky sex parties? Does the house have a 
mirrored room and pornographic videotapes? The police call the rumors "pure 
speculation." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just keeping an open mind," police spokeswoman Hilary Allison said. "We 
went down initially looking for one body, and now we've found nine. We don't 
know what else we'll find." 
</P>
<P>
 In Gloucester, which averages fewer than two homicides a year, "this is a rare 
event," she added. "We mostly deal with burglaries and car thefts." 
</P>
<P>
 West's attorney, Howard Ogden, has complained that the news coverage is making 
it impossible for his client to get a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ogden himself has posed for photos in a London tabloid and once advertised 
his services on radio with the slogan, "If you've been nicked (arrested), call 
Oggie." 
</P>
<P>
 He got the West case because, at the time of West's arrest, he was the 
"on-call" lawyer for the county, a duty for which he regularly volunteers, he 
said, to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 On Cromwell Street, opinion on West is freely offered and frequently divided. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a sick, perverted man," said Liz Steadman, 22, who lives three doors 
down. "We're all just sickened, disgusted." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Brothwell, a 23-year-old neighbor, remembers West had helped him a few 
weeks earlier, when Brothwell locked himself out of his apartment. West brought 
a ladder and they broke into one of the windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was helpful enough, pleasant enough," Brothwell recalled. "But this isn't 
the kind of street where people usually mix with each other. It's scary to know 
some guy lived here for all these years and was bumping people off." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in a small, one-story house 
next to 25 Cromwell St., Robert Bennett, a church elder, said the pastor had 
invited West to services many times, but West had always declined politely. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a consequence of something that's gone wrong in this world," Bennett 
said. "This is really a close-knit community. But I saw something in the eyes 
of all the people who have come here. It was total disbelief. The people here 
will never be the same."

 Mario Aburto Martinez, who had led an unremarkable life, launched himself into 
infamy when, authorities say, he assassinated Luis Donaldo Colosio, the man 
widely expected to be Mexico's next president. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it for Mexico!" the 23-year-old factory worker reportedly told his 
interrogators after his capture by an angry crowd in a broadcast spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 But just who is this curly-haired figure, whose chaotic apprehension -- he was 
beaten, bloodied and dazed -- has been repeated and repeated on television 
screens and whose confession was recorded Thursday? 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they have few clues to Aburto's motive. Officials, and those 
who knew him, said a lack of drama characterized his life -- until Wednesday, 
when he has admitted that he stepped forward from a crowd and coolly gunned 
down Colosio, 44, the presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, or PRI as it is known. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto has told police that he is a dedicated pacifist. A native of central 
Mexico, he lived for a time in San Pedro and was employed for about a year at a 
Torrance furniture firm, where his father and one brother still work. His 
sister is believed to reside in the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Colonia Buenos Aires Norte, the area Aburto called home in recent 
years, he is remembered as an unremarkable man who went to work at his assembly 
plant job and once fell in love and ran off with a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 His neighborhood is poor. It is filled with dirt tracks and temporary 
dwellings of cardboard and tin. It is the home to many laborers in 
foreign-owned factories. Aburto's house, actually owned by his mother, is a 
brick structure that appears to be one of the better in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never supposed it could be him," Yolanda Godinez Gomez, a former neighbor 
here, said of Aburto. "We were not only surprised, but indignant." 
</P>
<P>
 Elena Soria, another area resident, added: "He didn't mix much with the 
neighbors, but, like all men, he liked to flirt with the girls. He seemed 
normal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican attorney general said Thursday that Aburto had confessed to 
killing Colosio. Authorities say he was the sole gunman who fired two fatal 
shots, one of which hit Colosio in the head, the other in the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Aburto had planned his attack. He bought the murder weapon -- a 
Brazilian-made, .38-caliber Taurus revolver -- in recent weeks, possibly in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapon has been traced to a buyer who purchased it from a San 
Francisco-area dealer in 1977, said a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms, which is assisting Mexican authorities in tracing the 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials are attempting to follow the chain of transactions to determine 
how the weapon made its way into Mexican history. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests have shown gunpowder residue on Aburto's hands, indicating that he had 
fired a firearm recently, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 They said Aburto arrived at the scene -- in the poor Lomas Taurinas 
neighborhood, northeast of downtown -- with the goal of killing Colosio, who 
was giving a campaign speech during the first day of a two-day swing through 
this border down. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness to the shooting who identified herself as Maria, 31, said the gunman 
arrived at the neighborhood by taxi about 1:30 p.m. with two or three other 
people. "He seemed so calm," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto mingled among the 3,000 or so in the crowd who sought to greet Colosio 
after he had finished his speech. When Colosio neared, walking down a sloping 
dirt path, Aburto shot him twice at point-blank range, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second man under questioning, Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, a 47-year-old 
former state police official here, seems to have been at the wrong place at the 
wrong time and nothing more, law enforcement officials said. They now call 
Mayoral a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Aburto, authorities said he is a native of the town of Zamora, in the 
central state of Michoacan, where he lived until he was 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The poverty there forced him, as it has with so many others, to seek a better 
life in the north -- in this bustling border city and, beyond, in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Aburto, the suspect's father, expressed shock at his son's arrest and 
left early Thursday from his job at a Torrance furniture firm, co-workers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked very upset," said George Villasenor, a supervisor at the Torrance 
facility where Ruben Aburto Sr. and Ruben Jr. both work. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspect Aburto told investigators that he is an industrial mechanic working 
out of a machine shop in a neighborhood northeast of downtown Tijuana known as 
Mesa de Otay, a haven for U.S.- and Japanese-owned assembly plants. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1993, U.S. immigration authorities revoked Aburto's 
border-crossing card when he was discovered to have been working without 
authorization in the United States, said a spokesman for the U.S. Immigration 
and Naturalization Service. Such cards allow border-area residents to enter the 
United States to visit and shop, but not to work. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was not on the job, authorities say, Aburto was a dedicated pacifist 
and claimed to have written several books on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 He was stoic during interrogations after his arrest, said Jose Luis Perez 
Canchola, the Baja California attorney general for human rights who witnessed 
Aburto's questioning Wednesday night. "He refused to make any statements, to 
answer all (but a few) questions," Perez said. "He seemed to have been 
conditioned psychologically to remain cool under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Perez recalled, Aburto did show surprise when he was told that Colosio 
had died. 
</P>
<P>
 In the neighborhood where Aburto lived, disbelief was the chief reaction. He 
lived in the house of his mother, Maria Luis Martinez, who appears to own 
several properties in this and other Tijuana communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a man who kept to himself, but he never made any problems for us," 
neighbor Maria del Refugio Reyes said. "We're surprised about what happened 
because, frankly, we never imagined this boy would do something this vile." 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda Godinez Gomez, another neighbor, recalled how Aburto fell in love and 
ran off with a girl several years ago. "I remember him as a boy in love," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The romance didn't last, however, and Aburto returned to Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, Colosio's assassination has brought shame on their neighborhood. 
They worry about where the violence and tumult may lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never thought our neighborhood would be involved in something like this," 
said Luis Jorge Soria Torres, a policeman who lived across the street from 
Aburto. "We feel great consternation. What was done was cowardly. This can put 
us into a predicament."

NEW CHARGES ON WHITEWATER TOLD IN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS and SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, President Clinton's leading Republican critic in the 
Whitewater controversy, charged Thursday that the Arkansas real estate venture 
ultimately was used "to skim, directly or indirectly, federally insured 
deposits" from a Little Rock savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Presenting what he called the findings of a months-long investigation by 
Republicans in Congress, Leach released more than 100 pages of documents that 
he said prove Clinton and his associates guilty of benefiting financially and 
politically from Whitewater, stonewalling on the subsequent investigations and 
interfering with federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whitewater may have begun as a legitimate real estate venture," Leach said on 
the House floor, but eventually "it came to be used to skim, directly or 
indirectly, federally insured deposits" from both Madison Guaranty Savings & 
Loan and Capital Management Services Inc., a Small Business 
Administration-backed fund that made government-subsidized loans to what were 
supposed to be economically disadvantaged borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents Leach released, many of them internal memoranda and notes 
written by federal regulators and investigators working for the Resolution 
Trust Corp., provided no evidence directly linking Clinton or his wife to that 
scheme or other apparent wrong-doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the documents was a memorandum in which a senior federal 
investigator of the Whitewater controversy concluded that the real estate 
investment shared by Clinton, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and two friends 
cost the federally insured Little Rock thrift more than $100,000. This is the 
first government estimate of the financial impact of Whitewater on Madison 
Guaranty, which eventually folded at a cost to taxpayers of more than $47 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The material Leach released provided new details about many aspects of the 
controversial case, including a conclusion by investigators that Clinton's 
Whitewater partners had used Madison and its subsidiary in a giant check-kiting 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 This conclusion was contained in a memo written earlier this year by L. Jean 
Lewis, the senior criminal investigator in the Kansas City office of the RTC, 
who had been handling the RTC's investigation of Madison Guaranty. Madison, 
which the RTC shut down in 1989, was owned and operated by James B. McDougal, 
the Clintons' partner in Whitewater Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said in the memo, which described a discussion she had with a senior 
attorney for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. last month, that she doubted 
any of McDougal's business partners could have been unaware they were 
benefiting from McDougal's use of Madison funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you know that your mortgages are being paid, but you aren't putting money 
into the venture, and you also know the venture isn't cash flowing, wouldn't 
you question the source of the funds being used to benefit . . ?" Lewis asked. 
"Wouldn't you wonder even more if you knew that your business partner's main 
source of income, an S&L, was in serious financial difficulty, which by 1985 
was fairly common knowledge?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons have said that they invested about $70,000 of borrowed money in 
Whitewater and received no return on their investment, except for some interest 
payments on loans that were covered by Whitewater and McDougal. But McDougal 
has said that they never invested more than about $13,000 in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said in her memo that the FDIC lawyer, April Breslaw, who had come to 
Kansas City to discuss Madison Guaranty, told her that "people at the top" of 
the government hoped the RTC would conclude that no money from the defunct 
savings and loan went into Whitewater Development. 
</P>
<P>
 To the contrary, Lewis' notes said she told Breslaw, there was ample evidence 
that Whitewater received money from Madison as part of McDougal's larger 
check-kiting scheme. In just one six-month period examined by the RTC, she 
said, investigators found that $70,000 had been shifted from Madison to 
Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from that evidence, she said, "it was my belief that the losses to 
Madison from the Whitewater account alone would easily exceed $100,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the $70,000 of thrift funds that went to Whitewater was a $30,000 
check approved by the Madison board of directors as a bonus for McDougal. 
According to Lewis, the bonus money was immediately moved into the Whitewater 
account at a time when it was overdrawn by $28,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said there was no doubt in her mind that Whitewater was an integral part 
of McDougal's complex financial scheme, and that Whitewater-related losses 
helped to bring the federally insured institution down. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a clear-cut loss," she wrote, recalling her conversation with 
Breslaw. "I also stated that any attempt to extract Whitewater as one entity 
from the rest of the McDougal-controlled entities involved in the alleged check 
kite will distort the entire picture. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I stated that if she wanted me to tell her, unequivocally, that Whitewater 
didn't cause a loss, I could not do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis indicated that her judgments were at the heart of the so-called 
"criminal referral" that the RTC forwarded to the Justice Department last year, 
asking for a criminal investigation of Madison and the related real estate 
investment once partly owned by the President. The substance of that referral, 
which kindled the Whitewater controversy, had never previously been made 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither Lewis' memo on her conversation with Breslaw nor the other 
documents released by Leach showed direct involvement in Madison's activities 
on the part of Clinton. The President has consistently maintained -- and did so 
again in his press conference Thursday night -- that he had no knowledge of 
McDougal's Madison activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Leach, the ranking minority member of the House Banking, Finance and 
Urban Affairs Committee, House Republicans have been investigating Whitewater 
and Madison with the hope of making their findings known at a committee hearing 
on the RTC. But committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) abruptly canceled 
that hearing, which had been scheduled for Thursday morning, after Leach served 
notice that he planned to call a number of Whitewater-related witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 While Democratic leaders later agreed to negotiate with Republicans about the 
possibility of conducting Whitewater hearings, no dates were set -- prompting a 
clearly disappointed Leach to go to the floor on the last day before Congress' 
spring recess to outline what he said are the results of his months-long 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Leach's key assertions: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Clintons, far from losing nearly $69,000 on their ill-starred investment 
as they have claimed, "received value from Whitewater in excess of the 
resources (they) invested." He apparently was counting political and other 
benefits, as well as possible financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
 * Funds from Madison Guaranty may have been improperly used to help pay off a 
personal loan of $50,000 that Clinton took out to help finance his 1984 
gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * Federal regulators in Washington, hoping to stifle the political fallout, 
interfered with the Madison investigation being conducted by the Kansas City 
office of the RTC, the agency charged with overseeing clean-up of the nation's 
multibillion-dollar S&L failures. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited the meeting between Breslaw and Lewis as evidence of high-level 
pressure on the investigation, though Lewis' notes said that Breslaw indicated 
her superiors in Washington were hoping for -- but not insisting on -- a 
finding that Whitewater did not benefit from Madison funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach himself acknowledged indirectly that his evidence does not directly tie 
Clinton to wrong-doing, saying that "on the landscape of political scandals" 
Whitewater may end up being only "a bump." 
</P>
<P>
 But he also asserted that deception and greed inherent in Whitewater "speaks 
mountains about the Me-Generation ethics" of the 1980s and in some ways should 
be condemned more than the so-called Keating Five scandal, to which he said it 
bore disturbing similarities. Five senators were investigated by the Senate 
Ethics Committee for allegedly helping Charles H. Keating, owner of failed 
Lincoln Savings & Loan, in return for campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a nutshell," Leach added, "Whitewater is about the arrogance of power." 
</P>
<P>
 Leach said that one of the Kansas City investigators whom he did not identify 
by name -- but who was understood from information provided by other sources to 
be Lewis -- later was "removed from the case" for refusing to abide by the "gag 
order" imposed on her by her superiors in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 She and several other investigators from the Kansas City office "courageously" 
resisted the attempts to deflect their Madison inquiry and "have sought 
whistle-blower protection rather than comply with the Washington . . . gag 
order," Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Leach's charge that Lewis, the RTC lead investigator on Madison Guaranty, 
was removed from the case, his documents included an E-mail computer message 
last Nov. 10 from Lewis to four other FTC officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey you!" the message opens. "Just a heads up to let you know that Mike 
Caron, Senior Criminal Investigator, is now the lead investigator on Madison . 
. . so any more faxes you send should come to Mike's attention, and any further 
communications about Madison should go to him, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Powers That Be have decided that I'm better off out of the line of fire 
(and I ain't arguing), but please let me assure you, that we are leaving you in 
very capable hands!" 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, on Nov. 15, 1993, Lewis was still sufficiently involved in 
the case to send a computer message to Lee O. Ausen, another RTC investigations 
official, urging that she be allowed to attend an upcoming meeting with a 
Justice Department attorney appointed to head the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Justice Department lawyer Donald) McKay is not coming here to look at 
records," she wrote. "Cut to the bottom line. He is coming here because he 
wants to be convinced that there either IS or IS NOT a very good case behind 
those referrals. . . . He's coming here to evaluate us, our work, and to try 
and decide just how good this case is, and how he can best deal with a very 
sensitive political situation . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "If this meeting is going to turn into a turkey shoot, then you are going to 
need every loaded gun you've got to assist you in convincing this special 
prosecutor that the case is as good as it looks on the surface. And yes, we 
have strong documentation to support the allegations. But what's beneath the 
surface, including where we looked and why, who's tied to who, who's in 
business with who, who got paid for what and where all the internal and 
external ties are, isn't in writing. It's in my head."

HAD NO DEALINGS WITH FAILED S&L, CLINTON SAYS; PRESIDENCY: HE DISTANCES HIMSELF 
FROM WHITEWATER MANAGEMENT. IN HIS DEFENSE, HE'LL RELEASE KEY TAX RETURNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, in a cool and confident defense of his conduct, declared 
Thursday that he had "nothing to do" with a failed Arkansas thrift institution 
or with the management of the Whitewater real estate venture that have 
bedeviled his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nationally televised press conference, Clinton said that today he will 
release his 1977, 1978 and 1979 tax returns to lay to rest questions about the 
Whitewater controversy, and he insisted that the matter has not interfered with 
his efforts to reform health care and enact anti-crime legislation and other 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people should know that I and my Administration will not be 
distracted," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton acknowledged that Whitewater has begun to erode his popularity among 
voters but said he was actually surprised that the effect has not been worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The press conference came amid a renewed White House effort to dispel 
accusations that the First Family was holding back information on the murky 
Whitewater events. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons are to leave today for a weeklong vacation in Texas and 
California, and the White House did not want to leave an impression that they 
were turning their back on the Whitewater questions that continue to boil up. 
With his further explanations, the President also hoped to offer more support 
for Democratic lawmakers who must face their constituents during the spring 
break that begins today. 
</P>
<P>
 In the one new detail, Clinton revised downward his estimate of the amount of 
money he lost in the venture to build vacation homes in the Ozarks. He said he 
now believes that he lost roughly $22,000 less than the $68,900 he has claimed 
for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton answered questions for 40 minutes in the East Room -- the majority of 
them on the Whitewater matter -- and made a clear effort to offer the broadest 
defense possible to continuing charges and disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 He disavowed any knowledge of the land venture's management, which he said was 
handled by his business partner, James B. McDougal. He declared he had no 
knowledge of any money from McDougal's Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan flowing 
into either his Arkansas political campaigns or the Whitewater business 
accounts -- two of the chief allegations that have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that he could shed no light on the continuing reports of abuses and 
deceptions, he said: "We didn't keep the books or records. We were essentially 
passive investors."  
</P>
<P>
 He said that when history judges Whitewater it will shrink to insignificance 
next to what he has accomplished in his first year in office. 
</P>
<P>
 The President looked at ease and smiled frequently, radiating an appearance 
intended to demonstrate his avowed confidence that the allegations will be 
shown to be baseless. 
</P>
<P>
 He also tried to forcefully deny allegations, raised again Thursday by Rep. 
Jim Leach (R-Iowa), that the Administration tried to keep federal officials 
from moving toward a criminal investigation of Madison Guaranty. "I have had 
absolutely nothing to do, and would have nothing to do with any attempt to 
influence an RTC regulatory matter," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach, ranking Republican on the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs 
Committee, released documents showing that an RTC official had met with a 
regional investigator in Kansas City on whether Whitewater could be found 
blameless in Madison Guaranty's losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that Leach had not made accusations about any political appointee 
of the Administration and asserted that Leach "may be talking about an internal 
dispute within the RTC from career Republican appointees, for all I know." He 
said the people involved were in government before his Democratic 
Administration arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton offered that he had overstated his earlier estimate of his 
losses from Whitewater Development Corp., he said that he does not think he 
will be found liable for additional federal income taxes. But he said that, if 
it is determined that he has a tax liability, he will pay it. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower figure for losses widens the gap between what Clinton invested and 
lost in Whitewater and what his supposedly equal partners, James and Susan 
McDougal, lost. The Clintons have estimated McDougal's loss at about $95,000; 
McDougal has said that he sunk more than $150,000 into the failed project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons have never explained why the McDougals took a far greater share 
of Whitewater's losses than the Clintons did, even though the two couples were 
supposed to be 50-50 partners in the deal's profits or losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that he changed his estimate of his Whitewater losses after 
discovering that $20,700 in payments he thought were made on Whitewater loans 
actually went to help buy a cabin for his mother, Virginia Kelley, and his 
stepfather. He said he was reminded of this when proofreading the manuscript of 
his late mother's autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed that she mentioned there something that I had genuinely forgotten, 
which is that I helped her to purchase the property and what was then a cabin 
on the place that she and her husband, Dick Kelley, lived back in 1981, and 
that I was a co-owner of that property with her for just a few months," Clinton 
said. "After they married, he bought my interest out." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he made an additional $1,500 payment for the Kelley property that 
he had earlier attributed to Whitewater losses. That sum has been subtracted 
from his previous estimate of losses from the land deal, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not explain how the change in his losses on Whitewater would affect his 
potential tax liability.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton bristled and rose to the defense of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
when asked whether the Whitewater affair had eroded his wife's moral authority 
to speak for the Administration on health care reform and other issues.  
</P>
<P>
 "People should not be able to raise questions and erode people's moral 
authority in this country. There ought to have to be evidence and proof," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in her 20 years of practicing law, her ethics and ability have 
never before been questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in the end, when all these questions get asked and answered, her 
moral authority will be stronger than it has ever been, because we will have 
gone through this process and been very forthcoming as we are to the special 
counsel," Clinton said. "And then at the end, people will compare how we did 
this with how previous administrations under fire handled their business. And I 
think it'll come out quite well." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said after the press conference that 
Clinton had been "credible" and had "helped himself" with his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he expected special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. to question both 
him and his wife about their investments, and he promised that they would 
"cooperate with him in any way he decides is appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also said he would cooperate with congressional hearings, and did not 
rule out the possibility that he would testify in Congress on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton conducted back-to-back news conferences two weeks ago, and Mrs. 
Clinton also has fielded questions on the matter this month, though her 
responses dealt with her feelings about the matter rather than details of the 
family's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton defended his initial investment in Whitewater as "perfectly honorable 
. . . perfectly legal." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that we did anything wrong in that at all, and I think we 
handled it in an appropriate way," the President said. "We were like a lot of 
people; we invested money and we lost." 
</P>
<P>
 And he staunchly defended his wife's role as a lawyer for the failed thrift 
when it was seeking state approval to sell preferred stock to shore up its 
shaky capital position. He cited a New York University law professor as calling 
Mrs. Clinton's representation of Madison Guaranty within the bounds of legal 
ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton noted that Mrs. Clinton took no money from her law firm for work done 
with the state of Arkansas, saying she "wanted to bend over backward to avoid 
the appearance of conflict" of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 On other topics, Clinton urged the Mexican people "to continue their strides 
toward economic reform and progress" despite the assassination of the ruling 
party's candidate for president. He said that the United States also would step 
in to help if there is a run on the Mexican currency, though he added his hope 
that such assistance would not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he intended to continue efforts to keep North Korea from 
developing a nuclear bomb. And he promised that he does not intend to give up 
his Administration's commitment to bring pressure to improve human rights in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that he would sign a health care bill this year, despite the 
difficulties reform has already encountered in the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton tried to stress what his Administration had already accomplished, from 
lower interest rates, to the creation of 2 million new jobs in his first year. 
He said that his budget contains three consecutive years of deficit reduction 
"for the first time since Harry Truman."

POWERFUL STORM BATTERS REGION, TRIGGERS SLIDES 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 A blustery arctic storm hammered Southern California with intense 
thundershowers Thursday night, unleashing mudslides below the fire-scarred 
hillsides of Malibu that blocked the coast highway and several canyon roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy snow fell in the mountains, stranding several dozen motorists on the 
Angeles Forest Highway and closing Interstate 5 in the Grapevine area. A 
scramble was on for the last available motel rooms in Gorman as it became 
increasingly likely that the state's principal north-south highway would remain 
closed until sometime this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thursday night commute was a stop-and-go nightmare on most Los Angeles 
freeways, which were clogged with traffic accidents and stalled cars. Despite 
heavy rains, roads through the Sepulveda flood basin remained open. 
</P>
<P>
 An unidentified man, believed to be in his early 40s, was killed about 5:15 
p.m. when his car spun out on rain-slicked La Tuna Canyon Road about a mile 
west of the Foothill Freeway, crossed the center line and triggered a four-car 
crash, city fire officials said. They said two other men and a woman -- drivers 
of the other cars involved -- suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Gale-force winds were reported in several areas, and strong gusts shorted out 
power lines in several areas of Los Angeles on Thursday, cutting electrical 
service to about 4,300 customers for varying lengths of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said a small tornado touched down briefly in Santa Barbara, 
flattening an outbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters predicted more severe thunderstorms -- with heavy downpours and 
scattered hail -- before the storm begins to ease sometime tonight.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be nasty," National Weather Service forecaster Debra Rominger 
said. "It's a pretty strong one." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said as much as three 
inches of rain is expected to fall in the coastal valleys and along the 
foothills before the storms move out to the east, probably sometime Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoren said there is a slight possibility of even more rain if the cold storm 
from the Gulf of Alaska hooks up with a broad band of moisture stretching from 
Hawaii to Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it doesn't look like that's going to happen, but it could," Thoren 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather service said the storm -- unusually cold for this time of year -- 
probably will drop between one and two feet of snow in the San Gabriel and San 
Bernardino mountains by Saturday night. The snow level in some of the northern 
ranges is expected to dip as low as 2,500 feet -- about the level of the 
Antelope Valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu -- where dozens of houses were invaded by mudslides in February 
after brush fires destroyed scores of homes and stripped hillsides of 
vegetation last fall -- rockslides blocked traffic on the Pacific Coast Highway 
and on at least four canyon roads leading inland Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the slides occurred between 5 and 6 p.m. as heavy rain, sometimes 
mixed with hail the size of jellybeans, reduced visibility to about 30 feet in 
some areas. A stream of runoff a foot deep coursed down Las Flores Canyon Road, 
disappearing into a storm drain at the coast highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain continued into the night and so did the rockslides. Caltrans crews 
said they were not sure when they would be able to reopen the PCH, Topanga 
Canyon Boulevard, Topanga Canyon Road, Big Rock Drive, Las Flores Canyon Road 
and Tuna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Malibu's residents stood watch over sandbag barriers in front of their 
homes Thursday night, guarding against the possibility of major slides like the 
ones that damaged homes there last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a long, long night and a long, long weekend," Kent Knudsen 
said as he sipped a mug of hot chocolate and gazed balefully at the continuing 
rain. His house on Pacific Coast Highway was one of those damaged during 
February's storms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get this trench cleaned out, along with the drain, and then I'll 
just do it all over again," he said. "I just want to keep the mud and water out 
of the house this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Because sheriff's deputies would not let traffic through on the PCH, Carole 
Smith and her 5-year-old son, Shane, had to walk about a mile home in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lovely night for a walk," she said with only a touch of sarcasm. "I 
thought about trying to bribe the sheriffs, but I decided not to." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Maurice, a spokeswoman for the city of Malibu, said the city had 
notified residents to prepare for the storm, but added: "We don't want them to 
have a false sense of security, because a fire or sheriff official probably 
will not come knocking on their door to tell them to get out. If they feel they 
are in danger, they probably are and should just get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Such warnings are old hat in Malibu, where most residents prefer to stick it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Spack, who lives midway up Big Rock Drive, was undaunted by the 
thrashing rain that hit by about 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're keeping our fingers crossed, but the city got all the drains in and did 
some hydro-seeding so I am feeling pretty safe about it," Spack said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pasadena Glen area -- another neighborhood where disastrous brush fires 
during the fall were followed my destructive mudslides in February -- an 
improved system of culverts and barricades appeared to be protecting homes from 
storm runoff Thursday night. The rainfall there was steady but not 
exceptionally heavy during much of the evening, and the streets were deserted 
as emergency crews retreated to warmer, drier quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Pasadena Glen's residents had left their homes Thursday afternoon 
rather than wait for what many feared would be a renewed onslaught of 
mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 Barriers were in place in the neighborhood -- many heavy, steel-braced wooden 
walls that county flood control crews had erected to divert the anticipated 
runoff from the homes and into newly paved flood-control channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Paul, a 65-year-old retiree who lives with his dog, Biff, in an 18-foot 
trailer on the lot where his house burned to the ground last fall, was one of 
the few who decided not to evacuate on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived up here for 37 years," Paul said. "It gets exciting at times. We 
get to see a lot of nature, only sometimes nature goes on a rampage."

2ND WILSON NOMINEE IS REJECTED; CAL STATE: SENATE TURNS DOWN ROSEMARY E. THAKAR 
FOR BOARD OF TRUSTEES, BUT APPROVES ANOTHER APPOINTEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The combative state Senate on Thursday handed Gov. Pete Wilson his second 
confirmation defeat in less than a month when it turned down one of his 
appointees to the California State University Board of Trustees, the first such 
rejection in Cal State's 34-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat of Rosemary E. Thakar followed the Senate's rejection March 3 of 
the Republican governor's appointment of Saratoga businessman Lester Lee to the 
University of California Board of Regents, the first time a regent nominee had 
been denied confirmation since 1883. He was the first Chinese American 
appointee to the UC board. 
</P>
<P>
 Thakar, a San Francisco furniture store owner and generous Wilson campaign 
contributor, needed 27 votes for confirmation, but she received only 10; most 
Democrats and conservative GOP senators refused to vote, thus assuring her 
defeat. Six bipartisan votes were cast against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative and Cal State records showed Thakar to be the first trustee 
confirmation to be defeated by a vote of the full Senate since the 
administrative system was created in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, virtually the same Senate coalition confirmed a second 
Wilson appointee, Joan Otomo-Corgel, a UCLA dentistry professor, to an 
eight-year term on a 31-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Wilson said the governor was deeply disappointed by Thakar's 
rejection and blamed it on "a lot of bizarre things at work here." 
</P>
<P>
 Thakar issued an angry statement, accusing the Senate of abusing its power and 
refusing to confirm her because she backed her son, attorney Todd Thakar, in 
his unsuccessful 1992 primary challenge against conservative state Sen. John 
Lewis (R-Orange). 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident that I would have been confirmed today had I not supported my 
son, who had the temerity to challenge a sitting legislator in a contested 
primary election," Thakar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who had privately encouraged fellow conservative Republicans to break 
with Wilson and defeat Thakar's confirmation, told a reporter that "there are 
some political overtones to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' Senate floor seat mate, Sen. Frank Hill (R-Whittier), said Republican 
legislators had called on Wilson to use his influence to discourage Todd Thakar 
from running against Lewis, but the effort failed. "Lewis is mad at the kid," 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the leadership of new President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), the 
usually collegial Democratic-controlled Senate has sought to break from what 
Lockyer calls a "rubber stamp" approach to approving gubernatorial nominees to 
the UC Board of Regents and the Cal State Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), a candidate for governor, 
appears to have become more persuasive in his arguments that such nominees need 
to be evaluated more critically. Hayden says the UC regents and Cal State 
trustees are pawns for university administrators who reward themselves with 
higher salaries and other perks as student fees continue to increase 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited Thakar and Otomo-Corgel as examples. He said that as unconfirmed 
trustees last year, they had voted fee increases of 24% and 30% for 
undergraduate and graduate students, respectively, and had endorsed $200,000 
worth of salary increases for campus presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden charged that Thakar's long association with Wilson was the political 
reason for her appointment and challenged whether as a trustee she was 
independent from the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden also charged that when Thakar first asked Wilson for an appointment, 
she displayed no interest in a trusteeship. Hayden said she asked for an 
appointment to the state Commission on Tourism or as a state protocol officer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, who defended both nominees, 
scolded opponents for engaging in what he characterized as political hypocrisy. 
He recalled that two-thirds of the Senate during the last few years had 
ratified the student fee increases when the Legislature enacted the state 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hayden assailed Otomo-Corgel for supporting fee increases, he also 
said he had spoken with her shortly before the Senate debate and believes she 
has undergone an abrupt philosophical conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said Otomo-Corgel promised him that in the future she would fight 
against student fee increases and higher pay and perks for university 
administrators. He termed her a "born-again fighter for students." 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes after the Senate confirmed her, Hayden bolted from the Senate 
chamber and returned with Otomo-Corgel. In an unexpected twist, he interrupted 
proceedings to introduce her to the senators. They hugged briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 After Lee's rejection March 3, Senate Democrats drew fire from the Asian 
American community, including its news media. Alerted that Otomo-Corgel was 
facing the same fate, some of these supporters came to her defense in the last 
two days, lobbying their senators with letters and telephone calls.

PROSECUTORS RELEASE DEPUTY'S ACCOUNT OF FATAL SHOOTING; LAW ENFORCEMENT: IN AN 
EFFORT TO CLEAR LINGERING PUBLIC DOUBTS ABOUT THE HANDLING OF THE CASE, BRIAN 
SCANLAN'S DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS LEADING TO HIS COLLEAGUE'S DEATH DURING A 
TRAINING EXERCISE IS REVEALED.

 For all the candlelight vigils, all the protests, all the legal maneuverings 
that have followed the shooting death of Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Darryn 
Leroy Robins three months ago, one element has remained absent from the public 
debate: the account of the veteran field training officer who shot Robins to 
death outside a Lake Forest movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But that piece of the puzzle emerged this week as Orange County prosecutors, 
hit by charges that they had not pursued the case aggressively enough, released 
virtually all their evidence on the shooting, two weeks after a grand jury 
rejected their recommendation and decided not to indict Brian Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Scanlan's interview with authorities just hours after the shooting -- 
describing the lull of a Christmas morning, the emotional rush of getting ready 
for a mock confrontation with a Los Angeles gang member and the shock of seeing 
his colleague spitting blood like "a hose" -- that fills in many of the missing 
details in the case for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan said he was not expecting any trouble as he prepared to pull over his 
training partner for an impromptu drill behind the theater that Saturday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months earlier, Scanlan said, he had learned that he needed to work on 
keeping his finger off the trigger of his service weapon. During video 
exercises at the so-called "laser village" at the Sheriff's Department's 
training academy, he had mistakenly "shot" two people. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Scanlan acknowledged, he was feeling "cocky" as he prepared to run 
through the drill, anxious to show that he could meet any challenge his partner 
threw at him.  
</P>
<P>
 He and fellow deputy Robins were developing ways to counteract new techniques 
that Los Angeles gang members had been using to get the drop on cops. Scanlan 
said he figured that if the gangbangers were up to new tricks, "I want to 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 Robins, playing the role of a suspect in a car stop, was going to show him 
something new. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, the nine-year veteran approached Robins' car with his loaded 
9-millimeter handgun drawn. Robins started talking back to him, demanding to 
know why he was stopped. Robins' hands were jittery, "going all over the 
place," as he handed over a white piece of paper marked "CDL," meant to 
represent a California driver's license, Scanlan recounted. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, supposedly responding to a request for his vehicle registration papers, 
Robins reached up behind the driver's side sun visor and produced an unloaded 
.25-caliber handgun, thrusting it out the window, Scanlan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Startled, Scanlan "jerked back," he said, and fired a single Talon bullet into 
his colleague's face. Half an hour later, Robins was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan's gripping yet strikingly unemotional narrative of what took place 
behind the theater is the keystone of two months of interviews, forensic 
reports, videotapes, photographs and other evidence released to the news media 
Wednesday by the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The volatile shooting case has attracted considerable attention, fueled in 
part by charges from black and Latino groups that the case was not handled 
properly by authorities because the dead deputy was black and the one who shot 
him is white. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite heightened racial sensitivities, many details of the case remained 
the subject of speculation and off-the-record comments -- until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said prosecutors took the unusual step of 
releasing almost everything in their investigative files in hopes of dispelling 
lingering suspicions that the shooting was not accidental -- or that Robins' 
race was somehow a factor in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors refused, however, to allow copying or television broadcasting of 
any of the key videotapes in the case. And even as they allowed reporters to 
view the tapes in a crowded Santa Ana office, they edited out certain key 
scenes -- such as the one showing Robins' fellow deputies frantically carrying 
him from a patrol car into the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the newly released evidence provides for the first time a 
detailed chronology of the day's events. And it is Scanlan's 90-minute account, 
given to investigators just hours after the shooting, that authorities say has 
become the most authoritative version. 
</P>
<P>
 In more than 40 interviews after the shooting, "nobody's contradicted 
anything" that Scanlan related, Conley said. "All the other little details 
fit."

IN KEY ENDORSEMENT, MOLINA PLEDGES TO SUPPORT GARAMENDI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's underdog campaign for governor 
won a big boost Thursday when he captured the endorsement of Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Gloria Molina, the state's most prominent Latino politician. 
</P>
<P>
 With a beaming Garamendi at her side, Molina wrapped her populist mantle 
around him and asserted that the Democrat shared her concerns about the 
economy, health care, the financing of county government programs and 
government accountability. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has never been considered a political insider or a good old boy of 
back-room politics; instead he has steered clear of politics as usual," Molina 
said at the announcement, which was held at the county Hall of Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The endorsement by Molina -- the most important one among Latino politicians 
and, perhaps, from any elected official in Southern California -- represented 
something of a perceptual oddity: a Latino woman known for fighting and 
scraping her way against the status quo dispenses her political largess on a 
white man who has spent 20 years as a stalwart of the political system. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this year's Democratic primary, it is Garamendi who is the long shot, 
lagging behind state Treasurer Kathleen Brown in the polls and in fund raising. 
And Molina was clearly sympathetic, alluding repeatedly to the tough road ahead 
for Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so accustomed to campaigns of this type when you run against the power, 
the money, all of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With enough hard work, this campaign can in fact be a winner in June." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, who on Thursday spent nearly as much time extolling Molina's 
virtues as she did his, was clearly elated about the supervisor's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say that I'm thrilled, delighted, excited, ecstatic, really underplays the 
emotions that I have today as I accept this endorsement, as I embrace it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to Molina's endorsement, Brown campaign spokesman Michael Reese 
issued a statement pointedly noting that several Latino officials are 
supporting Brown -- the best known of them Assemblyman Richard Polanco of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "After her victory in the June primary, Kathleen Brown looks forward to 
working closely with Gloria Molina to beat Pete Wilson in November," Reese 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Garamendi was hopeful that Molina's move would help maintain the 
momentum he has developed in recent days. Most promisingly for Garamendi, his 
mini-surge has occurred at the same time that Brown's campaign hit a rough 
patch. 
</P>
<P>
 Little more than a week ago, Brown hired a new campaign manager, Clint Reilly, 
and then saw her old campaign manager, her issues director and her media 
adviser depart. The only Brown hand with more than a few months familiarity 
with her -- press secretary Reese -- was simultaneously sidelined by his 
brother's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, Garamendi succeeded in his struggle to deny Brown her expected 
endorsement by the California Teachers Assn. Although Brown won the support of 
more CTA delegates than Garamendi, she did not receive the 60% necessary for 
the organization's formal endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has also battled public concerns about the direction of her campaign, 
and to some extent Molina's endorsement reflected the disdain some Latino 
leaders feel for the treasurer's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina went out of her way to avoid directly criticizing Brown, who as of late 
yesterday pleaded with the supervisor to reconsider her endorsement. But in 
praising Garamendi's position on illegal immigration, Molina referred 
indirectly to concerns within the Latino community about Brown's more 
conservative stands on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am pleased with the positions that John has taken, the kind of leadership 
role that he's demonstrated to bring sensible and reasonable solutions to the 
issue of immigration," she said, adding that he was "not just running off 
making statements from time to time as some of the others have." 
</P>
<P>
 Molina's endorsement is coveted in political circles because of her links to a 
variety of voter bases. In addition to her strong support in the Latino 
community, the supervisor is popular among women and has carved out an image as 
the area's premier populist politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Martinez, executive director of the nonpartisan Southwest Voter 
Registration Education Project, called Molina's move "a shot across Kathleen 
Brown's bow." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, he said, "has to run in this instance like a minority candidate -- 
why not replicate what wins with minority candidates?" 
</P>
<P>
 In another effort to gain ground on Brown, Garamendi renewed his assault 
Thursday on the airwaves. One television advertisement that has already run for 
weeks -- a biographical introduction to Garamendi -- is back on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 A new advertisement that seeks to further define him also began its run 
Thursday -- and ironically, it uses as a central device the now-ubiquitous 
800-number made famous by Brown's brother, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., in his 
1992 campaign for President. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ad, Garamendi refers to his "work days," in which he takes on the job 
of a typical Californian for part of a day. He touts his 800-number, on which 
callers can find a message from Garamendi on the issue of the moment -- this 
week, it's crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In closing, he characterizes himself as "for workfare, not welfare" and 
supportive of a "crackdown" on illegal immigration. He also calls himself "the 
only Democrat who will stand up for the death penalty" -- a swipe at Brown. The 
treasurer has said that although she personally opposes the death penalty, she 
would carry it out as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's campaign manager, Darry Sragow, said the ad's line about illegal 
immigration does not violate the candidate's pledge not to politicize the 
racially sensitive issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is shorthand for being tough on the problem," he said. "But that's 
different from being inhuman to the people."

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / ALAN C. MILLER: FOR A FRESHMAN, A FEW HARD LESSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Howard P. (Buck) McKeon was one of many who ran for Congress two years ago as 
an outsider -- pledging to trim the pork, transform politics as usual and 
reform an institution whose members are all too preoccupied with 
self-perpetuation. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, drawing on his history as co-owner of a chain of Western 
clothing stores, former bank chairman and mayor of Santa Clarita, he even 
fashioned himself as a kind of low-level Republican Ross Perot in cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen months into his first term, McKeon still espouses such lofty aims. But 
the long, lean Californian has learned some hard lessons about why they're so 
difficult to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year has been the biggest learning year of my life, other than the year 
I learned to walk and talk," McKeon said during a recent reflective session.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lesson No. 1: Bringing home the bacon doesn't necessarily make it pork. 
</P>
<P>
 Belying his aw-shucks, down-home manner, McKeon has shrewdly pursued his 
goals. He was elected Republican freshman class president. And he gained a slot 
on the Public Works and Transportation Committee -- renowned as a source of 
largess for local highway, airport and water projects. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon has made winning federal funds to upgrade freeways in his district a 
priority. Asked how this differed from pork-barrel spending, he pulled out a 
"Porkbusters' Manual" by a group seeking to eliminate government waste. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the no-nos -- such as goodies of dubious value inserted in 
spending bills behind closed doors -- McKeon said he would seek money for 
projects with broad regional impact on their merits through the normal 
legislative process. He said the projects "have real significance for our 
district but meet these criteria. So they wouldn't be called pork." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lesson No. 2: Be careful what you promise on the hustings -- it may come back 
to haunt. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon declared during his maiden campaign that he opposed the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. He later said he knew little about NAFTA at the time but 
had been told by a businessman that it would cost the district jobs. As the 
issue heated up last fall, McKeon stuck to his guns until shortly before he 
cast his vote -- for the controversial treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, he said, he saw the merits of the pact: NAFTA would create more 
jobs than it would cost and would help combat illegal immigration. But, as the 
Clinton Administration desperately scrambled for votes, McKeon also got 
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena on the horn to make a pitch for some of 
those highway funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Back home, Perot's vociferous backers, who thought they had a commitment from 
McKeon to vote against the treaty, hit the roof. Some even cried: "Treason!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not a politician," McKeon recalled, perhaps giving himself too little 
-- or too much -- credit. "I did not understand that if you made a statement 
you were bound (until) your death." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lesson No. 3: When in doubt, vote the district, veto the principle. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon recently found himself in a quandary after the Northridge earthquake. 
As Congressman Epicenter, he had as much at stake as any legislator when the 
Administration's massive $8.6-billion relief package galloped through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman's dilemma arose when fellow fiscal conservatives -- trying to 
prevent additional deficit spending -- pushed broad budget cuts in other 
programs to offset the emergency aid. McKeon, a frequent critic of profligate 
spending, had already supported such a principle when a similar measure was 
passed for the Midwest floods last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, McKeon heeded the warning of a veteran Democrat from a 
neighboring district who argued that such a process would spark a protracted 
congressional debate over which programs to cut. This, in turn, might delay the 
urgently needed quake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon cast his ballot against two packages of cuts -- one of which lost by 
only four votes. And he worked to persuade GOP colleagues to shoot down the 
reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to vote for the country, but we really have to represent our 
district," McKeon said. "I have to be there fighting for (my constituents) 
because that's my obligation." 
</P>
<P>
 So he voted to boost a deficit he had vowed to reduce. But McKeon, a little 
older and more than a little wiser, still holds the majority Democrats 
primarily responsible for refusing to rein in spending and shrink government. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he cites one other lesson: "I've learned it's a lot easier to talk 
about than it is to do."

ASYLUM OKD ON BASIS OF HOMOSEXUALITY; IMMIGRATION: GAY MAN SAID HE WOULD BE 
PERSECUTED IF RETURNED TO MEXICO. EXPERTS SAY INS RULING IS A FIRST.

 In what appears to be a precedent-setting case, the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service has granted asylum to a gay Mexican who said his sexual 
orientation subjected him to persecution in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Garcia won his bid to remain in the United States earlier this week after 
telling immigration authorities that he was ostracized by fellow citizens and 
harassed, beaten and raped by Mexican police because he is gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who is using a pseudonym to protect his privacy, also presented 
evidence linking members of the Mexican police and military to assassinations 
of homosexuals, and said he feared retaliation if he was sent home because he 
is a visible AIDS education activist in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Under U.S. immigration law, asylum is granted only if an applicant can prove 
"a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, 
political opinion or membership in a particular social group." 
</P>
<P>
 INS officials said Garcia's case appears to mark the first time their agency 
has acknowledged that a homosexual may belong to a persecuted social group that 
deserves asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, an immigration judge in San Francisco granted asylum to a gay 
Brazilian man who was being deported by the INS. The judge acted after hearing 
evidence of pervasive anti-gay violence in Brazil, including the testimony of a 
prominent anthropologist who estimated that a Brazilian homosexual is killed 
every five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the Garcia decision is different because it marks the first time 
the INS has granted a petition based on sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have the agency itself make this finding is an important precedent," said 
Charles Wheeler, directing attorney of the National Immigration Law Center in 
Los Angeles. "In the past, membership in a social group has been a very 
difficult category to prove." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Silberstein, Garcia's San Francisco attorney, agreed: "Lawyers have been 
arguing for this for a long time. It's nice to see the Immigration Service 
agree with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for gay and lesbian rights hailed the decision as a breakthrough. In 
Los Angeles, leaders of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund expressed 
hope that Garcia's success would help three applicants -- a Russian lesbian and 
two gay men from Iran and Nicaragua -- they are aiding with asylum petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This nation has always been a beacon of hope for those who are persecuted in 
their homelands," said J Craig Fong, Lambda western regional director. "It is 
gratifying to now see the U.S. offer safe harbor for those persecuted for their 
sexual orientation." 
</P>
<P>
 INS officials, however, cautioned that Garcia's victory is no guarantee for 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not mean by any stretch of the imagination that anyone who is gay in 
Mexico has a valid case for asylum in the U.S.," said Duke Austin, an INS 
spokesman in Washington. "The facts in this case simply convinced the officer 
that asylum was warranted." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who is in his mid-30s, came to the United States 12 years ago after 
what he called a life of unspeakable degradations in Mexico. Taunted and 
humiliated by his countrymen, he said he was also arrested for patronizing gay 
bars, jailed for crimes he did not commit, beaten and, on one occasion, raped 
by a Mexico City policeman while in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no one to turn to," Garcia said at a news conference Thursday. "When I 
heard that being gay in the United States was tolerated and even accepted in 
some areas, I had only one desire: to flee Mexico for the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's asylum bid was aided by evidence supplied by the International Gay 
and Lesbian Human Rights Commission. The commission described rampant 
intolerance in Mexico and said police and government officials have obstructed 
the investigation of a series of assassinations of transvestites in Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican government officials defended their country's treatment of gays and 
lesbians and called Garcia's portrayal of life there inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We respect the human rights of anyone without consideration of sexual 
orientation," said Daphne Roemer, spokeswoman for the Consul General of Mexico 
in San Francisco. If Garcia had brought his concerns to Mexico's human rights 
commission, she added, he would have learned that "we're very concerned about 
these issues."

ASIA MINOR; FISCAL WOES, ETHNIC CONFLICTS UNDERSCORE TURKISH ELECTIONS; 
SUNDAY'S MUNICIPAL VOTE AMOUNTS TO A NATIONAL REFERENDUM ON THE STRUGGLING 
GOVERNMENT OF PRIME MINISTER TANSU CILLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At a bank branch along the windy Bosphorus, manager Sema Ozturk has devised a 
practical response to the high-turnover tumult of Turkey's seesaw currency 
market. Never mind the vault: She keeps a cash box full of foreign currency 
under her desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The head office is bringing in currency by the planeload. It goes out just as 
fast," she said. "Nobody wants Turkish lira. Today we had one customer take 
away $500,000 in dollar bills inside his briefcase." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, as many as 200 customers a day frequent Ismail Yucelsin's 
storefront currency-exchange shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even schoolchildren are buying dollars with their pocket money. Who has 
confidence in the lira?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 An almost universal lack of confidence in government fiscal policies 
underlines the preeminence of pocketbook issues in preparation for Sunday's 
municipal elections in every city, town and village across this nation of 60 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Local issues and personalities will also weigh heavily. So will a growing 
polarization between Turks and ethnic Kurds in an election that amounts to a 
national referendum on the young, struggling government of Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller. A four-party stalemate seems the most likely outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we will see more of the same after the election and a situation that 
will therefore become more dangerous," said commentator Cengiz Candar. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months after taking office, the 47-year-old Ciller, Turkey's first female 
prime minister, is an economist buffeted by national economic alarm. Recession 
looms. After a decade of strong 5% annual growth and rapid modernization, 
production is slowing. The unloved lira has lost 70% in value against the 
dollar since January. Inflation may hit triple digits this year. Every Turk is 
a millionaire, but two new purple 500,000 lira notes are worth about $40, 
compared to $1,000 six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Massive rejection Sunday of her conservative True Path Party could cost Ciller 
her job and might force forward parliamentary elections scheduled for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls, though, say True Path, which won power in 1991, will finish respectably 
this time. Its candidate in Istanbul, former Mayor Bedrettin Dalan, is running 
neck-and-neck with Zulfu Livaneli, a movie director making his political debut 
as a candidate of the center-left Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Social Democrats and the True Path are coalition partners in national 
government in Ankara, but there and in other major cities their competing 
mayoral candidates face stiff challenges. The center-right Motherland Party, 
which directed '80s modernization under the late Turgut Ozal, and the Welfare 
Party, an Islamic movement with a fundamentalist fringe, should profit from the 
government discomfiture. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics score Ciller's inexperience and lack of decisiveness on bringing 
government spending under control. They also fault her for not enacting a 
broadly approved privatization program whose receipts might have helped balance 
the government's books. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the votes are counted, analysts believe, the headstrong armed forces will 
launch a major campaign against Kurdish separatist guerrillas. By some 
published accounts, at least 350,000 troops are massed in the southeast, where 
brutal anti-insurgency policies have brought international condemnation of 
Turkey for human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciller's opponents charge that she has abdicated authority to the generals in 
confronting unrest among Turkey's 12 million Kurds. The United States and 
Turkey's European allies support the drive against terrorism, but they urge 
that underlying issues of Kurdish cultural and ethnic aspirations be addressed 
on political and social levels. So far there has been no sign of that. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as expected, the election delivers no strong mandate to Ciller -- or fails 
to reinforce her opponents' calls for change -- Turkey may drift closer to 
stormy seas.

LATIN AMERICA; U.S. EMBASSY SMARTING IN BOLIVIA STING OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Embassy in Bolivia participated in a sting operation aimed at proving 
that the president of the Bolivian Supreme Court was soliciting a bribe from a 
U.S. citizen. The court's president and another justice are now on trial in the 
Senate, and the embassy is on trial in the press. 
</P>
<P>
 The case offers a telling taste of Bolivian politics, a murky stew that often 
smacks of back-room deals, corruption and U.S. intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Supreme Court President Edgar Oblitas and Justice Ernesto Poppe are suspended 
from the court pending the outcome of their Senate trial. The U.S. Embassy is 
trying to keep a low profile, but its name keeps popping up in the proceedings 
and press coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In statements to the press, Oblitas has accused the embassy of trying to 
destroy the current Supreme Court and replace it with one that would be 
submissive to U.S. wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a confidential letter to the Bolivian Foreign Ministry that leaked out to 
newspapers, the embassy said it does not wish to involve itself in Bolivia's 
internal affairs or influence judicial processes, but "wants only what all 
Bolivians want: a system of justice that is honest and impartial." 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began in January, 1993, when the government of Nicaragua requested 
the extradition of Jose Antonio Ibarra, a former Nicaraguan vice minister under 
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. Ibarra, wanted on charges of 
embezzlement, was then teaching university courses in the Bolivian city of 
Cochabamba. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibarra has testified that he received a request in the name of Poppe for 
$5,000 to settle the extradition case in Ibarra's favor. He told U.S. officials 
of the request, asking for help because he has U.S. as well as Nicaraguan 
citizenship. David Dlouy, the No. 2 U.S. diplomat in Bolivia, reported the 
request to Oblitas in June. Oblitas took no official action. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Ibarra told U.S. officials of a $15,000 bribe request from 
former Supreme Court Justice Hugo Galindo in Oblitas' name. U.S. and Bolivian 
officials decided to try to trap Galindo in a sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration installed a camera in Ibarra's 
Cochabamba home before Galindo visited him on Sept. 30, and the hidden camera 
recorded Ibarra handing Galindo $1,000 in marked bills as a "down payment." On 
Oct. 4, the Supreme Court rejected the extradition request. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities filed charges against Oblitas and Poppe that same month, and the 
lower house of Congress sent the case to the Senate for trial in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Oblitas' defense attorney, Juan Carlos Lazcano, said there is no evidence 
directly linking the Supreme Court president to any bribe requests. Independent 
analysts observe, however, that the Senate will not necessarily be bound by 
legal rules of evidence in what is essentially a political trial.  
</P>
<P>
 One of Lazcano's tactics apparently is to win support from nationalist 
politicians who oppose a presidential plan to privatize government enterprises. 
Lazcano said the government wants to remove Oblitas because he opposes 
privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 Another tactic appears aimed at arousing indignation over U.S. intervention. 
Lazcano said the U.S. Embassy wants Oblitas out because he has led the court in 
blocking the extradition of Bolivians wanted in the United States for drug 
trafficking. Setting the Trap 
</P>
<P>
 The events leading up to the sting operation that ensnared two Bolivian 
Supreme Court justices: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Nicaragua asks Bolivia to extradite former Vice Minister Jose Antonio 
Ibarra to face embezzlement charges. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Ibarra informs U.S. officials that he received a request in the name of 
Supreme Court Justice Ernesto Poppe for $5,000 to prevent the extradition 
(Ibarra has U.S citizenship). 
</P>
<P>
 3. American diplomat in Bolivia reports the alleged request to Bolivia's 
president, who takes no official action. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Ibarra tells U.S. officials of a second, $15,000 bribe request from former 
Supreme Court Justice Hugo Galindo in the Supreme Court president's name. 
</P>
<P>
 5. U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration installs video camera in Ibarra's 
home. Camera records Ibarra allegedly handing Galindo $1,000 in marked bills as 
a "down payment."

LEBANON SEIZES FACTION'S WEAPONS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lebanese security forces continued their crackdown Thursday on a Christian 
group accused of a deadly church bombing last month amid a news blackout 
ordered by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Troops stormed a Lebanese Forces office in Breij, 25 miles north of Beirut in 
the mountains that once formed the heartland of the onetime militia's war-time 
territory.The raid netted 300 U.S.-made M-16 assault rifles, 20 
rocket-propelled grenade launchers, 20 machine guns and three truckloads of 
ammunition, all removed from an LF office. A raid on a second office in 
Christian east Beirut uncovered a cache of rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanese army checkpoints have been erected in Christian areas since the Feb. 
27 church bombing in the Christian suburb of Jounieh, in which 10 people died. 
More explosive devices have since been found in rubbish bins, schools and other 
buildings, including the British Embassy -- all in Christian areas -- spreading 
fear among the population. All were dismantled by army experts.

30 WOUNDED IN PROTEST OF HEBRON SIEGE; MIDEAST: PALESTINIANS RIOT OVER ISRAELI 
USE OF FIREPOWER AGAINST MILITANTS IN DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fierce clashes spread through the Israeli-occupied territories Thursday as 
soldiers shot and wounded at least 30 Palestinians protesting the Israeli 
military's fiery two-day siege in the West Bank town of Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel Radio announced that two Israeli soldiers and three civilians were 
slightly wounded in the rioting and street fights that left more than two dozen 
Palestinians hospitalized throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest round of violence was triggered by a massive Israeli military 
operation in which 1,500 soldiers fired more than 100 antitank missiles and 
thousands of rounds of ammunition into a house in Hebron, where four men the 
army called leaders of an armed Palestinian fundamentalist faction were holed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-hour siege, in which a pregnant Palestinian woman was killed in the 
cross-fire, ended Wednesday evening. Israel's military censors had blocked news 
of the battle until Chief of Staff Gen. Ehud Barak announced it at a hearing of 
the government commission investigating last month's massacre of about 30 
Palestinians in a mosque by an Israeli settler. 
</P>
<P>
 Barak said all four militants were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The residential neighborhood of Hebron where the fighting took place, less 
than a mile from the site of the mosque where the Feb. 25 massacre occurred, 
was still sealed off by Israeli soldiers Thursday. A bulldozer finished 
leveling the three-story building where the Palestinians were thought to have 
been sheltered. Crews began sifting the rubble for bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered Palestinians and some Israelis criticized the military for using so 
much firepower in a densely settled neighborhood. Military leaders, however, 
continued to hail the Hebron operation as a key victory over armed Palestinian 
groups that publicly have vowed revenge for the massacre at Hebron's Cave of 
the Patriarchs, which Jews and Muslims believe is the burial site of the 
prophet Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Danny Yatom, the military commander of the West Bank, said the army 
was justified in using "all our powers to ensure (terrorist) cells are wiped 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the criticism focused on timing. The army launched the operation just 
as delegates from Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization were 
convening in Cairo to try to restart talks that could finalize a long-delayed 
agreement for limited Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank town of Jericho and 
the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO had suspended those negotiations when Brooklyn-born physician Baruch 
Goldstein, a Jewish settler who lived near Hebron, opened fire in the mosque at 
praying Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Israel Radio, the government's left-leaning 
Communications Minister Shulamit Aloni roundly condemned the siege. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a mistake," she said. "Even if they got four terrorists, is 
this how the best army in the Middle East does catch four terrorists? . . . If 
Israel wants to push the peace process forward, we have to get it into our 
heads once and for all that, in our relations with the Palestinians, we are not 
the victims. We are the rulers. We are the occupiers." 
</P>
<P>
 There was little optimism for the Cairo talks here after the siege. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this stage, we have not reached an agreement on any of the subjects," 
Israel's chief negotiator, Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak, told Israel Radio in an 
afternoon interview. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the list are PLO demands for an armed international observer 
force and a contingent of Palestinian police in Hebron, where more than 120,000 
Arabs have been under military curfew for almost a month to protect 415 Jewish 
settlers from retaliation.

ADMINISTRATION ASSESSING HARD LESSONS OF SOMALIA; MILITARY: CLINTON ABOUT TO 
APPROVE NEW LIST OF RULES DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE U.S. RISK IN FORAYS INTO 
PEACEKEEPING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the last U.S. troops leave Mogadishu today, the Clinton Administration is 
still absorbing the hard lessons of its bitter experience in Somalia -- and 
still trying to persuade a skeptical Congress that the United States should 
play a major role in international peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the bloody nose he got in Somalia, President Clinton has not abandoned 
the idea of sending U.S. troops to police trouble spots overseas. Instead, he 
is about to approve a new list of rules designed to make U.S. forays into 
peacekeeping as low-risk as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peacekeeping . . . is rooted in American interests," Clinton's national 
security adviser, Anthony Lake, said in an interview Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 The most important lesson of Somalia, said Lake, is not that the United States 
should refuse to intervene in foreign conflicts -- but that the Administration 
should set clear and achievable goals, state them clearly to Congress and the 
public and know how to get out if things go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The new guidelines, contained in a document called "Presidential Decision 
Directive 13," are likely to face an early test as diplomats work toward a 
settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina that could require as many as 25,000 U.S. 
ground troops to serve as peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 How the Administration will act when it faces that moment in Bosnia still is 
uncertain. "In Somalia, this Administration encountered a firestorm -- and it's 
still feeling burned," said Arnold Kanter, an undersecretary of state in the 
George Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lake and other officials said there is more public support for U.N. 
peacekeeping operations than many members of Congress realize. Inside the White 
House, Lake has been talking up a University of Maryland poll that shows a 
surprisingly large 49% supporting U.S. participation in most U.N. forces -- and 
another 42% supporting it in cases where U.S. interests are directly involved. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bosnia, Lake said, "I think it would still require a real effort to 
convince many members of Congress but . . . I can sense a real openness to the 
arguments that was not there" last year. 
</P>
<P>
 William J. Durch, a strategist at Washington's Henry L. Stimson Center, a 
defense-oriented research organization, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that (Somalia) soured us on peacekeeping as much as it sobered 
us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Directive 13's provisions: 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. troops will only participate in U.N. peacekeeping operations in cases 
where there is a serious threat or breach of international security. Even then, 
the deployment must serve U.S. national interests. And all warring factions 
must have signed a peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 * The troops must be part of a multinational force, with a deployment order 
that provides a clear view of what the objectives of the mission are, how long 
it will last and what criteria the Administration will use to decide when to 
bring its forces home. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. peacekeeping troops normally will serve in jobs for which Americans 
have special qualifications -- providing air power or operating high-tech radar 
and communications equipment, for example -- rather than front-line ground 
patrols, which might be riskier. 
</P>
<P>
 * Except for a few limited circumstances, all U.S. forces will be under U.S. 
command -- not under the command of foreign generals or admirals. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Administration will work now more closely with Congress on peacekeeping 
operations, notifying lawmakers before deploying U.S. troops in the first place 
and keeping key House and Senate committees up to date on how the venture is 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 The limits contained in the directive constitute a conspicuous retreat from 
the dream that the Administration had only a year ago for a permanent, U.N.-led 
multilateral rapid-reaction force to keep the peace and support 
"nation-building" in the post-Cold War world.

2 SOMALI WARLORDS AGREE TO CEASE-FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after the United Nations announced that it was giving up on peace talks 
for Somalia, the country's two most powerful warlords agreed Thursday to 
arrange a cease-fire and set up a new government. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agreement between Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed does 
not ensure stability.Previous agreements have quickly fallen apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest came only after the United Nations, exasperated by the failure of 
two weeks of talks in the Kenyan capital, said it would stop paying food and 
hotel costs for the negotiators from Somalia's 15 rival factions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton praised the accord: "Because of their 
courageous efforts, Somalia can now build its own future, a step it made in the 
right direction today with the accord between the leaders of the two largest 
factions in that country."

JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA SEEK TO END MISTRUST; ASIA: BOTH LOOK OVER THEIR SHOULDERS 
AT AN INTRANSIGENT NORTH KOREA. HOSOKAWA SAYS JAPAN WILL NOT DEVELOP NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a looming threat to both countries from North Korea's potential 
development of nuclear weapons, Japan and South Korea on Thursday focused their 
principal attention on removing mistrust and bitterness from their own 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion was a visit by President Kim Young Sam, who arrived for a 
three-day stay before going on to China. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of continuing Korean mistrust of Japan after a 1910-45 Japanese 
colonial rule, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa offered Kim an unsolicited 
assurance that, even if Communist North Korea armed itself with nuclear 
weapons, Japan, as the only nation to suffer nuclear attacks, would never 
follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Emperor Akihito, at a black-tie banquet for Kim and his wife at the Imperial 
Palace, added an apology for "the numerous immense sufferings . . . which my 
country inflicted . . . on the people of the Korean Peninsula" during Japanese 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have expressed my deep sadness over this fact some years ago, and my 
feelings have not changed," the emperor added in an unusually long toast. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first time an emperor had apologized without diplomatic 
negotiations in advance. Hosokawa's nuclear demurral was his second. He made a 
similar statement when he visited Washington in February. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea, in an apparent bid to justify its suspected nuclear development, 
has pointed repeatedly to Japan's use of plutonium in its nuclear power plants 
as "proof" that Japan ultimately will develop nuclear weaponry. Plutonium can 
be used to make a nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Nov. 10, just four days after a meeting in South Korea with Hosokawa, Kim 
declared in an interview with The Times that he feared that Japan would go 
nuclear if North Korea did. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim responded to the emperor with a mild admonition that Japan must "squarely 
face the past just as it happened and earnestly learn its lessons." But once 
that is done, South Korea and Japan can "enter a new era of strong neighborly 
ties. . . . We must not let our past shackle our future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech he delivered today before Parliament, Kim proposed that "we close 
this century of strife and friction and open a new era of genuine bilateral 
friendship and cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa and Kim agreed to continue close cooperation with the United States 
to persuade North Korea to abandon nuclear development and allow full 
international inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kim warned that "there is a limit to our patience" with North Korean 
delaying tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa, for his part, reiterated a pledge to act "with responsibility" to 
carry out any sanctions the U.N. Security Council might impose on North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Sato said in a speech that Japan should be 
prepared even to revise its laws, if necessary, to carry out its part of any 
sanctions. At issue if sanctions are imposed is how Japan would halt the flow 
of an estimated $600 million worth of remittances to North Korea made by Korean 
residents sympathetic to the Stalinist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "The countries who are the recipients of the threat posed by the North Korea 
nuclear problem are South Korea and Japan. If Japan failed to implement 
completely U.N. sanctions, it would be branded an irresponsible nation," Sato 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A mistake in handling the North Korean nuclear issue, he added, "would invite 
the isolation of Japan in international society." 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa was expected to face opposition from the Socialist Party, his largest 
coalition partner that maintains friendly ties with North Korea, if attempts 
are made to halt the flow of money to Pyongyang.

CLINTON TAKES A BOLD STEP TO SWAY SKEPTICS; ANALYSIS: HE MAKES A SPIRITED 
DEFENSE OF HIS ACTIONS IN ORDER TO STEM HIS ERODING CREDIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, his credibility beginning to sag under the weight of the 
Whitewater controversy, decided earlier this week that a rare full-dress press 
conference was his best chance to convince a skeptical public that he has 
nothing to hide -- and that he is still moving forward on health care, crime 
and other issues close to voters' hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 35 minutes of nationally televised give-and-take with reporters 
gathered at the White House, the President unleashed his considerable skills as 
a communicator to build a fire wall between himself and the apparent ethical 
shortcomings of his former business partners and many of his other associates 
during the years when Clinton was governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether that fire wall will hold, however, remains a question. 
</P>
<P>
 By asserting emphatically that he had nothing to do with managing the 
Whitewater real estate venture and knew nothing about any wrongdoing by his 
business partner, James B. McDougal, operator of the failed Madison Guaranty 
Savings & Loan, Clinton has taken a position that requires his critics to prove 
not only that improper or illegal acts occurred but that he himself had guilty 
knowledge. That is a difficult standard -- one that none of his Republican 
attackers have yet come close to meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the unqualified nature of Clinton's denials could magnify 
his vulnerability if hard evidence should emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as other presidents using similar defenses have discovered, the public 
may come to its own conclusions if the evidence of misconduct and ethical 
lapses by those around Clinton becomes too voluminous. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, however, White House strategists believed that they had no choice but 
to take a bold step. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the steady drumbeat of daily Whitewater stories," declared a 
senior Clinton aide shortly before the press conference, "we haven't been able 
to break through to the national audience and convince them we are cooperating 
with the special counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton scheduled the press conference as new polls found the Whitewater 
controversy seriously eroding his popular support. A Times Mirror poll released 
Thursday showed that about two-thirds of Americans of all political stripes -- 
73% of Republicans, 67% of Independents and 59% of Democrats -- believe the 
Clintons are guilty of at least some wrongdoing. Only 15% believe they are 
guilty of serious offenses, while 52% said they think the Clintons are guilty 
of only minor offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, which a senior Clinton aide called stunning, also showed that 52% 
believe the White House has covered up information damaging to the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 The President insisted more than once that he has fully cooperated in the 
Whitewater investigation and said that he and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
are prepared to answer all questions posed by the special counsel, Robert B. 
Fiske Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Clinton declared, he has provided Fiske with tax returns and 14,000 
documents and made available every Administration witness that the special 
counsel has sought. However, opinion polls show that continuing reports of 
alleged Whitewater improprieties and the President's efforts in the past to 
divert attention from the controversy have left a strong public impression of a 
cover-up that his assurances may have done little to dispel. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton complained that the public has not been aware that he is cooperating 
fully. He seemed resigned to seeing Whitewater continue as a major controversy 
that he will have to confront while going "back to work doing what I was hired 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely has a sitting President been questioned in a criminal investigation, 
but Clinton said that he would cooperate with Fiske "in whatever way he decides 
is appropriate." Administration sources suggested that Fiske would take a 
deposition from both Clintons.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, hoping to stabilize his shaken presidency, also insisted at his press 
conference that despite all the media attention, the controversy has not 
interfered with the Administration's pursuit of a heavy domestic and foreign 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that, away from the media spotlight, it's business as usual for 
health care reform and other issues and that "our Administration is preoccupied 
with the business we were sent here to do for the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the White House has continued to work on health care and other major 
issues. But the Times Mirror poll, conducted March 16-21 among 2,001 adults, 
showed that 81% of Americans think the controversy is disrupting the 
government's effectiveness. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton aides privately acknowledged that Whitewater has demoralized the 
President's staff, absorbed much of its time and energy and distracted it from 
work on health care reform and other major issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a happy place to be these days and it's not just political, it's 
personal," said one aide. "People are getting hurt and seeing their friends 
subpoenaed and put on the griddle." 
</P>
<P>
 People at the White House, said one official, "are resigned to the fact that 
there seems to be no end to Whitewater, it'll just go on and on and on and 
we'll just have to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton repeatedly sought to convince the public that he already has been 
fully cooperative with the special counsel and cited comments from respected 
public figures who agree: Sam Dash, who served as counsel for the Senate 
Watergate Committee during the scandal that dogged the Richard Nixon 
Administration, and Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii), who served on that 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Dash, he said, "contrasted our conduct with previous presidents and said we 
had been highly ethical." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton quoted Inouye as saying: "I've been experienced in these 
investigations. You folks have claimed no executive privilege. You've fully 
cooperated. No one can quarrel with that." 
</P>
<P>
 The President obviously was perturbed by his plunge in the polls. After rising 
to the high 50s earlier in the year, he has dropped to the mid-40s in the 
latest surveys. But he said that, after reading reports that the media devoted 
three times as much coverage to Whitewater as to health care, "I'm amazed that 
there hasn't been more change in the polls."

EXCERPTS: CLINTON SUPPORTS 'CLEARING THE WAY FOR HEARINGS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Federal News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 . . . I know that many people around America must believe that Washington is 
overwhelmingly preoccupied with the Whitewater matter. But our Administration 
is preoccupied with the business we were sent here to do for the American 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of Whitewater is being handled by an independent special 
counsel whose appointment I supported. Our cooperation with that counsel has 
been total. We have supplied over 14,000 documents, my tax returns dating back 
to 1978, and made available every Administration witness he has sought. 
</P>
<P>
 I support the actions of the House and the Senate clearing the way for 
hearings at an appropriate time that does not interfere with Mr. Fiske's 
responsibilities, and I will fully cooperate with their work as well. Tax 
Returns to 1977 
</P>
<P>
 Tomorrow, I will make available my tax returns dating back to 1977 when I 
first held public office. Cooperation, disclosure and doing the people's 
business are the order of the day. . . . Question: You just said that you would 
release your tax returns back to 1977. Questions also have been raised about 
whether you made money or lost money in your Whitewater investment. Do you 
still believe that you lost about $70,000, and do you have any reason to 
believe that you owe any back taxes? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I am certain that we lost money. I do not believe we owe any back 
taxes. If it is determined that we do, of course we will pay. I am now sure 
that we lost something less than $70,000 based on an interview I heard on 
television -- or I heard about on television with Jim McDougal on one of the 
networks where he said that he felt that one of the loans I had taken from a 
bank where we also borrowed money for the land development corporation -- he 
said he thought one of those was a personal loan. 
</P>
<P>
 So I started racking my brain to try to remember what that might have been. 
And by coincidence, I was also rereading the galleys of my mother's 
autobiography, just fact-checking it, and I noticed that she mentioned there 
something that I had genuinely forgotten, which is that I helped her to 
purchase the property and what was then a cabin on the place that she and her 
husband, Dick Kelly, lived back in 1981, and that I was a co-owner of that 
property with her for just a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 After they married, he bought my interest out. So that's where that -- I 
borrowed the money to go in in that investment. I paid the money back with 
interest. That was unrelated to Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 All the other losses we have documented to date we believe clearly are tied to 
the investment Hillary and I made in Whitewater. So we in fact lost some 
$20,700 less than the Lyons report indicated because that loan came from a 
different place, and then -- or came for different purposes. And there was 
another $1,500 payment I made on it, so whatever the total in the Lyons report 
was should be -- you should distract -- or subtract from that $20,700 and 
another $1,500. And we believe we can document that clearly. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Question: Do you know of any funds, any money -- Whitewater seems to be about 
money -- having gone into any of your gubernatorial campaigns or into 
Whitewater, particularly federally insured money? Do you know of any money that 
could have gone in? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: No. I have no knowledge of that. I have absolutely no knowledge of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You just mentioned James McDougal, your former business partner. A 
lot of questions have been raised about his business practices. Can you tell us 
what drew you to him to begin with and whether or not you still have faith now 
that he was -- that he is an honest businessman? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Well, I can tell you that, when I entered my relationship with him . . 
. I knew Mr. McDougal and had known him for many years. I met him in the late 
'60s when he was running Sen. Fulbright's office in Arkansas. I knew that 
sometime around that time, perhaps later, he got into the real estate business. 
. . . Money Loss No Surprise 
</P>
<P>
 The reason we lost money on Whitewater is not surprising. A lot of people did 
at that time. Interest rates, as you'll remember, went through the roof in the 
early '80s. People stopped immigrating to my state to retire, at least in the 
numbers they had all during the '70s. And the market simply changed. 
</P>
<P>
 So we didn't sell as many lots, and the venture was not successful. So we lost 
the money. Principally the money I lost was on the interest payments I had to 
make on the loans which were never reimbursed because the venture never turned 
a profit. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Question: Congressman Leach made some very dramatic charges today. He said the 
Whitewater is really about the arrogance of power. And he didn't just mean back 
in Arkansas. He said that federal regulators tried to stop investigators for 
the Resolution Trust Corp. in Kansas City from putting Whitewater into their 
criminal referrals. That would amount to a cover-up and possibly obstruction of 
justice. Do you have any knowledge of that? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Absolutely not. . . . It's my understanding that Mr. Leach was rather 
careful in the words that he used, and apparently he didn't even charge that 
any political appointee of our Administration had any knowledge of this. So he 
may be talking about an internal dispute within the RTC from career Republican 
appointees, for all I know. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind, until I came here all the appointees of the RTC were hired under 
previous Republican administrations. There has never been a Democratic 
President since there's been an RTC. And I can tell you categorically I had no 
knowledge of this and was not involved in it in any way, shape, or form. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: In light of all that's happened, do you think you made any mistakes 
in the initial investment and in the way the White House has handled this? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I certainly don't think I made a mistake in the initial investment. It 
was a perfectly honorable thing to do. And it was a perfectly legal thing to 
do. And I didn't make any money, I lost money. I paid my debts. And then later 
on . . . Hillary and I tried to make sure that the corporation was closed down 
in an appropriate way and paid any obligations that it owed after we were asked 
to get involved at a very late stage and after Mr. McDougal had left the S&L. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Question: You've been kind of tough at times on people you felt made out 
during the '80s and didn't pay their fair share. Can you tell us here tonight 
that you have abided by the very high ethical standard --  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: -- To which you've sought to hold others? And also, if it turns out 
that you do owe something in back taxes, will you be prepared perhaps to revise 
some of those judgments you've made about others? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: No, not at all. I ask you to tell the American people what percentage 
of my income I paid in taxes in every year where I reported my tax returns. And 
let me tell you what my wife and I spent the '80s doing. I was the lowest-paid 
governor of any state in the country. I don't complain about it, I was proud of 
that. I didn't do it for the money. I worked on creating jobs and improving 
education for the children of my state. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year I was governor, my wife worked in a law firm that had always done 
business with the state. She never took any money for any work she did for the 
state and, indeed, she gave up her portion of partnership income that otherwise 
came to the firm, and instead, every year gave an enormous percentage of her 
time to public service work, helping children and helping education and doing a 
lot of other things, giving up a lot of income. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I would remind you that we, like most middle-class folks, we turned our 
records over to an accountant, we did everything -- I always told the 
accountant to resolve all doubts in favor of the government, I never wanted any 
question raised about our taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 When it turned out in our own investigation of this Whitewater business that 
one year we had inadvertently taken a tax deduction for interest payments when 
in fact it was a principal payment, even though the statute of limitations had 
run, we went back and voluntarily paid what we owed to the federal government. 
And if it turns out we've made some mistake inadvertently, we will do that 
again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Question: So many things have happened since this Whitewater story broke or 
resurfaced, depending on your point of view. Your counsel has resigned. A 
number of your top aides have been subpoenaed because of their contacts with 
Treasury officials in on the investigation. I'm curious. Who do you blame more 
than anything else for the Whitewater mess that the Administration is in now? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I don't think it's useful to get into blame. I think what's important 
is that I answer the questions that you have that are legitimate questions, 
that I fully cooperate with the special counsel, which was requested widely by 
the press and by the members of the Republican Party and who is himself a 
Republican, that we fully cooperate. And we've done that. . . . Enough Blame to 
Go Around 
</P>
<P>
 And then I get back to the work of getting unemployment down, jobs up, passing 
a health care bill, passing the crime bill, moving this country forward. I 
think the worst thing that can happen is for me to sort of labor over who 
should blame -- who should be blamed by this. There will probably be enough 
blame to go around. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Question: You and your wife have both used the phrase "bewildered, confused" 
about why all the interest in Whitewater. Yet in the Arkansas savings and loan 
business your wife represented Madison Savings & Loan before the Arkansas 
savings and loan board, whose head was a former lawyer who had done work for 
Madison Savings & Loan. Do you not see any conflicts of interest in your action 
or your wife's actions which would appear to contradict what you just said 
about her not doing any work before the state that would cause people to 
question her actions? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: No, that's not what I said. I said that when my wife did business, 
when her law firm represented some state agency itself -- state agencies all 
over America use private lawyers -- if she did any work for the state, she 
never took any pay for it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Was there anything wrong with her representing a client before a state agency? 
And if you go back and look at the facts, basically the firm wrote the 
securities commissioner a letter saying "Is it permissible under Arkansas law 
to raise money for this S&L in this way?" And it showed that she was one of the 
contacts on it. And the securities commissioner wrote her back and said it's 
not against the law. . . . These kinds of things happen when you have married 
couples who have professions, and the most important thing there is disclosure. 
There was no sneaking around about this, this was full disclosure. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Question: You said a few minutes ago that the people in the RTC who are 
involved in Congressman Leach's allegations are all career Republican 
officials. But aren't they members of your Administration, and do you plan to 
take any action in speaking either to Mr. Bentsen or Mr. Altman about taking 
action and investigating Mr. Leach's charges? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think the last thing in the world I should do is talk to the 
Treasury Department about the RTC. You all have told me that that creates the 
appearance of impropriety. I don't think we can have a -- it's not just a 
one-way street, it's a two-way street. Mr. Leach will see that whatever should 
be done is done, but I can tell you I have had no contact with the RTC, I've 
made no attempt to influence them, and you can see by some of the decisions 
that they have made that that is the furthest thing, it seems to me, that ought 
to be on your mind. . . Questioning the First Lady  
</P>
<P>
 Question: . . . When do you think it would be proper for the First Lady to 
answer questions about Whitewater? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: . . . The First Lady has done several interviews. She was out in three 
different places last week answering questions exhaustively from the press. I 
think she will continue to do that. And if you have questions you want to ask 
her about this, I think you ought to ask the questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: I take it that the tax returns you're putting out tomorrow are the 
ones that have already gone to the special counsel. If the special counsel 
wanted to question you about that, would you answer a subpoena? Would Mrs. 
Clinton? And what about congressional hearings? What would be the protocol on 
going before Congress to explain it to them? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: We decided in addition to putting out the '78 and '79 returns we 
should go ahead and put out the '77 returns, that that would be an appropriate 
starting point, because that's the year I first entered public life. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In terms of the information, I expect that the special counsel will want to 
question me and will want to question the First Lady. It's my understanding 
that typically in the past it's been done in a different way. I mean, I will 
cooperate with him in whatever way he decides is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, if Congress wants any information direct from us, we will of course 
provide it to them in whatever way seems most appropriate. Again, I understand 
there are certain protocols which have been followed in the past which I would 
expect would be followed here, but I intend to be fully cooperative so that I 
can go back to work doing what I was hired to do. . . .

 The state's highest court rejected an attempt Thursday to end abortions at 
Cook County Hospital, which serves many of Chicago's poorest residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The court criticized the four hospital board members who sued to block 
resumption of elective abortions, saying they had "abdicated their legislative 
obligations" by asking the courts to settle the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Richard Phelan issued an order in 1992 lifting a 12-year ban 
on elective abortions at the public hospital.

AF BASE SURVIVOR: 'FIRE WAS EVERYWHERE'; DISASTER: EYEWITNESSES TO CRASH OF 
PLANES AND RAIN OF FLAMING METAL DESCRIBE PANDEMONIUM, HEROISM. INVESTIGATORS 
ARRIVE AS DEATH TOLL CLIMBS TO 20.

<P>
 He doesn't recall the sound of the crash, just the sight of fiery death 
raining down. 
</P>
<P>
 Pandemonium broke out as panicked soldiers scrambled to escape. "I tried to 
run," said Army Sgt. Gregory Cowper. "I got about 10 or 15 feet, but the fire 
was just everywhere. Soldiers to the left of me and the right were completely 
on fire. It just totally engulfed the whole area. I'm not sure why I made it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowper, one of some 500 soldiers assembled near the Tarmac at Pope Air Force 
Base Wednesday when two planes collided overhead, was hospitalized with a 
broken leg and burns on his hands and head. But two of his friends were among 
the 20 who died when the crash sent flaming metal hurtling onto soldiers 
waiting to begin paratroop practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 58 people were hospitalized from injuries received in the accident, 
which occurred when a F-16D fighter jet clipped the tail of a C-130 transport 
plane, reportedly less than 300 feet above the airfield, as both were 
attempting to land. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew of both planes escaped injury, but the fighter jet -- whose pilots 
ejected -- crashed in flames. It skidded at 180 m.p.h. before hitting a C-141 
transport plane that was preparing to take paratroopers aloft. The transport 
plane exploded when flying metal punctured its fuel tanks.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they still don't know why the planes collided in midair, other 
than that each pilot thought he had clearance to land. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the 9th Air Force Base in South Carolina arrived at Pope 
Thursday evening to launch their probe of the accident. A determination of what 
caused the collision is not expected for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Brig. Gen Bobby Floyd, commander of the 23rd Wing at the air base, said 
preliminary inquiries show the F-16 crew did the proper thing when they 
ejected. "There is no way that they could've landed," he said, citing 
eyewitness reports that part of the jet's nose cone flew off after the 
collision. The jet, he said, "was out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 The transport plane was able to land despite losing a part of its tail. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators planned to examine tapes of the control tower's instructions to 
the two planes that collided. And ordnance experts scoured the crash area 
Thursday for ammunition from the fighter jet's 20-millimeter guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, personnel at the Air Force base and adjoining Ft. Bragg Army Base 
tried to make sense of the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The death toll rose to 20 after five injured soldiers died overnight 
Wednesday. The death toll could even rise higher. Dr. William Chapman at Womack 
Army Hospital said 90% of the patients hospitalized had severe burns, and up to 
12 also had broken bones requiring either pins or amputations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would anticipate our losses would increase," he told reporters. "There are 
several in the hospital too unstable to transfer." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty people were transported Thursday to Brooke Army Medical Center in San 
Antonio, the Army's premiere burn unit. Thirty-eight of the injured were being 
treated at area non-military hospitals, said Sgt. 1st Class Skip Richey. 
Another 27 people were treated and released Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the mass hysteria, with flames all around, there were examples of 
heroism as soldiers ignored their own injuries to help others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone pitched in," said Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, commander of the 18th 
Airborne Corps at Ft. Bragg. "Soldiers were saying, 'Don't take care of me, 
take care of my buddy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of individual efforts that saved a lot of lives," said Capt. 
Michael Taylor, who survived the inferno with only severe hand burns. "There 
were kids whose (clothing) were still on fire who didn't know what to do," 
Taylor said. "People knocked them down and rolled them in the sand. People with 
canteens were hosing others down." 
</P>
<P>
 His bandaged hands protruded from the sleeves of his uniform as he described 
the tragedy at a press conference at the Air Force base. "I made about three 
steps and realized I wasn't going to outrun it," said Taylor, 35. "So I started 
rolling in the sand. When I hit the ground I didn't think I was going to get up 
again because you felt the heat go over your top and you could feel the scrap 
metal, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowper, 23, of Boise, Ida., said he doesn't remember hearing the crash or the 
explosion of the parked transport plane. He was sitting on his paratroop 
equipment, talking with buddies about 75 feet from the runway when, out of the 
corner of his eye, he saw a giant, rushing ball of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 He tried to run but fell. He remembers the screams of his fellow soldiers, 
many of them engulfed in flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowper said he knocked one man down who was on fire. Because of his injured 
hands there wasn't much more he could do, but other people helped put out the 
flames. Despite his broken leg -- "I just knew it hurt real bad," he said -- he 
helped several other people, too, before someone helped him get out of the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all helped each other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I heard ammunition start to go off and I tried to run away from it as 
far as I could, like everybody else was doing. I tried to get as much distance 
between me and the explosion site as I could." 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-year-old paratrooper has been in the Army five years and served in 
Desert Storm. But he said he'd never seen anything like Wednesday's tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're going into combat you're aware that some bad things are going to 
happen because that's the nature of the game," he said from his hospital bed. 
"But nobody expected this. When you're losing people that you know, good men, 
highly professional people, there's no comparison."

HOUSE, IN IMAGE BOOSTER, VOTES TO CURB INFLUENCE OF LOBBYISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a move designed to improve the public's image of Congress, the House voted 
Thursday to require lobbyists to disclose contacts with lawmakers and to bar 
them from buying meals, travel or gifts for lawmakers and their aides. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, similar to a measure adopted by the Senate last May, sailed through 
by a vote of 315 to 110 on a fast-track procedure that required at least a 
two-thirds majority to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 A Senate-House conference is expected to reconcile differences and send the 
legislation back for ratification by both chambers after a two-week Easter 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) made a rare floor speech to urge passage of 
the legislation, declaring that voters think members of Congress are unduly 
influenced by representatives of special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics complained that the bill does not go far enough in curbing 
possible abuses while others argued that it goes too far, suggesting that 
lawmakers' votes could be bought for the price of a dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have loopholes here you could drive a lobbyist's limousine through," said 
Rep. John L. Mica (R-Fla.), referring to some exemptions for clients of 
lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, had 
rushed the bill to the floor in response to a request by the House leadership 
but he said that he does not think it is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento) declared: "This (bill) is an important 
step, not because I believe there is a widespread problem in this institution, 
but because there is a perception that highly paid lobbyists wine and dine 
members of Congress into supporting whatever cause they promote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every member . . . came here for a reason. No one came here for a free 
lunch," Fazio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would require all professional lobbyists to register if they try to 
influence high officials of the executive branch, members of Congress or staff 
aides on changes in federal policy or legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobbyists who are paid less than $2,500 in a six-month period and those who 
spend less than 10% of their time on lobbying would be exempt from the 
registration requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates of total lobbying expenses as well as detailed disclosures of the 
issues or bills being targeted also would be required. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation would bar lobbyists or lobbying firms from paying for meals, 
entertainment, travel or gifts to members of Congress and their staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite objections by Common Cause, the citizens' lobby, the bill includes two 
major exceptions to the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients of lobbyists would be able to pay for travel and related expenses for 
a lawmaker if they disclosed the expenses and the name of the member of 
Congress in semiannual reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Meals and entertainment also could be provided by clients of lobbyists to 
lawmakers and their aides under some circumstances, particularly when the 
client is attending the event. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also would require registration of anyone who directs a form of 
lobbying known as "grass-roots" campaigns to generate support or opposition to 
legislation in a congressional district or home state of a senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Disclosure reports would have to be filed twice a year with a new agency -- 
the Office of Lobbying Registration and Public Disclosure, whose director would 
be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil penalties -- including fines up to $10,000 for minor violations and up 
to $200,000 for major violations of the law -- would enforce the disclosure 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bill would change House rules to prohibit lawmakers and their 
aides from knowingly accepting a gift, meal, travel or entertainment that is 
forbidden by the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 203 Democrats, 111 Republicans and one independent voted for the 
bill. It was opposed by 60 Democrats and 50 Republicans.

STATE VULNERABLE TO OIL SPILLS, GROUP SAYS; ENVIRONMENT: REPORT RELEASED ON THE 
FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EXXON VALDEZ DISASTER SAYS OLD TANKERS AND POOR 
MONITORING RAISE THE THREAT OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a bundle of tough laws passed after Alaska's devastating Exxon Valdez 
oil spill, the coast of California remains vulnerable to a similar catastrophe, 
a national environmental group charged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report released on the fifth anniversary of the Valdez disaster, the 
Center for Marine Conservation says California has been lucky to avoid a major 
spill so far. The report cited problems posed by an aging tanker fleet, 
shrinking crew size and poor offshore monitoring by the U.S. Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing Russian roulette is stupid, and doing it with oil tankers is lunacy," 
said Warren Chabot, Pacific region director of the Washington-based center. 
"There are ways to reduce the risks. The time to take action is now." 
</P>
<P>
 The center's study focused on a 225-mile section of coast from San Simeon 
north to Bodega Bay. That stretch includes three national marine sanctuaries, 
areas set aside because of their biological richness. Although the sanctuaries 
enjoy federal protection from offshore oil drilling, they remain endangered by 
tanker spills, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, nearly 3,000 vessels carrying millions of barrels of crude oil pass 
through the sanctuaries en route to San Francisco and Southern California. 
Except on approach to ports, the massive tankers are free to navigate along any 
route they choose, with virtually no monitoring by the Coast Guard, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Valdez accident spurred improvements in the state's ability to 
clean up oil spills, measures to prevent them are lacking, the center warned. 
To make oil shipping off California safer, the report recommends: 
</P>
<P>
 * Creating a 50-mile, tanker-free buffer zone around the marine sanctuaries. 
The zone would reduce the risk of a tanker running aground and, in the event of 
an accident, would give emergency crews time to reach a disabled ship before 
the oil drifted ashore. If a spill occurred, the 50-mile distance would give 
oil more time to disperse before reaching beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishing a radar system -- similar to air traffic control -- to track 
tankers offshore. Already in use in Alaska's Prince William Sound, the system 
would require tankers to carry beacons announcing their location and identity 
to the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stationing an emergency offshore response vessel -- one capable of towing 
disabled tankers -- in San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increasing aerial surveillance of oil vessels by Coast Guard planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of state laws passed after the Valdez disaster and a 1990 spill off 
Huntington Beach, oil companies have spill prevention and response plans and 
contribute to a fund used to clean up spills of mysterious origins. Coast Guard 
officials said these changes, among others, have reduced the odds of a 
catastrophic spill in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling is we've made a lot of progress since the Valdez," said Lt. 
Kristin Barlow, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. "There is always more you can do on 
environmental protection, but we're moving in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Oil industry representatives declined to comment on specifics in the report, 
which they had not read, but defended their shipping practices. They noted that 
under an agreement enacted by nine major oil companies last year, tankers 
traveling to California from Alaska -- the source of nearly all the crude oil 
coming to the state -- remain a minimum of 50 miles offshore except on approach 
to port. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our folks operate vessels in a way that they feel is safe," said Robert 
Getts, assistant executive director of the Western States Petroleum Assn. 
"Remember, the last thing our member companies want is an oil spill. To them, a 
spill is terribly costly . . . not only in dollars and cents but in public 
reaction and outcry." 
</P>
<P>
 The Exxon Valdez supertanker ran aground March 24, 1989, spilling 11 million 
gallons of crude oil that killed hundreds of thousands of animals in Prince 
William Sound, an Alaskan inlet. 
</P>
<P>
 The center said it was releasing its report now because the Coast Guard has 
failed to produce two studies on tanker traffic that were mandated by the Oil 
Pollution Act, passed shortly after the Valdez spill. Coast Guard officials 
said the studies are under way, but could not give an estimated date for their 
completion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our coast can't wait," said Marci Glazer, co-author of the report. "Since the 
Exxon Valdez, at least seven fully laden tankers have lost power or steering in 
Prince William Sound. Those same tankers have been in San Francisco Bay 48 
times in one year."

SUIT CHALLENGES RECOLLECTIONS OF MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A father faced off in court Thursday against his daughter's two therapists, 
charging that they conned her into remembering childhood sexual abuse that 
never happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed by former wine company executive Gary Ramona is among the 
first to challenge the validity of so-called recovered memories. Some national 
experts say the time is right. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a certain number of therapists who see sexual abuse in every 
patient they see," said Dr. Harrison Pope, a Harvard University psychiatrist 
who has helped Ramona. "And they can lead a patient by a thousand suggestions 
and implications, and by reinforcing what they do and don't listen to." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona's life was shattered in 1990, when daughter Holly confronted him -- and 
later filed a suit -- over childhood sexual molestation she recalled during 
psychiatric treatment for the eating disorder bulimia. Her suit is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona, 49, denied abusing his daughter as a toddler. No criminal charges were 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
 But he soon lost his $300,000-a-year job as a vice president at the Robert 
Mondavi Winery. He was ostracized by friends, family and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 He sued the therapists for $8 million, accusing them of planting the 
molestation memories with improper suggestion and drug use. Holly Ramona, now 
23, is scheduled to testify in her therapists' defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona's attorney, Richard Harrington, opened his case Thursday by portraying 
a daughter who had been unhappy and overweight since childhood. He said she 
sought treatment as a college student while suffering from bulimia, only to be 
mishandled by a family counselor and a hospital psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 The counselor, Marche Isabella, repeatedly insisted that bulimia was caused by 
childhood sexual abuse and that the subsequent use of the drug sodium amytal 
proved that Holly's flashbacks were true, Harrington said. He said the 
accusations came despite repeated medical exams during childhood that showed no 
evidence of abuse.

MAN WITH AIDS VIRUS GETS 5 LIFE TERMS IN RAPE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An HIV-positive man convicted of attempted murder in the rape of three boys 
was sentenced Thursday to five consecutive life terms. He is believed to be the 
first person in the nation convicted of attempted murder for using the AIDS 
virus as a deadly weapon during a rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignacio A. Perea Jr., 32, was found guilty by a jury Feb. 28 of attempted 
murder, kidnaping, lewd and lascivious assault and sexual battery in a case 
that has broken new legal ground and outraged the community.  
</P>
<P>
 "This case is every parent's worst nightmare," said Assistant State Atty. 
Susan Dechovitz. 
</P>
<P>
 After accepting Perea's no-contest pleas and finding him guilty in two other 
sexual batteries, Circuit Judge Michael B. Chavies sentenced Perea to the 
maximum penalties on each of 23 criminal charges, meaning that he would have to 
serve a mandatory minimum of 100 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling his offenses "unparalleled in this court's mind," Chavies told Perea: 
"It is my intention that you serve the rest of your natural life in a maximum 
security prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Perea's defense attorney, Harold Keefe, called the charges, as well as the 
sentence, "overkill." He said his client is on the verge of developing 
full-blown AIDS. "Five years would be a death sentence," Keefe said. Perea's 
attorneys said they will appeal the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is basically new terrain," said University of Miami law professor Bruce 
Winick. "It's not criminalizing the disease, but criminalizing someone with the 
disease who rapes. It's attempted murder in a new way." 
</P>
<P>
 Some AIDS activists, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union, have 
expressed concern about the precedent that the conviction sets, saying that the 
defendant's medical condition has no bearing on other crimes alleged and tends 
to exacerbate the social stigma that already affects those with the human 
immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing followed an hour of emotional testimony from two of Perea's 
three victims, all of whom have tested negative for HIV. Both boys, who were 11 
and 15 at the time of the attacks, said that since the assaults, they dwell on 
thoughts of suicide and have sought psychological counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The third victim, who was not in court, also was 11 years old when he was 
assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members wept as Dechovitz recounted details of the crimes, which she 
described as "heinous, atrocious and cruel." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case on which Perea was tried and found guilty, he was accused of 
snatching one of the 11-year-olds off his bicycle in September, 1991, tossing 
him blindfolded to the floor of a car and driving him to a warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Perea and an accomplice, who has not been arrested, raped the boy and 
forced him to perform sex acts on them, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perea, who has maintained his innocence and did not testify at his trial, was 
arrested after police found a picture of him taken by a surveillance camera as 
he stood behind the boy in a store. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the arrest, Perea had in his pocket a receipt from a clinic 
that indicated he had tested positive for HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though there is no evidence that Perea intended to kill his victims, 
Dechovitz said he was charged with attempted murder because he knew he carried 
the virus and he knew the virus was deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The analogy I've made is to a firearm," she said. "Guns are legal to carry 
and own, but you are expected to behave responsibly. If you shoot at someone 
and miss, you can still be found guilty of attempted first-degree murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Perea's attorneys, Keefe and co-counsel Paul Morris, said the conviction 
offers several grounds for appeal, including the emotional effect the HIV 
charge may have had on the jury.  
</P>
<P>
 In similar cases, all in Oregon, a man was convicted of attempted murder in 
1992 for exposing a 17-year-old girl to the AIDS virus during consensual sex. 
In another case, an HIV-positive man was charged with attempted murder for the 
rape of children but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.

 The disputed territory is only a few feet away from some of the most expensive 
real estate in Southern California. The homes along Isle Vista here are valued 
between $1 million and $3 million. And the views are nothing short of 
spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, homeowners say, is that outsiders feel increasingly entitled to 
share the breathtaking sunsets and glimpses of Santa Catalina Island by parking 
on their exclusive street and walking to a popular park to take in the majestic 
scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 Isle Vista is a private road, as are the Gatsby-like estates of the 161-member 
Monarch Point Homeowners Assn. that claim it as an address. But Badlands Park 
-- one of the highest, most scenic points in all of Orange County -- is public. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding to end their frustration, the homeowners in 1992 took the liberty of 
declaring their street off limits. They put up no-parking signs and painted the 
curbs red to emphasize that most of Isle Vista -- the only access to the park 
-- is private. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where lawyers enter the picture. As county government sees it, 
painting curbs and erecting signs went too far. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Orange County officials filed suit earlier this month, seeking a permanent 
injunction against the association, as well as a $30,000 fine and payment of 
all legal costs. The homeowners' paint job and signs violate the California 
Coastal Act, the suit alleges, and could result in fines of $10,000 a day for 
each day they violate the act -- should a judge agree with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The act seeks to protect access to publicly owned coastal areas like Badlands 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that we had to press the point to litigation," said John 
Sibley, deputy director of the Orange County Environmental Management Agency, 
which made repeated demands to the homeowners to remove the self-imposed 
no-parking area. 
</P>
<P>
 The association's attorney, William P. Hickey, counters that his clients 
obtained no permission to paint the curb from any governmental agency for the 
simple reason that "they just don't need it." 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope the county acts reasonably, but at this point, it's hard for us to 
tell why they're doing what they're doing," Hickey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners maintain that plenty of parking space exists along the northern 
end of Isle Vista and that declaring the curbed area near Badlands a no-parking 
zone was based solely on safety -- for park visitors and property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The private street is the only access to the recreational facility, which has 
no parking lots. Residents are worried that public parking near the entrance 
could block emergency vehicles from reaching their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a school bus pickup area," Hickey said. "When cars are parked there, the 
cars of homeowners can't get through. Fire access is also an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 But public access to Badlands can "reasonably be made" only from Isle Vista, 
the suit maintains. The red paint and no-parking signs "effectively denied the 
public access over Isle Vista Drive," the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
 The no-parking signs and red curbs were an issue once before, in 1988, when 
the homes were about to be built. In anticipation, the developer put up signs 
and painted the curbs red. But as a condition of obtaining a coastal 
development permit, the developer agreed to remove the signs and paint, 
according to Edward N. Duran, deputy county counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 But by June, 1992, county officials discovered that the paint and no-parking 
signs had reappeared, Duran said. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of "repeated demands" by the county ever since, the homeowners' 
association has "refused to remove these obstructions," the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
 A security attendant, who asked not to be identified, said an incident in 
mid-1992 prompted the decision by homeowners to paint the curbs red all the way 
from the guard house, which stands at the entrance to the estates, to a point 
several hundred feet down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The guard described the incident this way: Fire had broken out in a 
homeowner's back yard. But firetrucks stalled at the guard house, because cars 
belonging to park visitors had made the entrance impassable. The homeowner 
doused the fire, and damage was averted, "but it could have been a disaster," 
the guard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees that parking on Isle Vista is an evil. 
</P>
<P>
 Two residents who asked not to be named said they welcome the park's daily 
visitors who use the Badlands trails to leisurely walk their dogs. They chose 
not to comment further, they said, hoping not to offend fellow homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Joseph Potocki, a marketing consultant who lives in one of the 
estates, called the park an asset in every way except one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a hazard to anybody coming out of the guarded-gate area if cars 
are allowed to park right there. There just isn't enough space," he said. "I 
find it difficult to believe that the county would favor that from a safety 
standpoint. It's too narrow a space. I don't think it's doable." 
</P>
<P>
 But the suit seeks to eliminate the entire red-zoned area imposed by the 
residents, even near the entrance to the guarded gate, which is barely wide 
enough for a single car. 
</P>
<P>
 "The association is eager to do the right thing," said Hickey, the homeowners' 
attorney. "We don't feel we're denying access to a public park and that we're 
complying with their request under the law and under the Coastal Act. Even now, 
visitors to the park have to walk maybe 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is the county so concerned about walking such a short distance in order 
to get to a hiking trail? Isn't walking the point here, anyway?"

 "I know you think I'm joking, but believe me that's the only way I could break 
into show business."  
</P>
<P>
 Does the name Rupert Pupkin ring a bell? 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Pupkin spoke the words above to a live audience near the end of his 
national TV debut as a stand-up comic. Even as a disbelieving but amused 
audience laughed, Pupkin explained that, no, he was serious -- he only got the 
gig after kidnaping host Jerry Langford and holding him hostage in exchange for 
this appearance on the show. Indeed, as soon as Pupkin's five minutes were 
over, the FBI arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was just the start of things. Pupkin served only two years and nine 
months of his six-year term at a minimum-security prison for abducting the 
talk-show host. He signed a book deal "for more than a million dollars," 
according to his publicist. The book title: "King for a Night." Hollywood later 
bought the rights. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a beautiful deal, baby. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994 terms, does it even matter that Rupert Pupkin was a fictional 
creation, that he was the character Robert DeNiro played in the 1983 film, "The 
King of Comedy"? 
</P>
<P>
 The movie was no doubt written as a satire on celebrity status and some 
people's craving for it. Anyone watching the movie today, however, would be 
more likely to say, "Yeah, that could happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Could happen? It happens all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 I caught a TV news teaser the other day and saw throngs of people surrounding 
a partially obscured figure. Obviously, it was a media horde and the only 
question was, who was the celebrity? 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out it was Joey Buttafuoco, the Long Island auto mechanic fresh from 
jail after serving part of his sentence for having sexual relations with a 
minor, the notorious schoolgirl Amy Fisher. Young Miss Fisher made her own news 
by shooting Joey's wife some time ago. I'm sure you caught one of the three TV 
movies last year about Amy. 
</P>
<P>
 So, here's Joey -- already made famous by Letterman and Leno monologues -- 
commanding a media crowd as he returns home. Having done nothing in life thus 
far but have an affair with a teen-ager, Buttafuoco may be set financially for 
life as his celebrity status kicks in. 
</P>
<P>
 It calls to mind a figure skater of recent vintage. Tonya Harding may have 
been headed for a nondescript career as a professional ice skater, but no more. 
She reportedly sold one TV interview for more than a half-million dollars and, 
by golly, she still has a life story to sell for either book or TV. 
</P>
<P>
 And for what? For being involved in an assault on another skater. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend says he heard that Lorena Bobbitt might get a job hosting a 
Spanish-language talk show. Why not? She earned her celebrity status the 
in-vogue way: She grabbed a potential murder weapon and went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 In a world in which Charles Manson T-shirts and songs sell, who wouldn't tune 
in Lorena's show? 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, we've always had people famous only for criminal activity. But 
have we ever been so brazen about accepting them in our midst as pop 
celebrities? Once, we would have ridden a Joey Buttafuoco out of town; now we 
put him on the cover of magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 At least Al Capone ran an empire. Buttafuoco repairs carburetors. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll try not to lose much sleep over it, because I can't do anything about it. 
The media seem incapable of resisting these people. But we can't take all the 
blame; the public seems incapable of resisting them, either. Let's face it, all 
three networks didn't do Amy Fisher movies because they thought no one would 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like pulling off a caper made a nobody named Rupert Pupkin a somebody, so 
it works for Tonya and Joey and Lorena, ad nauseam . 
</P>
<P>
 Joey and Tonya must love "The King of Comedy." They've probably seen it more 
times than I've seen "Casablanca." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as I replay over and over Ingrid Bergman's confessional to Bogart, Joey 
and Tonya probably can't get enough of Rupert Pupkin saying, ". . . You'll 
think I'm crazy, but I figure it this way -- I'd rather be king for a night 
than a schmuck for life." 
</P>
<P>
 Cash in while you can. Who knows, there may be another celebrity discovery 
just around the corner. 
</P>

CLAIMS FILED THIS MONTH AGAINST VIETNAM INVALID; PROPERTY: U.S. SAYS THE 1,300 
APPLICANTS HAD TO BE AMERICAN CITIZENS AT THE TIME THEY LOST ASSETS IN THE WAR 
AND HAD TO REQUEST COMPENSATION BY 1983. 
</P>

<P>
 The nearly 1,300 Vietnamese Americans who filed documents this month in an 
attempt to recover property and assets in their homeland appear to be out of 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the U.S. State Department, claimants had to be U.S. citizens at 
the time they lost property during the Vietnam War to qualify for compensation 
from the Vietnamese government. More importantly, they were required to file 
claims by 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Vietnamese Community of Southern California, the nonprofit 
agency that fielded 1,285 new applications for compensation during the past two 
weekends, said Thursday that they knew about the 1983 deadline and the 
citizenship rule but organized the drive anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Lien Nguyen, who organized the application drive, said the group hoped to 
exert pressure on Congress to amend the 1980 legislation that established the 
rules and allow more recent Vietnamese immigrants to apply for compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization also hoped to make a "political statement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The communist government in Vietnam does not believe in the right of private 
property. Everything is owned by the government," said Nguyen, who heads the 
group's asset claims committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if we can get them to even just sit down to discuss this with us, then we 
would have made them recognize that there is such a right. That would be a 
victory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Socialist Republic of Vietnam's office at the United 
Nations in New York said the Vietnamese Community of Southern California is 
being too optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to stress that the Vietnamese government does not have any plans to 
recognize requests from people who fled in 1975 but who weren't U.S. citizens 
at the time," said Tran Quy Duc. "Those who are giving them hope are being 
unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Bradley, counsel for the U.S. government agency in charge of negotiating 
the claims with the government of Vietnam, said the new applicants will receive 
compensation only if "the Vietnam government agrees to do so . . . or if they 
convince Congress to change the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 192 claimants have been deemed eligible for $99.5 million in private 
property and corporate assets under applications filed by 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate claimants include such large companies as IBM World Trade Corp., 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists Entertainment Co., Warner Bros. Inc. and 
General Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Orange County residents -- one of Vietnamese descent -- filed before the 
deadline, requesting about $110,000 in lost property and other assets, Bradley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Robert J. Burns of Westminster, who is now deceased; Cuc Pham Norris 
of Orange; and Pauline and Richard Wright of Fountain Valley. All seek 
compensation for the loss of businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been told that there is definitely a good chance that my client will get 
compensated," said Paul Sowa, a Tustin attorney representing the estate of 
Robert J. Burns. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns was a Westminster businessman who owned Index Corp., which provided food 
and housing in Vietnam for members of an international committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese government owes Burns' heirs about $70,330, without interest, 
Sowa said. The attorney said he cannot predict when the compensation might 
arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Nga Nguyen, 55, of Orange, who filed documents last weekend at the Vietnamese 
Community of Southern California's Westminster office, said she was surprised 
to learn that she is not eligible to reclaim the two homes she lost in Saigon 
and Ban Me Thuot, a town in the central highlands. The properties were 
confiscated by the communist government in 1979, when Nguyen fled to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the law is right," Nguyen said. "First of all, I've never heard 
of the existence of the law until now and so didn't know in 1983 that I was 
supposed to file for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Second of all, how could I have been an American citizen at the time I lost 
my home?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the law doesn't care about the loss of Vietnamese Americans," Nguyen 
added. "I hope the Vietnamese community could somehow convince the U.S. 
government to help us retrieve some of the property that was forcibly taken 
away from us." 
</P>
<P>
 When told that the Vietnamese Community of Southern California was aware of 
the law, even if she wasn't, Nguyen said: "Well, at least they tried. That's 
more than I can say about the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress passed legislation in 1980 authorizing the Foreign Claims Settlement 
Commission, a quasi-independent agency housed in the U.S. Justice Department, 
to accept appeals for lost property in Vietnam, said Bradley, counsel for the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The law set February, 1983, as the deadline for all applications. The 
commission finished compiling the claims list in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The first discussions of the assets were held in Hanoi on Feb. 28 and March 1, 
just weeks after President Clinton lifted the U.S. trade embargo against 
Vietnam. The talks are scheduled to continue next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Claimants are also seeking 6% annual interest, dating back to 1975, when the 
Republic of Vietnam fell to the North Vietnamese.

O.C. YOUTHS SMOKE MORE THAN AVERAGE, STUDY FINDS; HEALTH: THE REPORT COINCIDES 
WITH SURGEON GENERAL JOYCELYN ELDERS' TOWN HALL MEETING ON NONSMOKING EFFORTS. 
SOME ARE WARY OF SURVEY RESULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A new survey of Orange County's youngsters shows that one in three youths has 
tried smoking and that the number of 14-year-olds who smoke regularly is 
substantially higher than the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of 397 junior high school students indicates that 36% of the 12- to 
14-year-olds questioned had taken a puff at least once, according to the 
Southern Coast Regional Board, which coordinates tobacco control efforts in 
Orange and San Diego counties and is funded by federal cigarette taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 SCRB officials released results of their survey to coincide with U.S. Surgeon 
General Joycelyn Elders' national video "town hall meeting" on youth smoking 
Thursday morning, which was broadcast live via satellite from Atlanta to sites 
around the country, including Fullerton, Anaheim, Santa Ana and Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders told the youngsters that most people who smoke started before they left 
high school and encouraged them to educate classmates about tobacco. Adult 
advisers handed out the 23rd Surgeon General's report on smoking, packaged in a 
colorful magazine meant to be teen-friendly. Elders also took telephone 
questions from across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tobacco industry sells an image and adolescents get an addiction," Elders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara DuBois, executive director of the Southern Coast Regional Board, 
agreed, saying the Orange County survey indicates youths are susceptible to 
tobacco advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the survey, conducted in the first three months of this year, 10% 
of the 12-year-olds polled said they are regular smokers. However, 21% of the 
14-year-olds said they smoke. That is substantially higher than the national 
trend, DuBois said, citing studies that show 12% to 14% of 14-year-olds smoke.  
</P>
<P>
 "What is accounting for that?" asked DuBois, who attended Elders' conference 
at Cal State Fullerton. "The tobacco industry is appealing to people in these 
age groups locally." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County adults are the least likely people in California to smoke, 
according to state statistics. Only 18% regularly smoke, compared to more than 
20% statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest county survey, though, Latino students were especially likely to 
say they take a drag. About 20% of the young Latinos surveyed said they smoke, 
contrasted with 12% of whites and 13% of Asian Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 DuBois blamed ethnically targeted advertising and called for more education. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicki Walker, coordinator of the Orange County Department of Education's Drug 
Alcohol Tobacco Education project, questioned the SCRB's findings because the 
sample may have been primarily of teen-agers in certain pockets of the county 
rather than a representative sample of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A survey by the DATE project, which polled more than 1,600 students in the 
county in the fall of 1992, indicated that 12% of boys and 9.5% of girls in the 
eighth grade -- 14-year-olds -- had smoked in the previous week, Walker said.  
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Cowan, who coordinates the tobacco education program for the county 
Health Care Agency, said surveys vary because of questioning techniques and 
other details. A 1990 statewide survey, for example, showed that about 6% of 
12- and 13-year-olds had tried smoking, and only about 3% smoked in the last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 people attended Elders' conference at Cal State Fullerton, and most 
were either teachers or students who work in tobacco-prevention projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Event organizers said they were disappointed by the small turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tobacco sometimes isn't a priority with teachers or the community," said Jim 
Walker, head of Citizens for a Tobacco-Free Santa Ana. "It's a tragedy." 
Profile of Young Smokers

'3 STRIKES' COUNT UNFAIR, SUSPECT'S GIRLFRIEND SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elaine Guzman agrees tougher sentences are needed for criminals who repeatedly 
break the law. She just doesn't think that her boyfriend -- who has twice been 
convicted of violent felonies and is now charged with a third -- deserves the 
same treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Her boyfriend is Mario V. Rodriguez, a 30-year-old forklift repairman who 
appeared in court Thursday as the first Orange County defendant charged under 
the new "three strikes" law that mandates life prison sentences for repeat 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 As the arraignment hearing was postponed, Guzman, 24, sat in the courtroom, 
weeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is really unfair; he doesn't deserve this, he's a hard-working 
man," Guzman said later, adding that Rodriguez was stunned to learn about the 
sentence he now faces if convicted of assault and weapons charges stemming from 
a barroom brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can't believe it, he is just shocked," she said. "He's going into a 
depression." 
</P>
<P>
 To law enforcement officials, Rodriguez is a hardened criminal who should be 
taken off the streets, possibly for the rest of his life. To his girlfriend -- 
the mother of his 5-month-old son -- Rodriguez is a good provider and a loving 
father to his namesake. The couple plan to marry, Guzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Guzman said, she is trying to raise money for Rodriguez's 
$50,000 bail and to pay for an attorney who will fight the charges. Guzman said 
the "three-strikes" law should only be used in rare cases against dangerous 
felons. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, she said, does not fall into that category. 
</P>
<P>
 "My man is not violent, he is not abusive -- I've seen people who are worse," 
said the Garden Grove homemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez has two prior felony convictions, including a second-degree robbery 
conviction and a 1980 conviction for assault with intent to commit murder -- a 
crime he committed when he was 16, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has been convicted of several misdemeanor traffic violations, 
including drunk driving, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors, Rodriguez's third "strike" came Sunday night. He was 
arrested after allegedly shooting Donald Moore, 24, of Garden Grove in the face 
with a flare gun following a fight. Patrons tackled Rodriguez and held him for 
police. He suffered facial wounds still visible Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the new law, Rodriguez would have faced a maximum sentence of 14 years 
in prison if convicted, and would likely have served only half that with credit 
for work and good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted under the controversial new law, he faces 25 years to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say the law will help combat crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say the law is too far-reaching and unfair because it counts as 
"strikes" juvenile convictions -- as in Rodriguez's case. It is an issue that 
Deputy Public Defender Don Ronaldson said may be explored as part of 
Rodriguez's defense. The new arraignment is set for April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman said she will not turn her back on Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good provider," she said, her makeup smeared from sobbing. "He's the 
best man who has ever come into my life. We're engaged and I will marry him no 
matter what."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; HOPING KIDS TAKE SCIENCE TO HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hoped that a new program making the rounds of county schools will produce 
some future scientists by letting elementary students listen to their own 
heartbeats and those of animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Heart Beats premiered Thursday at Jonas Salk Elementary School, where 30 
fifth-graders took turns using a stethoscope and learned how the heart powers 
the body. 
</P>
<P>
 They listened to their heartbeats, at rest and after exercise, and to the 
heartbeats of a chicken and a snake. 
</P>
<P>
 It's part of the Science Jamboree on Wheels, an education program sponsored by 
the nonprofit Discover Science Center in Costa Mesa. The program aims to 
educate students about their bodies and how to stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, it hopes to interest elementary students in science, 
according to Bill D'Angelo, the program's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them to grow up to become scientists, and have fun while doing that," 
D'Angelo said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to tuning it their hearts, students "dissected" a seven-foot doll, 
whose chest unzips to reveal fabric replicas of the lungs, intestines and other 
internal organs. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Wirfs of Discovery Science Center guided the students during the 
45-minute medical examination of Stuffee, the anatomical doll. The doll was 
brought into the classroom in a wheelchair by technicians in white coats. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration for Susan Bock's fifth-grade class will be repeated in other 
schools around the county in the coming months, D'Angelo said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; PLAN FOR REFUGEE SHELTER OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About two dozen residents, mostly senior citizens, have criticized a request 
that the city Redevelopment Agency purchase a house that a group of former 
Vietnamese prisoners hopes to convert to temporary housing for newly arrived 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is up to the federal government, not the taxpayers of Westminster, to take 
care of these people," Lola O'Connor, 72, said at a Redevelopment Agency 
meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnam Political Detainees Mutual Assn. is requesting more than $170,000 
from the Redevelopment Agency to purchase a four-bedroom house on McFadden 
Avenue. The house would then be leased to the nonprofit group for $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hau Nguyen, the group's president, said that about five refugee families 
arrive in Westminster each week from Vietnam. He said the group has relied on 
private donations for the last eight years, but their needs, particularly for 
housing, have grown. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the association's plan, the Redevelopment Agency would pay $2,000 a 
month to the Westminster-based Shelter for the Homeless to manage the house and 
help the immigrants adjust to their new surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 The immigrants, who would be allowed to stay in the shelter for as long as two 
weeks, would be trained to operate appliances, shop for groceries and prepare 
food, and would take English classes, according to John Hjelm, the city's 
housing coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The program would help about 52 families each year, Hjelm said in a report to 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Money would be taken from the city's first-time home buyer and 
rental-rehabilitation programs, and from excess funds of the La Pat Street 
improvement project. 
</P>
<P>
 But Westminster residents who attended Tuesday's meeting were outraged by the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's uncalled for," said Marlene Dietrich "We have U.S. citizens out on the 
streets, needing food and shelter. Our citizens should come before anyone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Billstrom said it is not proper to single out a particular group of 
people to help with public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency members postponed action on the request, saying it must be studied 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make sure that this is not a drain on taxpayers' money," said 
Councilman Tony Lam. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency members also decided to delay a response to the Asian American 
Merchants Assn.'s request for money to develop a marketing plan for Little 
Saigon and promote the business district as a tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 The merchants' group, which organized this year's Tet Festival, also wants to 
install decorative sidewalks, lighting, signs and new landscaping to lure more 
shoppers into the hundreds of shops and restaurants in Little Saigon. BERT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; POLICE CRACK DOWN AT BUSY INTERSECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The intersection of Euclid Street and Obsidian Court, where nine accidents 
occurred in 1993, was targeted in an unusual police crackdown Thursday morning 
that resulted in ticketsbeing issued to 27 motorists, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three officers stationed near the busy intersection for more than an hour 
during the morning traffic rush cited or warned dozens of southbound motorists 
who tried to avoid the slowdown by driving straight through a right-turn only 
lane on Euclid Street, said Sgt. Larry Griswold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unusual to have three policemen doing this, but we are trying to reduce 
violations in that area," Griswold said. "The only reason we didn't issue more 
citations is because we couldn't write any faster." 
</P>
<P>
 The intersection is located just south of where Euclid Street and Edinger 
Avenue intersect. Griswold said the right-turn lane onto Obsidian Court is 
routinely used as shortcut. 
</P>
<P>
 "People didn't really complain when we stopped them," Griswold said. "They 
would say things like, 'Yeah, I was in a hurry so I thought I'd pass traffic on 
the right.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Griswold said that while the violation may seem minor, such maneuvers led to 
six people being injured last year. The violation comes with a hefty fine: $80 
to $100. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they will be stationed at the intersection again later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have to do it until we get better compliance," Griswold said. "We 
hope we don't have to keep issuing a bunch of tickets for very long. We hope 
that by doing this a few times, people will get the message." GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; SEISMIC WORK OKD FOR HISTORIC DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week unanimously approved a $1.7-million seismic 
retrofitting project to upgrade about 55 buildings in its historic downtown 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the unreinforced masonry buildings may begin as soon as August, city 
officials said at Tuesday's council meeting.The project will take about three 
years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also authorized paying a consultant up to $30,000 to review the 
expense of retrofitting the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 A city advisory committee had complained that original cost figures, from a 
number of estimators, were uneven. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory committee, made up of property owners and city officials, wants 
to make sure cost estimates are fair because buildings that need the most work 
will receive the mostmoney. 
</P>
<P>
 Obtaining the new estimates will delay the project's start by about three 
months, said city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take a little extra time," said Jack McGee with the Community 
Development Department. "But I think it's worth it to gain the confidence of 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the project began five years ago when the state enacted legislation 
requiring seismic retrofitting in designated areas. The project is funded by 
city redevelopment money, which is expected to cover about two-thirds of the 
cost to fully improve the unreinforced buildings. MARTIN MILLER

 People living as far as 50 miles from Camp Pendleton -- including many cities 
in South County -- may hear loud explosions or feel rumblings on Sunday from 3 
to 5 p.m. because of base training sessions, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosions will occur as 500-pound bombs are dropped from fixed-wing 
aircraft into the middle of the base, known as the "Zulu impact area," 
officials said in a news release. Depending on weather conditions, sound from 
the explosions could be amplified.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brea Olinda Unified School District trustees this week gave final approval to 
a policy that prohibits students from discriminating against each other and 
stresses zero tolerance against such behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not accept or condone discrimination," Assistant Supt.Peter J. 
Boothroyd said. "We will not tolerate it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a similar policy implemented earlier this month, students who display or 
distribute flyers or any kind of hate material, including stickers and buttons, 
will face suspension or expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, students are prohibited from name-calling and from 
discriminating, harassing, teasing, abusing or assaulting other students 
because of a handicap or a difference in background, ability, religion, 
culture, race, ethnicity, language, tradition or sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The "zero tolerance" policy will make students aware that district officials 
will not stand for discrimination or actions stemming from hatred for 
schoolmates, Boothroyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the policies were implemented in an effort to prevent 
racial and ethnic discrimination among students. In the past year, four 
students were suspended after racial discrimination incidents. Until last year, 
principals would call parents and counsel students against discrimination, but 
now such problems have to be reported to the district.MIMI KO

 The Brea Olinda Unified School District board has increased developer fees to 
generate revenue for new buildings and expansions of district schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Any resident or developer who plans to add rooms to homes or build houses that 
exceed 500 square feet must now pay the district $1.72 per square foot -- 7 
cents more than the current fee, Assistant Supt.Gary D. Goff said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, anyone planning to build commercial buildings will pay the 
district 28 cents per square foot -- 1 cent more than the current fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Goff said the fee helps pay for adding classrooms to schools and building new 
facilities for instructional purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 5-1 in favor of the increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Todd A. Spitzer voted against the increase. Spitzer said he 
opposes developer fees.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; REOPENING JAIL COULD BOOST CITY REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reopening the city's long-dormant jail could generate as much as $150,000 a 
year in new revenue for Seal Beach, city officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is set to vote next month on a plan to let a private 
contractor run the jail as a regional booking facility that would be used by 
Seal Beach and neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-bed facility is in the basement of the Seal Beach police station, on 
Seal Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the jail would hold arrestees from the time they are booked 
through their pretrial hearings. Currently, suspects arrested in Seal Beach are 
sent to the county's main jail in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seal Beach Jail would only accept people arrested for "low-level crimes" 
such as burglary and drunk driving. People suspected of more serious crimes 
would continue to be booked at the Santa Ana jail, said City Manager Jerry L. 
Bankston. 
</P>
<P>
 Reopening the Seal Beach Jail would ease overcrowding at the county's main 
jail, which was the subject of a recent Orange County Grand Jury report, 
Bankston said. The grand jury urged that new jails be opened to ease the 
overcrowding problem. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the plan, the private contractor would spend about 
$300,000 to renovate the jail. It could be opened later this year and might be 
operating at a profit within two years, Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several candidates in this month's City Council election have praised the jail 
plan as a smart way to increase city revenue without raising taxes. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CONCERTS BLOCKED BY COUNCIL MEMBER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outdoor rock concerts scheduled for Saturday and Sunday at an alternative 
clothing store have been canceled after objections from a City Council member. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Grace Winchell said she appealed the concert permit given the 
store, the Electric Chair, because she felt that "special events and things 
taking place downtown really need a good review." 
</P>
<P>
 But the store's controller, Patricia Bushman, says the issue is censorship of 
art and discrimination against youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Electric Chair, which also houses a body-piercing service, had received a 
permit to feature rock bands in its parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the whole thing is unfair and prejudicial," Bushman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph Bauer applauded Winchell's action at Monday's council 
meeting. He said bands that have played at the Electric Chair before have been 
"an outrage to the city." He said band members used obscene language that is 
not in keeping with a "family fair."  
</P>
<P>
 The concert would have coincided with this weekend's Main Street Festival, a 
fair that features fine arts, crafts, food and live music. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoter Chris Fahey called Winchell's appeal "ridiculous" and said the 
concert would have benefited Share Our Selves, a direct-aid charity in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're raising food for the homeless. It seems they've got bigger things to 
worry about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the bands that were scheduled to play at the Electric Chair will play 
at 8 p.m. Sunday at Our House, a coffeehouse and bar in Costa Mesa. They are 
Dirt Clod Fight, John Boy and F.H. Hill. Admission is three cans of food to be 
donated to SOS. MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; CERRITOS MAN DIES IN CRASH WITH BUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 67-year-old man was killed Thursday morning when his car crashed into the 
back of an Orange County Transit Authority bus on Lincoln Avenue near Grindlay 
Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ki Duck Lee of Cerritos was westbound on Lincoln Avenue when his car collided 
with the bus, which was preparing to pull away from a bus stop on the north 
side of the street, said Police Sgt. Ray Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee suffered head and chest injuries in the 9:30 a.m. accident and was taken 
to La Palma Intercommunity Hospital, where he died a short time later. The bus 
driver and his four passengers were not injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second OCTA bus was sent to the scene to pick up the four passengers and 
complete the morning route, said OCTA spokesman John Standiford. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said there were no skid marks at the scene of the accident and it is 
unknown how fast Lee was traveling when the accident occurred.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; BOAT MAKERS STRETCH THEIR IMAGINATIONS

 Cal State Fullerton art student Brandy Flower clutched his plastic boat, 
waiting to race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably win," he said Thursday as the 7th Annual Rubber Band-Powered 
Boat Race was about to get underway. With figures of Beavis and Butt-head 
sitting atop the rubber band-powered craft, how could he not? 
</P>
<P>
 But when the time came, a Bart Simpson Butterfinger boat cruised smoothly down 
the 0.004-nautical-mile lane as Flower's boat and two other boats weaved, 
bobbed or drifted sideways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Butterfinger's builders, Rhodri Lamba, Kenneth Lim and Joven Orozco -- 
three cousins and Cal State Fullerton art students -- grinned and gave out real 
Butterfingers to the assembled students and faculty members after the race. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went at the Rubber Band-Powered Boat Race, which participants said 
is held each year to celebrate the onset of spring break and give faculty and 
students a sense of camaraderie. Despite threatening skies and cold winds, the 
two-hour event at Cal State Fullerton went on with cheers and friendly jeers as 
racers watched their boats, for the most part, go nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't win," observed Flower afterward. Neither did Apollo Sison's craft, 
despite his boat's complicated power system of fuse, spring and rubber band and 
the figures of Beavis and Butt-head cutting off Barney the dinosaur's head on a 
guillotine. 
</P>
<P>
 He hoped, however, to win in the Grossest Boat category. 
</P>
<P>
 At the annual ritual, about 60 students, faculty members and visitors tested 
their engineering skills with boats of foam, wood, plastic and in one case, 
cinder block. Each boat had to be powered by a 28-inch-long rubber band. Most 
adhered to the theme of "Barney, Bart and Beavis and Butt-head," incorporating 
likenesses of the famed pop culture icons into their crafts. Winners received 
gift certificates from the Art Emporium and free food from various restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It lets students and faculty cut back and make fun of each other without the 
pressure of a classroom setting," said art Professor Bryan Cantley, who 
assigned the students in his 3-D art class to enter the race as a project. And, 
he added, it was educational as well, forcing art students to use engineering 
skills and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 While most used their rubber bands attached to model plane propellers as 
motors for their boats, Mike Jephcott used a catapult to throw his boat into 
the water -- at the finish line. He won the Farthest From Legal award. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't win, cheat," observed art department staffer Michael Quinn. "Art 
has no rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Some participants used their boats to make a statement. The boat of Tom 
Herberg, an art professor from Mt. San Antonio College, was a wooden tray 
holding a stack of paperwork adorned with pieces of red tape. "It's the SS 
Administrative Vessel," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 When asked what the boat race meant to him, he said, "Futility." 
</P>
<P>
 His boat promptly sank. AILEEN CHO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; PATROLS BOOSTED AFTER RASH OF BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have increased patrols in the Harborview and Newport Hills residential 
developments after 15 burglaries there within the last month, Sgt. Andy Gonis 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent burglary occurred Wednesday in the 1900 block of Port Albans 
Place, where a burglar broke through a window and stole cash from a man's 
wallet that had been left in view, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity thief who is looking for either open doors or items 
left in plain view by windows," Gonis said. "It appears to be the same person 
because of the similarities in the 15 incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonis said most of the burglaries have occurred between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. In 
most instances, residents were home and asleep when the thief entered through 
unlocked side garage doors, unlocked interior doors or broke through a window. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglar typically takes cash from purses left in sight in the kitchen area 
of homes in the two developments, which are located near the Fashion Island 
shopping center, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are asking people to make sure their place is locked up and to keep purses 
and wallets out of plain view," Gonis said. "And if they see or hear anything 
suspicious, to call police." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the burglar is asked to contact Detective Tom 
Gazsi at (714) 644-3764 or (714) 644-3717.GREG HERNANDEZ

<P>
 Four Orange County students are among 600 outstanding high school seniors 
nationwide -- 43 in California -- who have won college scholarships through an 
annual academic competition for black Americans, officials announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Distributed through the National Achievement Scholarship, the $3 million in 
awards are supported by grants from about 100 corporations, foundations and 
professional associations.An additional 200 award recipients will be named in 
late June and will receive four-year scholarships from the colleges or 
universities they plan to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of the winners announced this week will receive single-payment, 
$2,000 scholarships that were distributed on a geographical basis according to 
the black population of various regions. The other 200 winners will receive 
corporate four-year scholarships ranging from $500 to more than $2,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County students are: Sachiko V. White, of Brea Olinda High, who was 
awarded $2,000 from the National Merit Scholarship Corp.; Mashawna M. Vernon, 
of Pacifica High in Garden Grove, who was awarded an undisclosed sum from 
Texaco Foundation; Marjorie D. Terrell, of La Habra High, who was awarded 
$2,000 from the National Merit Scholarship Corp.; Homer B. Keppert, of Villa 
Park High, who was awarded an undisclosed sum from California Physician's 
Achievement Scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 95,000 black students participated in the achievement program based 
on their scores in the Pre-Scholastic Aptitude Tests. Semi-finalists and 
finalists were selected based on grades, recommendations, activities, interests 
and goals.

<P>
 A statewide organization that promotes Latino activism in politics, education 
and civil rights has a new Orange County chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 A local group of the Mexican American Political Assn., which endorses 
political candidates, has formed to provide a vehicle for interested Latino 
residents to voice their concerns and support issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time is now that we should form a MAPA chapter in Orange County to stand 
up for immigrants' rights, pushing citizenship and voter registration . . . 
(and) speaking out on hate crime," said Rueben Martinez, organizer of the local 
chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the goals of the statewide organization is to reach young Latinos, said 
Martinez, a Santa Ana barber, bookseller and active Democrat. Group members 
will try to provide Latino role models, promote education and give youths a 
sense of purpose and belonging. 
</P>
<P>
 A youth also will be chosen to join the group's board of directors, Martinez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The statewide group has taken stands on a variety of issues, including 
representation of Latinos in media, drives to encourage immigrants to become 
citizens and improvement of health conditions for rural and urban workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone interested in MAPA may attend the group's next meeting at 7 p.m. 
Wednesday. It will be held at the Martinez-Hernandez Hispanic Bookcase, 220 W. 
3rd St., Santa Ana. For information, call Martinez at: (714) 954-1151.ALICIA DI

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; PLANS FOR HISTORIC DISTRICT ADVANCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to create a historical district near City Hall are moving closer to 
becoming part of Buena Park's future. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, acting as the Community Redevelopment Agency, this week 
approved plans to move two historic homes to a new site on Beach Boulevard and 
to demolish buildings now located on the property at a cost of $10,000 to 
$16,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has bought property at 6621 and 6631 Beach Blvd. for the relocated 
homes, both currently situated at a city park site on Manchester Boulevard near 
Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 May Wong Hui, assistant director of development services, said tenants of the 
Beach Boulevard property will be relocated next month. The homes are scheduled 
to be moved in mid-May, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes are being moved to accommodate the expansion of the city's auto 
center, in which a Toyota dealership will relocate to the Manchester Boulevard 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 It is expected to cost $570,000 to move the Whitaker-Jaynes home, built in 
1887, and the Bacon House, a squatter's shack built in the 1850s, and to 
acquire and make improvements to the historical district site. Redevelopment 
agency money will pay for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate action, the City Council adopted an ordinance to change the park 
use of the present Whitaker-Jaynes site to an economic development use, namely 
the auto dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 Under redevelopment law, the city is required to find replacement property for 
the land converted from park uses to economic development. DEBRA CANO

NTSB CRASH REPORT CITES INADEQUATE SPACE BETWEEN JETS; AVIATION: BOARD SAYS 
SANTA ANA TRAGEDY COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF THE WESTWIND PILOT OR 
AIR-TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS KEPT AN 'ADEQUATE' CUSHION BEHIND BOEING 757. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stopping short of casting blame, a federal report released in Washington on 
Thursday suggests that a Dec. 15 fatal plane crash in Santa Ana may have been 
prevented if the pilot or air-traffic controllers had kept an "adequate" safety 
cushion between the aircraft and a Boeing 757 jetliner landing ahead of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the National Transportation Safety Board focused on the hazards 
posed by wake turbulence created by 757s and underscored a series of 
recommendations adopted by the NTSB last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a separate report on the Santa Ana crash will be forthcoming, 
Thursday's document cited the accident a number of times as the NTSB continues 
to pressure the Federal Aviation Administration to enact changes designed to 
prevent accidents caused by 757 wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB, which does not have regulatory power, has made 19 safety 
recommendations involving 757s to the FAA, among them, that the agency lengthen 
the minimum distances between aircraft landing behind 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 NTSB records show that there were 51 instances of aircraft caught in wake 
turbulence over the last decade, resulting in the deaths of 27 people and 
damage-destruction of 40 airplanes. The NTSB found that a disproportionate 
number of incidents -- five since December, 1992, resulting in 13 deaths -- 
involved wake turbulence from 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident in Santa Ana occurred when a twin-engine Westwind corporate jet 
was on approach to John Wayne Airport. The jet, which was 2.1 miles behind a 
757, went out of control and slammed nose-first into the ground near the Santa 
Ana Auto Mall. All five aboard, including the top two executives of the 
In-N-Out Burger chain, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 In part because of the Santa Ana accident, the NTSB unanimously recommended 
Feb. 15 that similarly sized corporate jets be kept five miles behind 757s on 
final approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana accident remains under investigation by the NTSB, but the report 
released Thursday provides the first clues as to what aviation safety officials 
believe was the cause of the crash and how it might have been prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way the pilot of the Westwind could have maintained adequate 
separation was to execute significant maneuvers," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the report says that "to prevent compromise of the separation 
requirement, the controller would have had to take positive action to change 
the Westwind's track." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the NTSB does not consider the 757 to have any design flaws, 
researchers have speculated that its unique, sleek-wing design may be the cause 
of turbulence that is unusually powerful for an aircraft of its size.

COMMISSION VOTES TO HIKE TRASH FEES; WASTE: IF APPROVED BY COUNTY SUPERVISORS, 
IT WOULD MEAN A $1 INCREASE IN THE MONTHLY BILL DESPITE THE DROP IN GARBAGE 
VOLUME DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF RECYCLING PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A county commission took the first major step Thursday toward raising landfill 
fees, a hike that for most residents would mean a $1 increase in their monthly 
garbage collection bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waste Management Commission voted 8 to 6 to increase the gate fees at 
county landfills, an expense that is passed on to consumers by the trash 
haulers who pay the fee.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County residents pay about $9 to $15 a month for trash collection 
service. The proposed hike is scheduled to go before the Board of Supervisors 
in late April; if approved, it would be in place by the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission approved the increase after reviewing a report on the 
Integrated Waste Management Department's financial prospects. Unless the county 
approves a $5 fee increase annually for five years, the independent report 
states, the agency's losses will hit $87 million by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners approved the first $5 increase on Thursday, and decided to 
address future fee hikes on a year-by-year basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The report cites the success of recycling campaigns, coupled with the regional 
downturn in development, as the causes of a 23% decrease in the volume of 
garbage going into landfills since 1989. At the same time, increasingly 
stringent federal regulations have pushed up the cost of doing business, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several commission members objected to the increase, saying it penalized 
consumers for recycling, while others wondered whether the agency was being 
managed as well as it should. Member Stan Tkaczyk, owner of a trash hauling 
service, said if the agency were a business, "I think this would say to me that 
you haven't done a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 But Murry S. Cable, the county's waste management director, said while his 
agency has cut back on staffing and facilities to keep pace with the decrease 
in garbage volume, the department has little power to combat the increasing 
cost of government regulations. Cable said the department will spend $129.5 
million this year for measures required specifically to meet those regulations, 
compared to the $57.9 million spent in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase would raise the gate fee paid by haulers from $22.75 a ton to 
$27.66.

WILDLIFE SERVICE URGED TO PROTECT PACIFIC POCKET MOUSE; ENVIRONMENT: SPEAKERS 
AT HEARING ASK THAT THE ANIMAL BE PLACED ON PERMANENT ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST. 
SUCH STATUS WOULD AFFECT PLANNED DANA POINT HEADLANDS RESORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A handful of people braved a driving rain Thursday night to urge government 
protection for the Pacific pocket mouse, a 4-inch-long rodent that could delay 
the construction of a proposed $500-million resort on the Dana Point Headlands. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to try to save a little bit of the Headlands that my family grew up 
with," said Bob Larwood, a 26-year Dana Point resident. "The Headlands is a 
wondrous place." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tony Gallagher, a member of a group called Save the Headlands: "This is 
the only part of Dana Point that is still natural." 
</P>
<P>
 The comments were made at a public hearing on a proposal by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service to place the mouse on the permanent endangered species list.  
</P>
<P>
 The service listed the mouse as endangered on an emergency basis last month 
after 39 of the mice, believed to be the last surviving members of the species 
worldwide, were discovered in about four acres of coastal sagebrush on the Dana 
Point Headlands, a peninsula just north of Dana Point Harbor.  
</P>
<P>
 The mouse habitat lies directly in the path of a proposed resort that would 
include a 400-room hotel complex and 394 homes to be built by Newport 
Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co. and Chandis Securities Co. on 121 acres 
overlooking Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The mouse "is part of California's natural heritage," Fred Roberts, a Fish and 
Wildlife Service botanist, said at the time. "They are an important part of the 
ecology." 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency listing gave officials 240 days -- or until Sept. 28 -- to 
decide whether to place the pocket mouse permanently on the endangered species 
list. If that happens, Roberts said, the developers will not be allowed to 
proceed without first convincing the service that construction would not 
further endanger the mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would have to come up with a habitat conservation plan built into this 
project that would show it would allow enough room to satisfy the scientists 
that the species could survive there," said Connie Babb, a spokeswoman for the 
Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the financial holdings of the 
Chandler family, is a principal stockholder of Times Mirror Co., which 
publishes the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The pocket mice, which had not been seen since 1971, were rediscovered during 
a survey conducted by a biologist last July at the request of the Fish and 
Wildlife Service. Once common as far as two miles inland along the Southern 
California coast from Los Angeles County's Marina del Rey and El Segundo south 
to the Mexican border, the mouse -- believed to be the smallest member of the 
rodent family -- has fallen victim to development and hungry cats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The urbanization of the coast all but wiped them out," Roberts said. "They've 
probably been at the Dana Point Headlands the whole time, but nobody's looked 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's hearing was attended by about 25 people, seven of whom spoke in 
favor of the endangered designation for the mouse. No one spoke against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the weather kept (advocates of development) away," Babb said. "I am 
extremely surprised; they have been extremely vocal." Dana Point's Tiny Mouse 
The Pacific pocket mouse is only four to six inches long from its nose to the 
tip of its tail.

</P>
<P>
 Known as Laura's House, the planned family haven is named after a South County 
woman who died in 1992 under what authorities called suspicious circumstances, 
although no evidence was found to file charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope not only to raise money for the shelter but also to educate 
people on the need for preventing domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's speakers will be authors Ann Jones and Mildred Pagelow, whose work 
has dealt extensively with family violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people know what's going on" when a woman is being physically 
abused, said Pagelow, who lives in San Clemente. "But they don't know what to 
do. We will give a list of the most important things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Pagelow suggests that people "not withdraw help" if a woman doesn't follow 
suggestions to leave her abuser. 
</P>
<P>
 "Understand there is a lot of fear going on inside her," Pagelow said, "and 
don't get tired of extending your hand."

2 BANK ROBBERY SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN FREEWAY CHASE ENDING AT EL TORO BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two bank robbery suspects were captured Thursday after a chase along the Santa 
Ana Freeway that ended at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A man entered a Bank of America branch in the 13300 block of Newport Avenue 
just after 2 p.m., handed a teller a note and fled with an undetermined amount 
of cash, according to Sgt. David Kreyling. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers in the area heard a broadcast describing the suspect and pursued the 
car south on Newport. At a gas station the suspects' car stopped, and as police 
approached, the driver ran off and was later arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The passenger then took the wheel and drove off, ultimately heading south on 
the freeway. The chase ended at the Marine base, where the second suspect fled 
ran away but was also captured, Kreyling said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the two men, both being held on suspicion of bank robbery, 
as Steven Francis Sawyer, 37, of Oceanside and Ronald Frank Corrales, 42, whose 
place of residence was unknown.

MAN, 34, SHOOTS EX-WIFE'S BOYFRIEND, SELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 34-year-old man was in critical condition Thursday with a gunshot wound to 
the head after he shot his ex-wife's boyfriend in the shoulder and then shot 
himself, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred moments after Flordelino Aquino barged into the 
apartment of his 33-year-old former wife, Josie Aquino, about 9:45 p.m. 
Wednesday, police Lt. Sam Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's boyfriend, Buddy William Hayes, 43, lives in the same apartment 
complex and was visiting with her when her ex-husband arrived armed with two 
handguns, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two men got into an altercation and there was a struggle for the gun and 
that's when Hayes was shot in the shoulder," Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes ran out into the street in front of the Creek Road apartment and was 
soon met by police officers. Meanwhile, Josie Aquino was inside trying to 
prevent her ex-husband from chasing after Hayes and shooting him again. She was 
not injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The woman blocked the door so (Aquino) turned the gun to his head and shot 
himself in front of his ex-wife," Allevato said. "She was tending to him when 
paramedics arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 Police recovered both guns near the front door of the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aquinos, who have two children, had been divorced for about three years. 
Allevato said the woman and her boyfriend had been threatened by her ex-husband 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been called out to the house on previous occasions on disturbances 
caused by the ex-husband," Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the gunman and Hayes were taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
Hayes is listed in stable condition, a hospital official said.

A DAY OF MOURNING; PACOIMA: EATERY FILLS WITH SPECULATION AND REGRET AFTER THE 
KILLING. AREA RESIDENTS BLAME THE DRUG CARTEL, THE CHIAPAS REBELS AND THE 
SYSTEM ITSELF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At Lenchita's, a small restaurant and tortilleria in Pacoima favored by 
Mexican immigrants, reaction to the assassination of the man who would be 
president of Mexico varied from conspiracy theories involving Indian rebels 
from Chiapas or vengeful drug lords to indifference to a political system that 
has allowed one party to rule for more than 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something like this had to happen for things to change in Mexico," said 
Bernardo Quintana, 45, who grew up in Mexico and El Paso, Tex. Colosio "was a 
beautiful person, but unfortunately he was with the old political system." 
</P>
<P>
 The mystery surrounding the motives of the assassin who shot Luis Donaldo 
Colosio, 44, the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or 
PRI, at a campaign appearance in Tijuana, left room for speculation among the 
noisy lunch crowd at Lenchita's. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mexican authorities arrested Mario Aburto Martinez, 23, for the 
shooting, no motive had been determined when diners gathered in the sparsely 
decorated restaurant tucked behind a Mexican deli and grocery store in the 
13600 block of Van Nuys Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is connected to the Zapatista rebels from Chiapas," said Luis 
Saavedra, 21, who left Michoacan seven years ago and now lives in Pacoima. 
Saavedra noted that the accused gunman was originally from Michoacan. 
</P>
<P>
 "People from Michoacan love Cardenas," he said, referring to Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas, 1988 presidential candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, 
who many thought had actually won the election but was denied victory by PRI 
election officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The PRI has won every presidential election in 65 years and Colosio, in turn, 
was the handpicked successor of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a 
practice resented by many Mexicans who would prefer a democratic vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think things are changing in Mexico," said Saavedra's dining companion, 
Raul Sanchez of Zamora, oblivious to the patting sound of women making 
tortillas behind the counter. "They're not stealing as much." 
</P>
<P>
 But Maria Samano of San Fernando said that making the Indian rebels the prime 
suspects is exactly what drug dealers want. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's the drug cartel that shot him," said Samano, 40, who left her 
native Colima state in Mexico 30 years ago. "They want to make it look 
political, like it stems from Chiapas." 
</P>
<P>
 Samano said she fears that violence and terrorism will break out in Mexico and 
is now uncertain if she will allow her two teen-age daughters to travel alone 
to visit relatives there this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Rivera, 28, of Mission Hills, who was eating lunch with her parents, 
Andrew and Gloria Hernandez, sees the assassination not as a political issue 
but as a human tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know too much about Mexican politics, but I think it is a shame that 
this would happen to someone who is trying to help others," Rivera said over 
the din of crying children and clanging silverware. "For whatever reason, 
violence is not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera's mother, who described herself as a devout Jehovah's witness, said 
it's now all in the hands of God. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politicians promise a lot but they don't deliver because they are not 
perfect," said Gloria Hernandez, a native of Durango, Mexico. "But God is 
perfect. Men are not going to be able to solve the problems of the world. Only 
God can do that."

LOCKHEED BILLS AREA FIRMS FOR TOXICS CLEANUP; BURBANK: THE DEFENSE GIANT SEEKS 
MILLIONS FROM SMALLER COMPANIES IT SAYS SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR GROUND-WATER 
POLLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lockheed Corp., on the hook for a massive Superfund cleanup in Burbank, has 
demanded financial contributions from dozens of firms it says also polluted the 
ground water, and is threatening to file a lawsuit next month against those who 
won't pay up. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry and fearful of Lockheed's legal firepower, many of these small to 
mid-size businesses are undecided whether to settle or fight, and are 
scrambling to determine if they have insurance coverage to meet Lockheed's 
demands -- which range from $50,000 to $15 million per company and total almost 
$70 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I go get a lawyer and spend money I don't have?" asked Ed Davis, owner of 
Davis Machining Co., who said Lockheed's bill for $320,000 is nearly half his 
annual sales. "It's tough enough to make machine payments. . . . I've never 
really been in this kind of predicament before." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense giant's demand for $480,000 from B.J. Grinding Inc., exceeds the 
annual sales of the machine shop, said Glenda Hoiseth, who runs the firm with 
her husband. "Essentially this would put us out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe the David versus Goliath story that they're spinning for 
you," retorted Lockheed lawyer Pierce O'Donnell, who said the firms together 
created as much pollution as Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lockheed has a genuine desire to be fair," said O'Donnell, adding that it 
would be unfair for Lockheed and federal taxpayers to bear 100% of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell said so many of the firms have asked to meet with Lockheed to 
discuss cost-sharing that today's lawsuit deadline established by the firm has 
been extended to April 25. "We actually are negotiating some settlements as we 
speak with some smaller players and some mid-size players," O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is financial responsibility for purging ground-water supplies of 
chemical solvents that leaked and spilled over many years, and that have seeped 
into the vast reservoir that underlies the San Fernando Valley -- idling 
Burbank's municipal water supply wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed is finishing construction of a ground-water treatment system that 
will continuously cleanse some 12,000 gallons of water per minute for up to 20 
years -- at a cost the company says will exceed $172 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In moving against its smaller neighbors, the defense giant is standing in the 
shoes of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in what resembles a 
high-stakes game of tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed became "it" in 1991, when it entered into an agreement with the EPA 
to design, build and run the Burbank treatment system until the year 2000. The 
consent decree came under provisions of the federal Superfund program -- which 
requires polluters to fund cleanup of toxic waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA originally had targeted dozens of Burbank-area firms in addition to 
Lockheed -- but most refused to settle, or offered only a token amount. Once 
Lockheed opened its deep pockets, assuring completion of the work, the EPA lost 
interest in the other firms -- leaving Lockheed to decide whether to pursue 
them on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed came under sharp attack from some environmentalists and members of 
Congress when news reports revealed that the firm stood to recover most of its 
cleanup expenses from the government by charging the costs as overhead in 
Pentagon contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lockheed's tentative agreement with the Defense Department also required 
the firm to seek cleanup contributions from its insurance carriers and other 
polluters. 
</P>
<P>
 In letters mailed in December, Lockheed lawyers broke the news to about 40 
Burbank-area businesses, some of which had been on the EPA's list of suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters invited company representatives to a January meeting "to discuss 
cost-sharing for the cleanup of Burbank's ground water, which at present is 
proceeding virtually at Lockheed's sole expense," according to a copy obtained 
by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Jan. 26 meeting at the Burbank Hilton had the trappings of 
civility -- "Coffee, Greeting & Introductions" was the first item on the 
printed agenda -- the atmosphere was described as frosty. Lockheed gave the 
companies until March 25 to open their wallets or be sued. To underscore the 
message, Lockheed lawyers followed up by mailing a draft copy of the 21 page 
complaint to each attendee. 
</P>
<P>
 This "blazing guns" approach was needless and insulting, complained David 
Goodreau, chairman of the California Industrial Leadership Council, who 
attended the meeting on behalf of several members of the trade group, which 
represents small manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in remarks to the gathering, and in a written report outlining evidence it 
amassed, Lockheed said it was merely asking for each firm's fair share. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed said its research had shown it was responsible for 59% of the 
pollution, whereas "other parties are responsible for 41% of those costs." 
Lockheed said this meant it should bear $102 million of the $172 million, and 
that the others should split the balance based on the pollution each created. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed said its cost allocations drew on a variety of sources -- including 
soil and ground-water data obtained from the EPA and California Regional Water 
Quality Control Board, and "private investigator interviews of employees." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that some companies are liable, Goodreau said, "Lockheed's 
allocation of costs has got more holes in it than Swiss cheese." 
</P>
<P>
 Under orders from the regional water board, some of the firms previously spent 
thousands of dollars to test and clean up areas of stained soil, and believed 
their involvement had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say they didn't spill -- and in some cases, never even used -- 
trichloroethylene(TCE) and perchloroethylene(PCE), degreasing solvents that are 
the most prevalent pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
 This alone, however, would not get them off the hook. Under the exceptionally 
broad provisions of the Superfund law, the owner of a contaminated site can be 
held responsible for pollution that occurred under a prior owner. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials said the Lockheed strategy is not unique. "It's not unusual at 
all that a company that's settled with EPA would . . . turn around and seek . . 
. contributions from other parties they believe are responsible, or that 
private-party litigation would occur without the government being involved," 
said Thomas P. Mintz, assistant regional counsel for the EPA in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, this is not even the first use of the tactic by Lockheed and its 
lawyers. Since reaching an agreement with EPA on cleanup of the Operating 
Industries landfill Superfund site in Monterey Park, Lockheed and a group of 
other large companies have extracted settlements of about $47 million from 
cities and waste haulers who also used the site. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell, a lawyer for the big firms, described that case as the "largest 
private cost recovery settlement" in the history of Superfund -- a distinction 
that could belong to the Burbank case if Lockheed is successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodreau said the Burbank dispute has prompted his group to seek congressional 
support for federal low-interest loans to help small businesses pay costs of 
environmental compliance.

 Following a national appeal to its members, the B'nai B'rith Jewish fraternal 
order has presented $70,000 in earthquake relief to the Salvation Army, the 
American Red Cross and two Jewish organizations in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Checks of $20,000 and $10,000 were presented on Tuesday to representatives of 
the Salvation Army in the San Fernando Valley and Santa Monica, respectively; 
checks of $18,000 and $7,000 went to Red Cross officials in the Valley and 
Santa Monica, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The presentation took place at Sova, a kosher food pantry in Reseda operated 
by the Jewish Community Centers Assn. Sova was presented a check for $10,000 
and the Encino lodge of B'nai B'rith was given $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Maroko of Los Angeles, president of the 10-state Western regional body of 
B'nai B'rith, said the gifts were made "to provide tangible demonstration of 
concern" by the fraternal order for suffering caused by the Jan. 17 earthquake.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; DOG SNIFFS OUT DRUGS PLANTED IN FORENSIC CLASS 
</P>

 Magnum the dog has a nose for narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 The golden retriever -- a seven-year veteran of the Port of Los Angeles police 
department -- showed how keen his olfactory senses were at a demonstration put 
on by detectives at James Monroe High School in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 After containers of marijuana, heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine were hidden 
in a music classroom, Detective Leo Stekkinger led Magnum on a search of the 
room. The white-faced, rust-colored dog sniffed the teacher's podium, desk and 
metal cabinet as they were pointed out to him by Stekkinger. At a cardboard box 
under the desk, Magnum reacted as though he'd caught a whiff of a T-bone steak, 
scratching at and tearing open the box -- which contained heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 Using his trained schnoz as an antenna, Magnum also homed in on stashes in the 
piano bench, a bookshelf and a piece of luggage on a side table.  
</P>
<P>
 The retriever came to the school -- a law and government magnet in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District -- to participate in forensic science teacher 
Kathleen Floor's class on how evidence is gathered for criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brings what we've been talking about to life for the kids," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug-sniffing dogs such as Magnum receive four to six weeks of training. 
Trainer Tom Romero said the dogs are made to believe that their favorite ball 
smells like drugs and that they are looking for their toy when they are 
sniffing for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 To inspire Magnum to search out drugs in Floor's class, Stekkinger first threw 
him a red plastic ball, and when the dog retrieved it, patted and praised him. 
Then the detective pretended to throw the ball, tucked it in his armpit, and 
indicated where he wanted Magnum to search. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration sparked a debate about animal exploitation among three 
students after the assembly. Sophomore Meena Kang said Magnum's work is an 
example of humans using animals for their own benefit, while Evan Zelig, 
another 10th-grade student, said he thought Magnum's special abilities should 
be utilized. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of a sad thought that these beautiful dogs don't realize that what 
they're doing is dangerous," said junior Berek Marcus, because a dog could die 
from accidentally ingesting heroin if not treated immediately. "I'm in favor of 
the idea . . . but it's a necessary evil." KAY HWANGBO

<P>
 Work began this week on new car-pool lanes on both sides of the Ventura 
Freeway along four miles of road between the Golden State and Glendale 
freeways, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Chumo Construction, the Baldwin Park construction firm that will 
undertake the $4.5-million project, will restripe that portion of the road and 
build a new concrete median between the lanes, according to Caltrans, the state 
transportation agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the work will be done at night, but will require some lane closures, 
the agency said. The project is scheduled for completion early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is part of a 15-year project undertaken by Caltrans, which is working 
to build a network of car-pool lanes across most of Los Angeles County. CHIP

 A city zoning administrator on March 2 ordered five Van Nuys motels to hire 
security guards and work with police to reduce crime or risk being shut down. 
The measure was lauded by community leaders but criticized by motel operators 
as expensive and unfair. Now some community leaders concerned about crime on 
Sepulveda Boulevard have called for the city to extend its crackdown to include 
other 24-hour businesses that may increase crime in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Should businesses believed to contribute to the high crime rate be required to 
reduce their hours and hire security guards, or should other measures be 
considered? 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. James McMurray, commander of the Police Department's Van Nuys station:  
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer, as we have done, to deal with these (businesses) on a case-by-case 
basis. Those businesses that have demonstrated an inability to control their 
clientele should be closed. But there are some businesses in that area that are 
perfectly capable of conducting business without drawing prostitution and they 
should be allowed to continue. We are in touch with those community groups so 
we know almost the next morning if a business is adding to the problem or not. 
It's better energy spent on those few specific ones rather than targeting 
everything."

investigation of all 11 motels in his district:

 "I think it is appropriate for the city to require additional controls on 
those businesses which contribute to certain types of crime in the 
neighborhood. We have done this for many years with liquor stores, dance halls 
and the like. The city attorney has advised the city that we can legally take 
additional steps to make business owners responsible for what occurs on their 
premises and in large measure these have been supported by the Los Angeles 
Police Department and the community organizations in the neighborhoods where 
these problems exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Romana Catton, police community representative for a Sepulveda Boulevard 
neighborhood watch group and founder of Unified Community Watch: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can generalize and say every 24-hour restaurant and store. 
I think you have to pinpoint businesses that clearly contribute to the crime, 
which is also verified by police reports. . . . Since crime is so prevalent on 
the boulevard in the late evening hours, businesses that do contribute to the 
crime need to have their hours addressed and on-site security. I'm not saying 
they absolutely have to have it, but it needs to be addressed. . . . LAPD knows 
which businesses contribute to crime. There are some businesses on the 
boulevard that are open 24 hours that I don't think contribute to crime. I 
don't think they should investigate every 24-hour store. It's unethical and 
very expensive. I don't think people who run a legitimate business should be 
penalized and looked into.  
</P>
<P>
 Heesun Ho, manager of El Cortez Motel, which was ordered to hire security and 
follow other instructions: 
</P>
<P>
 "The high crime rate is all over L.A. these days. Accusing the businesses 
won't solve the problem. If they want to solve the problem, they are supposed 
to solve it as a community. The small businesses are not in a position to pay 
these security guards. If this happens, these businesses will close and go to 
another area. More police power over here with some reasonable tax rates (is 
needed). It affects a lot of honest business people. That's not a fair way. 
This is a community-wide problem."

GLENDALE/BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; EDUCATORS SEE LIMITS TO OPEN ENROLLMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Glendale educators believe a policy allowing parents greater latitude to 
choose what school their child attends is overdue, they say it will be 
difficult to provide space for more students in the district's most crowded 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Board of Education will review Tuesday a proposal designed to 
meet provisions of a state law that requires California school districts to 
adopt open enrollment policies by July 1. The board is scheduled to vote on a 
proposed choice plan April 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Jane Whitaker said educators have long ignored parents' 
requests for greater choice in their children's education. 
</P>
<P>
 The district proposal requires parents to file applications requesting that 
their children be allowed to attend a school other than their neighborhood 
school.  
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Student Services then will place applications into a pot for 
each school and randomly draw requests to match the number of slots available. 
When each school is full, officials will continue to draw names to be placed on 
a waiting list.  
</P>
<P>
 Donald Empey, deputy superintendent of educational services, said some schools 
may have no vacancies to fill. "It is possible that many schools will have no 
openings; a lot will depend on the movement of kids from school to school," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of spaces available for additional students at each school will be 
determined by the school's recommended capacity minus its projected enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also must consider spaces filled by a permit system currently in 
place that allows parents to transfer their child to another school for 
child-care reasons, or for a specific curriculum. The district issued 500 
transfer permits for the 1993-94 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in the Los Angeles Unified School District, Glendale educators do not 
expect a clash between the choice system and school integration policy. The 
district's student body is racially mixed, eliminating the need to maintain a 
balance at individual schools, Empey said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board adopts the plan, it will send a letter explaining the choice 
policy to parents in early May. Applications to transfer schools would then be 
due by May 27. Administrators are researching how many spots will be available 
districtwide. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; FUNDS SOUGHT FOR COMMUNITY PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing prostitutes who ply their trade next to schools and a principal who 
spends his own money to buy shoes for students, North Hills civic leaders 
pleaded Tuesday with city and state officials to help them find funds for 
employment, after-school and police programs in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Swan, president of the North Hills Community Coordinating Council, told a 
group of about 50 at the United Methodist Church on Rayen Street that the 
community's problems are tied to high density, poverty and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Swan coordinated the meeting in the hopes of recruiting movers and shakers for 
new subcommittees in his council that could tackle the community's problems. 
Sign-up sheets were set up for a community outreach, public safety, and grants 
and funding subcommittees. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the average household income is only about $23,000, only $2,000 more 
than in South-Central Los Angeles. In one area of North Hills, he added, about 
20,000 people live in half of a square mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Balderrama, principal at Langdon Avenue Elementary School, said as many as 
three in four students need some kind of counseling to deal with problems at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to get across to a student when his mind is somewhere else," said 
Balderrama, who says he sometimes makes a run to the nearby shoe store to buy 
students shoes out of his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Reimann, principal of Sepulveda Middle School, said he has a hard time 
just convincing parents to keep their children in his middle school, even 
though his students ranked third in the Valley among those participating in a 
statewide learning assessment test. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to sell people on the quality of education you can provide when, at 
the same time, there are people trying to sell their bodies across the street," 
said Reimann, whose school rests near a corner of crime-ridden Sepulveda 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Swan said he will contact those who signed up for the subcommittees for a 
meeting in two weeks. The meetings will provide initial ideas for funding and 
networking, then report back to the full North Hills Community Coordinating 
Council, a non-governmental citizens group. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; COUNCIL OKS PLAN TO BOOST RETAIL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council has unanimously approved a long-term development 
plan for the central Reseda business district meant to kick-start 
revitalization in the aging shopping district. 
</P>
<P>
 The document, passed Wednesday and formally known as the Reseda Central 
Business District Specific Plan, has been in the works since 1988.While it was 
being developed, the city instituted a temporary moratorium to halt the opening 
of new auto shops, pawn shops and billiard halls in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year Specific Plan covers the business area along Sherman Way between 
Wilbur and Lindley avenues and along Reseda Boulevard between Kittridge and 
Saticoy streets. 
</P>
<P>
 It attempts to encourage revitalization by establishing zoning guidelines that 
promote commercial and retail development while limiting industrial projects 
and auto-repair shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also uses zoning guidelines to require more landscaping, trees and 
other amenities to develop an atmosphere that would draw more pedestrian 
traffic to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passage of this Specific Plan could not have come at a more opportune time," 
said City Councilwoman Laura Chick. "Reseda businesses and residents have 
fought for this plan for years." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was drafted with the help of a 15-member advisory panel of Reseda 
residents and business owners. Two members of the panel, Ann Kinzel and Steve 
Aufhauser, praised the City Council for adopting the Specific Plan. HUGO MARTIN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL SCHEDULED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earthquake-related hazardous waste can be brought to Van Nuys Airport for 
disposal today, Saturday and part of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick's office, the hazardous 
waste roundup is by appointment only and applies only to hazardous waste 
discovered after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be a container damaged in the earthquake and found after people were 
cleaning up their garage," said Laura Garcia, spokeswoman for Greenfield 
Environmental Hazard & Household Waste, which contracts the hazardous waste 
pickup for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazardous waste includes any liquid, solid or gaseous material labeled toxic, 
poison or flammable. Many hazardous items are found in the household, including 
cleaning products, pesticides, motor oils and paint. 
</P>
<P>
 The roundup will be held today, Saturday and Thursday through April 2 from 9 
a.m. to 1 p.m. Each participant will be required to sign a statement verifying 
that material deposited is waste created by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 To make an appointment, call the household hazardous waste hot line at (800) 
98-TOXIC or (800) 988-6942. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MAN ARRESTED AGAIN UNDER BAN ON GANGS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first gang member to be convicted of violating the court injunction aimed 
at curbing Blythe Street gang activities is in trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie Gonzales, 19, who goes by his gang name of Speedy, was arrested twice 
last week on additional charges that he violated the injunction and also the 
provisions of his probation, according to a statement released Wednesday from 
the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 These arrests marked his third and fourth since his conviction in August on 
violating the injunction that bans possession of a pager, obstruction of 
traffic and other activities associated with gangs in the Blythe Street area. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 17, according to the statement, police say they spotted Gonzales on 
Chase Street at the northern end of the area defined by the injunction, 
stopping traffic and wearing a pager. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Gonzales was arrested on a charge that he entered an area that 
is off limits to him under the terms of his probation. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the latest two arrests is scheduled for April 6 in Van Nuys 
Municipal Court. DAVID COLKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; VALLEY COLLEGE VOIDS NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The faculty president at Valley College in Van Nuys issued a letter Thursday 
rescinding a no-confidence vote taken last month against college President Mary 
Lee over her decision to reopen the school two days after the Jan. 17 
earthquake when other colleges in the area remained closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the campus, Valley College Academic Senate President Jack Sterk 
said he was "setting aside" the Feb. 9 vote that he had favored and helped 
orchestrate. Sterk said the dispute had been rendered moot by last week's 
announcement that Lee will assume the presidency of Pierce College in Woodland 
Hills on April 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "Further debate would be unfair and unproductive. The tone of the debate has 
grown increasingly bitter, hostile and unfortunately personal," Sterk wrote. 
"Continuing the debate only threatens to divide the faculty and undermine the 
support and unity the LAVC faculty should give to its new president," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee has insisted that she acted properly in reopening the campus quickly, 
saying it was safe at the time and there was no reason to wait. But faculty 
leaders complained they were not consulted on the decision, some questioned 
whether the buildings were properly inspected and some just called the timing 
insensitive. 
</P>
<P>
 At an Academic Senate meeting Thursday, Sterk said he still disagrees with Lee 
over the decision, particularly the lack of consultation with faculty members. 
But he conceded that there was a question about the standing of the original 
vote, specifically that there may not have been a quorum of faculty members 
present, as Lee had maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterk said Lee's critics had been planning at Thursday's Academic Senate 
meeting to pursue holding a formal facultywide vote by ballot on the 
no-confidence motion. But Sterk said the plan was aborted by Lee's impending 
transfer, since the faculty could not hold such a vote against Lee once she no 
longer leads the college. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting at Pierce College on Thursday, the Los Angeles Community College 
District's acting chancellor, Neil Yoneji, told faculty members that Lee's 
transfer had nothing to do with the prior no-confidence vote. He said the move 
was spurred solely by the need to find a replacement for Pierce President 
Lowell Erickson, who plans to return to teaching. JOHN CHANDLER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: KINDERGARTNERS ENACT EXODUS FOR MODEL SEDER

 Pretending to be the biblical figure Moses, 5-year-old Kyle Sullivan led his 
people on a make-believe trek from Egypt to Israel on Thursday at the Adat Ari 
El school and synagogue in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow kindergartners played Egyptian soldiers who drowned in the Red Sea 
while trying to stop the Exodus of Jewish slaves during the model Seder, a sort 
of dress rehearsal for the coming feasts celebrating Passover. 
</P>
<P>
 "My favorite part is when they (the soldiers) cross the Red Sea and it closes 
in on 'em," said Kyle, who wore a white rag and headband on his head during the 
skit as his mother looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 At Jewish day schools throughout Los Angeles, model Seders full of symbolism 
are being held to help children know what to do and expect when the actual 
Seders take place in Jewish homes on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids aren't the only ones sitting through the preparatory ceremonies. For 
years, adults have also been drawn to synagogues, jails, hospitals and nursing 
homes for model Seders, said Michele Kirsch, administrative associate for the 
Board of Rabbis in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Passover, some say, has taken on a wider meaning as a holiday for any and all 
suffering groups of people, including earthquake victims and former cult 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 At Adat Ari El, 20 Russian immigrants have been invited to take part in a 
community model Seder on Saturday night, said Principal Lana Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Marcus pulled a fake beard over her head and posed as the prophet 
Elijah in front of a group of parents and their kindergarten children, hoping 
that the kids would "see a connection with the past and with the past to the 
present." 
</P>
<P>
 The kindergartners sang from orange prayer books and ate from paper plates 
with symbolic food, including a bitter herb representing the bitterness of 
slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Alexander, a rabbi at the school, held a disposable camera as she 
watched her 5-year-old daughter, Shira Aitchison, participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "As parents, we are very proud of how much they've learned by the time they're 
5 years old," Alexander said. "They're already a part of carrying on the 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 During one skit, some of the children picked up toy hammers and shovels and 
led the entire group in the following verses: 
</P>
<P>
 "For it's work and work and work, every day and every night. For it's work and 
work and work, when it's dark and when it's light."  
</P>
<P>
 "It teaches our children about persecution," Anne Sullivan, Kyle's mother, 
said of the program. "We make a very big deal about this because we want to 
make sure our children don't grow up and persecute other people." VIVIEN LOU

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PLANNERS LOOK TO PUBLIC FOR VISION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Planners drawing the blueprint for future growth in Los Angeles are looking 
for ideas from the public on how the city should look, feel and move in the 
next century. 
</P>
<P>
 At public workshops Saturday morning in Tujunga and Monday night in 
Northridge, planners want San Fernando Valley residents and merchants to 
describe how they envision their communities developing over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The ideas will be incorporated into a revision of the General Plan, the 
document that serves as the city's land-use "constitution" and directs how Los 
Angeles will grow in the long-term. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, planners want the public to comment on preliminary ideas for 
future growth that seek to accommodate more people while limiting the impact on 
traffic congestion, sewage capacity and air quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's workshop in Tujunga begins at 9 a.m. in the auditorium of the 
Sunland-Tujunga Municipal Center, 7747 Foothill Blvd. Monday's workshop in 
Northridge begins at 6:30 p.m. in the main building of the Northridge 
Recreation Center, 18300 Lemarsh St. 
</P>
<P>
 Both workshops last about three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 At workshops in other parts of the city, residents reacted favorably to ideas 
such as mingling apartments and condominiums with shops and offices to create 
dense urban villages throughout Los Angeles. The thinking behind such 
"mixed-use" communities is that they encourage less use of the automobile 
because most destinations are within walking distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, by encouraging more development in certain areas, planners hope to ease 
the pressure for changes in single-family neighborhoods. Planners envision that 
the urban villages would be linked by public transit such as rail lines or 
express buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners caution, however, that whatever plan emerges from the two-year 
process may take several more years to become reality. Even then, changes will 
be slow. AARON CURTISS

 Three men were ordered to stand trial Thursday on a murder charge stemming 
from a drive-by shooting, but a judge dismissed a second controversial murder 
count in the death of a fetus carried by a shooting victim.

 Concluding a preliminary hearing, Van Nuys Municipal Court Judge Robert L. 
Swasey determined that prosecutors had presented enough evidence to show that 
16-year-old Nikki Foley was murdered as she stood outside a party last year in 
Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three defendants, who allegedly are gang members, only Robert Harvey, a 
20-year-old North Hills man, was identified by a witness as a gunman in the May 
15, 1993, attack. A second shooter remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others -- Brandon Reed, 22, of Sun Valley, and Ronald Ausborne, 20, of 
North Hollywood -- did not fire weapons, according to the testimony, but 
prosecutors consider them liable for the crime because they participated in the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, prosecutors conceded they had insufficient evidence to prove that a 
barrage of shots fired led to the death of a 3-month-old fetus carried by a 
15-year-old girl who was wounded in the attack. Swasey agreed and did not order 
a trial on the second murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The expectant mother, Mona Moore, survived her wounds, but her fetus showed no 
signs of life when she was brought to the hospital for treatment. In addition 
to the question of when life begins, Deputy Dist. Atty. Franco Baratta was 
faced with proving that the fetus was alive when Moore was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore did not obtain prenatal care, according to Baratta, so he could not show 
that the fetus had a heartbeat prior to the shooting. The California Supreme 
Court is currently weighing the issue of when a fetus is viable -- 22 weeks, as 
is now the accepted rule, or at about seven weeks, just past the embryonic 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling means prosecutors will not be able to seek the death penalty for 
the three men accused in the shooting. If convicted on a single first-degree 
murder charge, each defendant could be sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey, Reed and Ausborne will be arraigned in Van Nuys Superior Court on 
April 7. THOM MROZEK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; OFFICE CENTER DRAWS SEVERAL CIVIC GROUPS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A de facto Sun Valley community center is being created in a building on 
Sunland Boulevard, thanks to a variety of civic organizations that have decided 
to locate their offices there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Valley Chamber of Commerce and the North Hollywood division of the Los 
Angeles Police Department lease space in the building in the 8100 block of 
Sunland Boulevard.City Councilman Richard Alarcon said he also plans to lease 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility has a community room for meetings, workshops and social events 
for up to 50 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would want to have a deputy there who would have a very close relationship 
with the community," Alarcon said. He said he had an oral agreement with the 
building owner to use the space but a firm contract has not been settled. 
</P>
<P>
 While the meeting room is available, it is still not furnished, said Doriane 
Lee Parker, president of the Sun Valley chamber. She said the purpose of the 
room is to give local groups a central meeting place, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows what anybody else is doing and there is no way to get the word 
out," Parker said.  
</P>
<P>
 The chamber is leasing the new office space and will be managing the use of 
the community room. A small cleaning fee may be charged to those who use it, 
Parker said. A grand opening for the new center is tentatively planned for 
April 21. ED BOND

TRIAL UNDER WAY IN DUAL MURDER CASE; COURTS: MARY ELLEN SAMUELS ALLEGEDLY HAD 
HER HUSBAND KILLED AND THEN HAD THE HIT MAN EXECUTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Flourishing a large blown-up photograph of the defendant wearing only $100 
bills and a smile, a prosecutor told jurors Thursday, "This is the real Mary 
Ellen Samuels . . . clothed only with the blood money of her husband." 
</P>
<P>
 Spectators gasped. Camera operators from tabloid television shows zoomed in. 
And jurors leaned forward in their seats as Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Maurizi 
walked the picture past the jury box in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 So began the two-month murder trial of Samuels, 45, who is accused of hiring a 
hit man to shoot her estranged husband, a Hollywood camera operator, and then 
hiring more hit men to kill the original executioner to hide the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Philip Nameth asked jurors to keep an open mind until the 
outwardly demure Samuels can explain how she came to strike such a pose when 
she takes the witness stand in about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels is charged with two counts each of murder, soliciting murder, 
conspiracy and a single count of attempted murder. If convicted, she could 
become the fifth woman currently on California's Death Row, according to the 
Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial gain motivated Samuels to murder, Maurizi alleged. The couple, 
married in 1980, were divorcing and Mary Ellen Samuels "wasn't satisfied with 
half the good life," Maurizi said. Although she had filed for the divorce, she 
didn't want to give up her husband's pension, insurance policies and a Subway 
sandwich shop he'd bought her, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Samuels, 40, who had worked on films such as "Heaven Can Wait" and 
"Lethal Weapon," was found dead in the hallway of his Bahama Street home in 
North Hills on Dec. 9, 1988. Dressed only in boxer shorts, he appeared to be 
headed toward his tanning bed when the gunman -- whose identity is unknown to 
this day -- surprised him, hit him over the head, then shot him through a 
pillow with a 16-gauge shotgun, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the first things this poor grieving widow did was fly to Las Vegas and 
buy a fur coat," Maurizi said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the defense, Nameth suggested that Samuels, who was not initially a 
suspect, was framed by the now-retired police detective in her case after she 
refused to date him. The detective kept photographs he'd found of her dressed 
in a bikini and negligee, told her when his wife was out of town and invited 
her out for dinner and drinks, Nameth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nameth also told jurors that Robert Samuels had a drinking problem. The 
defense attorney also said that he abused Mary Ellen Samuels and molested her 
daughter Nicole Samuels-Moroianu, then a teen-ager, when he drank. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi said the allegations of abuse were nothing more than a manipulative 
woman's attempt to gain sympathy for her murder plot, which she discussed with 
"anyone who would listen" during bar-hopping outings with friends. She also 
discounted the allegations against the detective as another attempt at 
manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robert Samuels made one mistake," Maurizi said. "He provided too well for his 
family in the event of his untimely death." 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, Maurizi said, "Robert Samuels had outlived his usefulness to her. 
. . . She wanted it all. She wanted the limousines. She wanted the fancy cars 
and the fancy clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development in another courtroom on Thursday, Samuels was 
replaced by Susan Conroy -- Robert Samuels' sister -- as administrator of his 
estate. Attorney Robert Pike said only about $33,000 is left in the estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nameth said the late hit man, James Bernstein, acted on his own out of twisted 
love for Samuels-Moroianu, who claimed to have been raped by Robert Samuels, 
her adoptive father. He is believed to have hired the gunman who killed Robert 
Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maurizi said the 27-year-old Bernstein, a low-level drug dealer, was 
manipulated by Samuels-Moroianu and her mother. For a while, Maurizi said, 
Bernstein "enjoyed being kept by two beautiful women." Samuels-Moroianu "even 
pretended to be engaged to him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein had to die, Maurizi said, when he showed weakness under police 
pressure. If he confessed, Maurizi said, it would mean an end to the 
limousines, Porches and trips to Cancun that Samuels had enjoyed during the 
months after her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels-Moroianu's status as a witness was unclear Thursday. She hopes to 
testify about the abuse for her mother's defense, Nameth said, but has been 
identified by prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator in the case. Judge 
Michael Hoff denied a defense request to give Samuels-Moroianu immunity from 
prosecution on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other prosecution witnesses who were involved in or knew of the plots will be 
testifying under grants of immunity or under terms of plea bargains that 
allowed them to plead guilty to lesser charges.

78 BUILDINGS GIVEN DEMOLITION REPRIEVE; RECOVERY: CITY IS TOLD FUNDS ARE 
AVAILABLE TO RESTORE HISTORIC STRUCTURES, EVEN THOSE NOT OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Although a Los Angeles city panel granted 78 quake-damaged buildings reprieves 
from demolition, preservationists warned Thursday that the city's demolition 
process may be moving too fast to save historically significant structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings reviewed by the city's Building and Safety Commission were the 
first of more than 360 quake-damaged structures citywide that were "red-tagged" 
and declared public nuisances. The owners were given 30 days to make repairs or 
face demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 State and local preservationists said they fear that many historic buildings 
may be razed because property owners do not know that $5 million in federal 
grants are available to restore such structures. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they said the city's record of historically significant buildings 
is not complete because a survey in the San Fernando Valley has not been 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the Valley has historic buildings, despite the myth that the Valley 
has no historically significant buildings," said Pam O'Connor of Historic 
Preservation Partners, an alliance of state and local historic preservation 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Building and safety officials said public safety -- not historical 
significance -- was top priority when buildings were inspected after the quake. 
However, they said buildings declared historically significant by the city or 
state will not be demolished without a city review. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Connor and other preservationists said many historic buildings, 
particularly in the Valley, have not been recognized by the city. "We believe 
we need time to review this," said Linda Dishman, Los Angeles Conservancy 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the availability of historic restoration funds came as a welcome 
surprise to the engineer hired to restore a 96-year-old, four-unit apartment in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Valencia said the building's owner was struggling to find the money for 
repairs. "I think it will be good news for the owner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another historic building declared a public nuisance was the Cahuenga fire 
station in Hollywood, the largest one west of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Building Inspector Larry Galstain said the city has yet to file plans 
to repair the building. But he added that city officials have notified him that 
the building will be restored. "Obviously, it's not going to be demolished," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of the 78 buildings were notified two weeks ago that they had 30 days 
to make repairs or the city would hire a contractor to demolish the structures. 
More than 50 of the buildings are in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the commission either granted extensions on the demolition 
deadlines or postponed final decisions for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most owners appealing for more time said they were in the process of 
submitting plans for repairs. A few said they needed an extension because they 
had yet to get loans or insurance settlements for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of a red-tagged five-unit apartment complex in Sherman Oaks said she 
was debating whether to rebuild because quake-damaged buildings on both sides 
had been abandoned and overrun by gang members and graffiti vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission gave her 45 days to get a repair permit and another 90 days to 
complete repairs.

500 INMATES INVOLVED IN FIGHTS AT JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 500 inmates battled each other for several hours in five separate 
brawls at the Peter Pitchess Honor Rancho Wednesday and Thursday, but the 
fighting caused no serious injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence, which broke out between Latino and African American prisoners at 
the jail, is the latest in a series of brawls between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman said it was unclear what 
led to the latest series of disturbances, but in the past authorities have 
blamed the fights on a power struggle between African American and Latino 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, 17 prisoners suffered minor cuts and bruises and no deputies were 
injured, spokesman Gabe Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting began about 9 p.m. Wednesday in a dormitory in the jail's east 
facility when 120 inmates began throwing objects at each other, Ramirez said. 
Deputies were able to quell that fight without using force. 
</P>
<P>
 About four hours later, however, at 1 a.m., 124 prisoners brandishing broken 
broomsticks and safety razors began fighting in another dormitory at the 
sprawling jail. Deputies were able to restore order within a few minutes, 
Ramirez said, but only by firing rubber bullets, hurling sting-ball grenades 
and releasing pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, two other dormitories, housing 125 and 136 inmates, also 
erupted into violence. Again, deputies used rubber bullets, pepper spray and 
sting-ball grenades to stop the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 17 injured prisoners, five were treated and released from the 
County-USC Medical Center jail ward and the others were treated at the jail's 
own medical ward, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The inmates involved in the fighting will be transferred to other parts of the 
jail, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting broke out again between 132 inmates later in the day in the same east 
facility dorm, injuring 13 more prisoners, said sheriff's Deputy Rich Erickson. 
One inmate who suffered a puncture wound and a possible broken jaw was taken to 
County-USC Medical Center, Erickson said. Deputies recovered six homemade 
knives in the dorm after the fighting stopped, he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PROGRAM TARGETS STUDENTS AT RISK; EDUCATION: 
SANTA CLARITA HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT WOULD ALLOW POTENTIAL DROPOUTS TO ATTEND 
CLASS OFF CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High school students who hate their classes and fail several subjects may get 
to learn off campus and earn money. 
</P>
<P>
 The William S. Hart Union High School District and Santa Clarita officials 
have created the At-Risk Student Partnership Program to interest youths who 
might drop out. The program allows students to attend two classes a day off 
campus and then participate in work projects or pursue career opportunities for 
which they are paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're targeting are the kids we know won't be successful in high 
school," said Michael Allmandinger, Canyon High School principal. "We're still 
trying to salvage this young person as a productive person in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The program begins this fall with 10 incoming ninth-graders from each of Santa 
Clarita's four high schools. Families sign a contract with the district, 
committing the youths to work. Parents must pledge their support and take a 
parental education course. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope to secure jobs from area businesses. By offering instruction 
off campus, they hope to interest students who usually dislike school. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea evolved after city and school officials met a year ago to discuss 
youth problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating, dealing year after year with students who don't want to 
be in school and just don't seem to fit anywhere," said Allmandinger, who 
participated in the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 A sample project might involve planting trees at a park. Participants would 
measure where the trees will go, design a plan for the work, plant the trees 
and keep a record of their activities. Biology or math lessons could accompany 
the work effort. Students would be paid at least minimum wage, and a portfolio 
of their accomplishments would be compiled during the semester. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to break out as much as we can from traditional school," 
Allmandinger said. "I think what we'll be using rather than a paper-and-pencils 
test is an authentic measurement of their performance." 
</P>
<P>
 The At-Risk Student Partnership Program was endorsed this week by both the 
Hart district board of trustees and Santa Clarita City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will provide program instructors, diverting $120,000 in state 
attendance funds to cover the cost, and the city is to spend up to $150,000 
this year and $50,000 per year thereafter for transportation, work stipends and 
equipment costs. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the city's strongest involvement in educating at-risk youths -- an 
area generally left to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, municipalities stay in the realm of offering recreation activities 
to fill time," said Rick Putnam, city director of parks, recreation and 
community services. "We've both stepped out of our normal roles to see if we 
couldn't go a little bit further." 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders hope that by spending funds on this type of program, they can 
avoid higher costs down the road for law enforcement, vandalism cleanup and 
imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it speaks to the time when agencies can no longer look at these as 
individual problems," Putnam said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PICKETING ANTELOPE VALLEY TRANSIT WORKERS KEEP 
A LONELY VIGIL; STRIKE: UNION AND MANAGEMENT ARE DUE TO MEET WITH FEDERAL 
MEDIATOR FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NOVEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five months after 80 bus drivers and mechanics struck the Antelope Valley's 
public transit system, the strikers continue their lonely vigil on the picket 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus service has returned to levels provided before strike began Oct. 25, 1993, 
and striking workers say the community support they had hoped for never 
materialized. Despite that, strikers insist they are prepared to carry on. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the fledgling International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 572 and DAVE 
Transportation Services Inc. are scheduled to meet with a federal mediator for 
the first time since November, said John Helm, a regional manager for Santa 
Ana-based DAVE Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're coming in to see what the union has requested," Helm said. "We're just 
going to meet with them and see what they have to say." 
</P>
<P>
 The last five months have been challenging for the union, with some members 
finding other work, said Nathan Mackey, a striking bus driver and spokesman for 
the picketers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's still standing strong," said Mackey of his fellow strikers. 
"They're determined to stay out there until this thing's settled one way or the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 The union was rebuffed by the National Labor Relations Board in December and 
again last week, when the board dismissed two separate charges of unfair labor 
practices filed by the union, which has appealed the December decision and has 
until March 31 to appeal the recent dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the pickets keep a lonely vigil in small groups across the street 
from the Lancaster office of DAVE Transportation, the operator of the Antelope 
Valley's public transit system. They picket around the clock, seven days a week 
-- although on some days they are hardly noticeable as they seek shelter from 
the weather in their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickets have been ordered not to use foul language, block buses or 
intimidate those reporting for work. The court order, which was not contested 
by the union, was issued late last year after the firm accused the picketers 
of, among other things, making threats and using abusive language. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Mackey said, strikers are keeping a positive attitude, each 
spending four hours a day on the line despite howling winds and biting cold, 
often huddling around fires lit in a large metal barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ain't got no negative thoughts about losing," striker Robert Ashford said. 
"We're going to keep on going and we're going to win. It might take a little 
time, but we're going to get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mackey said, "We have a purpose for coming out there and we know we're right." 
 
</P>
<P>
 The workers, who voted last May to join the union, went on strike in October 
because they felt progress was not being made in the negotiation of their first 
contract. They are seeking higher wages, improved working conditions and 
benefits for part-timers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until they come to our agreements, we're going to keep on striking," said 
Ashford, a bus driver who had been working for DAVE Transportation about 18 
months before the walkout. "So far they have not done what we want."

DAM CLOSED FOR $22-MILLION RESTORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The arrival of warm weather has people thinking of visiting one of the 
Antelope Valley's most popular water recreation spots -- the Littlerock Dam. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, the dam and its recreation area are closed to the public and will 
remain so for up to a year pending completion of a $22-million restoration 
project aimed at strengthening the dam and nearly doubling its water storage 
capacity.The work, which began more than 10 months ago, will also result in 
improved recreational amenities at the dam. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Lawler, an Angeles National Forest interpretive specialist, said the 
Forest Service is getting a lot of calls from people wanting to go to the dam. 
It is expected that the 70-year-old dam and recreation area will be open by 
next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, all that remains open is an off-road vehicle area and campground near 
the reservoir. Access is limited to those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The recreation area is being kept closed during the restoration work because 
of health and safety concerns, Lawler said.

SPI GETS CONTROLLING STAKE IN RUSSIA'S OLDEST DRUG FIRM; TRANSACTION: COSTA 
MESA-BASED COMPANY'S DEAL, WORTH AT LEAST $43 MILLION, GIVES IT FOOTHOLD IN THE 
REGION. 
</P>

 SPI Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Thursday it has begun the second phase of its 
two-step purchase of Russia's oldest drug firm. 
</P>
<P>
 SPI's controlling interest in St. Petersburg-based Leningrad Industrial 
Chemical and Pharmaceutical Assn., known as Oktyabr, establishes the Costa Mesa 
drug company more securely in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash and stock deal, estimated by analysts to be worth at least $43 
million, also marks the first time that Russian citizens have owned a stake in 
a U.S. corporation. In a ceremony Thursday, St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoly A. 
Sobchak hailed the transaction and pointed out that, for the first time since 
the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, American stocks were used to fund a business 
transaction in his city. 
</P>
<P>
 SPI spokesman David Calef said Thursday in St. Petersburg that the deal "is a 
significant step in the march toward capitalism." 
</P>
<P>
 With former Yugoslavia Prime Minister Milan Panic at SPI's helm, observers 
said, the company is poised for further expansion in the region once dominated 
by the communist East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very good thing for the company," said Dennis Roth, an analyst with 
New York brokerage Lew Leiberbaum & Co. Panic "has a lot of contacts there and 
can take advantage of situations." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roth said that the deal to buy Oktyabr, founded in 1714 by Czar Peter the 
Great, could be followed this year by other takeover announcements. SPI has 
agreements pending in Poland and Hungary. But Roth noted that the region still 
has political and economic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 SPI, for instance, has suffered financially from its 1992 purchase of ICN 
Galenika, a drug maker based in Belgrade, Serbia. At first profitable, Galenika 
has suffered from the Balkan civil wars in the former Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 But as capitalism grows in Eastern Europe, SPI's gamble will likely pay off. 
Analysts estimate that the potential pharmaceuticals market in the former 
Soviet bloc countries is as much as $9 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 They also point out that the company is buying into a market where there is 
virtually no competition from other Western pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always a risk," Roth said. But Panic "is a great entrepreneur," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent decision by Moscow allows the sale in Russia of U.S. drugs that have 
been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That decision, Calef 
said, should allow SPI to begin making and selling pharmaceuticals in St. 
Petersburg for distribution across Russia within months, if not weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the potential immediately," Calef said. "And we want to take advantage 
of that opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 SPI, the chief subsidiary of ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., announced in October, 
1992, that it was buying Oktyabr. At that time, SPI officials said they were 
signing a joint-venture agreement with the city of St. Petersburg, which shares 
ownership of Oktyabr with the company's 2,175 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to that agreement, SPI assumed a 75% stake in the joint venture and 
agreed to invest about $40 million to build a new facility near Oktyabr's 
existing factory. That construction has not yet begun. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, SPI has pursued another agreement to gain an 88% stake in 
Oktyabr's existing plant. Thursday's announcement brings that pursuit closer to 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the deal, SPI has transferred 30,000 shares of its common stock 
-- valued at $16.875 a share -- to St. Petersburg in exchange for 15% of 
Oktyabr. Within the next two weeks, SPI will gain an additional 33% of Oktyabr 
from the city in exchange for training workers, providing equipment to Oktyabr 
and funding a feasibility study on Oktyabr's future. 
</P>
<P>
 SPI has also invited Oktyabr workers to turn in their ownership stakes in 
Oktyabr -- awarded to them after the breakdown of the Soviet Union -- for 
137,025 shares of SPI stock now held by SPI's parent company, ICN 
Pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers' stake accounts for about 40% of the company. It was not 
immediately clear how many of the workers, who would be SPI employees once the 
deal is finalized, are planning to trade ownership for stock in the U.S. 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading SPI shares for Oktyabr ownership has not been without hassles. "We've 
had some problems, maybe more than we should have," Panic said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said that getting SPI dividends to Russian shareholders will 
also be a problem, for most Russians do not have bank accounts. Dollar accounts 
do not exist for the vast majority, and most closed their ruble accounts long 
ago. Inflation, which was 900% in Russia last year, makes saving money 
unprofitable. 
</P>
<P>
 But SPI spokesman Calef said that the same program -- trading stock for 
workers' ownership -- worked well in Belgrade, where virtually all of ICN 
Galenika's workers opted for the transaction. About one in four of those 
workers eventually sold their SPI stock for cash, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's trading on the American Stock Exchange, SPI's stock closed at 
$16.625 a share, down 25 cents. SPI's Russian, Eastern European Connections

 Costa Mesa-based SPI Pharmaceuticals has purchased Russia's oldest drug firm 
and is moving forward with other purchases in Eastern Europe. It already owns a 
controlling interest in a drug company in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia.

DISNEY TIGHTENS RETIREE HEALTH CARE RULES; BENEFITS: EMPLOYEES MUST STAY TO AGE 
55 TO QUALIFY, NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS ON JOB. MANY WILL QUIT BEFORE JULY 1 
DEADLINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Walt Disney Co., reeling from continued losses at Euro Disneyland, is 
tightening eligibility requirements for retirement health care benefits among 
its 70,000 employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Disney policy requires workers to stay with the company until they are 
at least 55 years old to receive the post-retirement health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 That's in addition to the previous requirement that employees work a minimum 
of 30,000 hours over 20 years. Before, retirees received the benefits 
regardless of their age at resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Eligible, hourly employees younger than 55 have until July 1 to leave the 
company or be subject to the new rules, which took effect March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Some workers suggest that Disney's primary motivation is to gain additional 
savings as higher-paid, veteran employees resign to preserve their current 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "What upsets me so much is that I'm not ready to leave. But I'm being forced 
to," said a 39-year-old Disney supervisor who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
"That kind of upsets me, but I have no other option. It's their way of cleaning 
everything out." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney spokesman John Dreyer denied any attempt to entice veteran workers to 
leave the company. He said the grace period was "made out of fairness to 
long-term employees to give them an option" -- retire, or fall under the new 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreyer would not reveal how much money Disney expects to save by cutting 
retirement benefits, but he said it is substantial. "It's more in line with 
corporate America, but it remains a good plan," he said of the revised 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Saving Disney even more money, the new rules also will postpone health 
benefits for retirees by three years until age 65, when they would also be 
eligible for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 The health benefit changes are the latest cost-cutting moves at Burbank-based 
Disney, which is still reeling from losses at Euro Disney resort. Disney's 
half-ownership of the troubled French attraction cut $514 million off its 
bottom line last fiscal year. Euro Disney is undergoing a financial 
restructuring and the effects are reverberating throughout the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment giant recently reversed a longstanding policy against 
releasing its cinematic crown jewel, the 1937 animated classic "'Snow White and 
the Seven Dwarfs," to the videocassette market. 
</P>
<P>
 Though possibly dampening future box office returns, the move should generate 
tens of millions of dollars in new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of Euro Disney losses, Disney is widely believed to be re-evaluating 
whether to proceed with its planned $3-billion Disneyland Resort project, which 
would add a new Westcot theme park and several hotels to Disneyland in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 In the theme park division -- the company's largest and most profitable sector 
-- Disney recently took the uncommon move of dismissing 60 middle managers at 
Disneyland in Anaheim and 300 at the Walt Disney Resort in Orlando, Fla. 
Disneyland workers said in a recent company poll that they believe 
penny-pinching has reduced the quality of the park for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The new retirement health rule strikes particularly hard at the 45,000 workers 
in Disney's theme park division, because so many started in high school or 
college, climbed through the ranks to middle management and are still more than 
a decade from age 55. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been pushing people out the door for a while," said one janitor 
with more than 20 years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers were informed of the changes in February letters from Executive Vice 
President Sanford M. Litvack. He cited "rising health care costs and President 
Clinton's health care proposals" as reasons for the change. 
</P>
<P>
 But the path was cleared at Disneyland -- Orange County's largest employer 
with a peak work force of 12,000 workers during the summer -- in labor 
negotiations two years ago. Then, says another veteran janitor who is a union 
shop steward, the park's four major unions threw down a gauntlet when the 
company insisted on the option to reduce retirement health benefits: make them 
apply to management as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the salaried personnel found out (about the proposed contract cuts), all 
hell broke loose. They were flabbergasted," said the steward, who declined to 
be identified. "They could not believe the company would turn around and agree 
to such a clause in the contract. . . . That caused a stink all the way to 
Burbank." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor who intends to quit said the cutbacks are just another example 
of how Disney, and Disneyland, have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have whittled away the perks that made it special," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer do employees receive green-tinted carnations to wear on St. 
Patrick's Day, or red ones for Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 But, hesitating for a moment, she said pensively: "Little by little, I have 
noticed all those little things." How Old, New Plans Compare 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. has made it harder for its workers to become eligible for 
company-provided health care when they retire. Hourly employees with at least 
20 years of service have until July 1 to decide whether to quit in order to 
qualify under the old rules. OLD PLAN

BRIEFCASE: BANKING; ONLY ONE COUNTY INSTITUTION MAKES FINDLEY REPORTS' LIST OF 
STATE'S BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by James S. Granelli, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How bad was it for the banking industry last year? 
</P>
<P>
 There were fewer banks than ever on Findley Reports' annual list of the 
state's best-performing banks.The list consists of only 74 "premier-performing 
banks" out of 408 in the state, including Mariners Bank in San Clemente -- the 
only Orange County bank on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, a quarter to a third of the state's banks, including a dozen Orange 
County banks, meet the criteria set by the Anaheim consulting firm, which has 
been honoring top-performing banks since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the top-rated banks are in Northern California, where recovery from 
the long-running recession is moving along better than in the lower half of the 
state, said Edward E. Schmidt, a co-director of Findley Reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of Orange County's 27 community banks are operating with various 
restrictions imposed by state or federal regulators, Schmidt said. The biggest 
problem for most has been the flagging value of real estate, which backs most 
loans and, therefore, has caused many to go bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we see, though, is an indication that such losses have bottomed out," 
Schmidt said. Since 1991, when Findley Reports saw the recession begin to 
batter banks, the firm has lowered its criteria for becoming a 
premier-performing institution. One of the criteria, for instance, once 
required banks to increase loans and other assets by 8% a year. That was 
lowered to 5% in 1991 and lowered the next year to 0% -- essentially 
maintaining the same size. 
</P>
<P>
 The consulting firm also selected only 25 banks, including Landmark Bank in La 
Habra, for its list of "commendable-performing banks," a step below 
"premier-performing banks" but still an indication of a financially healthy 
institution.

O.C. SHERIFF'S OFFICIALS SAT IN ON D.A.'S PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates' assurances that his department would 
step aside during the criminal inquiry into one deputy's Christmas Day slaying 
of another, documents reveal that Gates' investigators sat in on virtually all 
of the interrogations conducted by the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Local black leaders said the disclosure bolstered their claims, until now 
largely speculative, that the Sheriff's Department and district attorney's 
office worked too closely together to allow local prosecutors to thoroughly 
investigate the case. 
</P>
<P>
 And several legal experts questioned whether the presence of sheriff's 
investigators at the interviews might have influenced the statements given by 
colleagues under questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, the district attorney's office questioned deputies about the 
shooting while a fellow sheriff's employee looked on a few feet away and often 
asked questions of his own, according to newly disclosed documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be an Einstein to figure out that candor may be compromised 
in that situation," maintained Jennifer Keller, an Orange County defense 
attorney who serves on a California State Bar panel on criminal law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deputies are rather protective of their colleagues anyway, but having an 
investigator from your department there (taking part in an interview) means 
that a deputy who might be willing to talk about certain things won't do that," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, however, said in an interview Thursday that he did not believe his 
investigators' presence while people were being questioned compromised the 
district attorney's investigation in any way. "I don't believe there's any 
conflict with the process that takes place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Brian P. Scanlan shot Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins to death Dec. 25 as 
they were running through a mock car-stop exercise designed to highlight 
methods that Los Angeles gang members reportedly use to get the drop on police. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office says that it recommended to the Orange County 
Grand Jury earlier this month that Scanlan be indicted for involuntary 
manslaughter for his "gross negligence" in using a loaded weapon during the 
exercise, but the grand jury refused. Scanlan remains on paid leave from the 
Sheriff's Department pending an internal review. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, the case has loomed as a potential trouble spot for Gates 
politically, as he prepared for a reelection campaign for sheriff later this 
year and flirted briefly with the idea of running for lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal leaders in Lake Forest demanded to know why deputies were training 
with a loaded weapon at the parking lot of a public shopping plaza. And 
minority leaders, questioning whether race may have played a part in the 
handling of the case, repeatedly called for an independent state or federal 
investigation. Robins was black, while Scanlan is white. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates has sought to avoid the spotlight in the controversy, saying throughout 
the last three months that his office would play no part in the district 
attorney's independent investigation into the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-hour January interview with The Times, for instance, Gates pointed 
out repeatedly that he did not know details of the case, in part because he and 
his office had little to do with the investigation. Any tips from the public on 
the investigation were being forwarded to the district attorney, he said, and 
sheriff's officials had not even viewed their deputies' patrol-car videos 
around the time of the shooting before turning them over to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said sheriff's officials were anxious to see the district attorney 
conclude its investigation so that they themselves could get more answers in 
the case and begin their own internal review. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to wait for the D.A. to finish their work. I don't know how long that 
is going to take. We have asked him to move as rapidly as they possibly can," 
Gates said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not the ones doing the investigation," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a press release issued Feb. 17, the Sheriff's Department said: "The 
Orange County Sheriff's Department will continue to remain removed from the 
investigative process being conducted by the district attorney and the grand 
jury panel." 
</P>
<P>
 Documents released to the media this week, however, showed that a sheriff's 
investigator took part in all 36 interviews that the district attorney's office 
conducted with sheriff's employees on the case to discuss the events of Dec. 25 
and broader issues of training and procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's investigator also took part in an interview with a Lake Forest 
resident who thought she heard a gunshot that day. Of the remaining interviews, 
a district attorney's investigator spoke alone with three employees of 
Saddleback Memorial Medical Center, where Robins was declared dead. Prosecutors 
did not release transcripts of several other interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bulk of these interrogations, three people were present: the person 
being interviewed, the district attorney's investigator and the sheriff's 
investigator.  
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office led the questioning in each case, but the 
sheriff's investigator often joined in the questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the critical interview of Scanlan just hours after the shooting, for 
instance, sheriff's investigator Leo Vandor took over the questioning at the 
interrogation room for several minutes as district attorney's investigator Mike 
Major left the room, and he questioned Scanlan at some length about his work 
history, his gun and his training methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley said that having a sheriff's investigator at 
an interview helps to provide technical guidance on department matters and 
should also "promote candor on the part of the (sheriff's) officer because 
they're at ease with a person they know." 
</P>
<P>
 Conley said this arrangement was part of what was considered a "joint 
investigation" between the Sheriff's Department and the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gates disputed this characterization, saying the district attorney 
conducted an "independent" investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said his investigators took part in the interviews in accordance with 
the terms of a 1985 county policy on the investigation of officer-involved 
shootings. His department's investigators reported back to their supervisors, 
Gates said, but not to him. 
</P>
<P>
 But that explanation did not sit well with Eugene Wheeler, who heads a group 
called 100 Black Men of Orange County and who has helped lead the call for an 
independent investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does bother me, and it verifies our claim that it's difficult for the two 
of them (the Sheriff's Department and district attorney's office) to separate 
from one another. This is a recognition of their dilemma -- it's hard to 
separate Siamese twins," Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller, the defense attorney, said that other counties around the state have 
recognized the potential "chilling effect" when a police department's 
representative is allowed to sit in on an interview with one of its own people, 
and they have adopted reforms to ensure a "truly independent" probe into 
alleged wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County, she said, "has lagged behind in how these things are 
handled. . . . It's hard to say in an individual case whether the truth came 
out, but it sure affects my confidence level." 
</P>
<P>
 And Gregory C. Brown, assistant professor of criminal justice at Chapman 
University, said the Sheriff's Department's role in the investigation presents 
"a problematic situation" that challenges the independence of the district 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 For sheriff's officials to help interview their own deputies in the Scanlan 
case, he said, "is like you asking me a question (about my job) and my boss was 
standing right over your shoulder. It would have to influence me. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It flies in the face of everything the sheriff has said wasn't happening, and 
it really corroborates the arguments the blacks in Orange County have been 
making all along," he said.

RAMS GET NOTICE TO VACATE LONGTIME TRAINING FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS and MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying they face an "extreme hardship," the Los Angeles Rams began 
contemplating life away from Rams Park on Thursday after being notified they 
were to vacate their longtime headquarters in seven days. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal wrangling could delay formal eviction for months, and business continued 
as usual on the practice field Thursday. But John Shaw, Rams executive vice 
president, said the National Football League team will begin a serious search 
for an alternative site. 
</P>
<P>
 In the statement, Shaw said he was "shocked and disappointed" by the actions 
of the city of Anaheim and the Magnolia School District, the site's owner, in 
asking the Rams to leave the former Juliette Low School site by Thursday. But 
city and district officials, unhappy over the team's unwillingness to sign a 
long-term lease extension, expressed little sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think anybody who looks at what has gone on over the months of negotiations 
can hardly characterize this as 'the poor Rams are being evicted,' " said Paul 
S. Mercier, school district superintendent. "I don't see this as a difficult IQ 
test. The Rams say they don't want to sign the lease. They're the ones walking 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' statement did not say whether they would try to do so by Thursday. 
Shaw, reached by telephone later in Orlando, Fla., at the NFL owners meetings, 
said he will meet with the team's attorneys upon his return to Los Angeles 
today to discuss options. He added that it would be virtually impossible to be 
relocated by the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 While a number of players use Rams Park daily for weight work and informal 
practices at this time of year, the team is not scheduled to come together 
formally until a three-day mini-camp in early May. The Rams would next require 
full use of locker and practice facilities in late August, at the conclusion of 
training camp at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter received by the Rams Thursday does not constitute a formal 
eviction. A team official said he expects the city and school district to begin 
official proceedings if the Rams remain after March 31 and that it was the 
Rams' understanding it would take another 60 to 90 days before they could be 
forcibly removed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' statement Thursday expressed unhappiness over the eviction "in light 
of the oral commitments made by the city to spend $7 million for the purchase 
and renovation of Low School, and because of the Rams' willingness to agree to 
a two-year extension offered by the school district in November, 1992." 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite protracted negotiations on the extension of the Low School lease we 
find it incredible to believe the City of Anaheim evicted us from our offices 
and practice facility without providing an alternative site," Shaw said in the 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mercier said Shaw was being disingenuous when talking about the Rams' 
willingness to sign a two-year lease in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the district originally made the offer but changed it to a longer term 
at the Rams' request. He said the district spent two years trying to 
accommodate the Rams, only to have team officials suddenly change their 
position last fall when it was clear they wanted to explore a move out of 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercier said the district and city have gone to great lengths to try and 
address the Rams' concerns but that the team keeps raising "non-issues" to 
avoid signing the lease. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials also disputed the Rams' claim that Anaheim ever committed to 
make $7 million in improvements at Low School or purchase a new practice site 
for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Jack L. White said the city had promised only to find the team a 
new site if the district decided to convert the property back to a school while 
the Rams still held a lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, that issue is somewhat of a red herring," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, however, that the city would be willing to "put that issue on the 
table" as part of negotiations to keep the team playing in Anaheim. But to 
expect the city to "spend $7 million of taxpayers' money for a new practice 
facility at the same time the Rams say they are going to leave isn't 
reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 Rams officials have told the city they will exercise an escape clause in their 
Anaheim Stadium lease May 3 and look to move to another city with greater 
financial opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the district's deadline, White said the city is still willing to try 
to complete the lease deal and then go to district officials and ask that they 
rescind their demand that the team vacate. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the present proposal, the Rams would have a 10-year lease with a 
five-year extension option. They could break the lease at any time with six 
months' notice but would have to pay a $250,000 penalty. The proposed lease 
also has the city subsidizing up to $3 million in rental payments for the team 
over a 15-year period and paying a portion of the restoration costs the team 
would be required to make if it leaves the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposed lease is a substantial improvement over the team's previous 
one," which expired Dec. 31, White said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rams officials say the proposal is still unfair. They say they have 
refused to sign the lease because they do not want to pay both a penalty for 
breaking the lease and the bulk of the restoration costs, which have been 
estimated between $1.2 million and $1.5 million and which they say should be 
shared equally by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also contend that the present site, where the team has practiced for 
15 years, is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams Park includes offices for the coaching and administrative staff, a locker 
room, a weight room and football field.

SMALL AD AGENCY IN O.C. PROVES BIG ON CREATIVITY; ADVERTISING: SAKOL 
MONGKOLKASETARIN'S ONE-MAN SHOP SNAGS FOUR OF THE INDUSTRY'S ANNUAL BELDING 
AWARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an industry that calculates its annual billings by the millions, 
27-year-old Sakol Mongkolkasetarin, a graphic designer who runs a one-person 
advertising agency from his Santa Ana apartment, figures that his billings for 
all of 1994 will probably total $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday night, he competed with some of the big-money ad firms of 
Southern California and came away with four of the industry's Belding awards. 
That was twice the number bestowed on hip Venice Beach agency Chiat/Day, 
creator of the Energizer Bunny campaign, and Mongkolkasetarin was the 
third-biggest winner of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I want to miss it now," he said with a huge smile Thursday 
afternoon as he paid a visit to his biggest client and prepared to car-pool 
with friends to Los Angeles for the posh awards ceremony. This ad whiz drives a 
white 1981 Toyota Corolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Mongkolkasetarin and his firm, Acme Advertising, were honored for his work for 
Pacific Snax, a Newport Beach snack food company that makes puffed rice in the 
shape of popcorn, flavored with caramel or Cheddar cheese. "Imagine if Uncle 
Ben married Orville Redenbacher," says one of the winning ads. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also makes Jurassic Snacks, to be released with the video version 
of the movie later this year. Mongkolkasetarin's newspaper ads for the dinosaur 
snacks will tout them as "65 million years in the making. But don't worry, 
they're vacuum-packed." 
</P>
<P>
 He will also begin working later this spring on a snack package linked to the 
upcoming "Flintstones" movie starring John Goodman and Rosie O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
 The designer said he stumbled upon what makes good advertising after he was 
laid off by one of Orange County's most prestigious ad agencies, Cochrane 
Chase, Livingston & Co., when it shut down in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't find a job, so I decided to find my own clients. I had friends who 
needed ads," Mongkolkasetarin said. "When the client happens to be someone I 
know personally, there is a connection. You have a chemistry, and good work 
happens that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Featuring cherubs, halos and corncobs, the designs for Pacific Snax's packages 
"give an image of a higher plane of eating" that the company desired for its 
health-conscious snacks, said Jerry H. Ludeman, senior vice president of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Mongkolkasetarin has one other client, computer peripherals maker Triam. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with Thursday's top two winners, also small agencies, 
Mongkolkasetarin's victory supports a popular belief that the very best 
advertising ideas in the Los Angeles area are being created by small agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Mongkolkasetarin also employs old-fashioned courtesy. "He is always polite and 
on time, and when he says he will have the work done, it is done," said Roya 
Cuentara, chief financial officer of Pacific Snax. "He takes criticism very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Thailand, Mongkolkasetarin moved to Southern California when he 
was 6 and has returned to Bangkok just once, to attend his grandfather's 
funeral in 1991. He asks that people call him Sakol (SAY-koh) rather than 
attempt his last name (Mon-GOL-ka-say-TAR-in). 
</P>
<P>
 Though he says his Thai background remains an important influence, 
Mongkolkasetarin identifies himself primarily as a Southern Californian. Until 
recently, he said, he jogged, surfed and rode his bike to an office where he 
briefly sublet space. But life has gotten more hectic, Mongkolkasetarin said. 
"I gave up running, sold my board, and my bike is hanging in the closet," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He comes from a family of creative people. Father Stitaya Mongkolkasetarin, a 
free-lance architect, emigrated from Bangkok in 1968 with his Chinese 
Vietnamese wife, Am, a dressmaker who has a shop in the Little Saigon area of 
Westminster and Garden Grove. Their children came to the United States four 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Stitaya Mongkolkasetarin was laid off from a job with Fluor Corp. in 1991, and 
Sakol, the oldest son, decided to start a family business. 
</P>
<P>
 His father took a second loan out on their house to pay for $10,000 worth of 
computer equipment. The four brothers -- Sakol, Jsada, Kreangsuk and Sumith -- 
turned the living room of the family's Fountain Valley home into a studio and 
opened for business in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 During their first year, the brothers, who called themselves the M Group, 
billed about $42,000. The brothers have since gone on to other ventures, Sakol 
has renamed the firm Acme Advertising, and he has repaid his parents, in part 
by designing award-winning direct-mail ads for his mother's business. 
Mongkolkasetarin has also done design work for Balboa Bay Beverage Inc. and 
Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Inc. in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 His agency's reputation spread after it developed a creative series of 
public-service ads for the local chapter of the American Cancer Society. One ad 
compares the dangers of cigarettes to those of drugs by picturing marijuana, 
tobacco and poppies. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the M Group won gold, silver and merit awards from the Orange County 
AdClub. It was a finalist last year in the Advertising Club of Los Angeles' 
Belding awards. And it won merit awards from the Art Directors Club of Los 
Angeles and the New York Art Directors Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Mongkolkasetarin graduated from Cal State Long Beach in 1990 with a degree in 
graphic design. He was an assistant art director for 18 months at Cochrane 
Chase, where he met Richard Damian, chief executive officer of Pacific Snax. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I got into this," he said, "is that not just one person sees my 
work. Millions of people see it. That's what satisfies me."

WHEN HANDSHAKE IS SETBACK TO SPORTSMANSHIP; HIGH SCHOOLS: VENTURA COUNTY LEAGUE 
BANS THE PRACTICE TO AVERT POSTGAME FIGHTS. CRITICS SAY KEY LESSONS ARE LOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER and AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is the very symbol of sportsmanship -- the victors and the vanquished 
shaking hands at the end of a bitter contest. Evert and Navratilova. The 
Trojans and the Bruins. Grant and Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a series of scuffles between high school teams in eastern Ventura 
County, officials in the Marmonte League say they are sacking the symbol to 
save the sports. 
</P>
<P>
 From tennis matches to baseball games to swim meets, competitors in the 
league, which includes schools in Simi Valley, Camarillo and the Conejo Valley, 
are now forbidden to shake hands after contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics complain that the new policy, enacted earlier this month, is also a 
symbol -- a disturbing though perhaps apt one in an era of bratty tennis 
players swearing at line judges and coaches hurling chairs onto basketball 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them to ban it is bad for sports," said Billy Miller, a junior football 
and basketball player at Westlake High School. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, high school sports events around Southern California have 
been marred by violence between opponents. Punches were thrown as fans mobbed 
the field after a 1990 football game between Dorsey High and Banning High. 
Football players from Costa Mesa High and Laguna High engaged in a 
third-quarter melee in 1991. And last year, a Harvard-Westlake soccer player 
was charged with assault for kicking an opponent in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some high school sports leagues have scrapped postgame handshakes 
in especially tense circumstances. The Marmonte League appears to be the first 
to abolish the practice altogether -- in all sports, for boys and girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals of the eight schools in the league, which encompasses mostly white, 
middle-class bedroom communities, voted unanimously to ban postgame handshakes, 
encouraging handshakes before games instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the prohibition) is promoting sportsmanship, but an honest 
sportsmanship rather than just going through the motions," said the man who 
proposed rule, Camarillo High School Principal Terry Tackett, who is a former 
baseball coach. "I don't want to play someone and have them beat me up for 40 
or 50 minutes, then have to tell them they played a good game. I'd rather tell 
them good luck before the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics don't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about resolution," USC philosophy professor Dallas Willard said of the 
postgame handshake. "It recognizes that in the competition feelings are 
aroused. There is hostility. But the idea is now the game is over and the two 
sides come back together. . . . Without it, there is no resolution. You carry 
the resentment or the feeling of domination off the field with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches in neighboring leagues voiced similar opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're that far gone, we shouldn't be playing at all," said Darryl Stroh, 
football and baseball coach at Granada Hills High School in the Northwest 
Valley Conference. "If kids can't handle losing, then we aren't doing our job. 
Overcoming the adversity of losing is part of growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 But scuffles broke out after several Marmonte League basketball games this 
past season -- including one in which a player threw a punch during the 
handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 No players have been hurt in any of the outbreaks, but cautious principals in 
the league want to make sure they don't escalate into the kinds of brawls that 
marred a 1984 baseball game between Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks high schools. 
That fight started with the handshake and ended with five players being 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics agree that safety of the players is a top priority, but argue that 
coaches should have the discretion to handle volatile situations as they arise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally think if there is any misconduct, coaches ought to be fired," 
Camarillo softball coach Darwin Tolzin said. "If the coaches can't control 
their players, they need to get different coaches. My personal opinion is: I 
think handshaking after the game is fantastic. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley baseball coach Mike Scyphers agreed. He cited a game his team 
played this month against Edison High of Huntington Beach. During Edison's 8-1 
victory, the two coaches noticed friction between the teams and agreed to call 
off the postgame handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's a good way to handle it, but the coaches have to be very 
observant," Scyphers said. "I like the sportsmanship, that we shake hands. But 
they don't do it in the big leagues and they don't do it in college. I'm not so 
sure if someone is beating you pretty good that you want to go shake their 
hands anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think when you've got a great ballgame, and it's 3-2 and well-played, 
I'd like to see the kids shake hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Some local observers see the decision as a quick fix that fails to address a 
deeper problem: the postgame flare-ups themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a shame," said John Aylsworth, whose son Steve plays basketball 
at Westlake. "I think the kids need to understand how to (conduct the 
handshake) appropriately rather than just prohibiting it entirely." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA sociologist Jeffrey Alexander said the Marmonte League principals are 
sending the wrong message to their athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, the decision seems to give a certain legitimacy to the 
aggressive behavior by giving into it and saying, 'We're tying our hands 
because we can't do anything about it,' " Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Crowley, commissioner of the Southern Section of the California 
Interscholastic Federation, the governing body of high school sports in the 
state, said a rule similar to the Marmonte League's was proposed for all of the 
region's 400-plus schools a few years ago, but was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry a league had to make that decision," Crowley said. "It says that we 
need to get back to what athletics are all about, ethical conduct, 
sportsmanship, fair play, all the things that we perpetuate in our code of 
ethics." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County athletic teams are not immune to fighting; assistant boys' 
basketball coaches from Mater Dei and Dana Hills high schools recently scuffled 
after a junior varsity game, and a boys' soccer match between Newport Harbor 
and Woodbridge high schools was stopped with 17 minutes left when players 
brawled. 
</P>
<P>
 But the after-game handshake was not involved in either case, and coaches and 
longtime observers could not recall an instance when that ritual had led to 
violence in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Danley, veteran boys' basketball coach and athletic director at Katella 
High in Anaheim, said he could nonetheless understand the Marmonte League's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe they're doing what they believe is right under their 
circumstances," he said. "We've never had a major problem with that in Orange 
County, but for us to be judgmental wouldn't be right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under normal circumstances, I would think teams would want to shake hands and 
show due respect for their opponent, whether they've won or lost, and the same 
goes for the coaches and administrators," he said. "I would hope it wouldn't 
come to (a ban) in Orange County, but things do change." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Sullivan, a spokesman for Little League Baseball in Williamsport, Pa., 
declined to comment specifically on the Marmonte decision. But he characterized 
the postgame handshake as one of the most important parts of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the aims of Little League is to teach kids how to win and how to lose 
with dignity," he said. "The handshake at the end of the game signifies true 
sportsmanship and friendship. To me, it's the beginning of the second half of 
the game, the part you carry away with you." 
</P>
<P>
 But Harry Edwards, a sociology professor at UC Berkeley, said that if 
abolishing niceties such as handshakes is needed to preserve high school 
sports, then it should be done without regret. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards, a noted sports sociologist, added that too many youths are scared 
away from athletics by the threat of violence from off the field, saying some 
boys have quit teams rather than travel into unfriendly neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing of developing sportsmanship is all well and good, but the mere 
connectedness they get from the fact that they still want to come out and play 
ball -- that becomes the critical point," he said. "The rest has to be 
considered gravy." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the rule has not made much of a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Thousand Oaks boys' volleyball team stunned Simi Valley's Royal High 
in a fiercely fought match on Tuesday night, snapping Royal's 66-match league 
winning streak that had lasted more than five years, opponents sought each 
other out through the fans who had streamed onto the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Some players even hugged.

POWERFUL STORM BATTERS REGION, TRIGGERS SLIDES

 A blustery arctic storm hammered Southern California with intense 
thundershowers Thursday night, unleashing mudslides below the fire-scarred 
hillsides of Malibu and triggering an all-night vigil by emergency workers in 
Laguna Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 Heavy snow fell in the mountains, stranding several dozen motorists on the 
Angeles Forest Highway and closing Interstate 5 in the Grapevine area. A 
scramble was on for the last available motel rooms in Gorman as it became 
increasingly likely that the state's principal north-south highway would remain 
closed until sometime this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thursday night commute was a stop-and-go nightmare on most local freeways, 
which were clogged with traffic accidents and stalled cars. Despite heavy 
rains, roads through the Sepulveda flood basin remained open. 
</P>
<P>
 An unidentified man, believed to be in his early 40s, was killed about 5:15 
p.m. when his car spun out on rain-slicked La Tuna Canyon Road about a mile 
west of the Foothill Freeway, crossed the center line and triggered a four-car 
crash, city fire officials said. They said two other men and a woman -- drivers 
of the other cars involved -- suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol blamed the rain for a number of traffic 
accidents in Orange County, most of them minor. The CHP said one of those 
accidents briefly blocked all lanes of the Orange Freeway at Katella Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters were on alert in fire-ravaged Laguna Beach, where the storm was 
expected to persist until 4 a.m., with winds gusting up to 40 m.p.h.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is billed as the strongest storm since the fire," said Patrick Brennan, 
a spokesman with the Laguna Beach Fire Department, which was keeping an 
all-night vigil in expectation that the coastal area would receive at least two 
inches of rainfall -- enough to saturate the ground and perhaps unleash floods 
or mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan said many residents and business owners in the city had spent the day 
shoring up their property with sandbags, and the city had deployed earthmoving 
equipment to strategic locations, ready to be used to keep flood channels open. 
</P>
<P>
 A downpour of half an inch of rain in one hour between 8 and 9 p.m. triggered 
the U.S. Weather Service to issue a flash-flood warning for the Laguna Canyon 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 For four months, Brennan said, the city has been working on erosion-control 
plans for the burn areas that have withstood several smaller storms. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be the big test," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said a small tornado touched down briefly in Santa Barbara, 
flattening an outbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters predicted more severe thunderstorms -- with heavy downpours and 
scattered hail -- before the storm begins to ease sometime tonight.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be nasty," National Weather Service forecaster Debra Rominger 
said. "It's a pretty strong one." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said as much as three 
inches of rain is expected to fall in the coastal valleys and along the 
foothills before the storms move out to the east, probably sometime Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thoren said there is a slight possibility of even more rain if the cold storm 
from the Gulf of Alaska hooks up with a broad band of moisture stretching from 
Hawaii to Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it doesn't look like that's going to happen, but it could," Thoren 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather service said the storm -- unusually cold for this time of year -- 
probably will drop between one and two feet of snow in the San Gabriel and San 
Bernardino mountains by Saturday night. The snow level in some of the northern 
ranges is expected to dip as low as 2,500 feet -- about the level of the 
Antelope Valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu -- where dozens of houses were invaded by mudslides in February 
after brush fires destroyed scores of homes and stripped hillsides of 
vegetation last fall -- rockslides blocked traffic on the Pacific Coast Highway 
and on at least four canyon roads leading inland Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the slides occurred between 5 and 6 p.m. as heavy rain, sometimes 
mixed with hail the size of jellybeans, reduced visibility to about 30 feet in 
some areas. A stream of runoff a foot deep coursed down Las Flores Canyon Road, 
disappearing into a storm drain at the coast highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain continued into the night and so did the rockslides. Caltrans crews 
said they were not sure when they would be able to reopen the PCH, Topanga 
Canyon Boulevard, Topanga Canyon Road, Big Rock Drive, Las Flores Canyon Road 
and Tuna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Malibu's residents stood watch over sandbag barriers in front of their 
homes Thursday night, guarding against the possibility of major slides like the 
ones that damaged homes there last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a long, long night and a long, long weekend," Kent Knudsen 
said as he sipped a mug of hot chocolate and gazed balefully at the continuing 
rain. His house on Pacific Coast Highway was one of those damaged during 
February's storms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get this trench cleaned out, along with the drain, and then I'll 
just do it all over again," he said. "I just want to keep the mud and water out 
of the house this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Because sheriff's deputies would not let traffic through on the PCH, Carole 
Smith and her 5-year-old son, Shane, had to walk about a mile home in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lovely night for a walk," she said with only a touch of sarcasm. "I 
thought about trying to bribe the sheriffs, but I decided not to." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Maurice, a spokeswoman for the city of Malibu, said the city had 
notified residents to prepare for the storm, but added: "We don't want them to 
have a false sense of security, because a fire or sheriff official probably 
will not come knocking on their door to tell them to get out. If they feel they 
are in danger, they probably are and should just get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Such warnings are old hat in Malibu, where most residents prefer to stick it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Spack, who lives midway up Big Rock Drive, was undaunted by the 
thrashing rain that hit by about 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're keeping our fingers crossed, but the city got all the drains in and did 
some hydro-seeding so I am feeling pretty safe about it," Spack said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Buena Park, rainwater poured through the roof of a dress shop on Beach 
Boulevard Thursday evening. The owner of a neighboring pizza parlor, Tony 
Garcia, who ran to help along with firefighters, said it took them two hours to 
move the garment racks to a dry area and mop up. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week. the prospect of heavy rain and perhaps hail prompted Orange 
County's strawberry farmers to hire extra workers to quickly harvest as much of 
the ripe fruit as possible, said Alan Reynolds, general manager of Treasure 
Farms in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "A hard rain will do damage, and hail will do a lot of damage," Reynolds said. 
He predicted that if the storm severely harms the approximately 500 acres of 
strawberries in Irvine as well as Oxnard's substantial strawberry crop, the 
price of the fruit may rise this spring at the supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pasadena Glen area -- another neighborhood where disastrous brush fires 
during the fall were followed my destructive mudslides in February -- an 
improved system of culverts and barricades appeared to be protecting homes from 
storm runoff Thursday night. The rainfall there was steady but not 
exceptionally heavy during much of the evening, and the streets were deserted 
as emergency crews retreated to warmer, drier quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Pasadena Glen's residents had left their homes Thursday afternoon 
rather than wait for what many feared would be a renewed onslaught of 
mudslides. 
</P>
<P>
 Barriers were in place in the neighborhood -- many heavy, steel-braced wooden 
walls that county flood control crews had erected to divert the anticipated 
runoff from the homes and into newly paved flood-control channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Paul, a 65-year-old retiree who lives with his dog, Biff, in an 18-foot 
trailer on the lot where his house burned to the ground last fall, was one of 
the few who decided not to evacuate on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived up here for 37 years," Paul said. "It gets exciting at times. We 
get to see a lot of nature, only sometimes nature goes on a rampage."

COLLEGES WILLING, ABLE TO TAKE TEAM; RAMS: MOST O.C. SCHOOLS SAY THEY COULD 
ACCOMMODATE PRACTICE AT LEAST FOR SHORT TERM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Rams, who could be homeless as of Thursday, might not have to look too 
hard or too long to find a new headquarters and practice facility. There are 
people willing to take them in, at least for the short term. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from some local colleges said they would be more than happy to talk 
with the Rams, who were asked Thursday by Anaheim city officials to vacate Rams 
Park because of a lease dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course (we would consider it)," UC Irvine Athletic Director Dan Guerrero 
said. "I don't know what the scope or magnitude of their desires would be, but 
our relationship with the Rams has always been very positive. If their needs 
were to have us accommodate something for the short run, we'd be willing to 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have had an ongoing relationship with county colleges since 1961, 
when they moved their summer camp from the University of Redlands to Chapman 
College. They have held camp at Cal State Fullerton 24 times, Chapman six 
times, Irvine in 1991 and '92 and Long Beach State in 1972. They will return to 
Irvine this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero said the Rams have not contacted him. He said the university would be 
able to handle the Rams for a season, which might be all they need. Team 
officials have informed the city that they will exercise an escape clause in 
their Anaheim Stadium lease on May 3 and explore the possibility of moving the 
team. The team would then be required to play only one more season in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Several sites likely could accommodate them through 1994. But if the Rams opt 
to stay at the Big A, a long-term plan would be more difficult to hammer out, 
at least at four-year universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe our facilities could accommodate them on the long term," 
Guerrero said. "They'll need offices and video rooms and all that sort of 
thing. And for them to actually build a complex on our campus, that would 
require a lot of steps (approval of regents, state committees, etc.). I would 
think that for them to move into a private site where they could make a few 
limited modifications would be in their best interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, the Rams' summer site in 23 of 24 years from 1967 to 1990, would 
seem to be another logical spot in the short term. The school has a stadium, 
but no longer fields a football team. There is an outdoor weight room and 
several athletic fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to contact us and sit down to see if their needs match up with 
what we have available, we'll be happy to do that," said Sal Rinella, Cal State 
Fullerton's vice president for administrative affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fullerton would present some problems. The school uses its fields for 
physical education and recreation classes, and the stadium is used by the 
school's nationally ranked men's soccer team and by the Salsa of the American 
Professional Soccer League. And the Rams were unhappy with the meeting 
facilities and dorms during a one-year return to Fullerton for camp last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Other possibilities might be Long Beach State and the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach has the facilities but perhaps not the space because of 
construction of its new events center and other renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we could pursue the possibility, but right now we're strapped for 
space and use of facility," said Mark Edrington, Long Beach's director of 
facilities and marketing. "We have the field space, but with so much 
construction, we don't have any room available. I don't know what kind of 
office space they'd look for, but our athletic department is located in 
temporary trailers now." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, Long Beach would be interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time we can make revenue, we'd be interested, and there would be some 
notoriety having the Rams," Edrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro base has plenty of room, weight facilities and a training field 
but would also come with a mountain of red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't heard anything," said Master Sgt. Don Long, a Marine spokesman. 
"If the request came in, they would have to seek a facilities license, which 
means we'd have to determine if it's feasible, if it would interfere with 
military operations, and any kind of expenses that team would have to cover." 
</P>
<P>
 Local community colleges are a lesser possibility; those schools have football 
programs of their own that would cause a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have to practice ourselves," said Golden West Coach Ray Shackelford. 
"Nobody has the space for them."

FATHER SAYS DOCTORS IMPLANTED ABUSE MEMORY; PSYCHIATRY: PLAINTIFF, WHO WAS 
ACCUSED OF MOLESTING HIS DAUGHTER, A FORMER UCI STUDENT, IS AMONG FIRST TO 
LEGALLY CHALLENGE VALIDITY OF 'RECOVERED MEMORIES.' 
</P>

<P>
 A father faced off in court Thursday against his daughter's two therapists, 
contending they conned her into "remembering" childhood sexual abuse that never 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed by former wine company executive Gary Ramona is among the 
first to challenge the validity of so-called "recovered memories." Some 
national experts say the time is right. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a certain number of therapists who see sexual abuse in every 
patient they see," said Dr. Harrison Pope, a Harvard University psychiatrist 
who has helped Ramona. "And they can lead a patient by a thousand suggestions 
and implications, and by reinforcing what they do and don't listen to." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona's life was shattered in 1990 when daughter Holly, then a student at UC 
Irvine, confronted him over childhood sexual molestation she recalled during 
psychiatric treatment for the eating disorder bulimia. She later filed a 
lawsuit, which is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona, 49, denied abusing his daughter as a toddler. No criminal charges were 
filed. 
</P>
<P>
 But he soon lost his $300,000-a-year job as a vice president at the Robert 
Mondavi Winery. He was ostracized by friends, family and the Napa Valley 
community he called home for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 So he sued Western Medical Center-Anaheim and the therapists for $8 million, 
accusing them of implanting the molestation memories with improper suggestion 
and drug use. Holly Ramona, now 23, is scheduled to testify in her therapists' 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona's attorney, Richard Harrington, opened his case Thursday by portraying 
a daughter who had been unhappy and overweight since childhood. He said she 
sought treatment as a UC Irvine college student while suffering from bulimia, 
only to be mishandled by a family counselor and a hospital psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 The counselor, Marche Isabella, repeatedly insisted that bulimia was caused by 
childhood sexual abuse and that the subsequent use of the drug sodium amytal 
proved that Holly's flashbacks were true, Harrington said. He said the 
accusations came despite repeated medical exams during childhood which showed 
no evidence of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Isabella finally confronted Ramona in an emotionally charged meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confess that you raped your daughter," Harrington quoted Isabella as saying. 
"We know because we gave her truth serum." 
</P>
<P>
 As the defense prepared for its opening statements, Isabella flatly denied 
Harrington's accounts of their confrontation in March 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never accused him of raping his daughter," she said. "I don't have a 
problem with Gary Ramona. His daughter does." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is expected to take four to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the defendants, including Isabella and psychiatrist Dr. Richard 
Rose, say the pain was self-induced by Ramona's actions with his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not implant false memories," said Rose. "The patient came to us with 
all the memories she reported to us." 
</P>
<P>
 It's "a creative attempt for a manipulative man to continue to manipulate," 
Bruce Miroglio, Rose's lawyer, told reporters. The therapists' techniques were 
proper and professional, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another highly publicized California case supports the accuracy of some 
recovered memories. In 1991, a Redwood City, Calif., jury convicted George 
Franklin Sr. of the 1969 rape and murder of a childhood friend of his daughter 
Eileen. The conviction was based largely on the daughter's sudden recall of the 
event as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Ramona's memories began surfacing in 1989, she said, when she was 
attending UC Irvine and seeking treatment for bulimia, the syndrome of repeated 
gorging and vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first weeks after Holly confronted him, Ramona called around the nation 
seeking advice from experts. 
</P>
<P>
 He talked to Pope, one of the nation's leading experts on eating disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became so angry at what had happened to him," said Pope. "This was just so 
outrageous, I told him that we have to do something." Pope's partner, Dr. James 
Hudson, is due to testify for Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
 Other experts have joined with Ramona, including Dr. Martin Orne, a University 
of Pennsylvania Medical School psychiatrist who said in court documents that 
Holly's sodium amytal treatment "can best be described as a form of 'conning 
the patient.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Family counselors not involved in the case say "recovered memories" of 
childhood sexual abuse can be a minefield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never suggest to clients that they are in denial and they are trying not to 
remember," says Steven Gold, who practices in Santa Cruz County. "But there are 
some therapists who have hidden agendas." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fighting for my daughter, first of all, but there are some 3,000 families 
that have similar problems with the false memory syndrome," said Ramona outside 
court on Thursday. "She was told lies by this big hospital and the chief of 
psychiatrics and my loving word was suddenly gone."

 It's good to see some companies relaxing their loan requirements: When 
Transamerica Financial Services wrote to Brian Cagle of Westchester, offering 
to make him a $3,000 loan "in just two working days," family members were 
frankly surprised.  
</P>
<P>
 After all, Brian's a freeloader who still lives at home with his parents. And 
he's not working, though the job market is admittedly limited for 1-year-olds. 
But his father, Dave, points out that Transamerica was correct in assuming 
Brian possessed collateral. "He has a bunch of stuffed animals," his father 
said.

 We are being watched: That was the feeling of several readers, including 
Malibu's Bigfoot Museum curator Jon Erik Beckjord, after they saw the spooky 
weather satellite photo in The Times the other day. Who is that giving L.A.

seen anything so unsettling since he came upon a NASA photo that showed a 
Martian rock formation resembling the face of Teddy Kennedy.

 A letter of quality: Karen Owens of Sierra Madre received an invitation to a

cost-cutting opportunities that most other attendees don't have. . . . You can 
save on air fare and hotel rates by commuting each day."

 Cheeseburger -- hold the controversy: You may recall we quoted two historical 
journals as saying that the appropriately named Lionel Sternberger invented the 
cheeseburger in the early 1920s in Pasadena. We thus deflated, in short order, 
the claims of cooks in Denver and Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then, two different readers have made the sizzling assertion that 
Sternberger actually scored his culinary breakthrough in Highland Park, in his 
eatery, the Rite Spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, Gordon Gulack of El Monte offers eyewitness evidence in favor of 
Pasadena.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I was going to Pasadena High in the '20s, we used to go to a very small 
hamburger place run by Lionel Sternberger," Gulack writes. "This was before he 
opened the Rite Spot. It was a few miles east of there on Colorado (Boulevard) 
in Pasadena. I can remember getting a cheeseburger. . . ."

 Pasadena -- the honor's yours. Let's move on to something more significant.

 James Miller, the Nevada para-glider who landed at an L.A. Raiders game last

misdemeanor charge. Miller, who also para-glided into the boxing ring during a 
heavyweight fight in Las Vegas, was recently arrested upon landing in that city 
in connection with that incident. Ironically, Miller had returned on a 
commercial flight.

PHILIP MORRIS SUES ABC FOR $10 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Philip Morris Companies Inc. filed a $10-billion lawsuit against ABC Thursday, 
accusing the TV network of libel in an investigation of the cigarette industry 
on its prime-time newsmagazine "Day One." 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-part series on cigarettes that aired in February and March, "Day One" 
said that the tobacco company "artificially spiked" cigarettes with nicotine 
"in order to keep people smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 "Philip Morris does not in any way, shape or form spike its cigarettes with 
nicotine," Murray Bring, senior vice president of Philip Morris, told a news 
conference. "These allegations are not true, and ABC knows that they are not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC News responded with a statement saying that it "stands by its reporting on 
this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in Virginia Circuit Court in Richmond, Va., where Philip 
Morris has cigarette-manufacturing operations, names "Day One" reporter John 
Martin and producer Walt Bogdanich as defendants along with ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring said that contrary to ABC's report, the cigarette manufacturing process 
actually reduces the level of nicotine by about 20% to 25%. He said that the 
amount of nicotine in cigarettes has declined more than 50% over the past 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring said that following the ABC reports on Feb. 28 and March 7, Philip 
Morris' stock price "declined dramatically" and members of Congress called for 
investigations into the cigarette-manufacturing processes. Philip Morris is the 
nation's largest cigarette company. 
</P>

 Earlier this month, David Kessler, commissioner of the Food and Drug 
Administration, raised the possibility of designating nicotine as a drug, which 
could lead to FDA regulation of tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not think the FDA has or should assert jurisdiction in this area," 
Bring said. Tobacco products aren't foods, drugs or cosmetics, the only 
products the agency regulates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nicotine as used in cigarettes is not a drug," he said. "It's a natural 
element found in the plant itself." 
</P>
<P>
 The House Energy and Commerce Committee's health subcommittee was scheduled to 
hold a hearing today on regulating the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris' suit seeks $5 billion in compensatory damages and $5 billion in 
punitive damages for "the false and defamatory statements contained in 'Day 
One's' broadcasts (that) were made knowingly, recklessly and with malice," the 
company said in a prepared statement.

HOT CONCERTS, PRICEY TICKETS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Worried about getting shut out in the rush for Barbra Streisand tickets when 
they go on sale Sunday, and for Eagles reunion tickets when they go on sale 
April 2? 
</P>
<P>
 Frightened by the prospect of having to then turn to brokers who might charge 
outrageous sums -- maybe as high as the $2,000 that choice seats commanded for 
Streisand's recent Las Vegas shows? 
</P>
<P>
 The news may not be as alarming. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Times survey of Southern California ticket brokers, the outlook is that 
the best seats from brokers for Streisand's May 25, 27 and 29 shows at the 
Anaheim Arena should top out at a mere $1,000, while key Eagles seats are 
expected to level off around $500. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Vegas, (the Streisand) was a special situation," says Harris Rosner, owner 
of VIP Tickets in Sherman Oaks. "To begin with, the face value of the top 
tickets was $1,000 and you just couldn't get them." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Bongiovanni, editor of Pollstar, a trade magazine that tracks the concert 
business, agrees with Rosner's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of well-heeled people in L.A., but not a lot of people will 
part with $2,000 to see Barbra Streisand," he said. "You have to have more 
money than you know what to do with. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your oil well is gushing away in your back yard, it's no problem, but for 
most people it's out of the question. And remember: There are going to be 
40,000 tickets available at Anaheim, so people will be able to get them without 
paying that much." 
</P>
<P>
 The face value of tickets for Streisand's Anaheim shows ranges from $50 to 
$350 -- still high by pop concert standards, but well below the Vegas tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the Eagles shows are expected to be in the more traditional 
concert price range. The band's first reunion tour since 1980 is scheduled to 
begin at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on May 27, 28, 29 and 31 and at the Glen 
Helen Blockbuster Pavilion on June 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles tour will feature the group's final lineup of Don Henley, Glenn 
Frey, Joe Walsh, Don Felder and Timothy B. Schmit. It is expected to run at 
least through September, with a return to Southern California for arena or 
stadium dates possible in late summer. Plans are also being made for a 
televised performance and live album release. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokers expect the top Eagles tickets for the Irvine and Blockbuster shows to 
run about the same as for the best seats at the season's others big concerts: 
Pink Floyd at the Rose Bowl, April 16 and 17, and for the planned Rolling 
Stones dates in late summer.  
</P>
<P>
 "Pink Floyd has gone up to as much as $500 per ticket," says David Clem, 
manager of Applause Tickets. But he noted that the addition of the second Floyd 
show made more tickets available and drove the prices down. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the brokers say, a glut of upcoming shows appealing to the baby 
boomer market could keep the prices of many events lower than might be expected 
under other circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got all these shows -- the Stones, Pink Floyd, Traffic, possibly Elton 
John with Billy Joel, and the rumors of a Led Zeppelin tour," says Rosner. 
"Maybe people will mortgage their homes to sit in the first row of every show. 
I hope so, but I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers note, however, that for any of these -- especially the likes of 
Streisand, the Eagles and Led Zeppelin, none of whom have toured for years -- 
there is the wild card "high roller" factor.

JUST MAKING IT UP AS THEY GO ALONG -- SUCCESSFULLY; IMPROV: STAND-UP'S HUMBLER 
COUSIN IS GETTING SOME ATTENTION, THANKS IN PART TO A CABLE SHOWCASE. 
PARTICIPANTS LIKE THE 'RUSH' OF 'WALKING A TIGHTROPE.'

 On the stage of a comedy club, a three-headed psychiatrist is being asked what 
men and women can do to communicate more effectively. Each head quickly spits 
out a single word until a sentence is completed: 
"Give-each-other-plenty-of-hard-candy." The unusual doctor's impromptu advice 
is greeted with a wave of laughter.  
</P>
<P>
 The talking heads belong to three of the members of Wrought Irony, an 
improvisational comedy group that's been holding forth at the Laugh Factory in 
West Hollywood every Sunday night for almost four years. Each week the 
performers take to the stage without any idea of what they'll be doing on it, 
relying on crowd suggestions to guide and shape their comedic endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a rush," says group director Mike Colasuonno. "You're walking a 
tightrope, and it's a very exhilarating challenge. Can you make something funny 
out of nothing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the brash street smarts of stand-up comedy, improv often comes 
across as something of a humble, flighty cousin. But while the improv and 
sketch comedy groups of the L.A. area make do with a low profile in the 
entertainment industry, the work they produce is considered within the improv 
world to be some of the finest in the country. The success of the cable TV 
improv showcase "Whose Line Is It, Anyway?" on Comedy Central has begun to stir 
some industry interest in the scene. But most local players say they 
participate in improv and sketch comedy primarily for the sheer joy of making 
stuff up as they go.  
</P>
<P>
 "You get hooked on it," Colasuonno explains with a shrug. The improv veteran 
has a respectable day job as a writer for "The Tonight Show," but he continues 
to find the time to keep his freewheeling comedy group active. "It's hard to 
give up once it's in your blood."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Jennifer Joyce was hooked into the improv scene a few years back when 
she happened upon a performance by Los Angeles' best-known comedy troupe, the 
Groundlings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I saw the show, I didn't really know how to pinpoint what I wanted to 
do as an actress. But while I was watching the performance my heart started 
pounding because I was seeing exactly the kind of thing I'd always wanted to be 
a part of." 
</P>
<P>
 The Groundlings have been mixing polished comedy sketches with improvisational 
scenes for almost 20 years. Many successful comedy careers have been launched 
from the Groundling stage, including those of "Saturday Night Live's" Julia 
Sweeney, Phil Hartman and Jon Lovitz. "Late Night" host Conan O'Brien also once 
romped as a Groundling. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to L.A. in 1985, I happened to see an improv show called 
'Instaplay,' " O'Brien recalls. "It was put on by Bill Steinkellner, who later 
executive-produced 'Cheers.' The group presented a musical called 'Beverly 
Hills Ninja' based on audience suggestions. It was one of the best uses of 
improvisation I'd ever seen, and I wanted to be a part of the improv scene. I 
got into the Groundlings program right away." 
</P>
<P>
 While working his way up through Groundling classes and supporting himself as 
a comedy writer, O'Brien was also involved with smaller improv groups.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles carries the reputation of being a tough town for theater work, and 
it's even tougher for improvisers to get widespread attention. An outpost of 
Chicago's famed Second City theater wasn't able to support itself here in the 
late '80s, and when the recent earthquake damaged Santa Monica's Upfront 
theater beyond repair, improv groups such as the Transformers and the Alumni 
Players were left without a home. (The Alumni have taken up residence for the 
time being at the Improv on Melrose Avenue, and plan to re-open at a new venue 
in Santa Monica by May 1.) Despite the obstacles, local groups continue to get 
by relying on volunteer or fee-paying performers and a strong but small core of 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audience support is great," says Dan O'Connor, who works as a member of 
Wrought Irony. "Nobody is going to make a fortune working in improv, but it's 
satisfying to see people come back again and again." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor is also the artistic director of LA TheatreSports, a group that takes 
the game elements of improv to wild extremes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday nights, Theatre-Sports presents "Triple Play," a more dramatically 
oriented improv performance, and a recent guest performer was Mike McShane of 
the British program "Whose Line Is It, Anyway?" The show's producers spotted 
McShane in San Francisco, where he was working with the improv group Faultline. 
He's currently in England taping another season's episodes of the show, and 
then plans to move to Los Angeles, where he'll continue to improvise while 
pursuing his acting career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the quickness and cleverness of improv, and the fact that the audience 
participates," he says. "I love the give and take between the players and the 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Although stand-up and improv performers both seek to entertain, they have very 
different relationships with their respective audiences. Joyce brought one of 
her Groundling creations to a stand-up stage with mixed success. "I came up 
with a hooker character and did a bit with her on the stage at the Comedy 
Store. I got laughs, but everybody thought I was a real prostitute. I got 
cornered afterward by a male dancer who said, 'Hey, I know where you're coming 
from.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Skov, who founded the 17-year-old LA Connection in Sherman Oaks, sees a 
future full of big possibilities for improv and says that the large number of 
groups based in Los Angeles guarantees that the scene will stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's all this talk about interactive entertainment right now, and one of 
the most economical and enjoyable ways to experience an interactive show is to 
see some improv comedy. There are more groups now than ever, and more 
performers are interested in doing the work. The competition makes us all 
better. The players have more outlets, the audience has more choices, and every 
group has a reason to be doing the best work that they possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Longoria of the Wild Side theater in North Hollywood agrees that improv 
groups shouldn't be worried about stealing one another's audiences. "I always 
thought my competition was the other theaters, but I've come to the conclusion 
that the real competition is TV and video. With so many choices at the flick of 
a remote, it's hard to get people out of the house. But it's a mistake for 
improv groups to aspire to the level of a sitcom. We're in a theater, and we 
have to meet the challenge of offering a quality, very entertaining theater 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Chain's improv group, Mice, has been offering free Saturday night shows 
of loony improv scenes for 14 years. He says that the spontaneous, off-the-wall 
humor in his shows is a great tonic after a tough week of work, but he also 
feels strongly that improv work shouldn't be instantly disposable.  
</P>
<P>
 "Improvising can help you understand screenwriting, editing and storytelling. 
It's important to get a crowd to laugh, but I feel you should be able to improv 
a scene that could go right into a movie or a TV show." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Acme Comedy Theatre, director Mark Sweeney is in pursuit of high-brow 
silliness. "I started the group here to do intelligent, non-offensive, 
non-mean-spirited comedy. We don't have to be intellectual, but intelligent is 
always nice." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien still drops in to work with the Groundlings occasionally and says he's 
still using the improv skills he developed with them as he pilots "Late Night." 
 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be improv in every monologue I do. Working five nights a week 
and doing maybe five jokes per monologue, I know some will misfire. That's when 
I think back to Groundling days and try to make something out of nothing. I had 
a joke misfire recently, and I decided to make it up to the audience by giving 
them three pushups. They liked it and probably went home remembering the 
ad-libbed pushups instead of any of the scripted jokes. I got the laugh, kept 
my improv sharp and managed to work on my pecs at the same time."

SOTHEBY'S RETURN TO LOS ANGELES OFF TO A FINE START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Returning to Los Angeles on Wednesday after a 12-year absence, Sotheby's 
racked up $1.24 million worth of sales in an auction of modern and contemporary 
prints. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 73, or about 19%, of the 380 works offered failed to find buyers and 
others commanded less than their estimated value in a two-part auction at the 
Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, the sales total measured up to the auction 
house's predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1907-08 etching of a nude by Georges Braque commanded the top price of 
$36,800 from an unidentified Japanese dealer who bid by telephone. The 11x7 
3/4-inch work, said to be the first print the French master ever made, was 
valued at $25,000 to $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A Japanese dealer also snapped up "Roofs of Paris," Yozo Hamaguchi's stylized 
depiction of illuminated rooftops -- but only after spirited competition. The 
price was estimated at $8,000 to $10,000, but it was sold for $26,450. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mexican dealer paid $24,150, the auction's third highest piece, for Rufino 
Tamayo's "1984 Suite," a set of eight aquatints. 
</P>
<P>
 (Buyers pay a 15% premium on works sold for $50,000 or less at Sotheby's 
auctions, and 10% on any amount in excess of $50,000. The premium is included 
in selling prices, but not in pre-sale estimates.) 
</P>
<P>
 Large groups of works by Pablo Picasso, Joan Miro, Tamayo and Hamaguchi sold 
briskly, while late 19th- and early 20th-Century American prints languished. 
But despite obvious weaknesses in an art market that boomed in the late 1980s 
and crashed when speculators bailed out, the auction appeared to be a solid 
start for an ongoing series of print sales, to be held twice each year, in 
March and October.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We were exceedingly pleased with the degree of interest in the auction and 
with people's delight in having print auctions back in Los Angeles," said 
Andrea van de Kamp, Sotheby's senior vice president and West Coast managing 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 people attended the afternoon session, leaving many empty seats in 
the hotel's Grand Trianon Room, but the evening sale packed in more than 325 
collectors, art dealers and representatives of local museums. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the buying was done by telephone or "order" bids, which are placed in 
advance, but members of the audience also placed bids by raising numbered 
paddles. Los Angeles dealer Manny Silverman bought Henri Matisse's 1934 
lithograph of a seated ballet dancer for $12,075, well above the pre-sale 
estimate of $7,000 to $8,000. Robert Berman, a local art dealer and auctioneer, 
snagged a Man Ray portfolio of 10 lithographs for $4,255.

JAZZ NOTES: A TIME OF HOPE AND RENEWAL FOR HUGH MASEKELA; THE SOUTH AFRICAN 
TRUMPETER IS IN A CELEBRATORY MOOD ON HIS U.S. TOUR, WHICH REACHES THE 
WADSWORTH TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela calls his new Triloka album "Hope," and 
for him the title couldn't be more apropos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that there is hope of peace and a new freedom in our land, it is time to 
exploit our rich cultural heritage in musical expression," says Masekela in a 
press release. "It is time to dance, to celebrate." 
</P>
<P>
 Masekela, who is in the midst of a whirlwind U.S. tour and who appears tonight 
with singer Miriam Makeba at the Wadsworth Theater, has been living in 
Johannesburg since 1991, ending a 30-year self-imposed exile to protest 
political conditions. He made "Hope," on which he blends his affinity for 
African roots music with a punchy jazz/fusion feel, with South African 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The album symbolizes a new beginning for my native land, as well as for my 
recording career," says the trumpeter, who is perhaps still best known for his 
1968 hit "Grazin' in the Grass." 
</P>
<P>
 On the current tour, Masekela brings along 11 South African musicians to play 
a lot of classic African material. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing the old songs," he says, "but we're finally playing them the 
way they were meant to be played." 
</P>
<P>
 Cole Gets Back to Town: Holly Cole, the Toronto-based singer who makes her 
third L.A. appearance Tuesday through Thursday at the Viper Room in West 
Hollywood, builds a good portion of her show around tunes like "Get Out of 
Town" or "Talk to Me, Baby" done at a shockingly slow crawl that is by turns 
seductive and revealing. Which is just the way she wants it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of strength to be really vulnerable in front of a lot of 
people, and I love doing it," she says. "I want a rendition to hit me where it 
hurts, where the real emotion lies." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Cole won a Juno -- the Canadian version of the Grammy -- as best 
contemporary jazz artist for her album "Don't Smoke in Bed." But the singer 
doesn't feel she can be pigeonholed as a jazz, pop, cabaret or any other style 
of artist, "nor do I want to be." For this reason, Cole chose to work the 
Viper, known for its mainly rock lineup. "We want to attract a crossover 
audience with an open mind," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesperson for the Viper said Cole's booking wasn't that unusual, 
explaining: "The music here is very diverse. As long as it's honest and 
genuine, then the genre doesn't matter." More jazz-related artists are on tap 
at the Viper, but so far no names have been announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenor Titan Coleman Hits L.A.: George Coleman counts his blessings. The 
high-energy, be-bop-based tenor sax ace -- renowned for his early '60s stint as 
a member of Miles Davis' quintet (with Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony 
Williams) -- says he hasn't received a lot of recognition through the years, 
but he's not worried. "I'm thankful for what I've got," says Coleman, 59. "My 
fans haven't forgotten me." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, who makes his first Southern California appearance in several years 
Thursday through April 2 at the Jazz Bakery in Culver City, knows that the 
accent in jazz today is on youthful players, but so what? "When you play, 
people don't look to see how old you are, as long as you play with enthusiasm 
and creativity, which is what I always try to do," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The saxman, who can be heard on "Live at Yoshi's" (Evidence), says that his 
time with Davis was extremely fortuitous. "It was one of the most profound 
times of my career," he says. "I experimented with my playing. I started 
stretching out more." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Cohn Benefit: Ellen Cohn was a devout music lover who, as an executive 
for the MAMA Foundation and Chase Music Group, furthered the careers of such 
artists as bandleader Bob Florence, pianist Terry Trotter and singer Mark 
Winkler, will be honored at a benefit Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The affair, to be held from noon to 5:30 p.m. at Catalina Bar & Grill, 
features Florence, keyboardists Trotter, Clare Fischer and Dave Mackay, the B 
Sharp Jazz Quartet, singers Julie Kelly and Shelby Flint, saxman Bob Sheppard 
and many others. Proceeds from the tribute will go to defray medical costs 
incurred by the family of Cohn, who died of cancer Oct. 10. Donation, $15.

POP ALBUM CHART; CURIOSITY KILLS THE COMPETITION

 Motley Crue fans apparently are curious about John Corabi, who replaced lead 
singer Vince Neil, translating that curiosity into a No. 7 debut for the band's 
new album. This may seem like a relatively low opening position for a group 
that's been so popular, but alternative rock is what's selling big now and 
Crue's brand of standard hard-rock has fallen on hard times. Speaking of 
veteran rockers, David Lee Roth's new "Your Filthy Little Mouth," sure died 
quickly. After entering at No. 78 last week, it fell to No. 144. Disco 
lives--thanks to Ace of Base. The group's album, "The Sign," took over the top 
spot on the pop chart, matching the success of the title single, which has 
headed the pop singles chart for the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 * New Age keyboardist Yanni continues to amaze. His live album jumped from No. 
26 to No. 11 after three weeks. Live albums usually slip after first-week sales 
to hard-core fans, but this one continues to gather steam. New Age 
stars--except for Enya--sell well long-term but rarely in big enough bunches to 
make much noise at the upper levels of the pop chart. This album has a good

 "The Fugitive," debuting on the rental chart at No. 5, may soon chase "In the 
Line of Fire" on the heels of Tommy Lee Jones' best supporting actor win. "The 
Fugitive," which grossed a whopping $180.6 million in theaters, would have 
entered at No. 1 if it were available exclusively as a rental. But it's also 
priced for the sales market, available for $15-$17 in many outlets. Don't rule 
out second-place "Demolition Man" in the race for the top of the chart, which 
would be a shoo-in if not for the tough competition. "The Good Son," the 
thriller starring Macaulay Culkin, debuted at No. 7. It did fairly well in 
theaters--$44.4 million--even with normally spunky hero Culkin playing against 
type as the villain. Fans who like Mike Myers in the "Wayne's World" movies may 
be inspired to see him in the wacky "So I Married an Axe Murderer," although 
moviegoers certainly didn't care about the film--accounting for its paltry 
$7.3-million gross. Though it's off to a slow start, debuting at No. 29, it may 
find an audience on home video. 
</P>
<P>
 Woody Allen's witty "Manhattan Murder Mystery," featuring Diane Keaton, 
debuted at No. 30. It won't be a huge home-video hit, but his loyal 
followers--mostly sophisticated big-city dwellers--should love it, especially 
those who are starved for an old-fashioned Allen comedy. "Manhattan Murder 
Mystery" appealed to his movie-going fans to the tune of a $10.5-million gross, 
a disappointment for an Allen movie. 03,31,06,08 Rank Weeks Last on the Week

HOW O.C. SNARED THE EAGLES

<P>
 When the Eagles alight at Irvine Meadows for four shows in late May, they will 
be feathering a nest co-owned by their manager, Irvine Azoff. 
</P>
<P>
 But Azoff said Thursday that his partnership interest in the 15,000-capacity 
amphitheater is not the only reason the reunited band will be playing most of 
its Southern California dates in Irvine (a fifth show is booked at the Glen 
Helen Blockbuster Pavilion in San Bernardino County). 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't hurt that Irving Azoff is an owner of Irvine (Meadows)," Azoff 
said. "But there weren't tons of options." Azoff said the Eagles considered 
playing instead at such bigger venues as Anaheim Stadium, Dodger Stadium and 
the Rose Bowl, but they weren't available. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to be outdoors. Irvine was a logical place. The band loves Irvine, 
and it's a great-sounding place." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Meadows shows are the first scheduled stops on the Eagles' tour, 
their first in 14 years. Azoff said the band will play stadium concerts in the 
summer after concentrating on smaller venues (with the exception of a stadium 
performance in Phoenix) this spring.

BOSLEY ON BROADWAY: HAPPY TO BE BACK; THEATER: AS THE FATHER IN THE $10-MILLION 
MUSICAL 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,' THE VETERAN ACTOR FINDS TODAY'S VISUALS 'JUST 
AMAZING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Award-winning actor Tom Bosley couldn't be happier about being back on 
Broadway after a 25-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
 But he still feels a bit like a fish out of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having a ball, but it's not quite what I expected," said Bosley, star of 
Disney's musical "Beauty and the Beast," which recently opened for previews at 
the Palace Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to come back to Broadway, but it's almost entirely different," 
Bosley said during a break in rehearsal. "We now use microphones, and there are 
a lot of computerized things with lights that we didn't have in my day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just amazing, really, the visuals that have become part of the Broadway 
theater," Bosley said. "Before we were really dependent on the music and the 
lyrics." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosley plays Beauty's father in the $10-million Disney extravaganza. Adapted 
from Disney's animated film of the same name, "Beauty and the Beast" is the 
story of a young woman in a provincial French town who falls in love with the 
Beast -- a handsome prince trapped in an evil spell that, if he can learn to 
love and be loved, will be broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosley's contract calls for him to be in "Beauty and the Beast" for six months 
with an option to renew. 
</P>
<P>
 And, if "Beauty and the Beast" becomes a hit, there's a good chance a second 
"Beauty and the Beast" company will open in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney has talked about the possibility down the line of an L.A. company, 
and, if I'm not involved in anything else, I would certainly consider that and 
be home at the same time," Bosley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Square-built and a bit chunkier than he was 25 years ago, the character actor 
is known in the industry an extremely hard-working "actor's actor." 
</P>
<P>
 In many of his roles, he combines the easygoing charm of the congenial 
neighbor next door with a strong sense of moral and ethical values. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's always tried to play parts that are good role models for young 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran of more than 1,000 TV appearances, Bosley is best known as Mr. 
Cunningham, Ron Howard's father on the long-running 1970s-80s series "Happy 
Days." 
</P>
<P>
 After his 11 years on "Happy Days," Bosley want on to play Sheriff Amos Tupper 
on "Murder, She Wrote" and, more recently, Father Dowling in the "Father 
Dowling Mysteries." 
</P>
<P>
 He made his Broadway debut as legendary Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia in the 1959 
production of the Pulitzer Prize-winning musical "Fiorello." He received a Tony 
for his performance as "the little flower," as the feisty LaGuardia was 
affectionately called, and went on to be in five more Broadway shows. 
</P>
<P>
 After his last time out on Broadway in 1969, Bosley began to work in 
television and movies exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bosley wanted to come back to Broadway a long time ago but turned down a few 
roles because he didn't think the shows would last. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't want to come here and do something and then fall by the 
wayside," he explained. "And I even gave consideration to replacing someone in 
a show. But when this show came along, I auditioned for it and they liked me. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I just got together with my family and made some sacrifices to make it 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 But the more things change on Broadway, the more they stay the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really overwhelmed with the amount of revivals that are coming in and 
that are already in," Bosley said. " 'Damn Yankees' is here. 'My Fair Lady' is 
here. 'Carousel' opens soon. And 'Showboat' is coming to town." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be like deja vu for me," he said. "Like it was when I first 
came to New York."

REVOLVING DOOR IN; TEATRO COMETA OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The thing about revolving doors is that they let you in -- and they also show 
you the way out. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, though, Joel Beers and his partners are thinking of the name of 
their fledgling theater group -- Revolving Door Productions -- as meaning only 
one thing: In, not Out. 
</P>
<P>
 When the group started rehearsals at downtown Fullerton's Teatro Cometa for 
their current show, "An Evening of One-Acts", it was just a visitor, subletting 
the small black box space from the Teatro Cometa company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino troupe had occupied the space for three years, occasionally 
producing new and old work with an activist bent in the tradition of Luis 
Valdez's El Teatro Campesino. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before "One-Acts" begins the second (and final) weekend of its run, 
Beers and company are settled in as the theater's main tenants, having signed a 
yearlong lease. The theater itself will undergo a Spanish-to-English name 
change on April 1: from Teatro Cometa to the Tribune Theatre, in honor of the 
Fullerton News-Tribune, whose printing operation was once located at the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers might remark that such a change doesn't mark real progress for 
theater in Orange County, dominated as it is by Anglo artists -- including the 
Revolving Door company. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of underrepresented minority voices on county stages was highlighted 
when The Times reported recently that the area's flagship professional theater 
company, South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, has never produced a work by a 
black American.  
</P>
<P>
 With a growing Latino community to draw from for support, Teatro Cometa was 
the only company exclusively addressing and serving Latinos in the county.  
</P>
<P>
 However, Beers noted in a phone interview, Revolving Door will "gladly" 
welcome Cometa back any time it wishes to produce work. "They leased the space 
to us at different times," Beers said, "so we'd be happy to return the favor." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Mansfield, the property's landlord, would not confirm reports that Cometa, 
which relied on grants and ticket sales, was behind in rent and had long been 
in a precarious financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Cometa, Mansfield said with a chuckle, "the theater turned into more of 
a party house than I had intended. It seemed as if (Cometa) lost the interest 
in (producing)." Mansfield added that he hadn't seen a recent Cometa show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cometa company reportedly is touring in Arizona and Colorado, and no 
company member could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Beers may sound apologetic for what he calls the "white, suburban" makeup of 
Revolving Door's membership (15 at the core, plus 15 supporters), but the 
troupe is giving youth a voice, being completely run by people under 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched in 1992 by a group of Fullerton College graduates -- including 
current company board members Jennifer Bishton, Nick Boicourt Jr., Steven 
Lamprinos and Bradley Whitfield -- the inspiration for the group was a 
Fullerton-born production of John DiFusco's Vietnam drama, "Tracers," which was 
taken to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "After it was over, they never lost touch," said Beers, 27. He wasn't part of 
the original group but knew the others while majoring in communications at 
Fullerton College. "There's been this desire ever since to do interesting 
theater, as a group of local artists committed to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Beers noted numerous Fullerton artists who have gone off to Los Angeles, New 
York and Europe (including founding members Steve Spehar, who is producing in 
Prague and England, and Michael Mollo, now in the Bay Area). 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us," he said, "have either left and come back or never left and want 
to stay. We're aware of being in the confines of Orange County, but this is our 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Using the Winged Heart Cafe coffeehouse (just west of the theater) as an 
initial base, Revolving Door mixed new plays ("Route of Chaos") with adapted 
pieces (Beers' and Mollo's "Visions: Portrait of a Beat Generation"). 
</P>
<P>
 The vagabond troupe also staged work at spaces at the Fullerton Museum Center 
and Tustin's Subterranean Blues Cafe and, with ties to the 
coffeehouse-music-spoken-word scene, arranged benefits involving several 
Fullerton bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Revolving Door board member Lamprinos, in fact, runs Homespun, an amalgam of 
five bands that will soon be producing a music-and-poetry CD. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homespun started at the same time as Revolving Door," said Beers, "so we're 
really part of the same thing. We want to incorporate music, poetry and visual 
art into the theater, so you can view the work of local artists . . . when you 
enter the theater. And when we're not doing a play, we'll do acoustic music 
evenings and readings. We'll mix it up." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's real concern, not surprisingly, is money. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue sources to pay the $650 monthly rent include nothing more than ticket 
sales ($5), fund-raisers and out-of-pocket donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be putting every penny into productions," Beers said. "Besides, we've 
never spent any more than $100 on any of the 10 pieces we've staged. Pretty 
soon, we'll apply for status as a nonprofit theater." 
</P>
<P>
 One summer production, Beers noted, may be a revival of Amiri Baraka's 
"Dutchman" but "only if we can find the right African American actor for the 
key role." 
</P>
<P>
 And if Revolving Door's dream of connecting theater with a bursting local boho 
sensibility sounds as if it's bound to go through the Out door, Beers considers 
SCR's fledgling days in the '60s: "They were all under 30, poor, struggling and 
didn't have a roof over their heads at first. We identify with that. And they 
made it."

THIS STAND-UP BOBCAT FEEDS ON ACTIVITY; COMEDY: HE SAYS HE'LL DO ANYTHING -- 
LIKE PERFORMING NUDE AND DRESSING AS JESUS. HIS NEXT STOP IS THE COACH HOUSE.

 So what's to make of this Bobcat Goldthwait? Here's a fellow who: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dressed as Christ to do magic tricks for a Comic Relief benefit, taking 
great pains to make sure his moves were smooth and professional.  
</P>
<P>
 * Rappelled onto an Oakland stage on New Year's Eve wearing nothing but angel 
wings, sneakers and a fur hat. ("That was painful.") 
</P>
<P>
 * Made a movie ("Shakes the Clown") in 1992 that was roundly denounced by 
clowns' organizations around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether you tag him a stand-up comic who writes and directs movies, or as 
an actor who does crazed stand-up is probably not that important to him, 
considering his attitude toward his field and niche in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll do whatever I'm asked to do," Goldthwait said in an early-morning 
interview earlier this week from his Omaha hotel before heading to St. Louis. 
"Nothing is precious about what I do. Everyone forgets that show business is 
not reality. The products are fictitious, not valuable." 
</P>
<P>
 That the Hollywood Hills resident was calling from Nebraska is no surprise. It 
could just as easily have been Lake Havasu City, Ariz., or Bangor, Me. Earlier 
this year, he wrapped up a nine-city tour with Nirvana, which included the nude 
rappelling. ("I learned that if you're naked at midnight, you don't get any 
kisses.")  
</P>
<P>
 His itinerary is impressive: The all-too-frequent flyer has played every state 
except North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like those people," he explained in a scratchy voice but without his 
trademark whiny screech. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait, who appears tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, 
generally performs in clubs, theaters and rock venues. In April, he'll be 
touring Australia before heading to New York to tape a public-service message 
for MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, all the travel catches up with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like, I went to the dog museum yesterday. I'll go to the bowling museum 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he has come a long way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing stand-up since I was 15 and started playing gong shows (open 
mikes) and stuff in Syracuse (N.Y.)," said Goldthwait, who is married and has a 
son, 11, and a daughter, 7. 
</P>
<P>
 From his native town, he went to Boston, where in 1982 he earned a spot on 
"Late Night With David Letterman." He did a stint in San Francisco before 
heading to Los Angeles, where he was noticed on a showcase night that led to a 
film role as gang leader Zed in "Police Academy 2," the first of three "Police 
Academy" movies the 31-year-old comic has done. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also seen in "Scrooged" with Bill Murray and a self-directed HBO 
special, "Is He Like That All the Time?," as well as spots on "The Tonight 
Show" and "Arsenio Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 The name Bobcat came about, he said, because there was already another Bob 
Goldthwait ("a weatherman somewhere") in the guild. "It was a union deal, but I 
got a great dental plan out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 He is doing five stand-up events this week. Asked how his recent shows went 
over, he replied with a simple, "Well, no one got hurt." 
</P>

 He does, however, differentiate among audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The West Coast is more tolerant. Without California, there would be no mimes. 
The rowdier crowds are in the East. I probably do more shows in New England 
than anywhere else, a lot of colleges. In the heartland, the crowds are polite, 
but maybe later they put on white sheets and let you know what they really 
think. I like the obnoxious crowds. I know what they're thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, he said he's happy with the state of stand-up, despite club closures 
and waning attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom feeders have moved on, all the soap-opera stars," he said. 
"Performers who really like comedy are sticking around." 
</P>
<P>
 Before starting his current tour, he finished doing George Lucas' "Radioland 
Murders" in North Carolina with Mary Stuart Masterson, Ned Beatty, Harvey 
Korman and Michael McKean. He plays a writer in what he says is a screwball 
comedy set in the '30s. It's due out in the fall or winter. 
</P>
<P>
 As for "Shakes the Clown," which he wrote, directed and starred in, Goldthwait 
isn't sure why its appeal was limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part, people hated it," he said. "I don't know why. I wish it 
had succeeded. I was just trying to make myself and my friends laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 He remains undaunted, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still writing scripts," he said, "but 'Shakes 2' is not likely."

 Martin Marietta -- A Times story Thursday reported incorrectly that the 
Pentagon had agreed to allow Martin Marietta to share half the estimated $450 
million in future cost savings from the expected consolidation of the space 
systems division of General Dynamics in San Diego with Martin's space launch 
business in Denver. Actually, the Pentagon agreed to share half of an estimated 
$60 million in future cost savings from the consolidation.
