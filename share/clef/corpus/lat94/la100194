CHIEF ACCUSES CITY OFFICIALS OF 'TAMPERING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a rare public broadside, an angry Police Chief Willie L. Williams on Friday 
accused City Council members of attempting to thwart his proposed LAPD 
reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm facing political tampering, but the tampering is not going to be 
effective on Willie Williams as the chief of police," Williams told reporters 
after a graduation ceremony at the Los Angeles Police Academy. "I make the 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' comments came after several weeks in which the chief's management of 
the department has come under increasingly harsh criticism from members of the 
mayor's staff and from certain City Council members, some of whom are 
attempting to broker a deal to keep Williams' top aide, Assistant Chief Bernard 
C. Parks, from leaving the department. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference last month, Williams announced that he was not working 
effectively with Parks and was demoting him from assistant chief to deputy 
chief. Williams also announced the creation of a position of first assistant 
chief, installing Deputy Chief Ronald Banks in that job. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, Williams has come under heavy fire for his handling of 
the shake-up and has become embroiled in the most serious political controversy 
of his Administration. Within days of the initial announcement, council members 
intervened to protect Parks' pension by drafting a deal allowing him to retire 
at his current rank and salary in return for his agreement not to sue the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks' promotion also hit a snag when it became clear that the move required 
council approval. Williams still has not sent the proposal to City Hall for 
consideration, leaving the process in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Williams has tried to shore up his political support at the same 
time that some council members have moved to keep Parks in the department by 
promising to protect his salary even at the lower rank. Sources close to Parks 
say he is intrigued but undecided about that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The backlash has surprised and angered Williams, and it provoked the normally 
taciturn chief to lash back Friday during a carefully staged appearance. 
Dressed in full uniform and accompanied by the Police Commission president, 
Williams signaled his displeasure with council members and reaffirmed his 
determination to press ahead with the reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the fallout has "created a lot of concern because I was brought 
here to help manage the organization. I was not brought here for people to make 
decisions about what Willie Williams is going to do. . . . That has not 
happened in the past, and it will not happen in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, even as Williams spoke, council sources said opposition to his 
proposed reorganization remains formidable. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' comments appeared to have little effect on the council's misgivings. 
Councilman Nate Holden said the council was right to act in defense of a 
longtime, respected civil servant who was being mistreated. "If we can save 
him," Holden said, "the council should be applauded." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said he will not back off his efforts in 
support of Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't stand idly by and see anyone, and that includes a very popular police 
chief, ruin someone's career and reputation," Yaroslavsky said. "Having 
destroyed (Parks') reputation and demoted him on citywide television, he now 
wants to drive the final nail in his coffin and have him leave the department 
in a way that makes him unemployable." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the chief has said Parks is welcome to return to work as a deputy 
chief, Williams has never publicly specified where he would be assigned. That 
has redoubled the sense among some council members that Williams' real goal is 
to have Parks leave altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Williams' charges of political manipulation, Yaroslavsky and Holden 
said the City Council is exercising its authority to protect the city from 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks would have a good chance of winning a suit against the city because he 
was given improper notice of his termination, Yaroslavsky said. He added that 
Parks' exemplary record and position as the runner-up in the competition to 
become chief would make him a powerful witness before a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas of the Public Safety Committee said some of 
his colleagues are only complicating the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Members of the council who have interjected themselves into this conflict are 
making a bigger mess of an already messy situation," he said. "If they were 
protecting the city from liability, they wouldn't be mouthing off in the press, 
but very discreetly and privately trying to resolve it." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who has enjoyed deep political support and public admiration in his 
two years here, has been rattled by the fallout from his department shake-up. 
One televised report went so far as to suggest that Williams had been given a 
letter by Commission President Enrique Hernandez Jr. warning him that he had 
only a year to improve or face dismissal -- a report that Williams and 
Hernandez both said was inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no meeting," Williams said. "There was no letter. There was no time 
line. Whoever gave that to the reporter lied." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing by Williams on Friday, Hernandez also denied those reports and said 
the commission is supporting the chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commission is fully behind the chief of police," Hernandez said. "He must 
have the ability to manage the department on his own, separate and apart from 
outside interference." 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the news conference, the chief took pains to rebut suggestions that 
doubts about his management have grown so severe that his job might be in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be here for the next three years, and I plan on being here for five 
years after that if the Board of Commissioners says so," Williams said. "It's 
clear that I need the support of the council as they've given every previous 
chief to make the decisions inside the organization and manage it." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief's debate with the council is only one facet of the complex political 
struggle that has erupted over the proposed reorganization. In fact, the 
escalating debate has opened a network of fissures between the LAPD, the 
council and the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan and his staff have become increasingly insistent that 
Williams deliver on such programs as a highly touted LAPD expansion plan, and 
they have expressed impatience with the lack of progress in hiring thousands of 
new officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said it is actually Riordan's office, and in particular the 
mayor's chief of staff, William Ouchi, that has been guilty of tampering with 
the Police Department's affairs. He reiterated earlier reports that Ouchi had 
met with Parks in April and said that he could help find the veteran LAPD 
officer a job in the federal government if he would leave his post with the 
LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is tampering. What we are trying to do is simply to preserve a career 
that has been put in jeopardy in the most shabby way," Yaroslavsky said. "That 
is not tampering, that is just humane."

7 KILLED AS HAITIAN GUNMEN DISPERSE MARCHERS IN STREET; CARIBBEAN: 
DEMONSTRATIONS CELEBRATING THE EXPECTED END OF THREE-YEAR MILITARY RULE 
DISINTEGRATE UNDER ATTACKS BY POLICE, ARMED HELPERS. U.S. TROOPS DO NOT 
INTERVENE.

<P>
 A mass demonstration celebrating the expected end of three years of brutal 
military rule here disintegrated into despair and death Friday as U.S. troops 
ceded the city's heart to Haitian police and armed thugs. At least seven people 
died, including two apparent members of the paramilitary forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the presence of more than 20,000 American troops brought to Haiti to 
secure order and protect followers of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
as the military leaves power, key streets on the demonstration route were taken 
over by the most vicious anti-Aristide forces -- the Haitian police and their 
armed civilian helpers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitian forces used American-made M-16 assault rifles, nail-studded clubs 
and glistening machetes to beat and shoot at the peaceful marchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration had been organized by supporters of Aristide, who was 
overthrown in a bloody coup on Sept. 30, 1991, and is scheduled to return to 
power under an agreement negotiated Sept. 18 that promised an end to military 
rule by Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's killings took place at the same site where a death squad shot and 
killed a bystander watching a pro-democracy demonstration just two days 
earlier. And near the spot where a grenade blast killed five people Thursday, a 
crowd of hundreds on Friday looted a Cash and Carry food store. 
</P>
<P>
 The day had started uncertainly but emotionally. Thousands of Haitians 
gathered on the fringes of downtown Port-au-Prince, still cautious from several 
days of scattered violence that included looting of food warehouses and the 
grenade attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Although street merchants set up stalls, most businesses were shuttered, and 
few cars ventured into downtown. The American troop positions that created a 
horseshoe-shaped cordon around the city center drew crowds of generally happy 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrations began with a highly charged Mass in the early morning at 
the city's Notre Dame Basilica, to be followed by a series of marches to the 
central cemetery. There, speeches would honor the estimated 3,000 Haitians 
killed by the military during its brutal turn in power and a mock funeral for 
the regime would be staged. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid Haitian hymns of forgiveness and reconciliation, Father Jean Juiste, a 
key ally of Aristide, beseeched more than 2,000 parishioners sitting in the 
church to remain peaceful, even if attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our march this morning will not be against anybody," the eloquent priest said 
from the pulpit. "It is for the blood that has flowed three long years ago, and 
to make sure that blood is used to nurture a new life for Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "If during that march, if trouble occurs, you must show you are mature, or 
there will be a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, Father Juiste was in the street, waving his hands, 
appealing to U.S. soldiers to intervene to stop the killing of marchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade route sent the demonstrators into an area controlled by the Front 
for the Advance and Progress of Haiti, a notorious death squad known by its 
French initials as FRAPH, only a block from the Haitian National Palace and the 
Haitian military headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 About two dozen FRAPH members then precipitated a series of street fights that 
lasted until late afternoon. Though their force was small, they easily drove 
off demonstrators who approached. 
</P>
<P>
 On at least four occasions, pickup trucks carrying armed, uniformed Haitian 
police took FRAPH members aboard and carried them toward the demonstrators. The 
armed civilians leaped from the trucks and assaulted the marchers, then climbed 
back aboard and were hauled back to FRAPH headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Under attack, most of the demonstrators never reached their destination, the 
city's main cemetery that is the burial site of many of the 3,000 people who 
human rights groups say have been killed under military rule. They ran in panic 
when the shootings and beatings began. 
</P>
<P>
 When remnants of the marchers -- numbering only 30 or 40 -- did reach the 
cemetery, they were forced to flee again when more shots were fired from across 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the dead were seen by an American reporter in the immediate vicinity of 
an office and bar controlled by Haiti's police chief, Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph 
Francois, and used by FRAPH. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence went well beyond attacks on demonstrators. Among the dead was a 
Haitian described as a driver for an American television network. Although a 
foreigner who was with him was let go, the Haitian was killed with a shot to 
the head and two more to the chest as he tried to hide on a porch. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other men described by witnesses as demonstrators were chased down by 
FRAPH members who trapped them in a doorway a block and a half from the FRAPH 
office. One was killed with an M-1 military rifle, the other with a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more bodies were found in a doorway less than a block from the FRAPH 
office. A sixth death came when a FRAPH member who had shot two of the 
demonstrators was turned upon and beaten to death with a wrecking bar. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one other FRAPH member was reported killed when demonstrators 
discovered he had infiltrated their ranks. Witnesses said the crowd went after 
him and crushed his head with a cement block after he pulled a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters were chased, shot at and hit by club-wielding civilians who emerged 
periodically from the FRAPH building. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said even before the day began that 
U.S. forces would be used only to cordon off Port-au-Prince's residential 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The city center and commercial area where demonstrations were to take place 
would be in the jurisdiction of the local authorities, he said -- a statement 
that was played on national radio repeatedly during the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. forces took over state television and radio Friday morning at the request 
of Aristide's representatives, officials said, asserting that troops would not 
broadcast on the stations or influence future broadcasts in any way. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why American forces, which now number about 20,000 in Haiti, took no 
action to stop the carnage, U.S. military spokesman Col. Barry Willey said: 
"Our mission was to provide a cordon to control and to deter, but not to get 
into controlling the march itself. Our mission was not, and still is not, to 
serve as a police force." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. officials blamed the death and destruction on the incompetence of the 
Haitian police, who, Schrager said, were given full responsibility for keeping 
order -- a policy one Haitian leaflet likened to "letting the cat protect the 
mouse." 
</P>
<P>
 In a heated briefing late in the day, Schrager indicated that U.S. commanders 
were re-examining the policy and considering harsher measures and disarmament 
of police and civilians alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Schrager's statement on limited American involvement emboldened the local 
forces, according to one Haitian officer, Capt. Josue Montheville, who said his 
men were told to use whatever tactics necessary "to maintain order." 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters accompanying the marchers, who were attacked almost immediately 
after leaving the Mass at the church, said the number of demonstrators never 
totaled more than 10,000, despite earlier predictions that the day's events 
would draw hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 The brutality of the Haitian police was well known by the U.S. military well 
before Friday's killings. Just 10 days earlier, American soldiers had looked on 
in frustration as Haitian forces beat pro-U.S. demonstrators, killing at least 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 This led Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, commander of the U.S. forces here, to demand 
that Haitian military commander Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and police chief Francois 
stop the beatings and to warn that they would be held responsible for the acts 
of their troops. 
</P>
<P>
 No U.S. soldiers on Friday were posted anywhere near the FRAPH headquarters, 
which is less than a mile from a heavy concentration of American forces. One 
U.S captain said he was aware of the situation "but was under orders not to 
move out." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told we want to avoid a firefight that might end up killing 
bystanders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Willey confirmed Friday afternoon that while U.S. commanders can 
intervene to prevent Haitians from killing Haitians, they are not to do so if 
it puts American soldiers in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked specifically why U.S. forces did not concentrate their heavy armor in 
the known trouble spot before the march began, Col. Willey said: "I'm not going 
to stand here and discuss what we did know and didn't know and why we did what 
we did." 
</P>
<P>
 But Col. Willey and Schrager clearly left the door open to expanding the U.S. 
military's law-enforcement role. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear we are going to do something about it," Schrager said. "We are not 
going to continue to permit the violent loss of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Cap Haitien on Haiti's northern coast, about 2,000 demonstrators 
marched through the streets Friday, singing songs in support of Aristide and 
chanting slogans denouncing the local police. 
</P>
<P>
 The largely peaceful crowds, which marched for more than four hours, decried 
the 10 Haitian police officers killed by U.S. Marines last weekend in Cap 
Haitien.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, a Haitian soldier was killed when a crowd rushed him at 
the Cap Haitien bus station and his guns apparently went off. 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.S. military authorities, the soldier, identified as 38-year-old 
Franz Bazil, normally guards Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic.  
</P>
<P>
 Bazil was not in uniform. But when the crowd recognized him and pushed around 
him, he attempted to draw two pistols that were tucked under his belt. One of 
the weapons fired and struck a teen-age boy in the knee. The other gun also 
went off, fatally wounding Bazil in the abdomen.

HAITIANS ASK, 'WHERE ARE THE AMERICANS?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As U.S. combat soldiers directed traffic, sipped from canteens or leaned up 
against massive tank barrels bearing such foreboding nicknames as "House of 
Pain," bewilderment and the seeds of anger began to well up Friday in alleyways 
and on street corners where Haitians had rejoiced in the U.S. forces' arrival 
just 11 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are the Americans?" shouted Eric Auguste, a pro-democracy demonstrator 
who for more than an hour had battled Haitian police -- the same police who are 
supposed to protect him -- as they attacked people gathered peacefully for a 
march against their country's military rulers. 
</P>
<P>
 As he fought bullets with rocks, Auguste shouted, "Why don't the American 
soldiers just take all their guns away? It would be easy for them. For us, we 
have only our bare hands." 
</P>
<P>
 A mile away, as the U.S. Military Police, part of a U.S. force sent here to 
restore democracy three years after a military coup overthrew President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, dug in behind the tanks and armed vehicles, another 
demonstrator who had fled the scene of carnage had a more dire assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, as the days are passing, the American soldiers are showing in which 
camp they now are. By not helping the people today, we can see they are with 
the police and their attaches ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were alarming words on a day when U.S. officials conceded there was 
concern at the highest levels that the U.S. military intervention here was near 
the brink of losing some of the hearts and minds of the poorest Haitians -- the 
people the Clinton Administration ordered the intervention to save from 
tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a great concern about that," conceded Stanley Schrager, U.S. 
Embassy spokesman, during a briefing assessing the day's events. "That is the 
kind of support that is necessary for us to accomplish our mission here." 
</P>
<P>
 Fueling such concern were other operational facets of the way the U.S. 
military Friday carried out a mission the U.S. Army spokesman here described as 
one only of deterrence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army's Sheridan tanks and vehicles with mounted machine guns blocked off 
streets leading to the wealthiest residential neighborhoods, where most of 
Haiti's elite strongly support the military rulers who seized power. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're guarding the rich, while leaving the poor to be slaughtered," said 
another demonstrator, who fled to one of the armored roadblocks after the 
pitched street battles broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the growing concern among U.S. officials and the Haitians 
alike is the issue of disarmament -- or rather, the lack of it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of Friday's killings, beatings and near-anarchy, Schrager 
refused to rule out the possibility that U.S. commanders will now decide to 
take more forcible measures to confiscate the vast weapons legally registered 
to Haiti's police and paramilitary groups. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that weaponry that was used Friday to terrorize a peaceful 
demonstration timed to commemorate the thousands of Haitian soldiers and 
civilians killed during the military coup on the same day three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the U.S. Command in Port-au-Prince has used only diplomacy and the 
implied threat of the troop presence to force Haiti's rulers to disarm their 
own agents. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Army spokesman Col. Barry Willey said Friday that the U.S. military is 
continuing a voluntary, nationwide money-for-guns program that so far has 
netted just 287 weapons, about half of which were grenades. 
</P>
<P>
 But most analysts said that it has yet to have any impact in a nation where 
there are between 75,000 and 100,000 legally registered firearms. And it was 
equally clear, as it was in the early days of the U.S. military's humanitarian 
intervention in Somalia, that Haitian popular opinion wants disarmament more 
than anything. 
</P>
<P>
 An old Haitian with a white beard and ancient blue Freemason's beret shouted 
such sentiment from the front steps of the Sante Rose Delima funeral parlor 
near the site of Friday's violence, which was largely restricted to the 
sprawling neighborhood around the paramilitary headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are your American soldiers doing here anyway?" he yelled to two passing 
American journalists. "There are two people shot dead inside here, killed by 
(the paramilitary group) FRAPH. And there are no soldiers to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Another elderly Haitian sitting beside him added: "Look, the population here 
loves the American soldiers. But since they are here, we don't see anything 
from them. They have to handcuff (Haitian army chief Lt. Gen. Raoul) Cedras and 
(Police Chief) Michel Francois, put them out of the country and take away all 
their guns." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. forces have, in fact, done a great deal. In another section of the 
city shortly before the gunfire broke out, U.S. Army Military Police caught one 
of the notorious attaches , or armed police allies, in the middle of the 
street. They stripped him of his pistol and two ammunition clips, handcuffed 
him and forced him to kneel in the street for half an hour as a crowd of 
thousands jeered and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 On a grander scale, U.S. Army technicians performed a near-miracle on Thursday 
night. After several day's work and with the flip of a switch, they doubled the 
power to a city that has lived with only a few hours of light each day for 
years.

ARTERY SURGERY BRINGS BIG DROP IN STROKE RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surgery that removes fatty deposits from the two main arteries in the neck 
that supply blood to the brain can sharply reduce the risk of stroke, one of 
the nation's leading causes of death and disability, the National Institute of 
Neurological Disorders and Stroke said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, said 
that they have halted a $20-million clinical trial that began enrolling 
patients in 1987 because results have been compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This finding will be of vital interest for individuals who are at risk of 
stroke, and who may already know that their carotid arteries are partially 
blocked," Institute Director Zach W. Hall said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the last 48 hours (we have) taken steps to inform the medical 
community of these important results so that they might be better able to 
evaluate and advise patients on the risks and benefits of surgical treatment to 
prevent stroke." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers said that the surgery, known as a carotid endarterectomy, lowered 
the five-year risk of stroke by about half, from greater than 1 in 10 to less 
than 1 in 20, in individuals who had not yet suffered a stroke or stroke-like 
symptoms but each of whom had an artery narrowed by at least 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroke, which occurs when brain cells die because of decreased blood flow, is 
the third-leading killer of Americans and the major cause of disability among 
adults. Carotid stenosis -- the condition of blocked arteries -- is responsible 
for 75% of all strokes. There are about 500,000 to 600,000 new strokes among 
Americans each year. They cause 150,000 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the estimated 3 million Americans who have survived strokes, more than 2 
million are left with crippling disabilities, such as paralysis, loss of speech 
or memory lapses. Stroke costs the nation about $30 million annually, according 
to NIH. 
</P>
<P>
 Carotid artery problems become more common as people age. They are caused by 
atherosclerosis or hardening of the two arteries, which is a buildup of fat and 
other materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgery, which removes fatty deposits known as plaque from the arteries, 
already has been proved effective in individuals who previously have had 
strokes and a demonstrated carotid artery blockage of 70% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 In this latter group, surgery reduces the estimated two-year risk of stroke by 
more than 80%, from greater than 1 in 4 to fewer than 1 in 10. In 1992, about 
91,000 Americans underwent the procedure, which costs about $15,000 and usually 
requires a hospital stay of as much as four days. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial was directed by Dr. James F. Toole, director of the stroke center 
and professor of neurology at the Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Wake Forest 
University, in Winston-Salem, N.C. The University of North Carolina School of 
Public Health at Chapel Hill served as the coordinating center for the study. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, conducted at 39 centers in the United States and Canada, involved 
1,662 men and women ages 40 to 79, each of whom had at least one carotid artery 
with a 60% or greater narrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the participants, 64% had hypertension, or high blood pressure, 26% had 
a history of cigarette smoking, 23% had diabetes, 21% had experienced a heart 
attack and 25% had suffered a mild stroke or symptom that was deemed unrelated 
to the carotid artery involved in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 All participants received conventional medical assistance for their risk 
factors, including aspirin, counseling to stop smoking and treatment for high 
blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. A subset of the group, 828 
randomly chosen participants, also received surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers said the study showed that only 4.8% of the surgical group risked 
a stroke within five years, compared to 10.6% of the non-surgical group. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the procedure reduced the risk by 55%, they said. Men showed a 69% 
reduction, while women showed 16%. The investigators said that they do not yet 
know the reasons for the difference between men and women, although they noted 
that the incidence of stroke in general is much higher in men. 
</P>
<P>
 Only facilities that had recorded few complications when performing the 
carotid surgeries were allowed to participate. Researchers emphasized that the 
track record of success was important for patients. 
</P>
<P>
 They "have the perfect right to ask the surgeon what his success rate is," 
said Dr. James T. Robertson, chairman of the American Heart Assn.'s stroke 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Michael D. Walker, director of the institute's division of stroke and 
trauma, which oversaw the trial, said: "When the surgery is performed to the 
standards set in the study, its long-term benefits clearly outweigh any 
short-term risks. Appropriate use of this technique has the potential for 
preventing many thousands of strokes every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Carotid stenosis often has no symptoms, thus "most people won't know" they 
have it, Toole said. However, it often can be detected during a normal checkup 
with a physician, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common method of diagnosis is the use of a stethoscope to listen for 
a rushing sound, called a bruit (pronounced "brew-ee"), in the carotid artery. 
Some patients can hear it themselves as "a swishing sound through their ears, 
when their heads are on a pillow," Toole said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, "dangerous levels of disease sometimes fail to make a sound and some 
blockages with a low risk can make a sound," the institute said. Thus, other 
diagnostic tests also are often employed to diagnose carotid stenosis, the 
institute said. Surgery's Success Rate 
</P>
<P>
 The study involved 1,662 patients who were found to have up to a 60% blockage 
of one of the two carotid arteries in the neck and who were experiencing no 
symptoms from the reduced blood flow. Half received one treatment and half the 
other. 
</P>
<P>

DUCKS FANS MIGHTY ANGRY AT HOCKEY SEASON IN LIMBO; SPORTS: SOME SAY NHL RISKS 
LOSING NEXT GENERATION OF ROOTERS, LIKE THE ONES IN O.C. WARMING UP TO NEW 
TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Kent and Rhonda Soper of Anaheim could serve as poster fans for the "new" 
National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent, 33, has been following the sport seriously since 1988, when he and a 
friend bought ticket packages for Wayne Gretzky's first season with the Los 
Angeles Kings. His wife, Rhonda, 36, began going to games occasionally several 
years ago and has since become a disciple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've created a monster," Kent says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent took a part-time job as an usher at The Pond of Anaheim just to be part 
of the hockey scene; Rhonda regularly uses the couple's single season ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 But a week from Sunday, when the Ducks are supposed to make their home season 
debut against the Calgary Flames, the Sopers will be at a loss. NHL 
Commissioner Gary Bettman announced Friday that team owners have decided to 
delay the start of the season -- which was to begin today with games that 
included the Mighty Ducks' opener at Dallas -- at least until Oct. 15 while 
stalemated collective bargaining talks with the NHL Players Assn. continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not happy about it at all," said Kent, whose regular job is in shipping 
at a screen print ink company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was watching the press conference today, and it was really irking me. If 
this keeps up, they're going to kill hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sopers, while likely to be ready to return to The Pond when the players 
do, nonetheless represent perhaps the biggest problem the NHL faces in a 
dispute that could cancel the entire season: the threat of losing a new 
generation of fans that was starting to catapult professional hockey toward the 
same level of interest as pro football, baseball and basketball in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very upset about all this," said Rhonda Soper, a pharmacy technician. "It 
seems that if the players are willing to play, why don't they just do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rhonda Soper is a double loser, also being a fan of baseball and particularly 
the Dodgers; that season has been lost completely because of a labor dispute. 
But Soper, who says she and Kent have taken to hockey at all levels -- they 
also attend college, roller and minor league games -- is now particularly 
frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is stubborn, and they just want to prove a point," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've met Gary Bettman, and I thought he was doing a good job, but now it 
seems as if he has a vendetta or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Vicki Caruso, a Mighty Ducks season ticket-holder from Huntington Beach, was 
so displeased with the prospect of missing even one game that she faxed a 
letter to Bettman on Thursday. She began following the sport during the Kings' 
run to the Stanley Cup finals two seasons ago, "and since then, I've been 
nonstop. This year, I'm like a walking hockey almanac. People walk away from me 
in conversations." 
</P>
<P>
 "My main concern is that they're losing the momentum they had going from last 
year's Stanley Cup," said Caruso, 27, referring to the closely watched 1994 
playoffs that ended with the New York Rangers winning their first Cup since 
1940. "They're mostly hurting themselves. This lockout will hurt the league now 
more than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda resident Randy Smith, 47, agrees. He says he was never a hockey 
fan until the Mighty Ducks arrived. Now, he's a member of their booster club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed, especially coming on the heels of the baseball fiasco," 
said Smith, a government consultant and lobbyist. "I don't think professional 
sports teams are considering the fans enough. How many times in other labor 
disputes have you seen the management side willing to close its doors and leave 
customers hanging to have a more aggressive negotiating posture? This is a 
little silly; worse, it is inconsiderate of the fans who have paid money to see 
the games. They should be able to negotiate aggressively without calling off 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sitting on a lot of Angels season tickets, so right now I don't have a 
good attitude about sports teams. This hockey thing, it's minor at the moment, 
but if they start canceling games, I might cancel my season tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Rowland, 29, is a wildlife biologist for Irvine-based Chambers Group and 
part-owner of Mighty Ducks season tickets. He is a little bit more of a 
longtime fan, having begun following the Kings in the late 1970s, but he, too, 
said the NHL was missing a big chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NHL has a very good opportunity to make a dent in the (sports) population 
in North America with no baseball going on," he said. "For the average fan 
looking for a sport to go to, those who had not seen hockey could experience 
the NHL without the distraction of other sports besides football. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically a corporate decision, and the Ducks are part of the whole NHL. 
They may have a voice in the whole thing, but their voice would pale in the 
face of the old NHL guard." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as fans such as Smith warn that they're getting sick of the whole 
thing and might soon walk away, others such as Kent Soper say they'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's just two weeks," Soper said, "it might actually be better that they 
do this now and get it done right rather than starting and then stopping 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 And if the dispute winds up canceling the whole season? Would he return next 
year? Soper paused for just a second. 
</P>
<P>
 "For hockey? I would."

 DRY TIMES: October usually means the World Series, hockey and the new rain 
season. Well, at least one of the three will start on time. . . . Last season 
was a relatively dry one. In fact, the total rainfall (above) was about half 
the normal average. It rained about the same amount in Los Angeles, Van Nuys 
and Newhall. Lancaster, however, received about half as much rain. 
</P>
<P>
 MILKEN: To most of the world, he's known as the junk bond king who went to 
jail. But to the disadvantaged youngsters served by a Sherman Oaks nonprofit 
organization, Michael Milken is their good pal. On Friday, he showed up to kick 
off the Milken Family Foundation Festival For Youth (B2). . . . Who knows? 
Maybe someday he'll be forgiven for his crimes. After all, Milken said, "the 
Catholic Church pardoned Galileo." 
</P>
<P>
 TELETHON: The Nickelodeon cable network's inaugural telethon for kids will be 
taped Sunday at Universal Studios. The idea is to encourage youngsters between 
2 and 12 to pledge their time to participate in community service activities. . 
. . Portions of the daylong event will be broadcast live. 
</P>
<P>
 FACEOFF: So what if hockey has been put on ice for a while (C1). There's 
plenty of puck to watch right here. . . . Amateurs compete in adult hockey 
leagues at Iceoplex in North Hills and Pickwick Ice Arena in Burbank. The 
caliber is pretty good, and it's free. Participants include ex-Kings defenseman 
Rick Chartraw, actor Dave Coulier and television producer David Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
 EXTENSION: The quake is almost 9 months old, but some people are just now 
realizing how much damage they suffered. That's why Los Angeles Mayor Richard 
Riordan is asking that the deadline to seek federal aid be extended from Oct. 
17 to Jan. 17, the temblor's one-year anniversary (B1). . . . Earlier, the 
deadline had been extended from Sept. 17 to Oct. 17. Rain Season

TRANSIENT HELD IN DEVASTATING LAGUNA FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT and JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 26-year-old transient was charged with arson Friday after telling 
investigators that he started the $528 million Laguna Beach fire last October 
in an effort to commune with a demon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Soto Martinez, who authorities said confessed to setting the Oct. 27 fire 
after being arrested on charges of lighting three small fires in Fullerton, was 
being held without bail in the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 At an afternoon news conference, law enforcement officials said Martinez 
"willfully and maliciously" set the blaze that in a few hours devastated the 
scenic beach community.  
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the filing of four charges of arson against Martinez, Orange 
County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi said the felony complaint involves "four 
counts of arson of interest to thousands if not millions of people here in 
Orange County and Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining officials from the district attorney's office were representatives of 
the Laguna Beach Police and Fire Departments, the Orange County Fire Department 
and the Fullerton Police and Fire Departments. Fullerton authorities arrested 
Martinez on Sept. 16 in connection with three fires at an apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 During questioning after the arrest, Martinez told investigators he was also 
responsible for other "big fires" in the area, according to court documents. He 
identified an Aug. 5 brush fire on Green River Drive near Anaheim and later 
made statements implicating himself in the Laguna fire, law enforcement sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources also confirmed that Martinez told police he set the fire to conjure up 
a demon king named Gotam. 
</P>
<P>
 A transient who had $8.12 in his pockets when he was arrested, Martinez 
remains mostly a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Official records indicate that he was arrested in San Diego County for 
burglary as a teen-ager and had a troubled past. According to jail booking 
records, he had attempted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Until his arrest in the Fullerton fires, Martinez had not been considered a 
possible suspect by the Laguna investigators, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like kicking a rock and finding a gold nugget," said Fullerton fire 
official John Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is scheduled to be arraigned Monday. If convicted on all four counts 
of arson, he would face a maximum of 30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same news conference, authorities also announced that they are seeking 
information from a man identified only as Mike, who apparently stayed with 
Martinez the night before the Laguna fire. They are also seeking anyone who may 
have driven Martinez away from Laguna Beach after the fire was started. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if Martinez was believed to have acted alone, Capizzi said 
authorities have the man they believe is responsible for the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they initially regarded Martinez as merely a suspect. They 
acknowledged that it was not uncommon for people, particularly fire bugs, to 
claim responsibility for large fires. 
</P>
<P>
 But his knowledge of details surrounding the start of the fire added a measure 
of credibility to Martinez's claims, investigators said. He led investigators 
to the exact location where the fire started. He also said he used matches -- 
not an accelerant -- and that too is consistent with investigators' findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take everybody seriously that comes up with something like this -- short 
of the ones that were beamed out of the spaceship," said Dan Runnestrand, chief 
investigator for the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, most importantly, this will help bring about closure to many of the 
victims," said Laguna Beach Police Chief Neil Purcell, who watched helplessly 
last October as the fire scorched more than 14,000 acres and destroyed or 
severely damaged 441 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased with the fact that we have a solid suspect in custody," 
Purcell said, adding that it had been a "very trying situation the entire year 
for these people" who lost their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Powered by Santa Ana winds, the October fire raced up Laguna Canyon and 
engulfed hillside homes overlooking the heart of Laguna Beach. As firefighters 
from around Southern California converged on the beach town, it took on a 
surreal appearance, with helicopters darting about overhead, fatigue-clad 
troops in the streets and residents, cut off by closed highways, frantically 
trying to return to the community by boat to save their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses to the Fullerton fires told authorities they saw Martinez try to 
spark the blazes. After his capture, Martinez seemed calm, witnesses and court 
records said, saying matter-of-factly that it was his "job" to light fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's arrest and statements to police resurrected an investigation that 
had all but come to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 After going through the painstaking process of tracking down about 500 
dead-end leads, investigators had lost hope of ever solving the case. The 
arrest has investigators believing at least temporarily that they will be able 
to close the book on one of the costliest fires in state history.  
</P>
<P>
 "With all fires, unless you have the suspect early on, you can only hope that 
something comes up, and that's why we must look at all leads," Runnestrand 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach residents and officials expressed anger and relief Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this man is indeed guilty, I am greatly relieved that his days of starting 
fires are over," said Councilman Robert F. Gentry. "This is obviously a man 
with some mental illness and maybe there's going to be a chance of some 
therapy. But my primary feeling is that he's off the street, he can't light his 
matches anymore and bring devastation to another community."

 SAFE PEDALING: Bicycle thefts are going down here. Huntington Beach Police 
Officer Mike Corcoran attributes that partly to aggressive enforcement. But he 
also agrees with others that more cities requiring bicycle registration helps 
too: "You put a little sticker with your number on your bike's frame. Anyone 
stealing it has a heck of a time trying to get that off, so it's a deterrent." 
</P>
<P>
 ANYBODY HOME? Sometimes it does pay to answer your phone. . . . As a 
good-neighbor gesture, the people at the new Jack in the Box on Katella Avenue 
in Orange wanted to contribute $250 to a needy local group. So they called City 
Hall on a Friday for a recommendation. But city offices in Orange are closed on 
Fridays. Only the firefighters answered the phone. Who got the money? The 
firefighters. They promptly sent it on to the Orange County Burn Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 SUNRISE SERVICE: Even if you'd like to clean up your downtown, would you show 
up at 5 a.m. to do it? In Huntington Beach, downtown merchants plan to show up 
before sunrise today, armed with hoses, scrapers and scouring powder to clean 
off the dirt, old chewing gum and surfboard wax from the sidewalks and walls of 
Main Street. The public is invited to join in. . . . Says Councilman Ralph 
Bauer, who'll be there: "Downtown, like it or not, historically represents old 
Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 SPIRALING PROBLEM: Who dumped those thousands of little plastic blue spirals 
all over the sand in Seal Beach this summer? Both Southern California Edison 
and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power -- directly across the nearby 
San Gabriel River from each other -- use them in a cleaning process. But each 
points a finger at the other. . . . Now Edison will chance finding out. It will 
spend $30,000 to change the color of its spirals. Then if it's not the blue 
ones washing ashore, admits Edison spokesman Jerry Dominguez, "it could be 
embarrassing." Bike Thefts

ANGER, RELIEF FOR VICTIMS OF LAGUNA BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For many Laguna Beach residents who lost their homes in last year's 
devastating wildfire, it appeared to matter little Friday that a homeless man 
had only been charged, not convicted, of starting the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ought to hang the bastard," said Joyce Wippler, whose parents Bertha 
Wippler, now 93, and Hans, 92, lost their Mystic Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 Other fire victims suggested more innovative punishments for Jose Soto 
Martinez, the 26-year-old transient who has told investigators he purposely 
sparked the October firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ought to throw him in a tank of piranhas," offered former Temple Hills 
resident Thomas Homan, quickly adding that he was joking, in part. But several 
others, without humor, said that if Martinez is found guilty, he should be 
burned at the stake. 
</P>
<P>
 For many whose homes and belongings were destroyed in the fire, the news of 
the confession brought a long-simmering sense of outrage and anger boiling back 
to the surface. But others expressed relief, saying that if Martinez is telling 
the truth, his arrest and imprisonment at least will ensure that he is not free 
this fire season to set another blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just so glad that he's not on the street, available to do it all again," 
said Jason Bevacqua, 23, whose home in the El Moro Trailer Park was lost to the 
flames. Bevacqua, a salesman, said he had moved back to the trailer park only 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach City Councilman Robert F. Gentry, who lost his own Mystic Hills 
home in the fire, said it was not until he heard the news of the arrest that he 
realized how uneasy he had been, conscious in the back of his mind that the 
person who started the fire could do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was really eating at all of us that this could occur again," 
Gentry said. "No one had been arrested, and now it's the season again for Santa 
Ana wind conditions," like those that whipped last year's flames into a blaze 
that destroyed or damaged nearly 400 homes in the Laguna area. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentry said Martinez's arrest also may help many fire victims find an element 
of emotional closure, particularly so close to the one-year anniversary of the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how it can do anything but help the healing process," he said. 
"And it brings closure. Maybe it will now be over."  
</P>
<P>
 There were others, though, who said they doubted, or at least wondered, 
whether Martinez was responsible. Many said it seemed likely that a man who 
claimed he set fires in the hope of calling forth a demon might delude himself 
into thinking he had started one of the most destructive blazes in California 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing sounds very tenuous to me at this point," said Polly Sloan. 
"I'm kind of reserving judgment." Sloan also said she found it difficult to 
understand or come to terms with the idea that anyone had deliberately started 
a fire that caused such suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of a person would set these fires and cause hundreds of families to 
be set back years emotionally, not even knowing where they were going to be 
living?" Sloan asked. "It's still hard to believe anyone could do that." 
</P>
<P>
 But she and others said they found a measure of comfort in the idea that the 
man claiming responsibility appeared to be mentally ill, and thus not 
completely aware of the likely consequences of his action.

 "I still don't really feel anger toward him," said Bobbie Chalmers, a writer 
who said she had hoped that the fire's origins were natural, sparked by 
lightning perhaps. "I still don't like knowing there's an actual person who did 
this, but I'm glad it wasn't malicious. I'm glad in a way that maybe it's a 
sick person and not an evil person." 
</P>
<P>
 And a few said they felt almost detached from the news, unable to feel much 
happiness that an arrest had been made at long last. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps to give closure, I guess, but you know what? It doesn't change a 
thing," Sloan said. "The houses are still gone, there's still the emotional 
loss, and people are still waiting for their permits to rebuild. It doesn't 
really change anything."

TRANSIENT CHARGED AFTER ADMITTING HE SET LAGUNA BLAZE; ARSON: JOSE SOTO 
MARTINEZ CONFESSES AFTER ARREST FOR LIGHTING THREE SMALL FIRES IN FULLERTON. HE 
SAYS HE WAS TRYING TO COMMUNE WITH A DEMON.

 A 26-year-old transient was charged with arson Friday after telling 
investigators he started the $528-million Laguna Beach fire last October in an 
effort to commune with a demon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Soto Martinez, who authorities said confessed to sparking the Oct. 27 
fire after being arrested for lighting three small fires in Fullerton, was 
being held without bail in the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 At an afternoon press conference, law enforcement officials said Martinez 
"willfully and maliciously" set the blaze that, in a matter of a few hours, 
left the scenic beach community resembling a war zone. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the filing of charges against Martinez, Orange County Dist. 
Atty. Michael R. Capizzi said the felony complaint in-volves "four counts of 
arson of interest to thousands, if not millions, of people here in Orange 
County and Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining officials from the district attorney's office were representatives 
from the Laguna Beach police and fire departments, the Orange County Fire 
Department and the Fullerton police and fire departments. Fullerton authorities 
arrested Martinez Sept. 16 in connection with three fires in and around an 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 During questioning after the arrest, Martinez told investigators he was also 
responsible for other "big fires" in the area, according to court documents. 
Martinez identified an Aug. 5 brush fire on Green River Drive near Anaheim. He 
later made statements implicating himself in the Laguna fire, law enforcement 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources also confirmed that Martinez told police he set the fire to conjure up 
a demon king named "Gotam." 
</P>
<P>
 An illegal immigrant and transient who had $8.12 in his pockets when he was 
arrested, Martinez remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Official records indicate he has a previous arrest in San Diego County for 
first-degree burglary as a teen-ager, but was tried and convicted as an adult 
and sentenced to four years behind bars. According to Orange County jail 
booking records, he claimed he had AIDS and had attempted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Until his arrest for the Fullerton fires, he had not been considered as a 
possible suspect by Laguna investigators, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like kicking a rock and finding a gold nugget," Fullerton fire 
official John Clark said, noting the role luck might have played in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is scheduled to be arraigned Monday. If convicted of all four counts 
of arson, he would face a maximum of 30 years imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same press conference, authorities also announced that they are seeking 
information from a man identified only as Mike, who apparently stayed with 
Martinez the night before the Laguna fire. They are also seeking people who 
might have driven Martinez away from Laguna Beach after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if Martinez was believed to have acted alone, Capizzi said 
authorities had the man they believe is "responsible" for the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Friday, investigators initially said they had regarded Martinez as 
merely a suspect they wanted to question. They acknowledged that it was not 
uncommon for people, particularly firebugs, to claim responsibility for large 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
 But Martinez's knowledge of details surrounding the start of the fire added 
credibility to his claims, investigators said. He led investigators to the 
exact location where the fire started. He also said he used matches -- and not 
an accelerant -- and that, too, is consistent with investigators' findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take everybody seriously that comes up with something like this -- short 
of the ones that were beamed out of the spaceship," said Dan Runnestrand, chief 
investigator for the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Powered by Santa Ana winds, the October fire raced up Laguna Canyon and 
engulfed hillside homes overlooking the heart of Laguna Beach. As firefighters 
from around Southern California converged on the beach community, it took on a 
surreal appearance, with helicopters darting about overhead, fatigue-clad 
troops in the streets, and residents, cut off by closed highways, frantically 
trying to return to the community via boat to save their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the height of the fire, flames consumed an average of 45 acres and four 
homes per minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased with the fact that we have a solid suspect in custody," 
said Laguna Beach Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr., adding that it had been a 
"very trying situation the entire year for these people" who lost their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most importantly, I think this will help bring about closure to many of the 
victims," who could do little but watch helplessly as the fire scorched more 
than 14,000 acres and destroyed or severely damaged 441 homes, Purcell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton police arrested Martinez two weeks ago after police said he admitted 
he set fires behind a community college district administration office and in 
the laundry room of an adjacent apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires occurred over a two-hour span on the morning of Sept. 16. Just after 
the third fire was spotted, a group of college employees surrounded Martinez, 
who was hiding in some bushes, and ordered him to step forward. He sheepishly 
appeared with a cigarette lighter in his hand and quietly accompanied those who 
had caught him with his head in his hands, as if he was in a daze. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Beeler, the physical plant director for Fullerton College, gently led 
Martinez away by the shirt collar. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very passive," Beeler said. "He didn't try to make a move." 
</P>
<P>
 Tucked in the back of his trousers was a hunting knife, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez readily admitted to setting the fires. Asked by police whether he set 
the Fullerton fires, he said, "Yeah. That's my job." 
</P>
<P>
 The college employees who caught Martinez were struck not only by his meek 
demeanor, but also by his appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen some street people and some down-and-outers, but this guy did not 
look like a transient," said Tony Haynes, manager of the Hillcrest Glen 
Apartments, where a fire was set in the laundry room of the complex. "He didn't 
say anything. He didn't make a run for it. It's almost like he wanted to be 
caught." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's arrest and statements to police resurrected an investigation that 
had all but petered out for a lack of fresh leads. 
</P>
<P>
 After going through the painstaking process of tracking down some 500 dead-end 
leads, investigators had lost hope of ever solving the case. The arrest, at 
least temporarily, has investigators believing they will be able to close the 
book on one of the costliest fires in state history.  
</P>
<P>
 "With all fires, unless you have the suspect early on, you can only hope that 
something comes up," Runnestrand said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Capizzi, "It's common in so many investigations that you have to look for 
that break. That break occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi refused to discuss the type or extent of evidence implicating 
Martinez. He said investigators are still trying to piece together Martinez's 
background, including his whereabouts before and after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Little is known about Martinez. In 1986, he was charged with burglary of an 
inhabited dwelling, exhibiting a deadly weapon in a threatening manner and 
giving false information to a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 He pleaded guilty to the burglary charge and was sentenced to four years at a 
California Youth Authority detention facility, although he faced up to six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 18 years old at the time, Martinez had been in the United States only 
eight months, having come from his hometown of Tijuana, according to court 
documents filed in San Diego County. Martinez said at the time that his mother, 
Teresa Saille Higuera, lived in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 In a financial declaration filed with the court, Martinez said he had $2 in 
cash to his name, was unemployed and had no assets. 
</P>
<P>
 As preliminary as the case is, the prospect of someone coming to justice for 
the fire prompted a combustible mixture of anger and relief from Laguna Beach 
residents and city officials. Despite its reputation as a tolerant and 
politically liberal enclave with many artists, residents and officials alike 
sounded off Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this man is indeed guilty, I am greatly relieved that his days of starting 
fires are over," said City Councilman Robert F. Gentry. "This is obviously a 
man with some mental illness and maybe there's going to be a chance of some 
therapy. But my primary feeling is that he's off the street, he can't light his 
matches anymore and bring devastation to another community." 
</P>
<P>
 "They ought to hang the bastard," said Joyce Wippler, whose elderly parents 
lost their home in the fire. "It's frustrating because no matter what they do 
to (Martinez), it will never replace the things that people lost."

HAITIANS ASK, 'WHERE ARE THE AMERICANS?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As U.S. combat soldiers directed traffic, sipped from canteens or leaned up 
against massive tank barrels bearing such foreboding nicknames as "House of 
Pain," bewilderment and the seeds of anger began to well up Friday in alleyways 
and on street corners where Haitians had rejoiced in the U.S. forces' arrival 
just 11 days before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are the Americans?" shouted Eric Auguste, a pro-democracy demonstrator 
who for more than an hour had battled Haitian police -- the same police who are 
supposed to protect him -- as they attacked people gathered peacefully for a 
march against their country's military rulers. 
</P>
<P>
 As he fought bullets with rocks, Auguste shouted, "Why don't the American 
soldiers just take all their guns away? It would be easy for them. For us, we 
have only our bare hands." 
</P>
<P>
 A mile away, where U.S. military police dug in behind tanks and armed 
vehicles, another demonstrator who had fled the carnage had a more dire 
assessment. "I think, as the days are passing, the American soldiers are 
showing in which camp they now are. By not helping the people today, we can see 
they are with the police and their attaches ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were alarming words on a day when U.S. officials conceded there is 
concern at the highest levels that the U.S. intervention forces may be about to 
lose the hearts and minds of the poorest Haitians -- the people the Clinton 
Administration hoped to save from tyranny when it ordered the intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a great concern about that," conceded Stanley Schrager, U.S. 
Embassy spokesman, during a briefing assessing the day's bloody events. "That 
is the kind of support that is necessary for us to accomplish our mission 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating trouble Friday on the third anniversary of the violent coup that 
ousted elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the Army had blocked off -- 
with Sheridan tanks and vehicles mounted with machine guns -- streets leading 
to the wealthiest residential neighborhoods. There, most of Haiti's elite 
strongly support the military rulers who seized power. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're guarding the rich, while leaving the poor to be slaughtered," said 
another demonstrator, who fled to one of the armored roadblocks after the 
pitched street battles broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 Army spokesman here described their role as one only of deterrence. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of Friday's killings, however, Schrager refused to rule out 
the possibility that U.S. commanders will now decide to take more forcible 
measures to confiscate the vast weapons legally registered to Haiti's police 
and paramilitary groups. It was those organizations Friday that terrorized 
peaceful demonstrators commemorating the thousands of Haitians killed since the 
military coup. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Army spokesman Col. Barry Willey said Friday that the U.S. military is 
continuing a voluntary nationwide money-for-guns program that so far has netted 
just 287 weapons, about half of which were grenades. 
</P>
<P>
 But most analysts said that it has yet to have any impact in a nation where 
there are between 75,000 and 100,000 legally registered firearms. And it was 
equally clear, as it was in the early days of the U.S. military's humanitarian 
intervention in Somalia, that Haitians want disarmament more than anything. 
</P>
<P>
 An old Haitian with a white beard and ancient blue Freemason's beret shouted 
such sentiment from the front steps of the Sante Rose Delima funeral parlor 
near the site of Friday's violence, which was largely restricted to the 
sprawling neighborhood around the paramilitary headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are your American soldiers doing here anyway?" he yelled to two passing 
American journalists. "There are two people shot dead inside here, killed by 
(the paramilitary group) FRAPH. And there are no soldiers to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Another elderly Haitian sitting beside him added: "Look, the population here 
loves the American soldiers. But since they are here, we don't see anything 
from them. They have to handcuff (Haitian army chief Lt. Gen. Raoul) Cedras and 
(Police Chief Michel-Joseph) Francois, put them out of the country and take 
away all their guns." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. forces have, in fact, done a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In another section of the city shortly before the gunfire broke out, U.S. Army 
Military Police caught one of the notorious attaches , or armed police allies, 
in the middle of the street. They stripped him of his pistol and two ammunition 
clips, handcuffed him and forced him to kneel in the street for half an hour as 
a crowd of thousands jeered and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 And U.S. Army technicians performed a near-miracle on Thursday night. After 
several days' work and with the flip of a switch, they doubled the power to a 
city that has lived with only a few hours of light each day for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the pro-democracy demonstrators who bore the brunt of Friday's attacks 
were distinctly unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a good thing that the Americans have done, restoring power to our 
capital city," said one demonstrator in a sweaty, bloody T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this too is for the rich. Who needs electricity, when you have no money 
to buy something that needs it? We need food. We need freedom. And right now, 
we need protection."

MAYOR PUSHES NEW PLAN TO BOOST ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what was billed as his first major speech on the Los Angeles economy, Mayor 
Richard Riordan on Friday predicted that the city would soon emerge from its 
worst recession since the Great Depression and pledged to consolidate the 
city's economic development efforts to smooth the way for a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's 20-minute address to a gathering of about 300 business leaders 
outside City Hall promised an improved business atmosphere and reduced 
regulation at City Hall, but offered no tax reductions or other hard economic 
incentives for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the programs Riordan discussed have been rolled out in the first 15 
months of his Administration, although he did announce formation of a 
centralized office to submit government loan applications, the One Stop Capital 
Shop, and the commencement of a series of business round-table discussions to 
allow industries to vent their frustrations with government. 
</P>
<P>
 The early morning address, delivered from the same steps where Riordan was 
inaugurated, was generally well received by the invited guests, although it 
remains unclear how the City Council will react to one central proposal: a plan 
for a consolidated economic development office. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and the City Council agreed this year that a system that diffuses 
economic development among at least four departments does not work and that a 
single location for business promotion would work better. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan's earlier consolidation proposal was rejected by the council, 
which said it de-emphasized low-income housing construction by eliminating an 
independent housing department. The council also said that Riordan's office had 
not determined how it would provide retirement benefits for employees of the 
new office. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor declined to provide details of his new consolidation effort, but 
said he believes it will be better received, in part, because it will maintain 
a separate city housing department. Advocates of affordable housing had said 
elimination of the department, just a few years after its formation, would 
reduce the city's focus on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said he plans to make the housing department even larger by adding 
some housing programs that had been under the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
"I've challenged our housing department to double the annual production of 
affordable housing over the next three years," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's plans may create a power struggle with the City Council. Some 
members, led by Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, remain intent on taking over 
control of the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has been a potent political and economic tool, allowing the city to 
pour tax dollars into distressed communities. Riordan's proposal would leave 
redevelopment in his hands, through his own commission.  
</P>
<P>
 Hearings on the matter are scheduled to begin this month. Riordan said he will 
veto any council attempt to take over the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of who wins the power struggle, the mayor has succeeded this week 
in having the council approve a 19-person office, under his control, that will 
help him respond to specific dilemmas posed by the business community. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the office will help speed city permits to companies and connect them 
with government loans, it will not be able to offer tax cuts or other hard 
financial incentives, Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a business gross receipts tax, which a lot of other cities and other 
states don't have," he said in an interview after the speech. "We have a lot of 
fees that are really way too high. . . (But) we need the revenue in the short 
run to make the city safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan was looking tanned and fit after a weekend getaway in Squaw Valley. He 
left at midday Friday for a 17-day European cycling vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The assembled business leaders greeted Riordan with sparse applause and many 
said they were more pleased with the tone than won over by any single proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles 
County, praised Riordan's upbeat attitude and said the consolidation of 
economic development programs is "extremely important." 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a roster of all these economic development agencies (within the 
city) and what you're looking at is a touch of schizophrenia," Kyser said. "By 
combining them, people will have a single source to go to, and you're going to 
be much more effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow with the Center for the New West public 
policy think tank, said he believed that Riordan was subtly attempting to lean 
on the City Council to get his economic development initiatives approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick Riordan was elected with a very strong mandate to do certain things, but 
the council was not elected on the same ticket," Kotkin said. "What he's got to 
do is develop very strong support in the business community and the community 
in general to push through some of these reforms." 
</P>
<P>
 John W. Mack, executive director of the Los Angeles Urban League, said he was 
most pleased that Riordan had moved beyond "his laser beam single focus on 
adding more police to the LAPD." Mack called on Riordan next to "become more 
aggressive and focus on job creation and African American business 
opportunities south of the Santa Monica Freeway."

MULTIMEDIA BATTLE IS A NEW L.A.-S.F. GRUDGE MATCH; RIVALRY: WILL THE RECENTLY 
HATCHED INDUSTRY NEST IN NORTHERN OR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA? OR WORSE YET, 
SEATTLE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It's been a while since Los Angeles and San Francisco had a hot new issue to 
feed their simmering rivalry. The water wars have receded, Southern 
California's political dominance is firmly established, and Angelenos 
cheerfully acknowledge that San Francisco is a terrific place to visit -- even 
though few northerners return the compliment.  
</P>
<P>
 But there's a new tug of war going on now, a geographic struggle over the 
heart and the soul and the dollars of the emerging multimedia industry. Born of 
the marriage of computer technology to video and sound and storytelling, it's 
an industry destined to shape the economy of California for decades to come.  
</P>
<P>
 Will it be centered in the north, with the computer programmers and venture 
capitalists and software patent lawyers? Or will it be in the south, home of 
the movie studios and entertainment writers and sound designers? At stake are 
thousands of jobs, as well as the evolving culture of two regions that have for 
years been defined by the two massive industries that are now giving birth to 
multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
 By most measures, the north is winning so far, and some headline-happy civic 
leaders in San Francisco are already declaring victory. "If you think about 
it," says Tim Boyle of the San Francisco Multimedia Development Group, in the 
ultimate digital-era insult, "L.A. is really very analog." 
</P>
<P>
 But where the industry ultimately settles -- insofar as it settles in one 
geographical location at all -- will be determined by a host of complicated 
economic and sociological factors that have only begun to play themselves out. 
And Los Angeles boosters -- who do, after all, have a stellar historical track 
record -- say they have just begun to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "These nerds in the north are not going to be the ones to make this thing 
work," says Joel Kotkin, an economist with the Ontario-based Center for the New 
West. "This region has not yet figured out what it's next act is going to be -- 
that's one of the problems -- but multimedia is clearly a big part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The industry is developing quickly, spreading across the state like a 
benevolent, self-replicating computer virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle's group, founded a year ago with financial help from the city, has 
nearly 800 members. The organization's informal monthly get-togethers at the 
Press Club -- beer and distilled water are sold at a makeshift refreshment 
stand, pretzels are free -- are jammed with multimedia entrepreneurs and 
wanna-bes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles New Media Round Table -- whose monthly meetings at the posh 
Loew's Santa Monica Beach hotel include a sit-down dinner and full-service bar 
-- reports similar growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has become a minimultimedia capital itself. San Diego's recently 
formed Digital Multimedia Assn. has signed up 65 members in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 And all across the country -- from New York to Atlanta, from Texas to Seattle 
-- ambitious cities and states are making efforts to develop a local multimedia 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 California is way out in front in the interstate struggle, and some argue that 
the north/south split should now be bridged: It is the respective talents of 
the two regions together that will bring the greatest prosperity in the long 
run. There have been efforts at building unity -- Pacific Bell is even working 
on a high-speed phone network to enable multimedia developers to exchange data 
in a form of virtual reality sometimes referred to as "Siliwood." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "I think there's reason for a little friendly rivalry," says Paul 
Gormsen of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. "I'd put it as the No. 1 
industry, in terms of the most desirable, most likely to succeed, most likely 
to add dollars to the cash register we call the city of San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohit Shukla, executive director of the Los Angeles Regional Technology 
Alliance, says: "We're going to go after this industry in a major way because 
it's part of our bread and butter."  
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to say exactly how much bread and butter multimedia will be worth. 
Many a forecast shows it becoming a multibillion-dollar industry very soon, but 
such predictions amount to little more than guesses about how quickly and 
enthusiastically consumers will respond to the CD-ROMs, interactive television 
programs and on-line services that the industry is just beginning to produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, it's hard to discern the precise geographical outlines of an 
industry made up of companies ranging from start-ups with fewer than 10 
employees -- often working out of their homes -- to large media and technology 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 A report released last month and sponsored by the Bay Area Economic Forum 
found about 62,000 people in more than 2,200 firms engaged in 
multimedia-related activities in the Bay Area, more than twice the national 
average.  
</P>
<P>
 The Carronade Group, a Los Angeles research and consulting firm that tracks 
the fledgling industry, estimates that Northern California is home to about 
three times the number of multimedia developers as the state's southern half. 
But with the addition of nearly 40 new media divisions at Hollywood studios and 
production companies in recent months, Carronade counts the two about even in 
terms of actual funded entities producing new media products. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the perception remains that Northern California is leading the 
multimedia charge. "The Revolution Starts Here," proclaimed a recent Newsweek 
story on San Francisco's so-called Multimedia Gulch, the onetime warehouse 
district near downtown where dozens of budding media firms have been drawn by 
the availability of cheap loft space -- and, some argue, decent coffee. It now 
boasts a population of nearly 6,000 multimedia-oids. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that there's more going on up there," says Steve Glenn, 
vice president of Simgraphics, a Pasadena-based multimedia firm and one of 
several local executives working with the Los Angeles mayor's office on what 
the city can do to foster the industry here. 
</P>
<P>
 The rap against Los Angeles is part topography, part ideology.  
</P>
<P>
 The geographic spread of the Southland, detractors say, works against the 
cohesion of a community such as Multimedia Gulch, where radios in neighboring 
work spaces are often tuned to the same station and graphic artists mingle at 
the same lunch spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going to L.A. is a nightmare," says one multimedia programmer who flies down 
frequently from his northern abode. "You have to drive everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, southern partisans note, pockets of multimedia communities have sprung 
up in different parts of the Los Angeles area. The American Film Institute in 
Hollywood has served as a gathering place for the city's entertainment elite 
and 20-something computer jockeys. And Santa Monica's Electronic Cafe fills a 
similar function across town. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles is considering helping to fund an "incubator" -- a 
space that could be another center where multimedia folk could gather and play 
show and tell. 
</P>
<P>
 But a bigger problem may be the region's lack of experience in nurturing a 
start-up industry. The Silicon Valley, with its storied entrepreneurial 
history, has a more robust infrastructure of venture capitalists, lawyers, 
public relations agencies and other service businesses geared to the needs of 
start-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole philosophy up north is different," says Jonathan Seybold, a 
new-media consultant who has offices in Malibu and the Silicon Valley. "And 
it's partly because the Silicon Valley geist is very much entrepreneurial and 
focused on fostering individual creativity, while the entertainment community 
down here has been more dominated by the established power structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, which region gains the upper hand may depend in part on whether the 
multimedia business structure parallels that of the entertainment industry, in 
which independent producers, usually in private partnerships, work 
project-by-project for major studios, or the high-tech industry, in which small 
firms have traditionally made money by reinvesting in themselves and eventually 
selling shares to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood studios, whose wealth and control of entertainment distribution 
channels provide Los Angeles with some major advantages, are experimenting in 
both forms. MCA/Universal, for example, recently signed what is probably the 
industry's first on-the-lot production deal with a video game production 
company called Naughty Dog, consisting of Andy Gavin, Jason Rubin and their 
dog, Morgan.  
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, 24-year-olds Gavin and Rubin -- both Washington natives who 
were courted by Silicon Valley firms as well -- say they like it better on the 
Universal lot.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is where all the talent is," Gavin says. "You meet people here and get 
ideas. We're pretty sure we saw Martin Short in a Lexus on the 101, but we 
can't be sure." 
</P>
<P>
 The two high school friends will develop games for Universal Interactive, 
MCA's multimedia division. But the studio will not have an ownership position 
in the company. On the other hand, MCA has taken stakes in Redwood City-based 
3DO, a video game console manufacturer, and Irvine-based Interplay, another 
video game firm.  
</P>
<P>
 MCA Executive Vice President Charles (Skip) Paul spends a lot of time up 
north, but he says his main focus is "a group of relationships" in the 
multimedia area, similar to traditional studio relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proximity matters," Paul says. "People share ideas and projects and get to 
know each other. That's why I wanted Andy and Jason on the lot," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if you're not attached to a studio, it's harder in Los Angeles for the 
average start-up.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan, who has a background in venture capital, is planning to 
meet with several of the city's multimedia entrepreneurs to acknowledge the 
importance of the nascent industry. And in March, the city is planning to 
invite several of the Silicon Valley's major venture firms to a conference 
where local entrepreneurs will make presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many Hollywood creative types have gone north, there's movement in 
the other direction too. Robert Kotick, chairman of Activision, moved the video 
game firm to Los Angeles from Menlo Park more than a year ago when he took 
control just so he could be near Hollywood's creative community. He recently 
hired Peter Lenkov, who wrote the screenplay for the film "Demolition Man," to 
write a script for a CD-ROM game. The firm has hired 120 people in the last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotick complains, though, that the city was less than welcoming. "When I 
decided to move here I put in a call to a bunch of city agencies but I never 
heard back from them," he says. San Francisco, San Jose and even Seattle appear 
to have done a far better job than Los Angeles of marketing themselves to the 
multimedia crowd. In 1992 San Francisco's City Council passed a resolution 
declaring the city the "de facto capital of multimedia." 
</P>
<P>
 The new efforts by the city of Los Angeles, along with the growing reputation 
of centers such as the American Film Institute may raise Los Angeles' 
multimedia profile. USC is also seeking funding from the National Science 
Foundation to become a national center for multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
 But meanwhile, efforts are under way by Northern and Southern California 
organizations to encourage the two powerful regions to work together to keep 
multimedia in California.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce's Gormsen has concerns on a broader 
level: "I find myself falling victim to the idea that there is this great 
struggle going on between San Francisco and L.A., but what I am more bothered 
about is some swing to Seattle or New York or someplace else. If it's in 
California, I think we're not so far apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Dowling, Kotkin's colleague at the Center for the New West, sums up the 
perpetual ambivalence: "Rivalry? We like to think of everything as harmonious 
in the state of California -- a brotherly, loving . . . kind of relationship. 
You mean it's not?"

EUROPE; INVESTIGATOR RIPS INTO DESIGNERS AT HIGH POINT OF FASHION SEASON; 
ITALY: THE MAGISTRATE SPEARHEADING THE PROBE OF A MASSIVE BRIBERY SCANDAL TURNS 
HIS ATTENTION TO WELL-KNOWN COUTURIERS.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Italy's most popular judge has come into fashion: Investigating magistrate 
Antonio Di Pietro brings sartorial taste -- including one smashing sports 
jacket -- but an awful sense of timing, in the view of the country's famous 
designers. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Pietro, vortex of debate on how to resolve a national corruption scandal 
without permanently scarring Italy's business community, is the reason more 
than hemlines are under scrutiny this weekend as clothes-watchers gather in 
Milan for the inaugural of the fashion world's annual ready-to-wear shows. 
</P>
<P>
 What women will be wearing next spring and summer is up to them. But it is Di 
Pietro who will decide if some designers are showing prison stripes by then. 
</P>
<P>
 As ever, cameras will be riveted on skirt lengths of models sashaying the 
catwalks during the Milan extravaganza lasting from today through Thursday; Di 
Pietro's more interested in hoodwinks and bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very simpatico, elegant even, in his gray cashmere jacket," said 
Gianfranco Ferre after being questioned by the judge who has spearheaded an 
almost three-year crusade against bribery and corruption. The investigation has 
focused on whether businesses richly and routinely paid off politicians and 
government officials in exchange for public contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pillars of a multibillion-dollar industry who have been to see Di Pietro 
when they would rather have been making final tucks in their creations include: 
Giorgio Armani; Santo Versace, brother and head of Gianni Versace's fashion 
empire; Krizia, and jeweler Gianmaria Buccellati. 
</P>
<P>
 They have told similar stories -- of yielding to official corruption by paying 
bribes that amounted to extortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Krizia, who shows her new line Monday "with a certain air of austerity," told 
the judge this week that she had paid $260,000 to tax inspectors under guise of 
a consultant's fee in 1990. In exchange, inspectors did not find irregularities 
in company books, which she says were clean anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to pay. It was the only way to stay free of the threat of being closed 
down or paralyzed," Krizia, whose real name is Mariuccia Mandelli, told Italian 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Pietro, the most respected figure in Italian public life, is the father of 
an investigation into a scandal called Tangentopoli (Bribesville) that has 
implicated an ever-growing list of prominent officials and business leaders -- 
more than 3,000 so far, including former Cabinet ministers and captains of 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular disgust at the scandal triggered an electoral revolt that broke 
Establishment parties after nearly half a century in power and brought 
political rookie Silvio Berlusconi to the prime minister's office. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, it is clear that corruption reached into every corner of the country 
and virtually every industry. Magistrates say they have evidence against 
crooked tax police in more than 200 cases, and businessmen are also falling in 
a steady stream: A textile manufacturer and a trader known as "the rice king" 
ran afoul of Milan judges this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a little while they'll even be investigating the saints," a disgusted 
Gianni Versace told reporters in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy is paying a huge cost for the scandal -- from lost taxes to a justice 
system overwhelmed by corruption cases to unsigned contracts and stagnant 
construction among companies fearful that skeptical judges will later vet their 
every move. 
</P>
<P>
 With 40,000 people jamming Milan this week for the shows, the fashion world's 
encounter with justice may not have tangible impact. But on the nervous eve of 
a new season, it is at the least unsettling to high-fashion wizards whose 
genius generates both national prestige and billions in export earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Pietro has been arguing publicly that investigations must be brought to a 
close. To speed an end, he suggests greater transparency in the letting of 
government contracts and American-style plea-bargaining and immunity for those 
who confess and testify. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has found greater echo in public opinion than in official 
circles, where there are complaints that as a magistrate Di Pietro has no 
business doing politicians' work.

ASIA; 'BANNED' BOOK RAISES EYEBROWS AMONG CHINESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONE TEMPEST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most talked-about books in the Chinese capital is a thin, 
provocative paperback titled "Viewing China Through a Third Eye." 
</P>
<P>
 The book is an alarmist vision of the future that warns of a looming 
"catastrophe" if peasants continue to flee the countryside by the millions for 
the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Praised in private by many Chinese leaders, reportedly including President 
Jiang Zemin, the book was nonetheless banned from government bookstores last 
month by the propaganda department of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the ban, sales have been brisk, particularly for a work of political 
analysis, in private bookstores. Li Shiqiang, owner of Beijing's Sanwei (Three 
Flavors) Bookstore, a haven for intellectuals since it opened in 1988, said he 
quickly sold out his 200 copies. Liang Heping, a composer and jazz keyboardist, 
said he shared his copy with dozens of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the interest is the uncertainty of the identity of the book's 
author. It was first published in March by Shanxi Province People's Publishing 
House under the pseudonym "Leininger." The author was identified as "the most 
influential China expert in contemporary Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 But few took the foreign authorship seriously. "The understanding of China and 
the Chinese language is too good," musician Liang said. "I think they used a 
foreign name to attract attention and give the book an air of objectivity." 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from journalists, the publisher said the author was, in fact, 
Wang Shan -- named as the book's translator. But that also happens to be the 
Chinese equivalent of "John Doe." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the book's pessimistic view of economic reforms, attention focused 
on controversial economist He Xin as the possible author. He, who works for a 
state-sponsored think tank, became a controversial figure among intellectuals 
in 1989 when he defended the army crackdown on the pro-democracy movement. He 
said the action, in which hundreds of Chinese were killed, was necessary to 
maintain order and prevent China from slipping into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview, he denied writing the book. "Back in 1988 I already wrote 
something similar to that," He huffed. 
</P>
<P>
 The main contention of "Viewing China Through a Third Eye" is that economic 
liberalization ushered into China by Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping has 
broken the traditional links of the peasantry to the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to China's huge floating population -- as many as 100 million who 
have left the rural interior to seek their fortune in the cities -- the author 
sees parallels with the decline and fall of Chinese dynasties: "Open the 
Chinese history books and we will be reminded of an obvious fact; every 
dynasty, without exception, was destroyed by roving masses. The roving masses 
are peasants who have lost their land or who are not satisfied staying on the 
land." 
</P>
<P>
 By opening up the economy and allowing peasants to travel to seek jobs, Deng 
and his supporters have "let the devil out of the bottle." 
</P>
<P>
 Such thoughts are not uncommon, particularly in hard-line factions of the 
Communist Party that see little good in Deng's economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 But no target is spared in the book, including the world's last great 
Communist system: "The Chinese Communist Party has made a lot of serious 
mistakes after it came into power. But the most serious mistake is that it 
covered up the reality of the impoverished countryside and starving peasants. 
The result is that the Communist Party lost the opportunity to gain sympathy, 
understanding and help from international society." 
</P>
<P>
 The mixed reactions the book provoked in the Communist Party proved that it 
touched a nerve. Just how seriously the book was received was apparent when, 
despite the ban, celebrated author Wang Meng wrote a critique for the journal 
Readings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang, one of China's most famous living authors who resigned his post as 
minister of culture in 1989 after the Tian An Men Square crackdown, praised 
parts of the book but attacked the dismissal of economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 In his most ironic line, Wang noted that the hard-line policies advocated by 
the author probably would have prohibited the book's publication. So Whodunit? 
</P>
<P>
 A mystery has surfaced over who wrote the brisk-selling political analysis on 
China. Excerpts From the Book 
</P>
<P>
 "Chinese intellectuals first didn't have the right to think independently. 
Then they were given the right but had lost the ability to think on their own. 
That's why today they either believe totally in the state or totally believe 
what they hear on Voice of America." 
</P>
<P>
 "To develop the economy, maintaining order is most important. To maintain 
order, autocracy is the appropriate way." 
</P>
<P>
 "If the state could maintain a 30-year program of coercion and education, then 
the mistakes and vice committed by the dictatorship would be forgiven."

ARISTIDE AND AIDES PLAN TO 'HIT THE GROUND RUNNING'; CARIBBEAN: WARY OF RAISING 
FALSE HOPES, THEIR FIRST GOAL IS TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMY AND 'MOVE UP TO 
POVERTY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It hardly sounds like a slogan to fuel a popular revolution: "From misery to 
poverty with dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is with this modest goal -- and an outline of the Herculean tasks 
necessary to get even that far -- that Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
and his allies are packing their bags to return from exile in Washington to 
their Caribbean homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's advisers concede that their economic goal would win few elections 
as a campaign slogan in the United States. But Jean-Claude Martineau, 
Aristide's official spokesman and a member of his Cabinet-in-exile, said Friday 
that Haiti's woeful economy now is "beyond poverty. As a first step, we would 
like to move up to poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem we would have would be to promise too much," Martineau 
warned in an interview. "That creates frustration, and this is not what we 
want." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, with more than 20,000 troops in Haiti, has forced the 
military leaders who overthrew Aristide three years ago Friday to make way for 
the firebrand priest and populist politician by Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing for his return, Aristide is meeting daily in Washington with his 
Cabinet, international development specialists and Clinton Administration 
officials. His task will be nothing less than introducing democracy to a 
country that has freely elected only one leader -- himself -- in its nearly 
200-year history and bringing economic stability to the poorest country in the 
Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 The obstacles to modernizing Haiti -- a country with an 85% illiteracy rate, a 
few haves among 7 million have-nots and a class of people who have benefited 
from being thugs all their lives -- seem to overwhelm the eight-page, 
$1-billion economic development plan that Aristide is taking with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the immensity of the work ahead, we understand the difficulty, and we 
are eager to tackle it," Martineau said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his first 120 days, he said, Aristide plans to select a prime minister, 
establish civilian control over a scaled-down military, create a police force 
separate from the military, develop a new judicial system and launch a massive 
public works program that will put as many as 50,000 people to work building 
roads and rebuilding cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan to hit the ground running," Martineau said. "This is not work that 
can wait. We are already 200 years late in developing our country. The sense of 
urgency comes from this." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the detailed plans for transforming Haiti from a country that is run 
by and for a tiny elite to one that serves the masses have been drafted and 
redrafted in a suite of offices rented by the exiled Haitian government in 
Washington's swank Georgetown neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, desks were covered with documents, telephones were ringing 
incessantly, copy machines were going full tilt and urgent conversations could 
be heard in French and Creole between a variety of exiled officials. 
</P>
<P>
 On the wall hung a single portrait of the bespectacled president, the man who 
is on the verge of accomplishing what no other Latin American leader in recent 
memory ever has done: reverse a coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Key to Aristide's strategy of achieving "poverty with dignity" is guaranteeing 
the masses that they are no longer subject to the arbitrary power of military 
strongmen who have murdered, raped and otherwise brutalized them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first priority of the people is justice," said Chavannes Jean-Baptiste, 
another member of Aristide's Cabinet abroad and the leader of Haiti's largest 
peasant movement. 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish this, according to Cabinet members and an eight-page plan, 
Aristide's government intends to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Complete the disarming of the 7,000-member Haitian armed forces and 
paramilitary groups, a task that U.S. troops already have begun, and replace 
them with a 1,500-member corps that will be subordinate to civilian government 
and based outside metropolitan areas. Only those who have never been involved 
in human rights abuses will remain in the military. Since Haiti has no external 
enemies, the new military will focus on disaster relief and public works. 
</P>
<P>
 * Create a police force separate from the military. Officers are being trained 
at new academies, created with the help of U.S. and international aid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Overhaul the judiciary so that judges no longer serve the elite and the 
military, as they have in the past. More courts will be opened, with judges 
elected by the people. 
</P>
<P>
 * Abolish the system of rural sheriffs, who are known for extorting money from 
peasants and serving corrupt members of the military and the elite. Fired 
during Aristide's first months in office, the sheriffs were restored to power 
by the military leaders who overthrew Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide and his team are not relying on justice reforms alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "What misery means today in Haiti is that people have no ability to survive -- 
no food, no homes, no access to health care," Jean-Baptiste said in a phone 
interview this week. "It's a question of giving them the minimum to live as 
humans." 
</P>
<P>
 To change this, Aristide's plan involves launching a massive public works 
program temporarily employing as many as 50,000 people to renovate decaying 
cities and rebuild potholed roads. Some of the jobs will go to former soldiers, 
to distract them from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is upwards of 80% unemployment in Haiti," Jean-Baptiste said. "If you 
give them jobs, it will have immediate positive impact on the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Only after those steps are taken can leaders turn to more fundamental 
problems, such as breaking up monopolies and bringing private ownership to 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a person is dying, the first thing you have to do is to keep them 
alive," Jean-Baptiste said. 
</P>
<P>
 To give people more control over their own destinies, the government will 
grant workers the right to organize and is considering raising the miserly 
wages -- under $3 a day for factory workers and even less in the countryside -- 
of those who do have jobs. Plans have been drawn up to improve health care and 
education for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide also plans to levy taxes on the wealthy who have not paid taxes in 
Haiti for 30 years -- except for a few months in 1991 when he was in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar reforms, seen as threats by both the military and business elite, 
precipitated the coup that ousted him. To avoid that happening again before 
Haiti can be changed into a democracy, Aristide's government is counting on the 
presence of U.S. troops, and, later, U.N. peacekeepers. It will also be 
expecting technical and financial support from foreign countries and from 
Haitians living abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every aspect of Aristide's plans for resuming power -- from taxing the 
rich to disarming the military -- has been examined by the U.S. officials with 
whom the Haitian president meets daily and by officials from the World Bank, 
the International Monetary Fund and other aid organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The finished package clearly reflects their priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no choice," said Lisa McGowan, a Haiti specialist at the Development 
Gap, a Washington-based public policy group. "If he does not take this advice, 
he will not get the funding from the international community." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials and international aid organizations consistently have made the 
point that Aristide needs to be careful not to alienate members of Haiti's 
business elite, who they believe are essential to Haiti's development. As a 
result, Aristide obviously has toned down the liberation theology and 
class-struggle rhetoric that was his signature before he was exiled to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he knows he has a daunting challenge when he goes back," a senior 
White House official said. "He knows he's going to need support from the 
international community. He knows he cannot succeed unless he can preside over 
a period of healing in which he allows the business sector to heal itself." 
</P>
<P>
 But officials who deal with Aristide daily stress that the only way outsiders 
can have influence on him is to persuade him that their advice is best for the 
people of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never overestimated our ability to influence him," one Administration 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts and Aristide's more radical advisers fear that he has gone to 
such lengths to appease the United States, the foreign aid community and the 
Haitian elite that he may lose passionate support of the Haitian people. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Baptiste, who sees his prime role as a leader of a movement and has no 
plans to take a position in Aristide's government, said Haitians will be 
satisfied only if they believe the military regime has paid for its crimes and 
if the country's wealth is divided more equitably. If not, they may take 
matters into their own hands. 
</P>

 But Aristide believes the people are patient and understand that he can do 
little more than make a start on democratic reforms before his term ends in 
1996, according to Martineau. If they believe Aristide, who has assured the 
United States that he will not seek reelection, has delivered on his promise to 
give them "poverty with dignity," they will consider him a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any progress will be relief for them," Martineau said. "These are the steps 
to be made now. Perhaps the next slogan will be from poverty with dignity to 
something else, one step further."

ARABS EASE BOYCOTT LINKED TO ISRAEL; MIDEAST: SAUDI ARABIA, FIVE OTHER NATIONS 
AGREE TO END CURBS AGAINST FIRMS DEALING WITH JEWISH STATE.

<P>
 Saudi Arabia and the other oil-rich Persian Gulf monarchies agreed Friday to 
end their boycott of companies doing business with Israel, declaring that the 
blacklist is no longer needed because of Israel's peace agreements with Jordan 
and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council announced the 
step -- which removes a serious irritant from U.S.-Arab relations -- after a 
lunch meeting with Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 With Prince Saud al Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, at his side, 
Christopher said, "There is a commitment from the states of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council to no longer enforce the secondary and tertiary aspects of 
the boycott and not discriminate against American companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very significant moves ahead," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official said later that the step is far more important 
symbolically than it is economically because few Arab states have enforced the 
boycott in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Friday's announcement was the first time that a significant group of 
Arab countries made the non-enforcement policy official and public. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. official said the announcement should reassure firms that "err on the 
side of caution" that they can do business on both sides of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. He said companies such as Motorola, which have long been on the Arab 
blacklist, should now be able to compete for business in the Gulf countries 
without any impediments. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, Arab governments offered to lift the boycott in exchange 
for a moratorium on Israeli construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. But the GCC action came despite continued Israeli settlement 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Gulf diplomat said the boycott had been intended to pressure Israel 
to make peace with the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 When PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook 
hands on the White House lawn a year ago, the primary reason for the boycott 
was pared away, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't be more royalist than the king," the diplomat said. "Whatever the 
Palestinians can live with, we can live with." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the diplomat said the boycott could make it more difficult for U.S. 
firms to do business with the newly established Palestinian self-governing 
authority in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho because the 
Israeli and Palestinian economies are so closely intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, here to attend the General Assembly 
session, said the Arab decision, though incomplete and slow in coming, is still 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a step in the dismantling of the walls of hatred," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision affects only the members of the GCC -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, 
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
 The boycott was imposed by the Arab League and only that organization can 
officially end it. However, the league allows member states to ignore the 
boycott if they deem that to be in their national interest, creating the 
loophole that the GCC used to end enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The GCC countries are the richest in the Arab world and account for a large 
percentage of all business dealings between Arab states and the rest of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 As the GCC diplomat said wryly, "American companies are not doing great 
business with Djibouti and Libya." 
</P>
<P>
 The GCC ministers said they will urge the Arab League to repeal the secondary 
and tertiary aspects of the boycott as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The secondary boycott bars Arab governments from doing business with companies 
that do business with Israel, while the tertiary boycott bars Arab governments 
from doing business with companies that do business with companies doing 
business with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary boycott, banning direct dealing between Arab states and Israel, 
remains. The GCC diplomat hinted that the primary boycott will be lifted after 
Israel and Syria reach a peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The diplomat said the GCC action may strengthen Rabin's hand in his 
negotiations with Syria because it will show the Israeli public that peace 
brings a tangible payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria is demanding the return of the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel during 
the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, as part of any peace settlement. Rabin has indicated 
that he is ready to exchange some land for peace, although he says he will not 
return all of the strategic plateau that overlooks both northern Israel and 
most of Syria. But Rabin is facing strong opposition within Israel to any sort 
of territorial concession. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. official said Israel and Syria have narrowed their differences as a 
result of negotiations conducted by U.S. mediators, but he said the two 
countries remain far from agreement on a peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher plans to visit the Middle East during the first half of October to 
continue his shuttle diplomacy between Rabin and Syrian President Hafez Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from any impact the boycott decision may have on the Israel-Syria talks, 
the most significant psychological effect may be in the United States, where 
the boycott has long been a corrosive factor in U.S.-Arab relations.

INDIA PANIC GROWS WITH NUMBER OF PLAGUE CASES; HEALTH: OFFICIALS SAY THE 
EPIDEMIC IS UNDER CONTROL. BUT CITIZENS AND OTHER NATIONS ARE SKEPTICAL.

 The nurses do not dare enter Ward No. 7 at the Infectious Diseases Hospital 
where S.K. Tyagi is now confined. The equally fearful orderlies leave his food 
at the door instead of carrying it to his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old Indian accountant, along with 107 other suspected plague 
victims in New Delhi, has been assigned to a hospital that is supposed to be 
expert in treating the dreaded disease. But he has quickly grown dubious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Singhal is the only person who is handling the cases," Tyagi said Friday 
as he sat on his unkempt bed in the dim ward with dirty yellow walls, his mouth 
and nose covered with a paper mask to prevent him from transmitting the deadly 
bacillus by coughing or sneezing. "Nurses don't come here; they're scared 
they'll get the plague." 
</P>
<P>
 The 150-bed hospital's harried medical superintendent, Dr. Ram Chandra Panda, 
used one word to describe India's general reaction to the recent outbreaks of 
bubonic and pneumonic plague: "phobia." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's under control," the doctor maintained Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But across India, ordinary citizens, politicians and even medical personnel 
are showing by their actions that they do not believe such assurances. 
</P>
<P>
 Abroad, many countries have begun treating India as a public health pariah by 
banning travel to and from there or requiring incoming passengers from Bombay 
or New Delhi to submit to special health checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some overreacting," said Dr. Narayan K. Shah, representative of the 
World Health Organization in India. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the U.S. State Department said the risk of plague infection for 
international travelers is low. But at Los Angeles International Airport, 
federal health officers began handing out warnings to passengers arriving from 
India to watch for signs that they may have been exposed to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten days after a pneumonic plague epidemic began killing people in the 
industrial city of Surat in western India, the New Delhi-based National 
Institute of Communicable Diseases reported a total of 2,171 suspected plague 
cases nationwide from Surat to Calcutta, 1,000 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The government institute's control room said there had been 45 deaths, but was 
apparently not aware of an 18-year-old man and a 5-year-old boy in New Delhi 
who the Health Ministry on Friday confirmed had succumbed to plague at the All 
India Institute of Medical Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two deaths were the farthest yet from the diamond-cutting and 
artificial-silk weaving center of Surat, 560 miles southwest of Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a vaccine and an antibiotic cure exist, few illnesses can match the 
plague for the atavistic reaction of fright that it produces. Though the number 
of suspected cases rose by more than 600 in the 24-hour period ending at 5 p.m. 
Friday, Shah said the progression was slow enough so he could predict that 
India's first large-scale outbreak of plague in 28 years will have subsided 
within three or four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing to panic about," Shah said. "First the number of cases will 
rise, and then it will go down. This epidemic will go away." 
</P>
<P>
 But in New Delhi, the capital's wary leaders ordered schools and movie 
theaters closed effective Friday as a way of minimizing transmission through 
public contact. Schools had been scheduled to close Oct. 5 anyway for Hindu 
religious holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Delhi government also arranged for 500 more beds at a hospital usually 
used for victims of tuberculosis, and Chief Minister Madan Lal Khurana ordered 
the members of his Cabinet to personally supervise a crash cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
 WHO's Shah said the emergency campaign to rid chronically filthy neighborhoods 
of rotting piles of garbage was not necessary on purely epidemiological 
grounds. The pneumonic strain of the plague, believed to have been spread by 
people fleeing from Surat, is transmitted by coughing, sneezing and human 
sputum, he said, unlike the better-known bubonic variety, which is transmitted 
by fleas that live on infected rats. 
</P>
<P>
 Of greater concern to health professionals is how the suspected plague 
sufferers in Delhi, 21 of whom have been proven so far to have the disease, 
contracted it. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half are not from Surat or the nearby state of Maharashtra, home to 
a separate epidemic of bubonic plague that broke out in early August. 
</P>
<P>
 To track down carriers of the bacillus, booths staffed by doctors have been 
set up at Delhi's railway stations and bus terminal to look for people with 
coughs and fevers who are coming from Surat or Bombay, Maharashtra's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 But conversations with Tyagi and his bedmates in Ward No. 7 showed how late 
authorities were in reacting. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyagi, who kept the books at a Surat iron foundry, was able to catch the train 
to Delhi from the plague-stricken industrial city Sunday. It was only the 
following day, he said, that police began to ask people streaming out of Surat 
where they intended to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Confirmed plague carrier Lala Babu Rai, who made and sold suitcases, fled 
Surat in a train so jammed that he and five other people had to stand for the 
entire trip -- in the lavatory. By the time he reached Delhi, the thin, 
35-year-old artisan had such a high fever and was coughing so hard that he 
hired a rickshaw to take him to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have criticized the authorities of India and of Gujarat, the state where 
Surat is located, for not moving faster to stop the exodus of as many as 
400,000 people. One duty officer at Delhi's Infectious Diseases Hospital, Dr. 
S.K. Chadha, said some of his fellow physicians, as well as the press, also 
deserved criticism for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "More panic has been created than the real problem," Chadha said. "I blame 
doctors, who are just scared and are sending their patients here to the IDH if 
they have a simple cough and fever, or even tuberculosis, rather than examining 
them. And in the beginning, the press gave such news: 'Delhi is in the grip of 
the plague.' But it's not. All the stories in the papers have wreaked panic. 
Even the members of my family are scared." 
</P>
<P>
 So, reportedly, were many Surat doctors, who fled the city. Dr. Jagdish Sobti, 
general secretary of the Indian Medical Assn., said many of his Indian 
colleagues knew little or nothing about the disease and may have been just as 
frightened as their patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plague is one disease not taught in medical schools," Sobti said. 
</P>
<P>
 He too blamed the press, Indian and foreign, for creating panic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to say two things," he said. "One, the plague is preventable. Two, 
it's curable." 
</P>
<P>
 The World Health Organization cautioned people coming to India against 
traveling to Surat, but said there was no need for travelers to delay visits to 
other parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Other governments, including many of India's nearest neighbors, disagreed. Sri 
Lanka, Bangladesh, South Korea, Nepal and Malaysia suspended air service by 
their national carriers. Saudia Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman banned 
all air travel to and from India. 
</P>
<P>
 Yemen and the United Arab Emirates closed sea links as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sri Lanka, authorities quarantined 11 cargo ships arriving from India, and 
1,173 returning Tamil refugees were allowed to disembark only after their ship 
was held off Trincomalee for more than three hours while masked health 
officials inspected each returnee for possible plague symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan canceled a train running between Lahore and the Indian city of 
Amritsar, stranding 317 of its own nationals in India. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governments are not confident about the (Indian) health service," WHO's 
Shah said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gita R. Choksi, general manager of Thomas Cook in Bombay, said the plague 
scare's impact on tourism had been disastrous. She said her travel agency had 
lost more than $150,000 in canceled bookings, "and the sad part is that the 
tourists are apprehensive about coming to India even in December." 
</P>
<P>
 Gujarat Chief Minister Chhabildas Mehta told reporters Friday that there had 
not been a plague death reported in Surat for the last three days. A total of 
12 million tetracycline capsules, an antibiotic used for both prevention and 
cure, have been handed out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not that serious and is fully under control," Mehta said. 
</P>
<P>
 The actions by leaders of neighboring Maharashtra showed that they were 
skeptical. On Friday, the state government empowered district magistrates to 
ban entry of people or vehicles from Surat and other plague-stricken areas.

U.S. ABSTAINS AS U.N. VOTES TO EXTEND SOMALIA MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States, insisting that "the time has come to bring this U.N. 
mission to a conclusion," took the unusual step of abstaining Friday when the 
Security Council extended the peacekeeping operation in Somalia for another 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The American stand put the United States at odds with the 14 other members of 
the council, all of whom voted for the resolution that delays a decision on 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the United States has a veto, it could have halted the mission 
immediately. But the Americans clearly did not want to defy the overwhelming 
majority and end the mission so suddenly. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the face of Somali intransigence, and unwillingness to reach political 
agreement, (the U.N.) cannot continue to maintain 15,000 troops in Somalia and 
spend over $2.5 million a day," U.S. Ambassador Madeleine K. Albright told the 
Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "The resolution . . . fails to come to grips with the realities of the 
situation in Somalia," she said. "It puts off any decision . . . for yet 
another month. . . . The gravity of the situation . . . does not countenance 
such delay." 
</P>
<P>
 But French Ambassador Jean-Bertrand Merimee, clearly reflecting the view of 
the overwhelming majority, said: "It would be a serious mistake for the 
Security Council to terminate the force prematurely. . . . The U.N. should 
continue to play a role in Somalia." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. stance meant that the country that led the world into a chaotic 
Somalia with more than 28,000 troops in December, 1992, was now trying to lead 
the world out of a chaotic Somalia as soon as possible. None of the 
peacekeepers now in Somalia are American. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, although it passed the resolution, did not give the mission any 
resounding accolade. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution clearly lays the groundwork for a possible withdrawal if 
security continues to deteriorate and Somalia's antagonistic warlords fail to 
resolve their differences in a conference. 
</P>
<P>
 While extending the mission until Oct. 31, the resolution provides that the 
Security Council will use that time to "undertake a thorough examination" of 
the mission "with a view to deciding on its future." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the resolution asks Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to 
prepare contingency plans for withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Many diplomats believe the 15,000 peacekeepers could be in danger if they 
depart without some kind of reinforced military escort. 
</P>
<P>
 Albright appeared to imply that U.S. forces might take part in this when she 
told the council: "My government stands ready to work with other members of the 
council to bring about" a safe withdrawal.

U.S. GETS TOKEN PAYOFF ON BOSNIA GAMBLE; NATO: ALLIES GIVE VAGUE ASSURANCES ON 
TOUGHER MILITARY RESPONSES TO REBELS. WASHINGTON HAD HOPED FOR PRESSURE ON 
SERBS TO MAKE PEACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration appeared Friday to have won only a token payoff on 
a gamble in which peace in the Balkans and the credibility of NATO were at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington had hoped that by delaying moves to arm Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
outgunned government it might compel NATO allies to seriously pressure Bosnian 
Serb renegades to make peace. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry left a two-day NATO strategy 
session here with little more than vague assurances from European defense 
ministers that "pinprick" air strikes would be replaced by more forceful action 
to induce the rebels to settle for two-thirds of the Bosnian territory they 
have overrun. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance will press the U.N. bureaucracy to allow NATO pilots to carry out 
air strikes "with greater speed, with surprise and with more force than in the 
past," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 While accepting that decisions on when to use force rest with U.N. commanders, 
the defense ministers said NATO pilots summoned to carry out air strikes should 
have an array of targets to choose from to avoid cat-and-mouse searches for 
individual weapons that can endanger the air crews. 
</P>
<P>
 But grave doubts persisted about whether the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization is prepared to risk the wrath of the heavily armed Serbs by 
punishing them for attacks on U.N. "safe havens" and for violating weapons 
exclusion zones. 
</P>
<P>
 It also remained unclear whether the defense chiefs' promise to pursue broader 
use of air power would satisfy Congress that NATO will act more decisively to 
protect Bosnian civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton is obliged by Congress to ask the U.N. Security Council by 
Nov. 1 to lift an arms embargo hampering the Bosnian government if the Serb 
rebels continue to reject a peace plan drafted by the United States, Russia, 
Britain, France and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 But the four European members of that mediation team -- known as the Contact 
Group -- oppose lifting the embargo, fearing it will provoke rebel retaliation 
against British, French and Russian soldiers serving in the U.N. Protection 
Force. (Germany has no troops on the ground.) 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has refused to take part in the dubious U.N. ground force in 
Bosnia, where more than 20,000 peacekeepers are deployed on humanitarian 
missions in active war zones with neither the means nor the mandate to deter 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the mission has bogged down and troops have become vulnerable to 
hostage-taking, pressure has been building in Congress for unilateral U.S. 
action to counteract the Serbs' huge advantage in weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress' underlying concern is that they wanted to put more pressure on the 
Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace plan, and I think any plan we present to them 
does that," Perry said of the proposed fine-tuning of alliance policy on air 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic on Tuesday gave his support to a U.S. 
proposal to delay any delivery of arms to his forces for six months, as long as 
the Security Council would agree now to nullify the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 France, Britain and Russia oppose lifting the embargo, even six months from 
now, yet the defense ministers exuded an attitude of having overcome disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ministers were guided by the intention of presenting the American 
Administration a helping hand in order to defuse the menace of an early 
decision by the Congress," acting NATO Secretary General Sergio Balanzino said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 He insisted that the "political and psychological environment has changed" 
enough with Izetbegovic's statement to persuade Congress that there is no 
urgency for moves that could divide NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of threatening to confront the defiant Bosnian Serbs with a 
better-equipped government army, NATO appears to be depending on Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic to cut off the rebels and force them to accept the 
peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry conceded, however, that initial assessments from foreign monitors 
indicate that Serbia is still sending some contraband to Bosnian Serbs.

PROBE OF PRI OFFICIAL'S ASSASSINATION SUGGESTS POSSIBLE DRUG CARTEL LINK; 
MEXICO: DEVELOPMENTS LEND CREDENCE TO EX-OFFICIAL'S CHARGE THAT TRAFFICKERS 
WERE INVOLVED IN COLOSIO SLAYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 All three suspects in the alleged plot that led to the assassination of a 
prominent Mexican politician are linked to the northeastern state of 
Tamaulipas, officials confirmed Friday, pointing the finger at a drug cartel 
that until this year had been overshadowed by more flamboyant Pacific Coast 
narcotics gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Television news also reported the arrests of dozens of people in Tamaulipas, 
an area said to be controlled by the notorious "Gulf cartel," which is believed 
to supply two-thirds of the cocaine that enters the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials had said previously that the murder weapon used to 
kill Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the reform-minded No. 2 official in the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, came from the Rio Grande Valley in 
Texas, an area that borders Tamaulipas. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican investigators would not confirm either the report on the source of the 
guns or the Tamaulipas arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials at the Chamber of Deputies confirmed Friday that Fernando 
Rodriguez Gonzalez -- one of two men accused of paying Daniel Aguilar Trevino 
$17,000 to kill Ruiz Massieu -- was a technical secretary of the Hydraulics 
Affairs Commission. Manuel Munoz Rocha, chairman of that commission, is from 
Tamaulipas and was said to be answering police questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office denied reports from the government news agency, 
Notimex, that Rodriguez Gonzalez had been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar Trevino, who was captured at the scene of Wednesday morning's killing, 
told police that he was hired by Rodriguez Gonzalez and Carlos Angel Cantu. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantu is from Aguilar Trevino's hometown, Corralejo, Tamaulipas. 
</P>
<P>
 Developments in the investigation of the Ruiz Massieu assassination have given 
new credence to assertions by Eduardo Valle Espinosa, a former justice 
official, that the Gulf cartel was somehow involved in the March 23 killing of 
Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate from the PRI, which has ruled 
this nation for 65 years. Valle has also said that drug dealers have 
infiltrated Mexican politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gulf cartel -- so named because it is believed to operate mainly in states 
along the Gulf of Mexico -- is thought to be directly connected to Colombia's 
Cali cartel, law enforcement sources say. The cartel specializes in cocaine, 
unlike other gangs that trade in a variety of illegal narcotics. Through Cali, 
the Gulf cartel also has contact with Colombia-linked drug dealers in Mexico 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 The cartel's kingpin is believed to be Juan (The Doll) Garcia Abrego, a 
broad-faced, 50-year-old with a mustache. He is variously said to have been 
born in either the violent border town of Matamoros or in Las Palomas, in 
Texas' Rio Grande Valley. He developed a reputation for violence in the 
mid-1980s, when he was accused of the murders of Matamoros journalists Ernesto 
Flores and Norma Moreno; they were investigating drug trafficking in the city. 
Garcia Abrego is wanted in the United States and in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 While Pacific Coast drug gangs have been killing each other off in a turf war 
in recent years, the Gulf cartel is believed by some to have been cultivating 
political influence. Valle resigned in May from his position as adviser to the 
attorney general because he said the Gulf cartel's political pull made the 
criminal group impossible to penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recognize that I am not capable of apprehending the public head of the Gulf 
cartel," he said in his letter of resignation. "I did all I could with the 
instruments at my disposal. I failed." 
</P>
<P>
 He has since linked the drug dealers to hard-liners in the PRI -- a faction of 
the ruling party believed to have been the most threatened by Ruiz Massieu. 
Ruiz Massieu, the PRI secretary general, is said to have been a moderate 
reformer who served as a bridge between the Old Guard and the Young Turks 
advocating democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Valle's frustration, Deputy Atty. Gen. Mario Ruiz Massieu -- brother 
of the slain man -- has made remarkable strides against the Gulf cartel. In the 
last four months, he and other authorities have arrested: 
</P>
<P>
 * Raul Valladares del Angel, accused of being a Garcia Abrego lieutenant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carlos Resendez, who is believed to have led the cartel's money-laundering 
operations. He was said to be its financial brain, as well as one of its top 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Antonio Abrego, Garcia Abrego's nephew; and Alejandro Diaz, who was caught 
in a police raid in Mexico City. Police said only that they were important 
members of the cartel and had been fugitives since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 After those arrests, a month ago, Mario Ruiz Massieu vowed that "the arrest of 
Juan Garcia Abrego and the dismantling of his criminal organization is a 
fundamental task" for police. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before Francisco Ruiz Massieu was assassinated, federal police 
arrested four suspected members of the Gulf cartel and took from them cocaine 
with an estimated value of $100,000. Between them, the Ruiz Massieu brothers 
thus managed to irritate both the drug traffickers and politicians that Valle 
accuses of having formed an alliance with the traffickers, analysts note.

'THE OWL' DOESN'T BLINK WHEN HE CALLS MEXICO A 'NARCO-DEMOCRACY'; CORRUPTION: 
FORMER ANTI-DRUG OFFICIAL EDUARDO VALLE ESPINOSA'S ALLEGATIONS HAVE ROCKED THE 
GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA and MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The solitary corruption fighter who has rocked the government here and riveted 
the nation with his denunciations of "narco-politics" is not a tenacious 
prosecutor, a crusading politician or a tough cop. 
</P>
<P>
 They call him "the Owl." 
</P>
<P>
 He is a bespectacled, fiercely outspoken journalist named Eduardo Valle 
Espinosa. He is a former '60s-era student activist, left-wing congressman and 
top aide to Mexico's attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 The Owl's persistence has made him a controversial overnight sensation at a 
turbulent time: The assassination Wednesday of a prominent leader of Mexico's 
ruling party -- a crime being attributed to drug traffickers, political 
infighting or both -- gives new urgency to Valle's warning that drug-related 
violence is menacing the nation's stability. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Valle made headlines when he resigned as the head of an elite 
anti-drug unit and declared that corrosive corruption had turned Mexico into a 
"narco-democracy."  
</P>
<P>
 But that was just a prelude. 
</P>
<P>
 With public attention focused last month on Mexico's historic presidential 
elections, Valle sat down with Mexican investigators in Washington and gave 
seven hours of explosive testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 He provided detailed documents -- investigative memos, wiretap transcripts. He 
named names, including a Cabinet-level official he linked to drug lords. And he 
discussed his theory that politically connected cartel forces took part in the 
March assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party presidential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The extraordinary allegations from a well-placed source have bolstered similar 
charges by critics of the government and triggered hasty denials from the 
Cabinet minister and an ambassador, playing into one of the most basic and 
universal concerns in Mexico today: The fear of the "Colombian-ization" of 
Mexican society. A recent survey by Mexico City's prominent daily Reforma found 
that 80% of Mexicans believe that drug trafficking is the most serious threat 
facing the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle asserted in a recent interview with The Times that the drug cartels have 
become "a state within the state." 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference is that in Colombia, the drug traffickers have negotiated 
directly with the state, as if they were another state," Valle said. "In 
Mexico, it has not reached this point. It is hidden; it has not reached the 
Colombian level in form. But in terms of the power of the cartels, it has." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the resulting media attention, Valle's former employers in the 
attorney general's office have seemed distinctly unimpressed. Six days after 
his first disclosures, the nation's chief prosecutor issued an aggressive 
blanket denial of his charges. 
</P>
<P>
 But privately, sources in Mexico's ruling party, the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, appear to be taking Valle more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts say President-elect Ernesto Zedillo, who campaigned on 
pledges of sweeping law enforcement reform, may well use the Owl's 
investigation to make an example of officials in the current government. 
</P>
<P>
 Although none would be quoted by name, Zedillo's aides indicated that he has 
followed Valle's disclosures closely and that he plans to make the fight 
against the cartels a top priority after he takes office Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The present government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari also may well 
act preemptively, using Valle's charges to ferret out at least a handful of 
corrupt officials in what political analysts in the capital say is the 
traditional, end-of-term housecleaning in the six-year Mexican presidency known 
as the sexenio . 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen whether any crackdown would go beyond the symbolic 
purges by past administrations and whether this week's murder of Francisco Ruiz 
Massieu, the secretary general of the PRI and a close ally of both Salinas and 
Zedillo, will provide further impetus for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most persistent speculation regarding "narco-politics" has centered on 
Emilio Gamboa Patron, the 44-year-old minister of communications and transport. 
Valle paints him as a point man for the cartels. Traffickers use the minister's 
vast fiefdom of airports and highways to move drugs with impunity, according to 
Valle. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamboa, who has staunchly defended himself against the charges in a news 
conference, is a former rival of Zedillo's for the ruling party presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 But Valle's charges go far beyond a single government ministry, embracing the 
biggest criminal case in the land -- the March assassination that changed the 
course of Mexican politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the role of "narco-politics" in the Colosio case, Valle has offered 
several leads to the special prosecutor investigating the assassination. But he 
admits that he has little concrete proof for his suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, investigators have not found evidence against three Colosio campaign 
officials about whom Valle raised questions, according to sources close to the 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the Colosio case is concerned, Valle did not present new proof," an 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle speaks well of the special prosecutor but expresses disgust with 
officials in the attorney general's office, who have questioned his credibility 
in stinging tones. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement dismissing Valle's allegations, Mexico's attorney 
general, Humberto Benitez, declared flatly that the former investigator 
"provided no proof that would implicate the public servants he mentions in drug 
trafficking." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Valle accused the nation's top prosecutor of failing to follow up 
on the evidence he had provided during his Washington testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "With surprising speed, they examine dozens of case files and reach the 
conclusion that there is insufficient proof," Valle said in a telephone 
interview from Washington, where he now works as a foreign correspondent. "This 
is an arbitrary act without any foundation in law. It is a real embarrassment. 
I have lost all confidence in this institution." 
</P>
<P>
 The voluble whistle-blower said he has not received any overtures from the 
Zedillo camp and remains dubious about the reformist talk. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to continue the long-distance onslaught that has captured the 
imagination of the Mexican public and of the nation's increasingly independent, 
hard-charging press. Besides his testimony, he has fired off letters to Salinas 
and unburdened himself in long interviews with reporters, at turns emotional, 
caustic and jovial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget about my safety. Who cares?" he said when asked about the risks. "Some 
people may say I am crazy. At least they say this guy is brave, he's not 
corrupt." 
</P>
<P>
 Valle, 47, was recruited in February, 1993, by former Atty. Gen. Jorge Carpizo 
MacGregor. Carpizo, who has a reputation for integrity, became Mexico's 
interior minister early this year and most recently was in charge of the Aug. 
21 federal elections that most observers concluded were the cleanest in Mexican 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle makes an unlikely crime fighter. His political activity as part of the 
"1968 generation" of student militants cost him stints in prison and run-ins 
with federal security forces who waged a violent campaign against the Mexican 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 He was elected in 1985 to a three-year term as a federal deputy representing 
the Mexican Workers Party in Congress, where he met Colosio, then a fellow 
legislator. Despite his anti-Establishment background, Valle readily accepted 
Carpizo's invitation to work as a close aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fight against drug trafficking is a fight for democracy, for our nation's 
children and for the young people," Valle said. "Perhaps some of my friends on 
the left do not understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 With a team of handpicked young agents, Valle led a secretive and harrowing 
investigation targeting kingpin Juan Garcia Abrego of the Gulf of Mexico 
cartel. It is considered the nation's most powerful narcotics organization, 
shipping cocaine north in partnership with the Cali cartel of Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle said he encountered pervasive interference by corrupt state and federal 
officials. And he said he discovered an alarming link between the cartel and 
top officials in the transportation and communications ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged go-between was Marcela Rosaura Bodenstedt Perlick, 31, a former 
federal police agent who is reputedly connected to the Abrego cartel, according 
to testimony and documents presented by Valle. Journalists have dubbed her the 
"Mata Hari" of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on intelligence reports and wiretap records presented to investigators, 
Valle asserts that Bodenstedt used her friendship with the transportation 
minister's chief of staff to make contact with Gamboa himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has admitted that Gamboa met with the woman last November, but 
officials say the only purpose of the meeting was to discuss a painting she 
wanted to sell. Mexican officials have said Bodenstedt is under investigation 
and apparently has left the country; they said she has not been charged. 
Scoffing at their statement that Gamboa did not know the woman's alleged 
connections, Valle points out that the minister oversees the federal highway 
police, a force with significant drug-fighting responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodenstedt and traffickers had contact with a presidential aide and other 
high-ranking government officials, according to Valle. He also provided 
documents listing airstrips that are suspected of involvement in narcotics 
trafficking. And he testified that federal intelligence reports show links 
between officials, including Mexico's current ambassador to Britain, and those 
suspicious airstrips. The ambassador vehemently denied the accusations in a 
letter published in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle's evidence includes voluminous records of high-tech eavesdropping 
throughout Mexico by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The Mexican 
press has published some of the material, complete with names and phone numbers 
of suspects, companies suspected of money laundering and surveillance logs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The protection isn't just proved by the meeting with Marcela," Valle told The 
Times. "It is the pilots and owners of airplanes with arrest warrants that have 
not been served. It is the runways that have not been investigated. These are 
structural problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The standard line from the Salinas administration is that drug corruption, 
although serious, has not penetrated the government to a meaningful degree. But 
some political opposition leaders and other analysts agree with Valle that the 
threat is far greater. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent interviews, Baja California Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel cited his 
experiences in the border state, which this year was the scene of the Colosio 
assassination, the slaying of Tijuana's police chief and a shootout between 
state and federal police -- cases linked to both drugs and politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle presents an accurate picture, said Ruffo, a member of the opposition 
National Action Party, or PAN. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen cases where police officers were reluctant to act for fear of 
being betrayed," Ruffo said. "This is very delicate. This is threatening the 
stability of the republic, not only the federation, but the government of the 
republic. This is very serious. It must be one of the most important tasks of 
the government. . . . What the Owl says has a lot of truth to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition leaders also suggest that the Colosio case could be connected to an 
attempted power grab by an alliance of drug traffickers and hard-line leaders 
of the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle believes that corrupt forces tried to infiltrate the presidential 
campaign and Colosio resisted them. "I cared a great deal for Colosio," Valle 
said. "It cannot be permitted that they announce that a lone assassin killed 
him and then they leave it at that. I believe Colosio was killed because he did 
not (negotiate) with the drug traffickers or the 'narco-politicians.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Valle testified that in the months before the March assassination, he learned 
that officials in the Colosio campaign had invited a brother of Abrego, the 
Gulf cartel kingpin, to a dinner for the candidate. He says he warned a close 
Colosio aide, and the invitation was rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle also expressed suspicion about two Colosio security chiefs, former 
federal police officers with alleged criminal pasts, and about Raul Zorrilla, 
campaign coordinator of special events and a former transportation 
sub-secretary under Gamboa. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle told investigators in Washington that Zorrilla had "immense 
responsibility" in the protection of traffickers while working for the 
Transportation Ministry, according to a transcript of his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle testified that he warned the candidate through intermediaries about 
Zorrilla, who he said was to be dismissed in a shake-up of the campaign staff 
then headed by Zedillo. Valle said that he had scheduled a meeting with Colosio 
to offer his assistance in campaign security March 25 -- two days after the 
assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 The special prosecutor's office noted Valle's allegations about Zorrilla's 
role in the campaign in a Sept. 6 news release, saying all pertinent leads 
would be followed. But there has not been independent confirmation of the 
corruption allegations. While authorities have questioned the two security 
chiefs named by Valle, they have yet to question Zorrilla or look into the 
reported invitation to the kingpin's brother, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators so far have not found evidence contradicting the thesis that the 
accused assassin, Mario Aburto Martinez, acted alone, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Owl awaits the outcome of his war of words, he has returned to the 
journalism trade far from home. He clings to his independence, insisting he is 
not protected by the U.S. Justice Department. In fact, he says American law 
enforcement officials have not aggressively pursued Colombian and Mexican drug 
lords for fear that revelations of government corruption could destabilize 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In an impassioned open letter to Salinas in August, Valle said he moved to 
Washington not because of fear but because of "priorities. The truth is more 
important than my life. About the Colosio assassination and about the 
domination by the Cali cartel of the Mexicans -- 85 million of us."

FILIBUSTER DOOMS CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL; REFORM: ANOTHER WHITE HOUSE PRIORITY 
FOR '94 IS BLOCKED. THE DEMOCRATS' FAILURE IS SEEN AS ONE MORE BAD OMEN FOR THE 
PARTY IN NOV. 8 ELECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Another of the Clinton Administration's legislative priorities fell victim to 
partisan gridlock Friday as Democrats bitterly gave up trying to pass campaign 
finance reform after failing to overcome a Republican filibuster in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides agreed that the decade-long effort to reform the way congressional 
campaigns are financed was doomed for the year when a procedural motion to end 
the filibuster fell eight votes short of the required three-fifths majority. 
The vote was 52 to 46, with only two Republicans voting to end the filibuster 
and six Democrats voting for it. The bill would have imposed limits on campaign 
spending and would have reduced the amount of money that political action 
committees could contribute to candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bill was highly controversial -- and enjoyed far less support 
among rank-and-file Democrats than their leaders generally acknowledged -- the 
failure to pass what had been the cornerstone of Clinton's agenda for 
legislative reform was seen by many analysts as another setback for the party's 
hopes of retaining control of Congress after the Nov. 8 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bound to feed what is a very powerful anti-Congress mood out there and 
that mood, while it is directed at incumbents in general, is hurting Democrats 
more than Republicans because they are the party controlling Congress and the 
White House," said William Schneider, a political analyst at the American 
Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 That concern was evident as Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), 
making no effort to conceal his anger, strode to the Senate podium after the 
vote to lash out at "obstructionism" and Republicans he said were trying to 
"tear down the institution (of Congress) so they can inherit the rubble." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had strained the bounds of all possible hypocrisy in the past, 
but I think we have broken through them in this debate," declared the bill's 
embittered chief sponsor, Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.). 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans just as angrily denied that their motives for killing what they 
described as a deeply flawed and possibly unconstitutional bill were partisan 
or political. Noting that Democratic leaders in the House and the Senate had 
held up the bill for months because of intraparty disagreements that were 
resolved only on the eve of the vote, Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said 
that he would make no apologies for blocking legislation that the Republicans 
were given no opportunity to influence. "From Day 1, Republicans have been shut 
out of the process. . . . It's been take it or leave it -- the Democratic plan 
or no plan at all," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not happy about not being able to pass a good, bipartisan reform bill. 
But if we can't do something good, then at least we can be satisfied that we 
didn't do something bad," said Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who led opposition 
to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ritual blame game that began after Mitchell announced that he was 
pulling the bill from the floor, public interest groups supporting the reforms 
were more bipartisan in their approach -- blaming Clinton for not pushing the 
bill strongly enough, House Democrats for stalling until they knew it would be 
vulnerable to an end-of-session Senate filibuster and Republicans for finally 
pulling the trigger on legislation that the Democrats, by design or ineptness, 
had allowed to become "a sitting duck," according to Common Cause President 
Fred Wertheimer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wertheimer praised Mitchell and Boren but charged that House Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley (D-Wash.) and Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) had played "a 
major role in killing" the reforms through their "inexcusable delay" in ironing 
out their differences with Mitchell so that the two versions of the bill passed 
last year by the House and Senate finally could go to conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The major difference, unresolved among the Democrats until late Wednesday, 
concerned the Senate's insistence on banning all campaign contributions by 
PACs. At the request of seven moderate Republicans whose support was crucial to 
overcoming an earlier GOP filibuster, the Senate included the PAC ban when it 
passed its version of the reforms last June. When the House finally acted five 
months later, however, it voted to retain the current $5,000 annual limit on 
PAC contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 There the matter rested until earlier this week, when House members -- who 
rely more heavily on PAC contributions than do their Senate counterparts -- 
grudgingly agreed to lower the PAC limit to $3,000 per year or $6,000 per 
two-year election cycle. However, that was not enough to satisfy the Senate GOP 
moderates, who, with two exceptions, all sided with Dole to defeat the second 
of three procedural motions required to send the bill to conference. 
</P>
<P>
 If the House Democrats had agreed "to meet us halfway" by accepting additional 
cuts of at least $1,000 per election cycle, it might have kept the GOP 
moderates on board, said Sen. James M. Jeffords (R-Vt.), one of the two 
Republicans who voted for the bill. The other was Sen. John H. Chafee of Rhode 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, many analysts saw the outcome as validating the widely held view 
that House Democrats did not want the legislation to pass and were hoping 
Senate Republicans could be maneuvered into taking the blame for its defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, who objected to the spending limits and the public funding 
included for candidates who abide by the caps, finally obliged -- provoking 
more Democratic charges that they were only seeking political advantage by 
denying Clinton any legislative victories before the midterm elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans tried to insulate themselves from the charges by attacking the 
public funding provisions, financed by voluntary tax check-offs and new 
registration fees for lobbyists, as "an entitlement program for politicians." 
But several lawmakers said privately that they thought both sides would come 
out looking badly, especially in the wake of Congress' failure to act on health 
care reform this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democrats have more to lose, of course, but this is bound to hurt all 
incumbents," Schneider agreed.

POSTAL SERVICE DELIVERY RATE SHOWS LITTLE IMPROVEMENT; MAIL: AN INDEPENDENT 
AUDIT FINDS A SLIGHT DECLINE IN ON-TIME OPERATIONS IN SEVERAL CITIES. OVERALL, 
PERFORMANCE REMAINED UNCHANGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Despite a major effort to improve mail service, the Postal Service on-time 
delivery record for local letters largely was unchanged during the summer, with 
a number of key cities showing disturbing declines in performance, according to 
an independent audit issued Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, where postal officials were embarrassed earlier this year by the 
discovery of a small mountain of undelivered mail, only 71% of local mail was 
delivered overnight, down from 75% in the previous quarter. But after angry 
complaints at congressional hearings, service in Washington has improved 
significantly, with a 70% on-time delivery for the nation's capital, up from 
62%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service has come under fire for performance problems that began 
during the severe weather last winter and have persisted in the face of an 
unexpectedly fast-growing volume of mail. But service is gradually improving, 
Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon Jr. told recent congressional hearings, 
citing a reorganization at the agency's top management level and expanded 
hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's report by Price Waterhouse, which is under contract to the Postal 
Service, covers the latest in a series of mailings. On a daily basis, the firm 
mailed 24 different types of stamped or metered first-class letters, cards and 
envelopes of various sizes to review service in 96 cities. The public report 
measured overnight local service -- the percentage of mail sent within a 
metropolitan area and received the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall national performance remained unchanged at 82% from the previous 
rating period. 
</P>
<P>
 Delivery standards fell in 43 areas, including Atlanta, Baltimore, Cleveland, 
Denver, Detroit and Kansas City. Services improved in 39 areas, including 
Washington, New York City, the suburbs of Chicago, Philadelphia and St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles generally meets the national average, with an 80% on-time 
delivery, unchanged from the previous measuring period. The Santa Ana service 
area had an 87% performance, also unchanged. Other Los Angeles-area mailing 
centers, which serve different groups of zip codes, include Long Beach, with an 
unchanged record of 90%; City of Industry, 88%, up from 87%; Van Nuys, 85%, up 
from 84%, and Inglewood, 84%, down from 85%. 
</P>
<P>
 The report covered test mailings from May 28 through Sept. 16. The previous 
test ran from March 5 through May 27. The Postal Service does not make public 
the sections of the survey showing results for letters mailed outside 
individual metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service said it was encouraged by the survey. The results "show 
that our 'back to the basics' efforts are paying off," said William Henderson, 
the Postal Service's chief operating officer. "Service performance in most 
cities is good -- and we are going to make it better." 
</P>

 The nation's big cities, where service is often comparatively poor, "have 
complex problems that will take time to resolve," Henderson said. "We will 
continue to focus on getting long-term, sustained results." 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service delivers a growing mass of mail over an increasingly 
crowded highway system. Volume has grown to 175 billion pieces a year, an 
increase of 50 billion over the last 15 years, spokesman Frank Brennan noted. 
"We would like to do 95% (on-time), he said, but transportation difficulties 
make this goal "problematic" in many urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's report "does mark a slow but steady improvement," said Arthur B. 
Sackler, executive director of the Mailers Council, an umbrella group for 60 
trade organizations whose members generate 75% of the nation's mail. "We are 
encouraged," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest test for the Postal Service will come during the holiday mailing 
season, traditionally its busiest season, which begins in earnest this month 
with the growing flood of catalogues and gift advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Members of Congress have made it clear that the test of this management team 
-- whether they survive or go -- depends on the crucial season," said Gene Del 
Polito, executive director of the Advertising Mail Marketers Assn. "They have a 
tremendous challenge ahead of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service said it will add workers, equipment and 1.5 million square 
feet of additional processing space for the holiday mailing season. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Friday's test mailing report -- called the External First Class 
Measurement System -- the Postal Service also issued a customer satisfaction 
index, based on a public opinion poll. The consumer survey indicated that 85% 
of the public considers mail service excellent, very good, or good, a rating 
unchanged from the previous survey. Highs and Lows

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal health officials awarded $14 million in grants Friday to 37 state 
health departments to create or expand cancer registries. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to reduce deaths from cancer, Health and Human Services Secretary 
Donna E. Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that the burden of cancer for Americans varies widely by geographic 
location and by ethnicity," Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-eight states will receive funds to expand their existing registries: 
Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, 
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine states will start registries: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Mississippi, 
North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina and Vermont.

SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF TO SURVEY EARTH SITES WITH RADAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Space shuttle Endeavour's astronauts rocketed into orbit and switched on a 
powerful radar instrument Friday to help scientists save vanishing animal 
species and look for lost civilizations under the desert sands. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew of six lifted off at sunrise on a mission that was delayed 1 1/2 
months because of a last-second engine shutdown on the launch pad. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA plans to survey nearly 600 sites with the $366-million radar, including 
the Silk Road traveled by Marco Polo 700 years ago and the area in Rwanda where 
Dian Fossey worked to save Africa's imperiled mountain gorillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Other targets during the 10-day flight include the habitat of endangered 
pandas in China, stagnant pools in countries with malaria outbreaks, 
sand-covered archeological sites in Israel, Egypt and Oman, and the 
radiation-contaminated land around the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 The radar will also track an oil spill in the North Sea. German oceanographers 
plan to dump more than 100 gallons of diesel oil off Denmark on Wednesday to 
see if the radar can identify the mess. They promise to clean up everything 
within two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The radar is flying in space for the second time in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 There were some bugs after the launch -- the kind that buzz. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after blastoff, shuttle commander Michael Baker noticed streaks on two 
cockpit windows and what appeared to be big, squashed bugs on the outside. He 
then discovered a stowaway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to let you know we had an extra passenger. One of those nice Florida 
mosquitoes is on board," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the shuttle holds 500,000 postage stamps; the $9.95 Express Mail stamps 
commemorate the 25th anniversary of the first manned moon landing and will be 
sold after the flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service paid the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
$50,000 to fly the stamps and expects to earn up to $12.5 million by selling 
them to collectors after the shuttle's 10-day mission ends. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the first time stamps have flown in space. The postal service orbited 
another Express Mail stamp in 1983, which became popular among collectors.

U.S., JAPAN SEEK TO AVOID TRADE RUPTURE; ECONOMY: HIGH-LEVEL TALKS STRETCH PAST 
MIDNIGHT IN EFFORT TO AVOID SANCTIONS AGAINST TOKYO. OUTCOME WILL AFFECT 
DIRECTION OF MARKETS, ELECTORAL POLITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 High-level U.S. and Japanese negotiators met into the night Friday, hoping to 
find enough common ground to avoid a rupture in trade relations that could 
further weaken the dollar and send crucial economic relations between the two 
countries into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto ended talks with U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor at midnight, saying the two men planned to meet 
again. The talks were expected to go well past the midnight Friday deadline set 
by the United States as both sides seek ways to head off steps that could lead 
to the imposition of trade sanctions against Japan -- and upset the Clinton 
Administration's effort to win approval of a global trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor scheduled a midday news conference today to announce what actions the 
United States planned to take. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides were described by a senior U.S. aide as "pretty close" to an 
agreement covering U.S. insurance companies' access to the Japanese market. But 
a wider gulf remained in the effort to open Japan to greater purchases of U.S. 
automobiles, auto parts and glass. Both sides characterized the negotiators as 
relatively close to an agreement covering the Japanese government's purchases 
of foreign telecommunications and medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the talks could echo throughout the sensitive arenas of trade 
and electoral politics, as the White House tries to use U.S. trade laws to pry 
open the potentially lucrative Japanese market to U.S. companies while 
presenting voters next month with a clear foreign policy triumph that would put 
dollars in American pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, pressure on both sides to reach an agreement was increased by the 
potential for disruptions in economic and diplomatic arenas beyond the talks: 
Failure to reach agreement could push the value of the yen higher and the 
dollar lower and damage support for the global trade pact facing a vote in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 It could also create a sour atmosphere at the Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation talks that Clinton is to attend in Indonesia in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration and industry officials said that failure to reach significant 
agreements sometime this morning would likely trigger steps leading to 
sanctions targeted at Japan's $4.5-billion to $5-billion industry that supplies 
flat glass for windows and other purposes. Less than 1% of Japan's supply comes 
from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor also is trying to make inroads in the auto industry, which accounts for 
about two-thirds of the United States' $60-billion trade deficit with Japan. 
Kantor has demanded that the Japanese government pressure its auto industry to 
buy $40 billion worth of parts, representing 20% of its market, from the United 
States, a demand that Tokyo has rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 If the United States refuses to retreat from this "astronomical figure," and, 
indeed, does not drop its demand for such specific targets, said Kiyohiko 
Nanao, economics counselor of the Japanese Embassy, the talks will fall apart 
and with them the progress made in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time this week, Japanese Trade Minister Hashimoto flew to 
Washington from Tokyo, to join Foreign Minister Yohei Kono late Friday evening 
in talks with Kantor at the modest offices of the U.S. trade representative one 
block west of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at the last stretch," Nanao said. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurmountable obstacle Friday, according to Japanese officials, remained 
unchanged from the start of the negotiations in July, 1993. That is the United 
States' insistence that some form of "objective criteria" be found to measure 
the progress of U.S. companies in the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan has argued that any specific targets would amount to interference in 
free trade and that it cannot force industries or consumers to buy a specified 
amount of U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
 With little expectation that the negotiators would be able to bridge all the 
gaps in the overnight end game, U.S. officials indicated -- and Japanese 
officials privately agreed -- that the likely outcome would be limited 
agreements covering the insurance industry and Japanese government procurement, 
coupled with movement toward limited sanctions imposed at some distant point, 
or antitrust suits intended to put greater pressure on Japan to buy flat glass 
and auto parts from U.S. manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese officials said they hope that, if full agreement is not reached, they 
could head off sanctions by proposing that the two sides accept the limited 
agreements already achieved, in insurance and government procurement, and agree 
to continue the automotive and flat glass talks after a break. 
</P>
<P>
 In pressing such a course, they were taking the chance that a split in the 
U.S. government, with the State Department and Treasury said to be leaning 
toward reconciliation, would make it difficult for the trade office to line up 
support for imposition of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months ago, a U.S.-Japanese meeting at the White House ended in failure, 
sending the dollar to new lows against the yen -- making Japanese products more 
expensive in the United States and thus less desirable.

CITING 'FATAL DEFECTS,' WILSON VETOES INSURANCE MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Friday vetoed the so-called "homeowners bill of rights," 
legislation aimed at protecting disaster victims from unscrupulous insurance 
practices and authored by the Democratic candidate for insurance commissioner, 
state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on the last day to sign or veto legislation, the Republican governor 
said he had found "several fatal defects" in the bill. But he added that the 
measure did include some "positive consumer protections" and that he would sign 
such a measure if the defects were corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said in a two-page veto message that firefighters and district 
attorneys had told him Torres' bill would have impaired prosecution of 
arsonists by setting up impediments to insurance companies when questioning 
claimants under oath. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, noting that the bill called for simplifying the language in homeowner 
insurance policies to a ninth-grade level, Wilson said he feared that the 
alterations could lead to myriad lawsuits over "coverage issues already decided 
by the courts, thus benefiting attorneys, not consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he favored such provisions as limitations on the number of adjusters 
who could be assigned to a claim and greater written documentation of the 
claims process. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Torres said: "The only reasons he vetoed this bill was the 
influence of the insurance industry and because that fair-haired tool of the 
industry, Chuck Quackenbush, would get credit for killing it. The homeowners 
lost today." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Quackenbush of Cupertino is Torres' Republican opponent for the 
insurance commissioner post in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres caustically remarked that Wilson has received $700,000 for his 
reelection campaign from the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's insurance adviser, Marjorie Berte, did not dispute the contribution 
figure. But she added: "The homeowners have not lost today. There were 
anti-consumer provisions of this bill which should not be enacted, and Gov. 
Wilson has asked for a new homeowners bill of rights that's done right."

 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Friday: There will be no debates between the candidates for 
governor this year, spokesmen for both campaigns said.Earlier in the day, Gov. 
Pete Wilson's campaign said that Wilson would agree to only one debate with 
Kathleen Brown and that it must be Oct. 14 at public television station KVIE in 
Sacramento. The Brown campaign rejected the offer. Each side blamed the other 
for the breakdown of negotiations, which had lasted more than two months. Brown 
held a town hall-style rally at a downtown Sacramento shopping mall at which 
she fielded questions from the audience on the economy, education and the 
state's fiscal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Neither Brown nor Wilson has any public events scheduled for 
today. THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Friday: Supporters of Sen. Dianne Feinstein held news 
conferences in Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco, Fresno, San Jose and 
Redding to criticize a new television commercial from Republican challenger 
Mike Huffington. The ad charges that Feinstein has supported lenient judges for 
the federal bench. Both candidates were in Washington.

BROWN, WILSON CAMPS AGREE: NO DEBATES; POLITICS: EACH SIDE BLAMES THE OTHER FOR 
THE BREAKDOWN. GOVERNOR'S FINAL OFFER TO MEET ON PBS TELECAST WAS REJECTED BY 
RIVAL AS BEING INSINCERE.

<P>
 There will be no debates between the candidates for governor this year, 
spokesmen for both campaigns said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson issued an ultimatum to 
Democratic opponent Kathleen Brown to debate him Oct. 14 in Sacramento or not 
at all. Brown rejected the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Each side blamed the other for the acrimonious breakdown of debate 
negotiations that had stretched over more than two months, though it became 
clear in recent weeks that Wilson, holding an edge in the polls, has played the 
incumbent's strategy by dragging out negotiations and seeking to limit the 
number of debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had once expressed a desire for "multiple debates" and Brown vowed to 
debate Wilson "anytime, anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign aides proposed Friday that they meet for one hour, 6:30 p.m. 
to 7:30 p.m., at the studios of KVIE, Sacramento's public television station. 
The remarks would be carried live on PBS stations in San Francisco, Los Angeles 
and San Diego and taped for later broadcast in other, smaller public 
broadcasting markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown denounced the offer as insincere and demanded that they debate over a 
statewide commercial network in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a transparent effort to avoid debating at all, you pronounce that you will 
debate only in a small market, non-statewide broadcast debate that for most of 
the people of California will mean no debate at all," Brown said in a letter 
faxed to Wilson's campaign office. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown proposed that their futile dispute over debate arrangements be mediated 
by the League of Women Voters. The Wilson camp said no. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Kathleen Brown wants to debate, she will sign on the dotted line," said 
Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown aides said she would not sign, and the issue was settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Most political experts believed that it was to Brown's advantage to debate 
Wilson, to get exposure to many California voters who do not know much about 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Steven M. Glaser, senior adviser to Brown, sounded as if he believed 
that Friday's impasse was a victory for the Brown campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think Pete Wilson's handed us an issue that will haunt him in the final 
six weeks of the campaign," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson campaign framed its ultimatum to make it sound as if the impasse 
was her fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Kathleen Brown continues to balk and drag her heels on the KVIE 
invitation, there will be no television debate in this year's gubernatorial 
election," said Vigo G. (Skip) Nielsen Jr., Wilson's debate negotiator, in a 
letter to those entities that had proposed hosting Wilson-Brown debates.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM BILL IS VETOED; LEGISLATION: GOVERNOR SAYS THE MONEY 
THE MEASURE WOULD REQUIRE IS NEEDED FOR SCHOOLS, HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A campaign finance reform bill limiting contributions and spending by 
candidates for the Legislature and providing for partial public financing was 
vetoed Friday by Gov. Pete Wilson, who said the money was urgently needed for 
other state programs such as schools, health and public safety.  
</P>
<P>
 The veto was announced as a midnight deadline approached for the governor to 
sign or veto the last of 1,200 bills passed by the Legislature before it 
adjourned for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also vetoed a bill permitting doctors to prescribe marijuana for 
legitimate medical purposes and one prohibiting merchants from charging women 
more money than men for the same goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 He also rejected a measure allowing cities and counties to set up clean needle 
and syringe exchange programs for drug addicts to help prevent the spread of 
AIDS, and vetoed a bill abolishing the State Franchise Tax Board while 
transferring its tax-collecting duties to the State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the second year in a row, the governor vetoed a bill giving libraries 
a new and, supporters say, desperately needed funding mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his rejection of the bill to reform legislative campaign finance, Wilson 
said: "This scheme could cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars every 
election cycle. At a time when government is compelled to cut essential 
services, it is indefensible to spend taxpayer money to finance political 
campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
 If it had been signed, the campaign reform proposal would have gone on the 
statewide ballot in 1996 for voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wilson, who is expected to raise $25 million for his current reelection 
campaign, has supported the concept of campaign finance reform, he has opposed 
plans that include public financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The vetoed legislation, authored by Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward), was the latest in a long line of failed attempts to make changes 
in how money is raised and spent in campaigns for the state Senate and 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer lashed out at Wilson, saying the governor "has destroyed our best 
opportunity to stop special interests and the big money influence in 
legislative campaigns. It's too bad he refuses to let the voters vote on 
campaign reform." Lockyer said campaign reform is needed to restore public 
confidence in state government. 
</P>
<P>
 His bill would have limited contributions in legislative races to $2,000 from 
individuals and corporations and $5,000 from political action committees. The 
limits would have applied separately to primary and general election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending also would have been capped at about $800,000 in state Senate races 
and $560,000 in Assembly races, adjusted each year according to the number of 
voters in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending limits would have applied only to candidates who accepted the partial 
public financing the bill would have created. The bill included a system to 
match private contributions by up to a 5-1 ratio, depending on the size of the 
donation. The taxpayer funds would have come from a voluntary state income tax 
checkoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most legislators say they want change, stalemates on the issue have 
been common as each political party fears that the other party will gain an 
advantage. Campaign reform bills that have passed the Legislature often have 
been vetoed, and the courts have struck down large portions of voter-approved 
campaign finance reform initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill allowing doctors to prescribe marijuana was sponsored by Sen. Milton 
Marks (D-San Francisco), who said marijuana was necessary to help patients 
suffering from debilitating diseases such as AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, multiple 
sclerosis and epilepsy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson said the federal Food and Drug Administration has concluded that 
marijuana has no recognized medical use. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the bill prohibiting merchants from charging women more than men for 
the same goods or services, which was authored by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier 
(D-Burlingame), the governor said state law already prohibits gender-based 
price discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 In vetoing the bill by Assemblyman Vivien Bronshvag (D-Kentfield) that would 
have permitted cities and counties to establish clean needle and syringe 
exchange programs for drug addicts, Wilson said he feared that such programs 
would result in an increased number of addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he rejected the measure abolishing the tax board as proposed by 
Assemblyman Johan Klehs (D-San Leandro) because he preferred his own idea of 
establishing a Department of Revenue, which failed to clear the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The library funding bill, authored by state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys), would have allowed local officials to levy a benefit assessment on 
property owners if a majority voted in favor in a local election. Wilson called 
the proposal a tax masquerading as a benefit assessment, and said it should be 
subject to the same two-thirds vote requirement as all new taxes.

SACRAMENTO FILE: WILSON OKS SEIZING CARS FOR 2ND UNLICENSED-DRIVING OFFENSE 
</P>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has signed a bill allowing police to confiscate automobiles 
driven by unlicensed drivers who have a prior conviction for driving without a 
license or for driving with a suspended or revoked license. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will have the authority to seize vehicles owned by such unlicensed 
drivers when they are stopped for routine traffic violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Effective Jan. 1, the new law (AB 3148) was sponsored by Assemblyman Richard 
Katz (D-Sylmar). 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost every week we hear about an accident in which innocent people are 
injured or killed because unlicensed drivers ignore the law and drive anyway," 
Katz said. "Now, if a person who has no business being on the road drives, they 
lose their car." 
</P>
<P>
 California will become the first state to have such a law. 
</P>
<P>
 GOVERNOR

kidnaping and murder. 
</P>

resist because they are intoxicated or under the influence of drugs.

A PREGNANT QUESTION FOR THE FIRST LADY

<P>
 As Hillary Rodham Clinton's spokesman, Neel Lattimore fields questions from 
inquiring minds every day.But he drew the line at this tabloid query: Is the 
First Lady pregnant? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the guts to ask her," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 A tabloid paper that hits the stands this week reports that "insiders" tell a 
British biographer Mrs. Clinton is due in April. The First Lady turns 47 next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the same publication that said she adopted a space alien baby," 
Lattimore said. "If they already have a space alien baby, I don't know if they 
need another one."

MARTINEZ WAS CALM DURING ARREST; ARSON: WITNESSES SAY HE WAS LED 'LIKE A LAMB' 
TO AUTHORITIES AFTER HE WAS FOUND NEAR SCENE OF THREE FULLERTON FIRES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The man now charged with igniting one of California's worst wildfires meekly 
emerged from the shrubbery behind an apartment complex here two weeks ago, 
readily confessed to setting three fires that day, and held his head in his 
hands, witnesses said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was like a lamb," said Tony Haynes, the manager of the 42-unit apartment 
complex where one of the three fires was set. "It was almost like he wanted to 
get caught." 
</P>
<P>
 He and other witnesses on the day Jose Soto Martinez was arrested described 
him as a confused and embarrassed young man who was led gently by the shirt 
collar into the arms of a Fullerton fire captain. He carried a Bic lighter and 
a hunting knife, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three fires had been set that day. One ignited the six-foot wooden fence that 
separates the Hillcrest Glen Apartments with the offices of the North Orange 
County Community College District. District maintenance employees and those 
from nearby Fullerton College ran to douse the blaze and called the Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, Haynes was making his rounds at the apartment complex when 
he saw a fire in a laundry room trash bin and extinguished it. By 2 p.m., a 
third fire had been set near the area where the fence had burned. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the maintenance employees and the district chancellor were on the 
scene almost immediately. Ron Beeler, the director of maintenance and 
facilities at Fullerton College, said Martinez was surrounded by four men, 
including Chancellor Tom Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris spotted Martinez and ordered him not to move. Joe Frank Otero, a 
maintenance man, pointed a fire extinguisher at Martinez and made him crawl up 
a steep slope until he was handed over to fire officials. Otero said he would 
not let Martinez up off his stomach for fear that Martinez might try something. 
After Martinez was turned over to authorities, Otero walked back down the hill 
and retrieved the Bic lighter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was acting weird," Otero said. "He was very confused." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Beeler: "He was very passive. He did not try and make a move. When he 
went to the fire officials, he admitted to setting the fire. He seemed to 
understand all the questions being asked of him. I was very, very surprised 
that he would answer so candidly." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials asked Martinez if he burned the fence, police said, to which 
Martinez replied: "Yeah. I burnt the fence. That's my job." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was booked on three counts of arson. Four charges of arson related to 
the Laguna fires were added Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the fire, Haynes said, police escorted Martinez back to the 
scene and had him retrace his steps, pointing out where he set the blazes. 
</P>
<P>
 For Haynes and others, the news that Martinez has been charged with the Laguna 
fire was exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is so dull and then something like this happens," Haynes said. "This 
just livens everything up."

NABBING SUSPECT COULD NET $50,000; REWARD: COLLEGE MAINTENANCE WORKER WHO 
DETAINED MARTINEZ REMEMBERS OFFERS MADE AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Joe Frank Otero remembers the talk of the reward clearly now. Last year, after 
a wildfire destroyed sections of Laguna Beach, Otero recalled that someone, 
somewhere was offering money leading to the capture of whoever set the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it appears that Otero might just be due the $50,000 that Gov. Pete 
Wilson offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the 
person the governor described as "the sick animal who did this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Otero, a 29-year-old divorced father of two girls, was one of several 
employees from the North Orange County Community College District first on the 
scene of the fire behind the administration headquarters on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees had helped put out the first fire in the area, and four hours 
later, there was a second fire. Otero couldn't believe it was happening again 
and he was right in the middle of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tom Harris, the district's chancellor, pointed to someone hiding in 
the bushes who turned out to be Martinez, it was Otero who tracked him down and 
ordered him to crawl up a steep hill on his stomach. Otero made sure that 
Martinez never had a chance to grab anything from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to stand up and I said, 'You are going to crawl up this hill,' " 
Otero said. "Every time he started to raise his hand up, I pushed it right back 
down. I thought he might reach for a beer bottle or something." 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the hill, Otero was joined by his boss, Ron Beeler, who turned 
Martinez over to authorities. Then Otero grabbed the Bic lighter that Martinez 
had tossed to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 A fire captain noticed a hunting knife in Martinez's pocket, which unnerved 
Otero. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must have had my guardian angel with me that day," Otero said. "When I came 
home, I told my roommate, 'Why didn't he try and do anything with that knife?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Otero wouldn't mind having the $50,000 right now. In fact, he wants to know 
exactly how to go about getting it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still up for grabs, ain't it?" he asked. "The chancellor's not the one 
who caught him. I'm the one who caught him." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, shortly after charges were filed against the suspected arsonist, 
the governor's office said it was "premature right now" to discuss the reward. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will have to be a conviction before somebody could collect," said Paul 
Kranhold, a spokesman for Wilson's office. 
</P>
<P>
 And even then, the governor might not dole out the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's information leading to the arrest and conviction," Kranhold stressed, 
adding that merely detaining the suspected arsonist might not qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would defer to the lawyers on that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Otero had the money, he'd buy himself a house. For the past 10 years and 
eight months, he's been a maintenance worker for the community college 
district. The extra money would help. He has two daughters, ages 8 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire in Laguna is still vivid in Otero's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember all those houses getting destroyed and it was so sad," Otero said. 
"You can't replace the things you have." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on his role in the apprehension of the man charged with arson in 
one of the biggest fires in memory, Otero became pragmatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money ain't the thing," he said. "It's like you might have put someone 
away who won't start fires no more. If I could do it again, I would. Because a 
lot of people got hurt and all those houses you just can't replace."

RULING ELATES BLACK PARENTS CONTESTING STATE IQ TEST BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 IQ tests, widely attacked by civil rights organizations as racist, may be 
available in the future for black parents who want to measure their children's 
learning problems, as the result of a court ruling Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals clears the way for a 
federal judge to decide whether a 15-year-old ban on the use of IQ tests to 
place blacks in "mentally retarded" classes still applies, given the current 
array of "special education" programs for students with various learning 
difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling did not resolve claims of racial bias in the tests nor the question 
of whether they should be available to families who want them. But it was a 
victory for a small group of black parents who challenged a statewide ban on 
the use of IQ tests to place blacks in special education. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tremendous victory for the cause of equality and for black parents 
and kids," said Manuel Klausner, a lawyer for those parents. 
</P>
<P>
 A landmark 1979 federal court ruling found that IQ tests are racially and 
culturally biased against blacks and barred California public schools from 
administering them to black students. Students of other races are not included 
in that ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say that prevents some parents from learning whether their child has a 
learning disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 A Laguna Hills mother who is suing the Saddleback Valley Unified School 
District over the issue said Friday that she is pleased with any ruling that 
could result in fair treatment for all schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one should be told they can't have the test because they are black, and 
that's what happened to my daughter," said Wendy Strong, whose 8-year-old 
daughter, Brianna Combash, was denied the test. Strong wanted the test 
administered to her daughter to help determine if the girl has a learning 
disorder.

STAND FIRM ON TRADE LEGISLATION -- FAST; CONGRESS MUST RESIST HOLLINGS-TYPE 
OBSTRUCTIONISTS AND RATIFY GATT BY YEAR'S END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a laudable show of bipartisanship, Senate leaders have agreed to return to 
Washington for an extraordinary lame-duck session in late November specifically 
to vote on a new world trade agreement. That appears to put to rest fears over 
the last 48 hours that Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) would succeed in his 
efforts to block a vote this year by holding the trade legislation hostage in 
his Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But the protectionist South Carolina Democrat has nonetheless deftly set the 
stage for other free-trade foes and critics of the Clinton Administration to 
hammer away at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. While there has been 
widespread bipartisan support for liberalizing trade in both the Senate and 
House, this is, after all, an election year, one in which incumbents are 
generally unpopular and vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing firm in supporting the trade legislation will be tough but right in 
principle and practicality. It is clearly in the national interest to ratify a 
worldwide agreement that would slash tariffs around the globe and help to 
create 300,000 to 500,00 new U.S. jobs in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans must join with Democrats in defeating GATT detractors like 
Hollings. A Republican wild card is Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), 
who was noticeably absent from Thursday's Senate Finance Committee and did not 
vote with fellow Republican members to clear the trade bill out of that panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, a would-be presidential contender, says he supports free trade but he 
has been critical of the Clinton Administration's trade legislation. Might the 
Kansas Republican be tempted to play politics over principle to embarrass 
Clinton and torture the Democrats? Dole should not stoop to such tactics. Will 
he have the political rectitude to resist? 
</P>
<P>
 The trade bill should not die due to cheap political muggings. If Congress is 
unable to approve an agreement before this year, ratification could be put off 
indefinitely in a new Congress, which will have the freedom to debate the pact 
endlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has long championed free trade. Despite some concerns about 
the North American Free Trade Agreement, it is proving to benefit the United 
States. More than 100 nations signed the GATT agreement in Morocco last April. 
U.S. failure to ratify the agreement by year's end would send a no-confidence 
message to other nations, particularly those looking for a way out of their 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate and House have shown rare bipartisanship on trade issues. They 
should renew that cooperation now to do what is best for the nation: Pass the 
trade legislation this year.

A FRIGHTFUL DISEASE IS BANISHED; THANKS TO DRS. SALK AND SABIN, POLIO IS NO 
LONGER A THREAT IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only older Americans are now able to recall the chilling fear once raised in 
all families, especially those with younger children, by the viral infection 
that science knew as poliomyelitis and that lay persons commonly called 
infantile paralysis. In its severest form the virus attacked the nervous 
system, producing death or paralysis. Sometimes its victims were doomed to a 
permanent immobile existence encased within a life-support system known as the 
iron lung. 
</P>
<P>
 Its most famous victim, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who contracted the disease at 
the age of 39, proved that it was possible to overcome or at least compensate 
for some of polio's worst consequences. Roosevelt's determination and success 
-- he was elected to the first of his four terms as President 11 years after 
being stricken with polio -- gave hope to millions. But two remarkable American 
medical researchers gave more than hope. By developing vaccines to prevent 
polio, they provided the means to eradicate the disease and in so doing lift 
the terror that it inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1954, Dr. Jonas Salk of the University of Pittsburgh found that polio 
viruses killed by formaldehyde were still able to produce immune reactions when 
injected into the body. From that discovery came the Salk vaccine. Five years 
later, Dr. Albert Sabin at the University of Cincinnati developed a live-virus 
vaccine for immunization against polio. Since 1961, this has been the vaccine 
of choice used throughout the world. Because of it, millions have been spared 
from infection. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Health Organization has now declared the Western Hemisphere to be 
free from polio, the last known case having occurred three years ago in a 
village in Peru. About 750 million people in the Americas can thus be 
considered as safe from one of history's most feared diseases. Credit is given 
to a regionwide immunization campaign launched in 1985. The threat of polio 
elsewhere in the world, while vastly diminished, has not wholly disappeared. 
Public-health officials hope the aggressive campaign waged in the Western 
Hemisphere can be emulated so that the 120,000 cases that still occur annually 
in the world's poorer regions can be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, what has happened in the Americas must be hailed with the gratitude 
that such an accomplishment commands. The Charter of the United Nations speaks 
of saving future generations from the scourge of war. The achievement of Drs. 
Salk and Sabin was nothing less than to spare future generations from the 
scourge of a frightful disease.

IDENTIFYING MEXICO'S POLITICAL ASSASSINS; REINVENTING THE NATION HAS LEFT 
SALINAS WITH MANY ENEMIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After decades in which political assassination seemed a thing of the past in 
Mexico, two key leaders in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party have 
been murdered in a matter of months. In March the PRI's presidential candidate, 
Luis Donaldo Colosio, was gunned down in Tijuana. On Wednesday, Jose Francisco 
Ruiz Massieu, the majority leader in Mexico's Chamber of Deputies and the PRI's 
No. 2 official, was the victim. Backed for his position by President-elect 
Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, Ruiz Massieu was a confidante of outgoing 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and had been a central figure in 
the transition from Salinas to Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The phrase political assassination suggests murder for ideological rather than 
personal or narrowly economic motives. Speculation as to who is responsible for 
this latest murder has been rampant, with suspicions focusing on the unresolved 
Chiapas uprising of last January or political disputes within the PRI. But it 
is at least as likely that drug lords are behind the slaying, which does not 
appear to be the work of a fanatic, but a hired gun. 
</P>
<P>
 In his campaign to modernize Mexico, Salinas has undermined the economic and 
political power of many interest groups. Dethroned union bosses, some now in 
jail, are his sworn enemies. Many former policemen, fired from their jobs for 
corruption, have openly joined the ranks of criminal organizations that rob, 
assault and kill their fellow citizens. Crooked financiers have also sworn 
revenge against a political and legal system that once sheltered their illegal 
activities, but was turned against them by Salinas. Many old-guard PRI 
officials have been fired from their posts and are now also looking for the 
chance to get even. 
</P>
<P>
 So Salinas' struggle to reinvent Mexico has left him with many enemies. But 
the drug lords, angry at tougher law enforcement and perhaps eager to show 
their power, may be the most dangerous enemies. It may very well be that behind 
the assassinations of both Colosio and Ruiz Massieu lies a lethal combination 
that Latin Americans refer to as narco-politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican drug Mafias may believe that they have the resources to literally 
terrorize the government and turn Mexico into a republic of fear, like their 
criminal counterparts in Colombia did. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Colombianization" of Mexico would mean a running battle of the sort seen 
for years in Colombia between government security forces and the underground 
army of the drug trade. If this is indeed the meaning of the Ruiz 
assassination, then the enemy has surely landed a grievous blow. But the drug 
lords will not destabilize Mexico as easily as they did Colombia. Mexico is 
bigger, stronger and more sophisticated than Colombia. Mexico can also count on 
the help of a powerful next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz Massieu's murder must bring sorrow to this entire continent. His 
colleagues in Mexico's leadership are staring into the face of war, and they 
should be accorded some of the respect we reserve for wartime leaders. They can 
win, but only if they do not have to fight alone.

CALIFORNIA'S INITIATIVE PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With nearly every election, the call for reforming the initiative process is 
heard (Sept. 19). Its use by well-funded special interests has been a 
particular target of reformers, and the sponsorship of Proposition 188 by 
Phillip Morris Inc. has once again focused attention on the power of money to 
dominate the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the abuse could be eliminated by the adoption of "truth in 
sponsorship" and "truth in advertising" laws. Petitions should be required to 
include a prominent notice disclosing the sponsors of circulation efforts with 
reference to industries or groups involved. Similarly, advertising should be 
required to include the names of industries or groups paying for the ads as was 
required by Proposition 105 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with this knowledge, prospective petition signers and voters would 
probably take a much harder look at initiatives. Many would not survive such 
scrutiny. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Sherry Bebitch Jeffe's article (Opinion, Sept. 18) on initiatives further 
added to my own frustration with the way the process is used in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Most initiatives are extreme solutions to legitimate problems. They are often 
written by extremists who often don't know what they are doing. Many are 
well-intentioned, but ill-conceived responses to the Legislature's inability or 
unwillingness to act. As a voter, I often feel frustrated because I have to 
choose between a poor solution to a problem or no solution at all. I have to 
take all or nothing of an initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 103 is a shining example of the process gone awry. The insurance 
situation in this state really was scandalous and something had to be done. A 
middle-aged driver with a good record in an urban area, I was supposed to 
benefit from Proposition 103. Instead, my liability premium went up $200 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The best public policy comes when competent, well-intentioned representatives 
of all sides come together and hash out a solution. The initiative process 
usually subverts that process by presenting one take-it-or-leave-it solution.

INFLUENCE OF TELEVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prof. Donella Meadows' cogent essay on the "junk media" (Commentary, Sept. 22) 
reflected on the influence of popular TV fare as the great American cultural 
distorter and purveyor. 
</P>
<P>
 One aspect not stressed enough, however, is that the pat circumstances and 
solutions contrived by the medium's scriptwriters have become the twisted 
reality and expectations of two generations. 
</P>
<P>
 By encapsulating life's dramas into neat little segments, the programmers have 
numbed impressionable minds to the day-to-day cultural influences from which we 
draw the perspectives to discern truth, realize goals and cope with adversity. 
TV rarely, if ever, focuses on the intellectual dues that its larger-than-life 
characters surely must pay before plying their skills in the improbable 
scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 It should surprise no one when today's youth, residing half their lives in 
TV's never-never land, on facing life's unscripted roadblocks, should cry that 
"reality sucks."

 Meadows points out that " . . . our blasted minds have lost the distinction 
between free political speech, which is essential to democracy, and free 
commercial speech, which can undermine democracy along with everything else 
worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
 I utterly agree. But although the junk media have been dancing on the grave of 
that particular distinction ever since, it was actually destroyed by the 
Supreme Court in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Buckley vs. Valeo, the court ruled that campaign spending 
expresses political opinion and is thus an exercise of freedom of speech, which 
the Bill of Rights forbids Congress to abridge. Insofar as the decision lets 
millionaire candidates spend as much of their own money as they please to buy 
brilliant TV ads and thus buy themselves seats in Congress, it has been 
comparatively harmless, though exasperatingly unfair. But it also created a 
bullet-proof legal disguise for both "undue influence" (meaning bribery) and 
for overwhelming interference in other people's elections. 
</P>
<P>
 This had previously been considered illegal under the "shall be chosen by" 
language and some other instructions in the main body of the Constitution.

 As an ex-nanny, I cannot tell you the number of children I have seen mimic an 
action or verbal expression seen on TV. This country is like a child playing 
with a toy, and the toy is the First Amendment. This has not just been about 
private industries' freedom of speech. This has been about the freedom of the 
rich versus the freedom of the poor, and the "poor" is beginning to mean all of 
us in the mental sense. I believe in freedom of speech, but what about the 
freedom to be free of this mental contamination?

 It seems that (GOP candidate) Michael Huffington is going through the 
"terrible twos." Remarkably, Huffington feels that two years in the House 
qualifies him for election to the U.S. Senate. Could it be that two years in 
the Senate will qualify him, in his eyes, for the presidency, where two terms 
might just satisfy his overweening ego?

'THREE STRIKES' LAW AND PIZZA CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Pizza Case Unlikely Focus of '3 Strikes' Debate," Sept. 18: 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Dewayne Williams, the man who stole the pizza from the children at the 
Redondo Beach Pier, has proven himself incapable of functioning in society. 
After four felony convictions, is there any doubt as to what he is? This will 
be his fifth felony conviction. At 27 years old, he has many more years ahead 
of him to damage society, unless he is locked up now.

 "Life? For a piece of pizza?" says Williams' girlfriend. Williams, who takes 
drugs, robs, frightens children and chronically commits felonies with no 
apparent problem, but who faints if he eats pork, should get his values 
straight. If the thought of taking drugs, robbing, etc. made him faint or ill, 
like it does decent people, then he wouldn't be in this mess with "three 
strikes."

 Reading about the "pizza thief" and similar cases makes two things 
"strikingly" clear: First, a "three strikes" law for serious felons is good 
and, second, that we either need to redraw the definitions of misdemeanor and 
felony or, more probably, create a new classification of crime -- something 
between a felony and a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 People who steal a slice of pizza, or an apple from the store, realistically 
are not as bad as those who hurt other people. I don't care whether they injure 
people while trying to pull a gold chain off their neck or by knocking them 
down while running away from police or by domestic violence or by manslaughter, 
etc. If someone criminally injures another, that should be considered a felony 
subject to a "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is that now that we finally have a strict and severe law, we need to 
do some serious fine-tuning to allow proper use of the law. After all most of 
us who clamored for it wanted some true justice, not petty revenge.

 Re "Denny Case Defendant to Be Tried on Gun Charge," Sept. 13: I am somewhat 
confused by Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and the "three strikes" law. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, Antoine Miller, after an argument goes into his house and 
returns to a vehicle armed with a gun. He then proceeds to fire at the 
occupants and subsequently, at point blank range, tried to fire into the face 
of the driver. The gun jammed. The crimes that were committed here are assault 
with a deadly weapon and attempted murder. This would also be a "strike" under 
the new law, a second strike because Miller is already on felony probation. 
</P>
<P>
 If we are to have citizens feel safe and to protect them at all, why is Miller 
only being charged with being a felon in possession of a gun? It would be 
reassuring to hear from our D.A.'s office the reasons why such lenient 
treatment has been afforded here. Are the victims afraid to testify? Should 
citizens arm themselves for protection? What?

MASS MURDER CASE GOES TO PUBLIC DEFENDER; COURTS: JUDGE ASSIGNS OFFICE TO 
REPRESENT CHARLES NG, THE ACCUSED KILLER OF 12. HIS LONG-DELAYED TRIAL WAS 
SHIFTED TO SANTA ANA FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Accused mass murderer Charles Ng, whose long-delayed trial has been 
transferred here from Northern California because of extensive media coverage, 
will be represented for now by the Orange County Public Defender's Office, a 
judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge John Ryan, who is presiding over the case 
temporarily, made the appointment during a pretrial hearing on the case, in 
which prosecutors will seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The case dates back a decade and has already cost more than $4 million by some 
estimates. It nearly bankrupted Calaveras County, where the killings took 
place, said Alan Slater, Orange County Superior Court chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Special legislation passed last year ensures that the state and Calaveras 
County -- not Orange County -- will pay for the trial, Slater said. "We are 
doing every conceivable thing to make sure Orange County will not bear any of 
the costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ng, 33, a martial arts expert and former Marine, is charged with torturing and 
killing 12 people in 1984 and 1985. Among the victims was Robin Scott Stapley, 
a 25-year-old Orange County resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Calaveras County Dist. Atty. John Martin and Los Angeles Deputy State Atty. 
Sharlene Honnaka will prosecute the case, which has been marked by legal 
wrangling from the start. Several judges have excused themselves or been 
removed from the case as a result of various motions, while several lawyers 
have actively competed to represent Ng. 
</P>
<P>
 A Northern California judge sent the case to Orange County in April after 
ruling that, because of extensive pretrial publicity, selecting an impartial 
jury there would have been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald McCartin, who was asked by 
the state Judicial Council to hear the case in Orange County, dismissed all 
previous attorneys and excused himself from appointing new counsel to defend 
Ng. 
</P>
<P>
 When Judge Ryan on Friday appointed the public defender, the office's first 
action was to file a document removing McCartin from the case. 
</P>
<P>
 A new judge will be assigned by Friday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ng's previous attorneys are expected to fight their removal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ng fled to Canada after the killings and was returned to the United States 
three years ago following a protracted extradition battle.

HOUSING IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In none of the articles I have read on immigration is there any mention of the 
effect of the mass influx on housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The newcomers gravitate to the oldest neighborhoods where the housing is 
aging.Zoning laws are violated by having many more people to a house than is 
normally allowable for health and safety reasons. Overcrowding results in 
friction between individuals and neighbors and overwhelms police availability. 
Foreigners don't trust the police. Drug activity and crime result. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, families can be displaced due to the practice of housing large 
numbers of single males in a house where the beds may be rented on a rotation 
basis. This produces large rents per housing unit and by displacing family 
units contributes directly to the homeless situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-income housing is not being built at all, let alone in quantities adequate 
to accommodate the newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no way the United States can continue to admit a million immigrants 
each year without consideration of housing them, unless we want to house them 
as they do in Tijuana, Mexico.

MARYLAND MILLION EXPECTED TO GIVE BIG LEG UP TO SMITH; HORSE RACING: HIS NINE 
MOUNTS AT LAUREL TODAY MIGHT HELP JOCKEY BREAK STAKES RECORD, CLINCH SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE ECLIPSE AWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mike Smith is so polite, he won't even begin to rate all the champions he has 
ridden in the past couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to offend anyone," he said when asked to compare such great 
mounts as Holy Bull, Lure, Prairie Bayou and Sky Beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," agreed his agent, Steve Adika. "He's the good guy, and I'm the bad 
one. I take all the heat if we lose. But that's what works for us. Mike is a 
real gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Smith, the nation's leading jockey for the second year in a row, 
invades Laurel Race Course for his first Maryland Million. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the fact that Smith is more famous than any of the horses he will 
be riding or that he never has seen at least seven of the nine horses he will 
climb aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he is thrilled to be here, glad to be invited down for the day from 
Belmont Park "by some of the people I ride for." By that, Smith means Claiborne 
Farm, the owners of Lure, who are longtime friends and associates of the family 
of Stuart Janney III, the Maryland Million's new president. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Smith's nine Laurel mounts are the Janney-owned Military Look, a double 
Maryland Million winner and entry Saturday in the Sprint, and Warning Glance, 
who will run in the Maryland Million Turf. Smith also will ride two other 
horses for Charlie Hadry, the Janney family's Maryland trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as Smith's presence today will be a bonus for the Janneys, the 
29-year-old jockey also could reap real benefits from riding on the Million 
card. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is on a quest. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, en route to winning his first Eclipse Award, Smith won 62 stakes, a 
North American record. 
</P>
<P>
 Already Smith's count this year is up to 55 stakes, which means the jockey is 
in a good spot, with three months left, to win eight more stakes and break his 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 At Laurel today, he will ride in nine stakes in one day, more than he rode 
last year when he had mounts in all seven races on the Breeders' Cup card, 
winning one, the Mile, with Lure. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to think Mike is in a good position to win another Eclipse," Adika 
said. "If he breaks the stakes mark, continues to be No. 1 in money won (so 
far, $11.9 million compared to $9 million for runner-up Pat Day) and rides Holy 
Bull, who could be horse of the year, you'd have to think he'd get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith would be the first jockey since Day in 1986-87 to win consecutive 
Eclipse Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's high-profile career switched gears when he moved from being Day's 
Midwest shadow in 1989 to riding at the New York tracks in 1990. There, he, 
Jerry Bailey and Julie Krone have filled the void left by the retirement of 
such riding greats as Angel Cordero Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike was reluctant to go to New York," Adika said, "but after a lot of 
prodding and pleading he went, and to say the least, it has all worked out. 
It's called being in the right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Croll, who trains Holy Bull, said Smith's riding has improved greatly in 
the past two years. "He has gained a lot of composure," Croll said. "That comes 
from experience and riding a lot of good horses. He's a good, cool rider, 
doesn't panic. In that regard, he reminds me of Craig Perret, who has a knack 
for keeping his mounts out of trouble. I've even seen it with how Mike has 
ridden Holy Bull this year. He has ridden each race with more confidence. And, 
believe me, that makes a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds fellow rider Chris McCarron: "Mike's just an all-around good kid. He 
rides strong and aggressive, and he's got a good head on his shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's self-control has been put to the test in the past two Triple Crowns. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Smith who was aboard Prairie Bayou when he won the 1993 Preakness and 
then unceremoniously jumped off him when the horse broke down and subsequently 
was destroyed in the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if you can ever put something like that behind you," Smith said, 
"but you have to go on. Everybody loved that horse in some odd way. He was a 
gelding, a kind of underdog, who kept winning, kept beating the odds. A lot of 
people related to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has a wall of photos in his house dedicated to the horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Then this year, Smith was aboard Holy Bull when the colt broke slowly from the 
starting gate and was the dismally beaten favorite in the Kentucky Derby. The 
horse subsequently skipped the rest of the Triple Crown, although he since has 
won four Grade I stakes and twice beaten older horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many little things went wrong that day that it turned into one huge 
problem," Smith said of the Derby. "Not only did the horse get off slow, he 
almost went down and then he was eliminated again after a sixteenth of a mile 
when a horse went over the back of his heels in the first turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a half-mile, we were just in a bad spot and the horse threw in the 
towel. He also didn't warm up well and was real quiet. It came out later that 
his blood count was down. By now, I think, it's pretty obvious to everyone that 
the horse just didn't run his race that day." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his ride on Holy Bull in his last start, the Woodward Stakes, when he 
beat Devil His Due by five lengths, "was awesome. There are just no words to 
describe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also can't believe that some people are knocking Croll for not running in 
the Breeders' Cup. Jimmy Croll isn't ducking anything with this horse. This has 
been been the plan all along, to rest the horse after the Woodward and then run 
him again next year at 4. If there was ever a race anyone would duck, it was 
the Woodward, what with the other speed horse (Bertrando) and going against 
those older horses." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that although he doesn't ride full-time at Laurel and has not been 
on the majority of his Million mounts, he anticipates no problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've ridden at Laurel before," said Smith, who won the 1990 Barbara Fritchie 
Handicap and has ridden in the International. "The trainers will tell me all 
about their horses before the race and I'll get a chance to feel the horses out 
in the post parade. Then, if they've got what it takes to win, they will show 
it."

WHY CAN'T BASEBALL BE MORE LIKE 'BASEBALL'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the current custodians of the game, players and owners both, are watching 
the PBS series "Baseball," and if in watching they have gained any sense of the 
enormity of the trust they have betrayed, do you think they give a damn? 
</P>
<P>
 They may not be the last, but they certainly are the least of the line. 
</P>

 I am nearly 90 years old and this will be the first time in my lifetime that a 
World Series will not be played. Every major league owner and player should be 
forced to sit down together to watch Ken Burns' brilliant "Baseball" -- and 
they should hang their heads in shame. 
</P>

 Regarding "Baseball": 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Downey's piece on "Ken Barbie" was right on the money: a bit cruel, but 
exquisitely appropriate. The same critique should have been, but was not, 
applied to the earlier Civil War series. I don't know what moves Mr. Burns, but 
it certainly is not an appreciation of male bonding. 
</P>
<P>

 Mike Downey's indictment of Ken Burns' documentary says a lot more about him 
than it does about the remarkable film.

 I've watched the first five "innings" of Ken Burns' epic "Baseball," and you 
know what? So far, not one ballplayer has worn an earring.

 After watching the recent documentary on the Black Sox scandal, a thought 
occurs to me. Those eight players have suffered the ignominy of having thrown a 
World Series. But are they any worse than today's greedy elite? Isn't Bonilla 
just as bad as Joe Jackson? Our modern-day heroes have thrown half a season, 
the playoffs and a World Series. Say it ain't so, Joe.

BOOIN' OF THE BRUINS: ARE THESE REAL FANS OR JUST FRONT-RUNNERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to ask the people masquerading as UCLA fans at the Rose Bowl last 
Saturday for a favor. If you are unable to support the Bruins when they are 
struggling, please give your tickets to someone who can and watch the game at 
home, which is where many of you were on Jan. 1 after selling your tickets to 
Wisconsin fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wayne Cook you mercilessly booed off the field Saturday is the same Wayne 
Cook who last November courageously played with a bruised kidney to lead UCLA 
over USC and a berth in the Rose Bowl. Like you, I was disappointed and 
frustrated by UCLA's performance against Washington State. However, as long as 
the Bruins are on the field, I will give them my unqualified support. That is 
what being a fan is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 PAUL C. BAUDUCCO, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The remarkable innocence of jocks and their coaches continues to astound, the 
latest dramatic example being the reactions of Wayne Cook and Terry Donahue to 
the booing of Cook during the Washington State debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Terry couldn't even bring himself to address the issue. Cook, for his 
part, manfully admitted he "stunk," but rather than leaving it at that, the 
quarterback felt the need to unburden himself. "I don't want to lie," he went 
on, then enumerated the ways in which he was personally hurt by the booing, 
concluding with a heartfelt, "The hell with everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want to lie either, Wayne, so in the interest of furthering your 
education at a great university, I'd like to explain the principle of booing: 
</P>
<P>
 Since the fan invests his heart and pocketbook primarily in the team, not in 
particular members of it, he reserves the right to express his feelings about 
what's going on on the field. A particular player might be having a bad day and 
the coach chooses to leave him in the game. That player is likely to hear some 
boos. It's an American tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 CHARLES CHICCOA, Reseda 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Willa Hockett (Viewpoint, Sept. 24) suggests Terry Donahue should be fired, in 
part, because he has never recruited a black quarterback. Wrong. Bernard 
Quarles started two games for UCLA during the 1979 season and Bert Emanuel was 
the Bruins' third-string quarterback during the 1990 season. Both transferred 
to other schools when Tom Ramsey and Tommy Maddox, respectively, emerged as 
stars-to-be in their freshmen seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, I must agree that Donahue should be axed immediately since my 
exhaustive research shows that he has never recruited a Jewish nose guard.

PERRANOSKI DESERVED BETTER THAN THIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The summary dismissal of Ron Perranoski by Fred Claire appears to be a classic 
example of an incompetent ridding himself of an expert to provide a scapegoat 
for his own mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers were ninth in earned-run average this season, but can you blame 
Perranoski for Claire's disposing of John Wetteland and Pedro Martinez, thus 
destroying the bullpen? 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, let's take a hard look at what Claire has let slip or given away 
and what he brings in. Fred, the Dodgers needed a class individual and a 
baseball man like Perranoski for your youth movement. Go back where you belong, 
selling newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 DAN MORIARITY, Calabasas 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With no left-handed pitchers to speak of, I guess it made sense for the 
Dodgers to have fired a left-handed pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there some lefties among these young players Fred Claire has referred to, 
or does he expect to go through another season with only right-handed pitchers? 
</P>
<P>
 ANTHONY GARAVENTE, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Fred Claire fired Ron Perranoski because he is too old to relate to the 
oncoming young pitchers, why didn't he fire Tom Lasorda, using the same 
reasoning? Or, for that matter, himself?

GOLF ROUNDUP; ELKINGTON GLADLY ASSUMES THE TOP SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Elkington shot his second consecutive six-under-par 66 Friday for a 
three-shot lead halfway through the Buick Southern Open in Pine Mountain, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Elkington held his lead over fellow Australian Steve Rintoul, who shot 65, and 
Steve Lamontagne, who shot 69. 
</P>
<P>
 First-round leader Todd Barranger skied to a 77 for a 142 total. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in all positions," Elkington said. "In front's always the best 
place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Elkington, regaining his form after being bothered by sinus problems and 
hepatitis earlier this year, was at 12-under 132. 
</P>
<P>
 He played a bogey-free round, falling in love with a new big-headed driver he 
said he would have tossed in a lake had there been one on the ninth hole in the 
first round when he sprayed his tee shots all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played really good," he said. "I'm driving the ball long and straight. I've 
hit so many greens that I haven't had the chance to get in any trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Azinger made his first cut since undergoing cancer surgery in December, 
shooting a 70 after his opening 71. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion John Inman was among those missing the cut, finishing 
75-148. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stockton birdied eight of his first 11 holes in a nine-under-par 63 that 
set the competitive course record at Tanglewood in the first-round of the 
Vantage Championship in Clemmons, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stockton's round, which included nine birdies, didn't give him much 
breathing room as 46 of 78 players were under par on the third lowest 
opening-round scoring day of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Murphy is at 64, with five others at 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton, who has won three times in 1994, set the course mark by one shot. 
The previous record was held by six golfers, including Jim Colbert and DeWitt 
Weaver last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Amateur Ron Morgan shot a 63 in 1978 while playing with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lightly regarded Pearl Sinn shot a two-under-par 70 to stretch her lead to 
four strokes after two rounds of the $500,000 LPGA Heartland Classic in St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinn, from UCLA, had a two-day total of seven-under 137. Four strokes back 
were Julie Larsen, Colleen Walker, Deb Richard and Liselotte Neumann. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paced by another record-breaking round by Wendy Ward, the three-woman United 
States squad stretched its lead to eight strokes in the World Amateur Team 
Championships in Saint-Quentin-En-Yvelines, France. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, the U.S. Amateur champion, smashed the course record for the second day 
in a row, firing a five-under-par 67 over the 5,858-yard French National 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 The American squad, looking for its 12th title in 16 tournaments, finished the 
third round at nine-under-par 423. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Spain tied for second with Australia, both at 431, and 
France was at 432.

MAVERICKS LOOK FORWARD TO KIDD STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAIME ARON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beyond all the hype, Jason Kidd looked like any other rookie during his first 
few workouts with the Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
 He hung on every word from coach Dick Motta, then repeatedly double-checked 
his duties with the assistant coaches to make sure he got it all. 
</P>
<P>
 When he ran the offense, Kidd appeared hesitant. It was as if he were waiting 
for his mind to tell his body where to look, what to do and when to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 For 90 minutes, he went through those motions. Not once did he look one way 
and pass the ball the other direction. He hardly even did anything as fancy as 
dribble between his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the Jason Kidd that has been making highlight films since high 
school? The same one who turned the University of California back into a 
basketball force? 
</P>
<P>
 Without a doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just that, for now, he's putting aside some of the flash to make sure he 
gets down all the fundamentals he needs to one day become a great pro, maybe 
even as good as or better than his idol Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked very hard to get to this point," said Kidd, who officially debuts 
when training camp opens Oct. 7. "The time has come. A lot of people have been 
talking about it for a long time and now they can stop talking and see what I'm 
capable of doing at this level. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm just trying to learn the different plays," Kidd said. "It's 
more of a decision, where I have to be and who I pass to. In time, that will 
all disappear I'll know exactly where to go with the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks knew exactly where they wanted to go when lottery Ping-Pong 
balls gave them the second pick in this summer's draft. 
</P>
<P>
 They practically salivated at the chance to take Kidd, then made him the first 
of the top eight picks under contract when he signed a $54 million, nine-year 
contract Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 While his basketball ability never was in doubt, Kidd's character became the 
big issue between the lottery and draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Over those five weeks, Kidd was involved in a hit-and-run accident that he 
fled on foot, was accused of slapping a woman, and the mother of his child sued 
for increased child support. 
</P>
<P>
 His summer got worse when he was caught in a controversy over his desire to be 
a Maverick. Motta said Kidd promised to be at the first minicamp, yet Kidd 
skipped it because he wasn't under contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "God has tested me to see how I handled it because I've been blessed with 
great success," he said. "So then He wanted to see how I handled the negative 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I withstood the storm," Kidd said. "It goes along with the 
territory of being a person who's looked upon not just in your community but 
across the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The nation has been looking upon the 6-foot-4, 215-pound Kidd since his high 
school days at St. Joseph in Alameda, Calif., and especially when he 
kick-started the Cal program and led it to the last two NCAA tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Mavericks were becoming the worst team in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas hopes to have the last laugh now by parlaying their failure into a 
nucleus of Kidd, Jamal Mashburn and Jim Jackson. Team officials have made no 
secret that they expect Kidd to pull it all together. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's more of a creator and a true point guard than anyone I've had," said 
Motta, about to enter his record 23rd season as an NBA coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were going over one of the plays in a controlled situation, I heard 
Jason say, 'I draw up the plays for all positions.' It was just a statement. 
But I don't know of many 21-year-old guys who would do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing few of Kidd's peers can match is some of the company he's kept 
in the offseasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He's already played with or against Johnson, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen 
and other NBA superstars, making him one of the least-awed rookies around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'm intimidated, but I still have butterflies going out there 
because it's a new situation. I think a lot of people will definitely come at 
me hard because of all the attention I've received," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd isn't burdening himself with pressure. Although he knows a lot of people 
are counting on him and he wants to deliver, he also wants to have fun while 
learning the league and his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of people expect me to pick up where I left off in college," 
said Kidd, who led the nation last season with 9.1 assists per game. "The 
people who know the game know it's a learning experience, especially your first 
time around." 
</P>
<P>
 Motta said he figures it will take Kidd at least two years and maybe even 
three before he's really comfortable in the NBA. Motta used the development of 
New Jersey's Kenny Anderson and Seattle's Gary Payton as examples. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Mavericks don't want to wait. They've already put up billboards 
advertising "The New Kidd in Town," and he's signed a lucrative deal with Nike. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd says he hasn't spent much of his newfound riches. He did donate $46,000 
to a Dallas church to install a basketball court for a midnight league, and he 
plans to build houses in Dallas and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited," Kidd said. "I'm glad to be here and I'm happy to be in the city 
of Dallas. They've welcomed me with open arms and I want to show that this team 
is ready to play."

CARSON HOLDS OFF CRENSHAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carson High came within inches of the first 0-4 football start in school 
history Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing fourth down and one at the Crenshaw 17-yard line with 2:06 remaining, 
Carson made a first down by less than a foot on a run by senior Joseph Redmond 
to keep its winning drive alive. 
</P>
<P>
 On Carson's next play after an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against 
Crenshaw, Redmond scored from eight yards out to give the Colts their first 
victory, 21-20, in a Southern Pacific Conference game at Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1:51 left, Crenshaw tried to rally and drove to the Colts' 31-yard line. 
The Cougars' hopes, however, ended when a pass bounced off the hands of 
receiver Kirk Oliver into the arms of Redmond with 1:10 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a good game, but we just had some bad breaks," Crenshaw Coach Robert 
Garrett said. "On our last drive, we knew that we were either going to score (a 
touchdown) or move in close enough for a field goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw (2-2) -- which outgained Carson in total offense, 380 yards to 242 -- 
took a 6-0 first-quarter lead on a 10-yard run by Ferrel Payton. Carson 
responded later in the quarter when Llewelyn Miller caught a screen pass from 
Ramon Rogers and scored a touchdown from 40 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless second quarter, Carson appeared to take control when Patrick 
McCall, who finished with 85 yards in 12 carries, scored on a 14-yard run to 
give the Colts a 14-6 lead with 3:50 remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With it's passing game struggling, Crenshaw turned to backup quarterback Ricky 
Lumford and its running attack behind linemen Romeo McCain, Earl Lillie, Todd 
Moore, Terry Warren and Willie Brown. It paid off with Brandon Seals scoring on 
a nine-yard run. The Cougars tied the score on a pass from Lumford to Kabeer 
Smith for the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw recovered a squib kickoff and three plays later scored when Lumford 
threw a 36-yard touchdown pass to Rashard Magee with 7:44 remaining.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since hitting the jackpot in his first stakes, the Louisiana Derby, 
Kandaly has spent a long season collecting consolation prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kandaly will try to snap a six-race losing streak today in the $750,000 Super 
Derby XV at Louisiana Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning line isn't exactly bubbling at his chances: He's the 8-1 fifth 
choice in the field of eight 3-year-olds going 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-1 favorite in the Grade I race is Soul Of The Matter, the winner of the 
San Felipe Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meadow Flight, winner of the Flamingo Stakes and the Pennsylvania Derby, is 
listed as the second favorite at 5-2 in the Grade I race for 3-year-olds at 1 
1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern, the Arkansas Derby winner, is at 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Kandaly has earned money in each of his 10 races. Even during his losing 
streak, he earned $146,190.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS MIXED AT QUARTER'S END; DOW OFF 11; MARKETS: BOND 
YIELDS EASE, BUT ANALYSTS SAY AN 8% TREASURY RATE IS POSSIBLE SOON. WALL STREET 
FEARS STOCKS' REACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite soaring interest rates, stocks posted surprising gains in the third 
quarter that nearly offset first-half losses -- and raised the tenor of the 
debate over what happens next.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which rocketed in late summer to within a 
stone's throw of its all-time high, eased 11.44 points to 3,843.19 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a selloff in the last two weeks, the Dow still finished up 218.23 
points, or 6%, for the quarter and now is up 2.4% for the year to date -- even 
as long-term bond yields hover just below 27-month highs, waiting for the 
economy's next move. 
</P>
<P>
 Some broader market indexes posted bigger gains in the quarter. The Nasdaq 
composite index of mostly smaller stocks jumped 8.3%, recouping most of its 
first-half loss and leaving it down just 1.6% for the year so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, analysts say the distraction of rising interest rates may have caused 
many investors to lose track of how powerful a recovery stocks enjoyed in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the split performances of U.S. stock and bond markets in the summer also 
are Wall Street's greatest source of anxiety today. Unlike in winter and 
spring, when stocks dove as interest rates jumped, share prices rallied in the 
third quarter even as rates pushed higher. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 30-year Treasury bond yield at 7.81% on Friday, up from 7.61% at the 
end of the second quarter and 6.35% at Jan. 1, many analysts believe that a few 
more reports of strong economic growth could be enough to push the bond yield 
to 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 That could happen in tandem with the next Federal Reserve Board move to raise 
short-term interest rates, which some economists believe may occur even before 
the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's fear is that another surge in bond yields will spark a renewed 
plunge in stocks, in part because institutional investors may decide to sell 
stocks and buy bonds should yields hit the psychologically important 8% level. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guess is that the whole world is making reservations to dine on an 8% 
long bond yield," said William Dodge, market strategist at Dean Witter in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 A jump in yields could punch the Dow down as low as 3,550, Dodge said. That 
would be an 8% decline from Friday's close. 
</P>
<P>
 David Shulman, strategist at Salomon Bros. in New York, believes the market is 
already in the midst of a sharper pullback on the order of 10% to 12%. The fact 
that it's October, a month with a nasty reputation for hosting market crashes, 
won't help investor psychology in the short run, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some pros believe the fourth quarter will bring a rally rather than a 
dive, precisely because so many people expect trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm bullish," says Ron Elijah, who has steered the Robertson Stephens Value 
Plus stock mutual fund to a 15% rise this year. Recent reports of continued 
economic strength "are ancient history," he said. Investors "are missing the 
point -- the economy is slowing down," he contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Once that becomes apparent in the fourth quarter, he said, "the bond market 
will get better" and stocks will enjoy a "relief" rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Other money managers believe that healthy third-quarter corporate earnings 
reports will have the same positive effect on stocks this fall that strong 
second-quarter reports had in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Wall Streeters warn that, given the market's flat performance so far 
this year, it isn't clear whether stocks are forming a base from which a new 
rally will spring or a top that will give way to a bona fide bear market. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets, third-quarter action was mixed: 
</P>
<P>
 * Major European markets failed to follow Wall Street higher. Frankfurt's DAX 
index was off 0.7% for the quarter and remains down 11.2% for the year. 
London's FTSE 100 stock index, which jumped 33.8 points to 3,026.3 on Friday 
and gained 3.7% for the quarter, is still off 11.5% for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many Asian and Latin American markets resurged in summer, after plummeting 
with U.S. shares in the first half. Mexico City's Bolsa index rose 28.6 points 
to 2,746.11 on Friday, bouncing back from a mid-week selloff that followed 
another political assassination. For the quarter, the Bolsa jumped 21.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tokyo stocks, the first half's global leaders, were hit by profit taking 
in the third quarter. The Nikkei index fell 51.31 points to 19,563.81 on Friday 
and was off 5.2% for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * In commodities trading, near-term gold futures closed at $394.20 on Friday, 
down $1 on the day. For the quarter, gold rose $8.40, or 2.2%, as the economy's 
resilience sparked new inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
 But the CRB index of 21 key commodities closed the quarter at 229.85, down 
marginally from 230.03 on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar jumped compared to the Japanese yen Friday on optimism about a 
U.S.-Japan trade pact before the midnight deadline. The dollar rose to 99.15 
yen in New York from 98.65 on Thursday, but it is only slightly above its July 
1 level of 98.50. U.S. Stocks: Good Quarter, Flat Year 
</P>
<P>
 Led by smaller stocks, Wall Street rallied briskly in the third quarter 
despite rising interest rates. But for the year to date most major U.S. stock 
indexes are down marginally, while foreign markets are mixed. Changes, in 
percent: 
</P>

DEVIL ON YOUR SHOULDER; SOUTHLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NEW WAVE OF ATM THIEVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Daniel Hebert couldn't get any money out of the automated teller machine 
at his local bank last month, he figured his misfortune was merely the result 
of "a plain old-fashioned mix-up." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, there was nearly $800 in his Bank of America account when he left 
for vacation a week earlier, and Hebert hadn't made any withdrawals or written 
any checks since. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he called the bank, he learned that while he had been relaxing at his 
parents' home in Delaware, his ATM card had been getting a workout across Los 
Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 A subsequent investigation by BofA determined that Hebert's card had been 
counterfeited. The bank refunded the money missing from his account. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't lose any cash, but my account got all screwed up, and I sure wasted 
a lot of time talking with bankers," said Hebert, a computer software salesman 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Although bank investigators and the Secret Service are still investigating the 
case, one thing is certain: Hebert is just one of hundreds or perhaps thousands 
of Southern California residents who've recently been victimized by a gaggle of 
high-tech bandits now working the region.  
</P>
<P>
 "ATM fraud tends to move around the country in waves, and I guess maybe the 
crooks have decided that Southern California is the best place to be right 
now," said Dominick Albano, a spokesman for the California Bankers Assn. in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ATM crime wave is blamed on a clever breed of thieves whom 
law-enforcement agencies have dubbed "shoulder surfers." Some are rogue 
operators who work alone; others belong to sophisticated rings. 
</P>
<P>
 The scam begins when a consumer pulls out an ATM card to make a transaction at 
a bank or other ATM site, or to use the card at a "point-of-sale" machine at a 
gas station or store. 
</P>
<P>
 The thief casually peers over the victim's shoulder while the personal 
identification number is punched into the keypad, or zooms in on the PIN from 
across the parking lot with the help of a telescope or high-powered video 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the thief must get the customer's receipt, because it includes either 
the ATM card's serial number or the number of the bank account -- either of 
which can be used to manufacture a bogus card. Many consumers leave their 
receipts at the counter or toss them into a nearby trash can, making the 
crook's job all the easier. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of an easy-to-get "encoding" machine that makes magnetic strips, 
the thief then uses the PIN and data from the receipt to counterfeit a matching 
card and empty the unsuspecting cardholder's account. 
</P>
<P>
 Since withdrawals and purchases at most ATMs and point-of-sale machines are 
usually limited to between $200 and $500 a day, "shoulder-surfing" might seem 
like a lot of work for a relatively low payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials with the Secret Service -- which investigates fraud involving 
ATM cards and other "access devices" -- say a skilled surfer can easily 
counterfeit dozens of cards a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Multiply a few dozen or a few hundred cards by $300 or $500 a day each, and 
you're talking about some major money," said Special Agent Jim Bauer of the 
Secret Service's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
 The surfers can hit the same accounts on several consecutive days before the 
scam is detected, Bauer said. If the account balance falls too low, they can 
deposit bogus checks at the machines to artificially raise an account's balance 
and take out cash the victim's account doesn't really contain. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer said the Secret Service and a small number of other agencies have 
arrested about half a dozen shoulder surfer suspects in Southern California 
over the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of individual thieves are in business, Bauer said, as are "at least a 
few" rings. 
</P>
<P>
 When authorities broke up an elaborate operation based in an Orange County 
hotel room earlier this year, they arrested three men and confiscated about 500 
blank cards, magnetic strips, a telescope, two guns and $20,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say they don't know exactly how much money has been 
stolen by ATM thieves in the area, in part because most banks and retailers 
don't like to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would not be advantageous to let criminals know how much is available 
through this type of fraud . . . " said Bill Wipprecht, director of security at 
Wells Fargo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, we don't want to scare our customers and discourage them from using 
their cards. Overall, the chances of any one consumer falling victim to this 
type of fraud are very, very minimal." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason banks don't want to discourage the use of ATMs is that they collect 
more than $2 billion a year in fees from the use of the machines, and they save 
huge amounts more by not having to hire as many tellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some security experts say this reluctance to talk about the matter leads to a 
lack of awareness among consumers that fuels the fraud. But Wipprecht and other 
bank officials note that many institutions now regularly include a list of ATM 
safety tips in their monthly statements. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, some stores and other retailers are even redesigning or 
relocating their point-of-sale machines to make it harder for thieves to watch 
as customers punch in their PINs. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the pay-at-the-pump card-reading machines at some Arco stations 
-- where Hebert's PIN was apparently seen by a shoulder surfer -- are being 
lowered several inches to make it easier for consumers to block the keypads 
with their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several of our own (employees) have been hit by those guys," said John 
Lannan, president of Arco's electronic-payment operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to thwart thieves, a group of retailers and bankers recently 
asked regulators at the Federal Reserve Bank to change a requirement that they 
print customers' card or account numbers on the receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most banks are currently allowed to block out part of those numbers, 
there's still enough information on the printouts to keep a smart surfer in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 A Fed spokesman noted that some consumers want the numbers printed on their 
receipts to make it easier to balance multiple checkbooks or resolve disputed 
transactions. Although the Fed might eventually change the requirement, the 
changes would not take effect until next year at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, bankers and retailers say, a consumer's best defense against being 
wiped out by a surfer is to cover the keypad with a free hand as the PIN is 
being entered and to always take the receipt when the transaction is completed. 
Thwarting ATM "Shoulder Surfers" 
</P>
<P>
 While most consumers would never use an ATM machine if a stranger was lurking 
suspiciously nearby, they forget that they're equally vulnerable to "shoulder 
surfers" hoping to steal their personal identification numbers (PINs) and drain 
their accounts electronically. Here are some tips to thwart these latter-day 
bandits: 
</P>
<P>
 * Memorize your PIN, but don't write it down. Bankers say it's surprising how 
many consumers keep their number in their wallets -- or even write it on their 
card. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't choose an obvious number. Among the most common: "1-2-3-4." 
</P>
<P>
 * Always cover the ATM keypad when you punch in your number. Your card can't 
be counterfeited without your PIN. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never share your PIN with anyone. Not even bank employees or the police. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take your receipt with you. The numbers on the printout might not make sense 
to you, but a clever thief can use them to access your account. 
</P>
<P>
 One more note: If you're victimized by a shoulder surfer, under California law 
you are liable only for the first $50 if you report the theft immediately. Some 
banks will even waive the $50 to keep their customers happy.

GM ELECTRIC CAR CREATING A BUZZ AMONG DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since July, ordinary drivers in Southern California have been commuting to 
work in cars powered by sophisticated battery-powered systems -- and by all 
reports they like what they are driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Less clear is whether they would be willing to pay as much as $25,000 for an 
electric car whose range is so limited that it is likely to be used only for 
driving around town or commuting. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, more than three months into General Motor Corp.'s $32-million test 
program of its Impact car, virtually all the drivers have been surprised at and 
pleased with the performance, according to officials at GM and utilities in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband and I would buy one in an instant, assuming the price were 
reasonably comparable" to conventional vehicles, said Eileen Givens, the mayor 
of Glendale. "I had no idea it would drive like that -- very smooth, very 
powerful, a luxury car compared to my station wagon." 
</P>
<P>
 The GM test is the first market research based on the use of real cars for 
ordinary commuting. Other auto makers have run less-ambitious tests of vans and 
delivery vehicles for fleet use. 
</P>
<P>
 While Detroit has been deeply skeptical of the potential market for electric 
vehicles, it is nonetheless moving ahead to develop the cars for eventual sale 
to the public because of California's tougher air pollution rules. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1998, 2% of new cars offered in California showrooms by the largest U.S. 
and foreign auto makers must be emission-free. Given the current technology, 
these will almost certainly be electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison Co. and the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power are administering the Los Angeles tests along with GM engineers. The 
utilities are preparing to provide the infrastructure to recharge electric 
vehicles in what they hope will be a major transportation shift that could 
generate huge new revenues for them. 
</P>
<P>
 By December, a total of 80 ordinary commuters will have a chance to take the 
car home in Southern California. So far, 11 volunteer drivers have tried the 
sporty two-seater, along with dozens of public officials and utility 
executives. The cars are also being tested in Phoenix, and tests begin next 
week in San Francisco, with nine more U.S. cities to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the only glitches have been a paper cup full of root beer that fell 
into an instrument panel (which had to be cleaned) and a mouse that chewed up 
the leather upholstery in one of the prototype cars, utility officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Impact draws stares on the highway for its distinctive shape, and a lot of 
questions whenever it's parked. One of the first is price. 
</P>
<P>
 Though GM once estimated that it could market an Impact for $20,000, it is now 
hinting at a price closer to $25,000. The auto maker has not said whether it 
would market the Impact or a different electric car, or when the first car 
would be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler has said it expects to market an electric minivan for $18,000 but 
would keep the price that low by spreading the development costs among 
conventional cars throughout its California fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Many who have driven GM's Impact said in interviews with The Times that 
$25,000 would be a reasonable sticker price. But not everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a middle-class guy," said Bob Ercek, a certified public accountant in 
Lancaster, as he pulled a pocket calculator out while his Impact was recharging 
at a small restaurant on the Angeles Forest Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 After factoring in utility estimates of lower maintenance and operating costs, 
Ercek figured he would be willing to pay as much as $21,000 for a car that has 
a range of 70 to 90 miles, can travel 80 m.p.h and will accelerate from 0 to 60 
m.p.h. in 8.5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the looks are fantastic," he said.

STATE FARM RAISES QUAKE LOSS TALLY TO $2 BILLION; INSURANCE: FIRM IS FIFTH 
MAJOR CARRIER TO HIKE ITS FIGURE RECENTLY. EXPERTS SAY THE TOTAL DAMAGE IS 
LIKELY TO EXCEED $10 BILLION. 
</P>

<P>
 State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. on Friday added $500 million to its 
estimate of losses from the Northridge earthquake, pushing its total to $2 
billion and raising the likelihood that industrywide losses from the Jan. 17 
catastrophe will exceed $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm, the largest property-casualty insurer in California and the United 
States, is the fifth major carrier to sharply raise its loss total in recent 
days. State Farm's losses alone are now more than twice the $960 million in 
total insured damage caused by the 1989 Loma Prieta temblor, the so-called 
World Series earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean F. Mooney, senior vice president of the Insurance Information Institute, 
said he expects total insurance damage for the Northridge quake to reach $10 
billion to $12 billion. That would still be short of the record $15.5 billion 
caused by Hurricane Andrew, which devastated Florida and Louisiana in 1992, but 
Mooney said it raises darker fears about the future of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message that the industry received from Northridge was that we have way 
underestimated the impact of a major catastrophe," he said. "The industry was 
equipped to handle this, but not a $50-billion catastrophe, and now it's a lot 
more realistic to envisage a $50-billion one." 
</P>
<P>
 Mooney, an economist, noted that until Hurricane Hugo in 1989, the industry 
had never recorded a $1-billion catastrophe. "Since then we've had six," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its competitors, State Farm said massive amounts of hidden damage are 
only now coming to light during the rebuilding process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more you do to repair what you thought was damaged, the more damage you 
uncover," State Farm spokesman Bill Sirola said. "They go in to redo a wall and 
they find out that the foundation is cracked and split." 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate Insurance Co., No. 2 in the market, lifted its loss figure to $1.3 
billion on Thursday, up $350 million. Earlier, Safeco Insurance Co., 20th 
Century Insurance Co. and TIG Insurance Co. substantially raised their 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers Insurance Group, third-largest in California, has no plans to update 
the $1.3-billion loss estimate it released last month, Vice President Jeffrey 
Beyer said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm said the number of claims it has received -- about 111,000 -- has 
not increased much since the company released its $1.5-billion loss estimate in 
midsummer. However, the severity of the claims has risen dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate has had a slightly different experience. Spokesmen for the company 
said it is receiving a steady stream of new claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would new claims arrive more than eight months after the quake? One reason 
is that earthquake policies typically carry deductibles of 10% of coverage 
limits, meaning the first $10,000 or $20,000 or more comes out of the 
homeowner's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers who thought the damage fell below their deductible might put off 
repairs for some months while trying to line up financing. Only later, when 
construction began and additional damage was discovered, would they file a 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor driving damage estimates upward has been the steadily rising 
costs of building materials -- particularly wood products -- and labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mooney said damage to commercial buildings has accounted for only about 5% of 
the claims so far but about 25% of the losses, in dollar terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry's official catastrophe loss figures are prepared by the Property 
Claims Services unit of American Insurance Services Group. Gary Kerney, 
director of disaster claims services, said the group is compiling a new survey 
of 50 to 60 insurers and will release an updated tally next week. Kerney said 
it will far exceed the current estimate of $7.2 billion, but he declined to 
speculate beyond that.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS MIXED AT QUARTER'S END; BOND PRICES UP; MARKETS: DOW 
CLIMBS AS MUCH AS 20 POINTS BEFORE FALLING BACK. YIELDS RETREAT ON HOPES FOR A 
U.S.-JAPAN ACCORD.

<P>
 Stocks ended the quarter on a mixed note Friday after computerized selling 
strategies buffeted the Dow Jones industrial average in the final half-hour of 
trading, causing the average to register its second straight decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue-chip indicator of 30 big-name stocks closed at 3,843.19, down 11.44. 
</P>
<P>
 The average had been up as much as 20 points in the afternoon, boosted by the 
second consecutive day of upbeat economic news and encouraged by a firming bond 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock prices were also driven higher early in the session as investors bought 
some star performers to add to their portfolios before the end of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Portfolio managers "need to look good for the quarter" in their reports to 
investors, said Trude Latimer, a stockbroker at Ferguson Andrews in 
Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-market indexes outperformed the Dow average and ended the day higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE composite index rose 0.37 points to 255.52. The Standard & Poor's 
500-stock index rose 0.45 points to 462.69. The Nasdaq composite index of 
mostly smaller companies rose 4.95 points to 764.29. At the American Stock 
Exchange, the market value index rose 2.34 points to 458.81. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the last-minute selloff in the Dow, advancing issues outnumbered 
decliners by about 3 to 2 on the NYSE. Big Board volume totaled a moderate 
291.94 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term bond yields retreated as investors held out hope that the United 
States and Japan would meet a weekend deadline for settling a trade dispute. 
Shorter-term securities ended mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year bond yield rose early in the day but turned around to close at 
7.81%, down from a 2 1/4-year high of 7.84% on Thursday. Its price was up 5/16 
point, or $3.13 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparking the retreat was a report of a U.S.-Japan agreement that could open up 
some Japanese government contracts to American companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, by Japan's Kyodo News Service, was denied by the Clinton 
Administration. But heightened hopes for a deal helped bonds retain most price 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that Americans' spending rose 0.9% 
in August, the largest increase since February and slightly above analysts' 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also said personal income rose 0.4% in August but failed to 
keep pace with spending, suggesting that this year's interest rate increases 
have not been enough to discourage consumers from borrowing to finance 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the numbers indicate a slightly more robust economy than they 
had expected. The data substantiates Thursday's reports of unexpectedly large 
increases in August new home sales and in the nation's second-quarter gross 
domestic product, and of a drop in initial unemployment claims last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's data sent the Dow down 23 points as investors feared that it would 
prompt the Federal Reserve Board to increase interest rates a sixth time this 
year in an effort to head off inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 While Friday's reports did nothing to change that view, portfolio managers 
focused instead on recovering bonds and on adding high-performing stocks to 
their holdings before they issue quarterly reports to their investors. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a renewed interest in cyclical stocks, which had taken a beating 
earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip Morris rose 1 1/8 to 61 1/8. It said it was in talks on the sale of 
its Kraft Food Service business. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Mills gained 1 1/8 to 57 3/4 and Kellogg rose 1 5/8 to 57 3/8 on a 
"buy" recommendation by Morgan Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pillowtex, maker of bed pillows, mattress pads and other textiles, fell 1 
3/4 to 13 1/8 after saying its third-quarter earnings would fall short of Wall 
Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retailer Nordstrom gained 1 1/4 to 40. Bear Stearns upgraded the stock to 
"buy" from "hold," citing expectations of strong sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto stocks recovered after losing ground Thursday amid fears of higher 
interest rates. Chrysler rose 3/4 to 44 7/8 after the company said it would 
increase its capital spending. General Motors rose 1/8 to 46 7/8 after the 
company reached a tentative pact to end a United Auto Workers strike. Ford rose 
1/4 to 27 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stocks ended mixed. Germany's 30-share DAX average ended at 2,011.75, 
down 31.83 points, while London's Financial Times 100-share average closed 33.8 
points higher at 3,026.3. In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average finished down 
51.31 points at 19,563.81. Mexico City's Bolsa index gained 28.6 points to 
close at 2,746.11. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade optimism boosted the dollar against the Japanese yen, increasing the 
allure of dollar-denominated instruments such as Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar was quoted at 99.15 yen, up from 98.65 on Thursday and 
at 1.552 German marks, up from 1.549. U.S. Stocks: Good Quarter, Flat Year 
</P>
<P>
 Led by smaller stocks, Wall Street rallied briskly in the third quarter 
despite rising interest rates. But for the year to date most major U.S. stock 
indexes are down marginally, while foreign markets are mixed. Changes, in 
percent: 
</P>
<P>
 Nasdaq composite: 3rd quarter: +8.3% Year to date: -1.6%

GM AND UNION REACH TENTATIVE STRIKE ACCORD; LABOR: THE AGREEMENT WOULD END A 
FOUR-DAY WALKOUT THAT STOPPED THE FLOW OF PARTS TO MANY OF THE AUTO MAKER'S 
PLANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative 
agreement Friday to end a four-day-old strike that stopped the flow of parts 
critical to keeping many GM plants running. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12,000 workers at GM's Buick City complex in Flint walked out Tuesday in 
a dispute that focused attention on manufacturer use of overtime instead of new 
workers to meet rising demand in the growing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The union contended GM was endangering workers' health and safety by running 
plants flat-out and scheduling employees to work many more hours than the usual 
40-hour week. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the tentative agreement, GM will hire more workers for the Flint plants, 
drawing from a pool of former GM employees who were laid off years ago and have 
lost normal recall rights, said Dave Yettaw, president of UAW Local 599. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not divulge details of the deal, but given the size of the work force 
and the nature of the dispute, it seemed likely that hundreds of hires might be 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The local is the UAW's largest at GM. The Buick City complex assembles large, 
front-drive sedans and produces V6 engines, transmission torque converters, 
springs and other suspension components. 
</P>
<P>
 GM would not comment on the proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Several facilities have run short of those parts, which are delivered on a 
"just-in-time" basis to the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
 GM's assembly plants in Lansing, Mich., and Linden, N.J., have halted 
production, while production of automatic transmissions in Warren and 
Ypsilanti, Mich., has been cut back. In all, more than 22,000 hourly workers 
were idled. 
</P>
<P>
 If union members vote to accept the tentative agreement at a meeting today, 
some production might resume Sunday in Flint, but the interruption in the flow 
of parts to other plants will take several days to rectify. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible, and certainly almost likely, that we're going to have a few 
more plants affected by this," GM spokesman John Shea said. "It's going to be 
several days before all of our plants have resumed normal operations." 
</P>
<P>
 One key in reaching the tentative agreement was the involvement of UAW Vice 
President Stephen Yokich, who kept in touch with bargainers in Flint and talked 
Thursday evening with GM President Jack Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Yokich said the same problem is affecting many other GM plants, and he wants 
to persuade GM to recall more laid-off workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from Wall Street, shareholders and competitors, the auto maker 
has eliminated 52,000 hourly jobs since 1991 to boost productivity and profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative settlement had a negligible impact on GM stock, which rose 12.5 
cents a share Friday to close at $46.875.

 Producers Entertainment Group Losses Widen: The Beverly Hills-based TV 
production company, which produces the CBS sitcom "Dave's World," reported 
losses of $5.4 million on revenue of $10.7 million for the fiscal year ended 
June 30.PEG said losses stemmed in part from non-cash charges, write-downs and 
amortization of film costs totaling $4.5 million. In the previous year, PEG 
lost $4.2 million. The company said its fiscal 1993 losses were restated to 
reflect the purchase of DSL Productions.

 Court Rebuffs 20th Century on Proposition 103: The California Supreme Court 
has refused 20th Century Industries' request to reconsider an Aug. 18 decision 
upholding Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's rules for enforcing 
Proposition 103. The court's refusal to review its 7-0 ruling means that 
Woodland Hills-based 20th Century still owes $119 million in rebates to 
policyholders under the 1988 insurance rollback initiative. A spokesman said 
20th Century has not decided whether to appeal its defeat to the U.S. Supreme 
Court and that it is continuing discussions with the Insurance Department about 
a possible settlement.

PHILIP MORRIS CONFIRMS KRAFT UNIT IS FOR SALE; CONSUMER GOODS: THE FOOD SERVICE 
DIVISION IS EXPECTED TO FETCH BETWEEN $600 MILLION AND $800 MILLION.

 Philip Morris Cos., following through on its new leadership's promise to 
streamline, is in talks to sell its Kraft Food Service unit, the company 
confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to news reports, Philip Morris confirmed it is in talks with one 
party to sell the division. It declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts with knowledge of the talks said the sale price would be between $600 
million and $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The food and tobacco firm's stock rose $1.125 a share to close at $61.125 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was 3.53 million shares, making it the 
eighth-most-active U.S. issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Two analysts said that in addition to those talks, Philip Morris is close to 
selling smaller food units, perhaps including smaller brands and frozen food 
operations, for $100 million to $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One analyst said the total divestitures by the end of October will reach $700 
million to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The food service business, acquired when Philip Morris bought Kraft in 1989, 
was cobbled together from local acquisitions. It has about $4 billion in annual 
revenue and profit of about $60 million, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysts said the buyer is likely to be an investment firm, not a food 
company. The food service unit is the second-largest in the fragmented 
industry, behind Sysco Corp., but it has a market share of less than 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Black, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said Wall Street 
reacted positively to the news not so much because of the reported price, but 
because the sale would show that management is committed to higher returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The food service business probably has a margin of roughly 1.5%, analysts 
said, far lower than Philip Morris' food manufacturing or cigarette operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really the indirect effect -- it shows they're using cash wisely," said 
Black, whose company owns more than 10 million Philip Morris shares. "One of 
the risks to this company is always that it could take its cash flow and do 
something stupid with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Black said the company has also talked about putting Kraft's macaroni and 
cheese unit up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is, you'll see most of the cash flow (from the coming sales) 
redeployed in international confectionery, international drinks and maybe 
international bakery," he said.

 Settlements Reached in Alleged Health Insurance Scam: Three insurance 
companies and about 175 brokers and agents have agreed to settlements totaling 
more than $7 million to be paid to victims of an alleged health insurance 
scam.About 10,000 consumers nationwide bought worthless health plans through 
Consolidated Local 867, which prosecutors have called a sham labor union. The 
consumers, now plaintiffs in a federal class-action lawsuit in New York, 
reached the settlements over the last two weeks, their attorneys said. However, 
the operators of the alleged scam as well as other agents and brokers that sold 
the policies remain defendants in the case, which is headed for trial in 
January. Attorneys said the victims lost an estimated $35 million.

COLORS VARY, BUT UNDER THE SKIN MULTICULTURAL DOLLS ALL STUFFED THE SAME; TOYS: 
NEW YORK COMPANY BRINGS DIVERSITY TO THE WORLD OF PLAYTHINGS, HOPING TO BUILD 
THE SELF-ESTEEM OF CHILDREN.

 When Jacob Miles was a child, his mother cut out pictures of African Americans 
and pasted them on dolls and toys to show him that all children could pretend 
to be, and really become, doctors, engineers and astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Miles' Cultural Exchange Corp. is producing playthings so today's children 
don't need those cutouts. Its dolls, toys and stuffed animals are made to look 
like the children playing with them, be they light-skinned or dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati-born Miles said the toys, for children from infancy to 8 years old, 
are designed to help them see themselves positively and to build self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cultural Exchange dolls not only look like real children but they do what 
real children do -- go to day-care centers, take picnics or visit the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dinkytown Daycare Kids, with names like Shanna, Calla, Kimmy, Koby and 
Deeto, come with books that describe their backgrounds. One Daycare Kid uses a 
wheelchair, which can be purchased separately. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Hounds, the pets "of the diverse kids of America," are 10- to 
15-inch-high toys with names like Shaneequa, Spike, Bitsy and Cuz. The Hounds 
are featured in puzzles, games and videos, including "Home is where the love 
is," and will have a television cartoon special this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles said they all have the faces of all of America's children: African 
American, Euro American, Asian American or Native American. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working not to be pigeonholed as an African-American toy company, but 
rather as a multicultural one," Miles said. The 2-year-old Minneapolis-based 
company defines its toys as not only multicultural but also based on principles 
of harmony and nonviolence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Its other products include the Spell 'n Learn Bus, Airplane Activity, Farm 
Activity and Electronic Phone. The children pictured on the toys are light- and 
dark-skinned. Its Soft Blanket Babies, for ages 6 months and up, also come in 
various skin tones. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately owned company is showing strong sales growth, Miles said. In its 
first year, Cultural Exchange had $660,000 in sales. It took in $2 million to 
$3 million this year and expects sales of around $8 million next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as becoming a buyout target for larger companies looking to expand 
their lines of multicultural toys, "we won't show up on radar screens until we 
hit the $25-million to $50-million level," Miles said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the toys are available in major retail stores including Target, 
Wal-Mart, Walgreen and Kay Bee Toys. Miles said Ames, Hills and Bradlees stores 
will be carrying the toys soon.

COACH HOUSE OWNER PLANS CLUB IN SANTA ANA; CONCERTS: VENUE AT THE FORMER RHYTHM 
CAFE SITE IS EXPECTED TO FEATURE MORE ETHNIC MUSIC WHEN IT OPENS IN 
MID-DECEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The owner of the Coach House concert club in San Juan Capistrano said Friday 
that he has taken over the former Rhythm Cafe, which briefly challenged the 
Coach House's hold on the local concert market early last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Folgner, who also owns the Ventura Theatre in Ventura, said that he has 
signed a 20-year lease for the vacant 550-seat building on Harbor Boulevard at 
Lake Center Drive. He would not disclose other terms of the lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Folgner plans to refurbish the premises and open the club in mid-December 
under a new name, which he hasn't chosen yet. The building has been vacant 
since February when the former operators were evicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The new club is expected to complement the highly successful Coach House by 
featuring ethnic acts that have not drawn well in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will allow me to buy the full range of entertainment," Folgner said in an 
interview Friday. He said that Latin jazz star Tito Puente and soul singers 
James Ingram and Patti LaBelle are examples of the type of acts he wants to 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, because some popular acts tour twice a year, Folgner said, he 
will be able to move them between the two clubs, which are 25 miles apart. He 
said he is negotiating with Eddie Money, Chris Isaak and Greg Allman to perform 
at his new site. 
</P>
<P>
 "This club will be a good addition to what I do: putting on concerts in Orange 
County," he said. Under separate operators, the Coach House and the Rhythm Cafe 
engaged in a sometimes destructive competition for the same acts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rhythm Cafe, at 3503 S. Harbor Blvd., was operated by a partnership called 
Musicsphere Entertainment in a brief run from late October, 1992, to mid-March, 
1993. The club booked such prestigious acts as B.B. King, the Neville Brothers 
and Los Lobos, but ran into stiff competition from the better-established Coach 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounting losses prompted Newport Beach developer Curt Olson, Rhythm's 
financial backer, to pull out. The landlord later allowed outside promoters to 
stage single events. Olson's partner, Michael Feder, tried unsuccessfully to 
line up new investors in subsequent months.  
</P>
<P>
 Among his remodeling chores for the building, Folgner will have to install 
sound and lighting equipment to replace the equipment owned by Musicsphere, 
which has removed its property. 
</P>
<P>
 Folgner already has been granted an entertainment license by Santa Ana and is 
seeking a liquor license.

LATINO ROLES STILL 'MIRED IN STEREOTYPES'; COMMENTARY: REPORTS ON THE CENTER 
FOR MEDIA AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS STUDY FOCUSED ON THE DECLINING NUMBER OF LATINOS 
ON TV, BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS THE ABSENCE OF POSITIVE PORTRAYALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The report itself was a stunner -- detailing the sorry state of Latinos as 
portrayed and employed on prime-time TV entertainment series. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it really be true: a decline from 3% to only 1% of all prime-time 
characters between 1955 and the early 1990s? Incredible. Outrageous. But, alas, 
documented. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent report from the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a Washington 
research firm, provoked a simple and obvious question: 
</P>
<P>
 Couldn't programmers read simple census returns about the growth of the U.S. 
Latino population? 
</P>
<P>
 But there is more. Amid all the facts, figures and condemnations, the report 
also disclosed a detailed, less-publicized but specific rundown of shows that 
featured Latino characters throughout the history of TV -- and how absurdly the 
broadcast industry has remained in a retarded state in this program area. 
</P>
<P>
 From "The Cisco Kid" and "Zorro" to "Chico and the Man," "Miami Vice" and 
"L.A. Law," the report paints a vivid picture of what should have been progress 
in the number of TV Latino actors and characters but hasn't turned out that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Hector Elizondo is in CBS' new medical series, "Chicago Hope." Yes, Rita 
Moreno is a regular in NBC's new Bill Cosby drama, "The Cosby Mysteries." Yes, 
Jimmy Smits is replacing David Caruso next month in ABC's "NYPD Blue." And, 
yes, Liz Torres is a regular on NBC's "The John Larroquette Show." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other examples here and there. John Mendoza starred in the NBC 
sitcom "The Second Half" last season. Series such as Fox's "Beverly Hills, 
90210" and NBC's "Hill Street Blues" have had regular Latino characters. Edward 
James Olmos was one of several major Latino characters in NBC's "Miami Vice." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the huge amount of Latino bad guys that TV's reality shows seem to 
focus on, all of these fictional characters -- and more -- are needed to 
provide some sort of reasonable balance. 
</P>
<P>
 For, as the Washington report says, Latinos on mainstream television still are 
"mired in the stereotypes of a previous generation. . . . Hispanics serve as 
window dressing. . . . Unfortunately, Hispanics have never played a significant 
role in television's debate over race relations." 
</P>
<P>
 Latino actor Ricardo Montalban, whose career spans the history of TV, says: 
"They (TV executives) are trying, but it's not good enough. We're a minority 
that's becoming a majority, and we're still unseen." 
</P>
<P>
 Montalban, who starred in "Fantasy Island" and plays an angel in a new 
syndicated series, "Heaven Help Us," says TV simply inherited "the image that 
Hollywood movies had created." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, we were the bandits or the indolent peon leaning against a 
tree, the thieves, maids, prostitutes or, on the other hand, that vapid thing 
called Latin lovers. And, in between, nothing. It was a terrible image. You 
never saw the great Latin artists or surgeons or architects." 
</P>
<P>
 Several times, the Latino community was roused in anger. One notable case was 
the notorious Frito-Lay commercial in the late 1960s -- the "Frito Bandito." As 
one report described it, the ad "utilized a gun-toting, serape-clad, unshaven 
Mexican cartoon character as the company's Hispanic character." The commercial 
was quickly yanked after protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Montalban said he spoke to a top executive of the company and asked him, "Why 
don't you make him the Frito Amigo, who is so wonderful that he has to share 
the chips with people?" 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Reyes, who later this month is coming out with a new book for research 
institutions, "Hispanics in Hollywood: A Film and Television Encyclopedia," 
released by Garland Publishing of New York, has a partial explanation of why 
the percentage of Latinos on TV was higher in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 He says that in addition to shows with a few high-profile TV Latinos, such as 
Desi Arnaz and the stars of "The Cisco Kid," there were a large number of 
Western series in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and that meant more work for 
Latino actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually they were not in leading roles," says Reyes. And, in those days 
before political correctness, "if the characters weren't clearly Latino, then 
Hispanics might play Native Americans or half-breeds." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes thinks the image of Latinos also was affected somewhat by "that bearded 
guy in fatigues in Cuba, Fidel Castro. All of a sudden, he was a threat. In 
numerous TV shows in those earlier years, another cliche emerged -- the 
American Anglo guy who goes down to some fictional Latin country and saves the 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 For Reyes, "one of the best portrayals of Mexican-Americans came out of the 
Western 'The High Chaparral,' " an NBC series "where the Mexican family was on 
equal footing with the Anglo family. It was a crucial series at the time 
(1967-71)." 
</P>
<P>
 Other pop TV figures that Reyes found positive included Elena Verdugo as the 
nurse in "Marcus Welby, M.D." and, surprisingly, Erik Estrada as a highway 
patrol officer in "CHiPs." 
</P>
<P>
 Although "CHiPs" was a shallow, lighthearted action show, Reyes notes that 
Estrada played a character who was "just a cop. He wasn't carrying any ethnic 
baggage with him. He lived in a nice apartment. He was a fantasy character that 
everybody could relate to, and Hispanic kids could take pride in that." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes has special affection for the late Latino star Freddie Prinze in "Chico 
and the Man," which ran from 1974-78: "His humor was able to transcend all 
audiences, like Cosby. If he had lived, he would have been like Eddie Murphy, 
gone on to make movies." 
</P>
<P>
 The report from the Center for Media and Public Affairs also cites some key 
television series with Latinos: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Man and the City" (1971-72), with Anthony Quinn as mayor of a Southwest 
city, derived "socially relevant plot lines from the barrio." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Barney Miller" (1975-82), "one of the most multicultural shows of the 
time," briefly featured male and female Latino cops, who "at least served to 
offset the Hispanic criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Miami Vice" (1984-89), "did attempt to show law-abiding Latinos mixed in 
with the criminal crop." 
</P>
<P>
 * The sitcom "a.k.a. Pablo" (1984), "despite its brief run . . . was one of 
the few (series) to deal explicitly with aspects of Latino culture." 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of other series have dealt with Latinos in prominent ways, but 
network commitment to presenting this significant segment of American society 
has, without doubt, been disgraceful.

POP BEAT: SEBADOH SPEAKS TO THE BRUISED SOULS OF SENSITIVE ROCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's more to Sebadoh than just warm fuzzy feelings and dulled ambition, but 
you'd never know it from some of the descriptions that have been applied to the 
band. From "sweet" to "lazy," the trio may never escape its title of sensitive 
slacker outfit. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Lou Barlow does sound like he's ready to cry when he sings all 
crackly-like about bad relationships. And when Jason Loewenstein takes the 
mike, it seems as if his screams will crumble into a pile of weepy frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 And, yes, some of the group's low-fidelity tunes do sound like bent music-box 
melodies that the band tape-recorded between re-runs of "Three's Company." But 
then again, that spontaneous emotion is half the beauty of this Amherst, Mass., 
band. 
</P>
<P>
 The other half of the Sebadoh appeal is great songwriting. The group's 
material is written by all three members (the interchangeable third members are 
Eric Gaffney and Bob Fay, with the latter currently on board), and is rooted in 
both sappy love songs and obnoxious hard-core tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 The mix has made Sebadoh sweethearts of underground rock, speaking to the 
bruised souls of sensitive rock geeks and pulling in more tough-skinned 
listeners with the initial appeal of harmonious feedback. The group -- whose 
Sub Pop Records release, "Bakesale," is currently the most played album on 
college and alternative rock radio stations around the country -- will be at 
the Roxy on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just a sensitive band," says Lou Barlow, who founded Sebadoh in 
1988 while he was still a member of the much acclaimed Dinosaur Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of other aspects in the music, too. We can be pretty bitter 
and male and aggressive. We're a heavy rock band, and a lot of people seem to 
miss that. We have a history of being a punishing live act, aggressive and raw 
and improvising a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the omnipresent slacker references, Barlow, 28, actually has some 
goals for Sebadoh, regardless if his motivation is jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I see a band I really dislike and see how popular they are, I'm always 
like, 'Man, if they can get that popular, Sebadoh can too.' " he says, 
lightheartedly. "It's just really a macho thing. Those are just some of the 
twisted goals I set for myself."  
</P>
<P>
 The band works that twisted philosophy. Sebadoh's discography is longer than 
Greg Allman's hair. Since 1988, Sebadoh and its various side projects have 
released 53 albums and singles (not including compilation albums) on every 
indie label imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the ton-o-Sebadoh stuff out there, the band still suffers 
comparisons to Dinosaur Jr., which Barlow left in 1989. But the musician openly 
bagged on Dino co-founder J Mascis in early Sebadoh songs, making the 
temptations to compare and contrast bands almost irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just has to be a reference point for people," says Barlow, who started 
his first band with Mascis in the mid-1980s. "It's funny though, those 
comparisons have waned, but I think we sound more like them than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Though "Bakesale" is highly touted, the fuzzy-wuzzy noise band isn't likely to 
replace R.E.M. as rock's sensitive mega band. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more popular we get, the more I realize how small we really are," says 
Barlow. "I see how far we have to go to really entertain the idea that we're a 
popular band. At this point, it's a cool underground thing that's pretty 
manageable. It makes me realize how much time it will take if we want to be a 
big band." 
</P>
<P>
 * Sebadoh plays on Friday at the Roxy, 9009 Sunset Blvd., 7:30 and 11 p.m. 
$10. (213) 276-2222.

CELEBRATING A CENTURY OF GAUMONT; MOVIES: THE REVERED FRENCH STUDIO IS THE 
FOCUS OF A NINE-WEEK RETROSPECTIVE PRESENTING HISTORIC, MODERN AND RARE FILMS.

 When Nicolas Seydoux, the man who runs Gaumont, looks around for that entity's 
peers, he doesn't see any. "We are dean of all the movie companies in the 
world," Seydoux says with not unnatural pride. "All the others have 
disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
 For though Americans like to think that everything to do with motion pictures 
had its beginnings over here, it was in Paris in early 1895 that the Lumiere 
brothers had the first public showing of a projected film. And just a few 
months after that, a young man named Leon Gaumont took over a company that sold 
photographic and optical equipment and, not surprisingly, renamed it after 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaumont was primarily interested in things technical, but when the making of 
films helped the sale of his equipment, that was OK with him. Now, 100 years 
and some 7,000 films later, a cross section of the massive oak that grew from 
that tiny seed will be on display over nine weeks at UCLA's Melnitz Hall in a 
remarkable series called "Gaumont Presents: A Century of French Cinema." 
</P>
<P>
 From the earliest of silent films to the most modern international 
co-productions, Gaumont has been such an active player it's considered the 
oldest continuously operating film studio in the world. Which is the reason for 
the program's 13-city tour, touching down in Los Angeles today through Dec. 3. 
"When you are a century old, when you have a major birthday," Seydoux explains, 
"of course you celebrate it." 
</P>
<P>
 With its familiar daisy logo and its chain of cinemas, Gaumont is an 
established brand name in France. "From the beginning," writes film historian 
Alan Williams, "they prided themselves on the technical quality of their films, 
but they have also been the most artistically oriented studio." 
</P>
<P>
 So although the Gaumont name is not exactly celebrated here, many of its films 
are, and this series is a chance to see all of them fully restored, with new 
prints and even newly written English subtitles. 
</P>
<P>
 A case in point is Jean Vigo, the influential poet of personal cinema who died 
in 1934 at age 29. Gaumont is especially proud of its association with him, and 
in addition to his classics, "Zero de Conduite" and "L'Atalante," two rarely 
screened shorts, "A propos de Nice" and "Taris et la natation" (Taris 
Swimming), will also be shown. 
</P>
<P>
 For audiences with still more modern tastes, the Gaumont series features 
everything from Eric Rohmer's restrained "Die Marquise von O" (The Marquise of 
O) to the sentimental "Cousin, Cousine" and Luc Besson's ultra-violent "La 
Femme Nikita." Also, for those who didn't get enough the last time around, the 
uncut, 192-minute version of Jean-Jacques Beineix's "Betty Blue" will unspool. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the true believers, however, the program's most awaited treasures are its 
silent films, an unprecedented chance to see films by people such as Emile 
Cohl, Leonce Perret and the legendary Alice Guy (later Guy-Blache) who have 
mostly been no more than names in history books until now. 
</P>
<P>
 A master of a whole variety of visual techniques, Cohl is considered the 
pivotal figure in the history of animation, the first person to see it as a 
form apart from mere visual trickery, and his playful and charming shorts still 
amuse today. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same program Sunday with Cohl is Leonce Perret's "Child of Paris," 
which was considered the discovery of the festival when it played in Manhattan 
recently. Made in 1913, two years before D. W. Griffith's "The Birth of a 
Nation," it was called "the most important French film of its time" by 
archivist Henri Langlois. "Child," the Dickensian story of a little girl 
without parents who gets repeatedly kidnaped and in general faces more perils 
than Pauline, is characterized by naturalistic acting and inventive visuals 
noticeably in advance of what anyone, even Griffith, was doing at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Alice Guy, though she did receive some recognition late in life, her 
key position in film history was for a long time underreported. More than being 
the first female producer-director, she established the Gaumont house style of 
filming in real locations and is a contender for the title of first person ever 
to make a fiction film, 1896's "The Cabbage Fairy." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she went to the United States in 1907, Guy had directed something 
like 300 films, including a complex "Life of Christ" and the charming "Sur la 
Barricade," in which a man's attempt to get some milk for his mother during the 
Paris Commune almost has dire results.  
</P>
<P>
 One of Guy's proteges, Louis Feuillade, was responsible for some of the most 
memorable of all silent filmmaking, ambitious multi-hour serials such as 
"Judex" and "Les Vampires" that were a sensation when they first appeared and 
that continue to delight audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Les Vampires," released in 1915-16, was banned for a time for being an 
"exaltation of evil" and is considered perhaps the first film to take that 
increasingly popular tack. Nominally the story of how a plucky reporter tracks 
down a criminal band that is intimidating all France, it is really more 
fascinated with the gang itself, a black-hooded and daring bunch that poisons, 
robs and terrorizes with impunity. And one of its leaders, the kohl-eyed Irma 
Vep (played by Musidora) was as bewitching as she was villainous. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though these films' French subtitles are fairly rudimentary, UCLA will provide 
a simultaneous verbal translation. Robert Israel will contribute organ 
accompaniment, and, as an extra inducement, the silents will be accompanied by 
Gaumont's celebrated newsreels, offering glimpses of Monet painting among 
Giverny's water lilies, a cigarette glued to his lips, and New York City 
motorcycle cops circa 1913 giving some of the world's first speeding tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same Oct. 27 bill with "La poison" is an exceptional work by a very 
different director, Robert Bresson's austere 1956 classic "Un homme condamne a 
mort s'est echappe" (A Man Escaped). The film, acclaimed by Francois Truffaut 
as "the most important film of the last 10 years," painstakingly delineates the 
imprisonment and plot to escape of a French resistance leader during World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a true story and told with Bresson's trademark purity and control, 
this film is totally involving because of its avoidance of any kind of 
deliberately dramatic effect. Made with extensive use of close-ups, a sober 
voice-over, Mozart's Mass in C minor and non-professional actors, "Escaped" is 
the best introduction to Bresson's demanding but exhilarating style and 
probably his masterpiece as well. With both this and the Guitry showing in the 
best prints available in this country since their original release, this is the 
one Gaumont night to go to if you're only going to one.

OPERA PACIFIC TO DO 'AIDA' SANS ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Pasles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, there will be no elephants on stage when Opera Pacific presents Verdi's 
"Aida" beginning Saturday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa 
Mesa. Or horses, or camels.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just lots of people," Opera Pacific general director David DiChiera confirmed 
Wednesday. "Animals are being seen less and less on stage these days. We have 
found that animal-rights groups are very uncomfortable now with the use of 
animals on stage. They want to know how the animal is being handled and 
treated, whether there is any undue stress to the animal. It's become an issue 
which never existed 10 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 That sensitivity was reflected when San Francisco Opera presented the U.S. 
premiere of Hans Werner Henze's opera, "Das Verratene Meer" in 1991. There is a 
scene in the opera in which a school gang kills and dissects a cat. 
</P>
<P>
 The SFO management added this note, in bold face and set off in a 
black-bordered box, after the plot synopsis: 
</P>
<P>
 "NOTICE: The kitten used in all performances of 'Das Verratene Meer' is at no 
time in any danger of mistreatment and is at all times under the supervision of 
a professional handler. At the appropriate moment in the opera, it is replaced 
by a prop, while the live kitten ends up safely backstage." 
</P>
<P>
 DiChiera said that people expect elephants in "Aida" simply "because of the 
Baths of Caracalla in Rome. So many Americans have seen 'Aida' there. 
Inevitably, they'll have (the hero) Radames coming in a procession led by 
several horses. The Nile Scene there has a camel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I've never seen an elephant in 'Aida.' I've seen horses, and I've 
seen a camel at Caracalla. Even in (the amphitheater in) Verona, the other 
biggie, I don't think I've even seen elephants." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for not employing animals in a production is that you don't 
always know what they'll do. "We did use a horse in the last 'Aida' we did here 
in 1988," DiChiera said. "We didn't have a mishap on stage, thank God." But 
he's quick to point out that the possibility exists: "You know the famous story 
about (conductor) Thomas Beecham? He was conducting a production of 'Aida,' I 
think. There was a horse on stage and he had a bowel movement, and Beecham 
said, 'Oh my, a critic.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason has to do with negotiating the animal around the set. "There is 
so much structure, in terms of sets," DiChiera said. "There is not that much 
room on stage. You need a lot of room for an animal. They don't walk through 
flats very easily, and the stage is very full, particularly now that we've 
found our fourth truck (which was stolen last weekend but recovered)." -- Chris

CUES FOR WORLD-CLASS GREATNESS; MAESTRA DIANA HALPRIN PLANS TO CALL ON HER 
EXPERIENCE TO TAKE O.C. CHAMBER ORCHESTRA TO HIGHER LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Chamber Orchestra's first concert under its new conductor 
takes place Sunday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, and there are bound to be 
burning questions on everybody's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Will there be changes in programming philosophy? New artistic goals? Ruffled 
feathers to be smoothed with the transfer of power? And, as a woman on the 
podium, will Diana Halprin face any special problems? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, she will. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the very superficial level, it's what the devil do you wear and why do I 
have to spend so much time worrying about it?" she said during an interview 
this week. "I love beautiful clothes, but you have no idea how many times I've 
heard the question -- what am I going to wear. That is the burning question on 
everybody's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like coming out with a big Macy's shopping bag." 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of that, and in addition to her baton, former concertmaster Halprin 
will come out with her violin for at least a portion of the program: She'll be 
serving as soloist in Beethoven's Violin Concerto with new concertmaster Joseph 
Goodman conducting (Goodman will continue as orchestra manager. Micah Levy, the 
orchestra's founding music director who left the post to pursue doctoral 
studies at the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, will 
stay on as principal guest conductor). Halprin will lead the orchestra in a 
Concertino No. 6 in E-flat Major ascribed to Baroque composer Carlo Ricciotti 
(1681-1758), and Mozart's Symphony No. 40 in G Minor. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the answer to the big question? 
</P>
<P>
 "Black, long, simple, a little bit of lace, and comfortable," the maestra said 
of her planned attire. "And black shoes -- flat, so I can be grounded during 
the monumental works of Mozart and Beethoven." 
</P>
<P>
 Now about those other questions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Re programming philosophy: "There won't be clever (program) titles. . . . We 
have many sophisticated people in our audience, others are tiptoeing in the 
classical world. I want to address a range of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Re ruffled feathers: "I'm having an absolutely benevolently wonderful reaction 
from all the musicians. I don't feel that I'm not a peer . . . I feel very much 
a peer." 
</P>
<P>
 Her artistic goals for the orchestra are lofty, to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been playing violin since the age of 3," she noted. "I've traveled a 
great deal, I've played with Karajan, Bernstein, Erich Leinsdorf, Zubin Mehta, 
and I believe I have a vision. I've had an intimate mental image, let me say, 
of greatness -- the honor and joy of experiencing firsthand what great 
musicianship is like. 
</P>
<P>
 "My aim and my comfort zone is to be as close to greatness as possible. 
World-class greatness, that's my goal. . . . That is where I want to take this 
orchestra. An organization is bigger than any one person, it has its own pulse, 
but I can offer the summation of my experience, which is considerable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It includes violin studies with Ivan Galamian from ages 5 to 18 at the Curtis 
Institute of Music and Juilliard School of Music; at age 7, she was the 
youngest soloist to have performed with the Philadelphia Orchestra. She studied 
conducting with Leon Barzin from 1970 to 1973 and conducted the New York 
Kammermusiker from 1968 to 1974 and the Columbia Chamber Orchestra from 1972 to 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barzin taught many great conductors, many of whom came to him on the q.t.," 
Halprin said. "He never took money for lessons -- you couldn't buy him, he 
never needed money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stick technique was the most valuable thing. Barzin made a study of 
Toscanini; he codified what Toscanini did. Toscanini was a great conductor 
whose stick technique sometimes failed him. A lot of the times it failed him, 
he would blow up at the orchestra. At least that's what Barzin said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of conductors, to give a cue on their right, will turn their backsides 
to the left. Barzin made sure our toes were always pointing forward. Everything 
had to come out of the stick. We practiced with the left hand in the pocket. 
You have to play the music with the baton, and every 16th note has to be there 
in a very clear way." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Halprin really believe that "world-class greatness" is possible here? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very small budget," she answered, "we need help, but we have the 
pool of musicians. We have a vision, we have a change and we have a joy. I 
think that this is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have musicians playing with us who play with us because of what this 
orchestra can be. A lot of musicians here work in the film business, but that 
doesn't necessarily sustain the soul. When you offer to sustain the spirit, you 
can attract a lot."

VOCAL UGLY DUCKLING NOW A SWAN; OPERA: SOPRANO MARIA GULEGHINA, WHO WILL SING 
THE TITLE ROLE IN 'AIDA' IN COSTA MESA, RECALLS EARLY DOUBTS ABOUT HER VOICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the age of 3, Maria Guleghina dreamed of being an opera singer. But as a 
child living in Odessa, Ukraine, her dream didn't bring her much joy. "Every 
time I sang, my friends laughed at me," Guleghina remembered over coffee 
recently. "I had such a large voice. They said, 'You sing like an elephant,' 
and I always cried." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father would soothe her and tell her not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father (a factory worker who died 12 years ago) had a beautiful voice," 
she recalled. "And my mother (a microbiology professor) also had a voice, but 
not big like mine. They always sang around the house. When I was ill, he would 
take me in his arms and sing Armenian songs for me, and my mother would take me 
in her arms and sing Ukrainian songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father's comforting words about her own singing turned out to be sound 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
 The soprano made her La Scala Opera debut as Amelia in Verdi's "Un Ballo in 
Maschera" in 1987 opposite Luciano Pavarotti. She sang Tosca opposite Placido 
Domingo last year and opposite Pavarotti in April, both at the Metropolitan 
Opera in New York. Beginning Saturday, she sings the title role in Verdi's 
"Aida" for Opera Pacific (alternating with Camellia Johnson). 
</P>
<P>
 And if Guleghina had doubts about making opera her career, her mother didn't. 
"One night, my mom had a dream and she said, 'Maria, in my dream, you made your 
debut at La Scala.' " So one day she marched the self-conscious teen-ager into 
the local conservatory for an audition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teacher asked me, 'What do you want to sing?' I said, 'I don't know.' And 
she said, 'Why do you come here?' I said, 'I don't know!' " 
</P>
<P>
 She sang "Edelweiss" and a Russian song "so loud, (the teacher) said, 'She can 
drink milk.' You know, in Russia, when people work in a very dangerous factory, 
the factory gives them milk, for their health. She said, 'Somebody will give 
you milk to help your voice.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Guleghina was enrolled in the conservatory, where she met her husband, Mark 
Guleghin, a bass-baritone. They got married when she was 15 and he was 17. "We 
were too young," she said. "Two children in the conservatory. But it's OK. In 
Russia, it's OK. We finish at school usually at 16 or 17, and after that, we're 
free." 
</P>
<P>
 Guleghina declined to give her age, although she said that from the age of 
their 14-year-old daughter, "you can calculate it. I'm old. Over 30." Their 
daughter dreams of going to Hollywood to be an actress, she said, raising her 
eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she and her husband sang the major roles together in Tchaikovsky's 
"Yevgeny Onegin" at the conservatory, basically it has been her career that has 
taken off and he now takes the role of her beloved "teacher and coach," she 
said, beaming. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marrying Guleghin, she became a Baptist, converting from the Russian Orthodox 
faith, because he and his family are Baptists. In doing so, she learned how his 
family suffered persecution because of their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband's grandfather was sent to Siberia for this, for 10 years," she 
said. "At that time, around 1933-35, someone came to the house and asked him, 
'Do you read the Bible with your children?' He said, 'Yes.' 'Do you sing hymns 
with your children?' 'Yes.' 'OK. Ten years.' It was terrible. When he came out, 
'rehabilitated,' he was a broken man. He died soon after. That is why I love 
America. America saved our family. We came to California as refugees." 
</P>
<P>
 But California is not yet exactly "home" yet. "My home? Oh, I don't know," 
Guleghina said. "It's a very difficult question. It depends on my work. I have 
a house in Russia. I have a new house in Hamburg. I have a house in Sacramento, 
where the parents of my husband live, but they're my parents also. I don't 
know. Maybe, when I will be old, I don't know, I will live only in America." 
</P>
<P>
 She has sung Aida before, but in a radical production at the Hamburg State 
Opera. "There were no Egyptians," she said. "No Ethiopians. Aida was white (not 
black). It was in contemporary dress. I sang in jeans because Aida was a 
military aide. It was a completely different character. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I would like to be the (traditional) 'flower of the Nile.' I will try to 
be very soft and very feminine. I will try to change. Two years, I sang Aida 
like this," she said, aiming an imaginary rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Vocally, she said, the role is "very hard because Verdi wrote the first and 
second acts for a dramatic soprano and the third and fourth acts for a very 
light soprano, really for a different type of voice. But I don't need to change 
my voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about dramatic credibility, Guleghina, who is one of the more svelte 
and attractive young sopranos singing today, made a conscious decision to lose 
weight. "I was big two years ago," she said. "Not big like some sopranos, but I 
was bigger than I am now. One day I looked intensely in the mirror and I 
understood, it's not me. I decided to change completely. I lost about 30 
pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss did not affect her voice. "I did this very gradually, poco a poco, 
over two years," she said. "Now I feel very good, and I think my voice does not 
depend on how many kilos I have. It doesn't change it. I need only to be 
strong. Before I sing, I usually eat, and I eat too much! I eat pasta. But when 
I don't sing, I don't need to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have respect for the audience," she continued. "People go to the theater to 
hear something, yes, it's true, but also to see something. I do not want people 
to smile when I play Tosca or Aida!" 
</P>
<P>
 * Maria Guleghina will sing the title role of Verdi's "Aida" on Saturday at 7

 Final Score: "Baseball" wound up its 18 1/2-hour PBS run on Wednesday, with 
viewership holding steady over the course of nine nights. Ken Burns' 
documentary averaged a 5.1 rating and 7 share of the audience in Nielsen's 32

prime time. The miniseries, which reached a cumulative audience of 28 million, 
according to PBS, will be repeated next April. . . . Elsewhere, the season 
opener of "Saturday Night Live," hosted by Steve Martin, averaged an 8.7

 Moving Up: Andrew Heyward has been named vice president of CBS News and 
executive producer of the "CBS Evening News," effective Oct. 17. He succeeds 
Erik Sorenson, who will continue at the news department as a vice president in 
development. Sorenson, who had been executive producer of the nightly newscast 
since February, 1991, had asked for a reassignment. Heyward has worked on the 
Connie Chung newsmagazine "Eye to Eye" since February, 1993.

 Dental Bill: A federal judge in Philadelphia has ordered a dentist to pay ABC

rejected Owen J. Rogal's claim that ABC's March, 1989, profile falsely

 False Alarm: "Higgins and Beech" has been declared alive and well by 20th 
Century Fox in the wake of the announcement that Michelle Pfeiffer had opted to 
do Touchstone's "Up Close and Personal" first. Brian Gibson is lined up to 
direct "Higgins," a rewrite is in the works and, if creative and budgetary 
concerns are resolved to the studio's satisfaction, the project will get off 
the ground in February or March for an intended Christmas, 1995, release. 
Pfeiffer, Fox explains, had been offered the film, but no deal was ever signed. 
As the mother of a newborn, the actress reportedly bowed out because the 
project would have taken her out of town for six to eight weeks. Julia Roberts 
and Demi Moore are said to be leading contenders for the role. According to 
PMK, which represents Richard Gere, the actor is interested in the project and 
will make up his mind after reading the final script.

THEATER REVIEW; RIVERA MAKES A VOLATILE WORLD IN 'EACH DAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A la Gabriel Garcia Marquez, "Each Day Dies With Sleep" features strange acts 
of nature, such as oranges that turn black and spurt gasoline. But Jose 
Rivera's 1990 play takes its stately title from a Gerard Manley Hopkins poem 
and its darkly whimsical tone from Gregory Corso. And although Rivera bows to 
Marquez's magical realism in his use of exaggerated plot elements, the play is 
more overheated than magical. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera creates a volatile universe in which a lot happens, but the play is 
repetitive and does not follow its own internal logic. While terrible things 
happen to his characters, nothing seems to really change. Our heroine, Nelly 
(Shawna Casey), transforms physically from a cowering, stuttering daughter into 
a confident wife, but even in her cowering state she already has the sharp 
tongue and spunk that she is supposed to grow into.  
</P>
<P>
 When her father calls her "pinhead," Nelly responds with "not pinhead." Her 
language problems seem like an affection and are easily fixed by her husband, 
who teaches her to form "I want to marry you" out of "want you, marry you." 
(Actually, her impediment seems modeled on Tarzan's.) The best that can be said 
of Casey's performance is that the actress appears to believe feverishly in a 
character that just doesn't add up.  
</P>
<P>
 While we can understand that Nelly might fall for the gigolo Johnny (Bernard 
White) in order to escape her father's home, why, for instance, does she remain 
fiercely faithful to this preening, vapid mechanic whose dream is to become a 
top model? 
</P>
<P>
 As if to camouflage certain logical or emotional inconsistencies, Rivera 
overloads the play with character details without illuminating the characters. 
For instance, Nelly's father Augie (Tomas Voth) is not simply macho, he has 
fathered 21 children and is sexually attracted to all of his daughters while 
still going out to bars and picking up two young women at a time.  
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Johnny is so attractive that he is besieged by "an army of jealous 
husbands," yet his modeling career remains a joke. He courts Nelly after he has 
fathered children with several of her sisters without marrying any of them. 
Yet, Nelly -- looking less than desirable in her half-buckled Ninja Turtle 
overalls -- gives him one kiss and he wants to marry her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each Day" has its moments. Voth is funny when he tries to drown out the 
sounds of his daughter's lovemaking by playing Bing Crosby's "Don't Fence Me 
In" at top volume. White is amusing when he explains his promiscuity with "What 
can I say? I love this family." 
</P>
<P>
 Set designer Dave Thayer fills the wide stage with the mess of Nelly's life. 
The high walls are covered in newspaper, spray painted with lines from the show 
such as "passion causes most of the misery in the world" and "I have a Walkman. 
I'm a survivor." Unfortunately, the play doesn't take us far beyond these 
slogans. 
</P>

OUT MAGAZINE SPOTLIGHTS GAYS IN HOLLYWOOD; MEDIA: ALTHOUGH NO ONE IN THE 
NOVEMBER ISSUE WAS 'OUTED' MANY INDUSTRY INSIDERS CALLED AND WANTED TO BE A 
PART OF IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The November issue of Out magazine, due on newsstands in mid-October, boasts 
one of the most comprehensive special reports to date on the spectrum of gays 
and lesbians working in Hollywood who no longer keep their private lives secret 
-- an openness that would have been unheard of just a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Out editor and President Michael Goff remembers a few years back when he would 
have been grateful for one or two people to comment for such an article -- and 
that would be off the record. But this year, Goff said, he received many phone 
calls from people who had heard about the coming issue and "wanted to be a part 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The article interviews dozens of prominent actors, agents, publicists and 
studio executives; its cover model is super-manager Sandy Gallin. No one is 
apparently "outed" in the magazine, which has a circulation of more than 
100,000 nationally and is not related to the now-defunct Outweek, which gained 
attention by announcing the sexuality of well-known individuals, whether they 
wanted it known or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years ago, I wouldn't have even thought of such a story," said longtime 
entertainment reporter Kevin Koffler, who is the West Coast editor of Out. 
</P>
<P>
 What has changed, he and Goff say, is that the major entertainment companies 
have added "sexual orientation" to their anti-discrimination policies, which 
has allowed gay employees to be more open without fear of reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
 When the usually low-profile Gallin was asked about why he allowed his photo 
to be used on the cover of Out, he replied, "I never had to come out. I never 
was in." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he wanted to be a part of the magazine's coverage because its 
national readership needs to know that in Hollywood people are judged not by 
their sexuality "but by their work." 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine devotes nearly 30 pages to the article, with profiles and 
photographs of prominent gays and non-gays in Hollywood. Featured gays and 
lesbians include "Married . . . With Children's" Amanda Bearse, producer Alan 
Poul, playwright and screenwriter Paul Rudnick, Amblin Entertainment producer 
Bruce Cohen, producer Neil Mehron, casting director Tammy Billik, producers 
Barry Krost and Doug Chapin, writer Richard Gollance, adult video director 
Chichi LaRue, scenic artist Johnmichael Hull and producer Leslie Belzberg.

BLACKS ON TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a black woman, I think my fellow blacks should put to rest those endless 
complaints that they don't see enough blacks on TV. The latest complaint, from 
Irene Wiley ("Something's Missing at Emmy Awards," Saturday Letters, Sept. 24), 
is that she didn't see enough blacks on the 46th annual nighttime Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that I can hardly turn on a TV channel anymore without 
encountering a lily-black program that shows black people as buffoons, idiots 
or worse. It seems to me that that is what black people should complain about 
instead of whining about their absence. There's always, and I do mean always -- 
24 hours a day -- O.J. Simpson, and if they don't like what they see about him, 
they can go next door and visit with neighbors and see how black people really 
do live -- just like everyone else.

'MY FAIR LADY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As my contribution as art director was overlooked in Emanuel Levy's article on 
the restoration of "My Fair Lady" (" 'My Fair Lady' Gets a Face Lift," Sept. 
23), I feel it proper to point out that, even though Cecil Beaton is credited 
as production designer, I conceived, designed and executed all the sets and, in 
addition -- working on a daily basis with George Cukor and director of 
photography Harry Stradling -- functioned as the production designer. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaton designed the costumes, and together we gave the film a look worthy of 
restoration.

 According to Judith Michaelson's article, "For PBS at Least, 'Baseball' Is a 
Hit -- but It's No 'Civil War' " (Sept. 26), the excellent program did not 
garner the numbers that "Civil War" got, but everyone at PBS is, nevertheless, 
satisfied. Who was the genius programmer at PBS who decided to run the series 
the same week all the networks were starting their new season? What a pity that 
a fine program had to lose its potential audience because of dumb programming.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; OASIS GIVES A NEW FACE TO OLD ROCK THRILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oasis has been heralded as the best band in Britain by the English rock press 
and was introduced Thursday at the Palace by KROQ's Rodney Bingenheimer as "the 
best band in the universe." When the band took the stage for its L.A. debut, 
the club didn't levitate, the heavens didn't part and the history of rock 'n' 
roll didn't come to a crashing conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Manchester quintet did demonstrate that, unlike many other Next Big 
British Things before it, it's a solidly talented band with a batch of prime, 
well-built rock tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Liam Gallagher occasionally snarled out his lyrics with a Rotten-esque 
flourish, but other than that there isn't a scrap of punk in the band's sound. 
Instead, it gives a new face to some old rock 'n' roll thrills, laying clean, 
simple melodies across steady, chunky chords and elevating the results into 
grand statements of lust, ennui, and -- most of all -- arch dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Such winning songs as "Up in the Sky" and "Cigarettes & Alcohol" can evoke the 
Beatles, Stones, T. Rex, and Mott the Hoople at once, but the band adds enough 
personality to avoid coming off as rank nostalgists. 
</P>
<P>
 The band was resolutely calm on stage, standing stock-still in button-down 
shirts and plain trousers as it powered through the set. Gallagher often 
waggled his tambourine with a look of snotty disdain, though he did politely 
thank the crowd after every song.  
</P>
<P>
 With more strong material and a little staying power, the band may actually 
grow into some of its laurels. CHUCK CRISAFULLI

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; 'MAD' 4AD FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 4AD record label may be best known as the easy listening wing of new rock 
with the atmospherics of the Cocteau Twins, et al. But Thursday's edition of 
the company's weeklong "All Virgos Are Mad" festival was a night of uneasy 
listening at the Troubadour, with Throwing Muses and Lisa Germano essaying the 
inner turmoil of being square pegs in a round world. 
</P>
<P>
 Well before Kurt Cobain and Eddie Vedder made reflections of shattered psyches 
staples of the Top 10, Throwing Muses' Kristin Hersh was a standard-setter for 
that topic. Fronting the Muses after a year off to concentrate on more subdued 
solo work, Hersh appeared Thursday as the confident survivor. Unfortunately the 
material hit a plateau mid-set, the dynamics all starting to sound the same, 
and the impact of Hersh's tales was diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 Germano, probably best known from her days playing fiddle with John 
Mellencamp, presented an even more disturbing picture of the struggle to define 
one's self in a confusing world -- the theme of her upcoming album, "Geek the 
Girl." Liz Phair's been anointed the quintessential '90s pop woman, but Germano 
takes it much deeper, if harder to define.  
</P>
<P>
 There was a sweet, innocent sense of acceptance of this geeky status in her 
almost shy presentation and brittle, slightly off-kilter music, but always with 
a shadow of menace underneath. It surfaced dramatically with a mid-set song 
about her fear of a real-life obsessive pursuer that she preceded by stating, 
her expression frighteningly serious, "I hope he dies." 
</P>
<P>
 Quieter but still disquieting was the spellbinding opening set by Heidi Berry, 
an English folk-based singer-songwriter with a haunting alto and haunted themes 
that called to mind the songs of the late Nick Drake as if sung by the late 
Sandy Denny. STEVE HOCHMAN

Wilson remains an acquired taste. Even with all the favorable press notices, 
the New York-based singer drew barely more than 100 people to the 500-seat 
Strand on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the slight, though quite enthusiastic, crowd could be that 
Wilson is an expressive, adventurous artist who defies easy categorization -- 
there are strong flavors of blues, folk, even country and pop in her work, 
which has the underpinnings of an arty jazz sensibility. She seeks personal 
approaches to songs that don't always grab an audience and hold it. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Strand, Wilson favored slow tempo deliveries built on elastic rhythmic 
bulwarks mainly provided by bassist Lonnie Plaxico and drummer Lance Carter. At 
those languorous paces, the singer employed her rich, honey-colored alto and 
consistently put a lot of space between her phrases -- which didn't always 
adhere to the written melody -- as guitarist Brandon Ross and 
violinist/mandolinist Charlie Burnham dropped in colorful asides. This coming 
and going of the melodic basis of a song, as when she sang the classic 
"Skylark," created a sense of drama and tension that resulted in emotionally 
fluctuating, come-hither-then-stand-back interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Wilson's successful renditions had an air of distance about them. Still, 
Van Morrison's "Tupelo Honey," two Robert Johnson numbers -- "Hellhound on My 
Trail" and "Come On in My Kitchen" -- and her own "Redbone" were fairly 
uncomplicated treatments that allowed Wilson to more effectively deliver a 
song's meaning. ZAN STEWART

SERVICE CHARGE DISCLOSURE BILL BACKED BY TICKETMASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ticketmaster Corp., lambasted as the "800-pound gorilla" of the entertainment 
ticket industry, says it supports a bill that would require full disclosure of 
service charges on tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 But that bill is a ticket to nowhere, at least for this year, because it has 
little chance of passage before the congressional session ends 
Friday.Supporters say it will be reintroduced early in the next session, which 
begins in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already practice the types of disclosure that are mandated by the bill," 
said Ned Goldstein, vice president and general counsel of the nation's main 
ticket distributor, at Thursday's meeting of the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 He said signs at retail outlets inform customers of the charges and telephone 
sales operators are instructed to tell customers who order by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation follows complaints by consumers about high service charges on 
concert and other live entertainment tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ticketmaster, the 800-pound gorilla in the ticketing industry, and in many 
places the only gorilla in town, rips off consumers," testified Bill Wood of 
the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. He said a survey by his group of the 
company's service charges for tickets to 80 events in 10 states showed that, on 
average, Ticketmaster's fees added $5.10 to the ticket's face value. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two-thirds of the Ticketmaster agents surveyed said their service 
charges were not disclosed separately on the tickets.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; ROCKABILLY POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rockabilly erupts regularly on the rock scene, as inevitable as acne on 
adolescent faces. This root form of rock 'n' roll endures because the urge to 
get wild that it embodies is essential, and it has never found a better 
cultural fit than it has with today's scene, where its iconography (tattoos, 
the juvenile delinquent look) and spirit (stage-diving is a pure rockabilly 
impulse) prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's no surprise to find the Reverend Horton Heat, a rockabilly trio from 
Dallas, topping the college-rock airplay charts and packing halls such as the 
Palace, where it played on Thursday to a crowd ranging from '50s fashion plates 
to '90s rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the dimension of dementia that the Cramps bring to the form, or the 
cartoonish charisma of the Stray Cats, the threesome relies on sheer, 
blistering power. Drummer Taz, taking his cues more from Keith Moon than any 
'50s forebears, is virtually the lead musician, and it was his relentless drive 
that kept Thursday's set on the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer-guitarist the Rev came on like the flipped-out square, with bow tie and 
pork-pie hat and charged guitar playing. For someone who professes a love of 
such unruly forces as Jerry Lee Lewis, he was a pretty mild performer. But 
their hearts are in the right place -- the Rev sounded like an earnest 
musicologist when he told the fans that they need to be familiar with Gene 
Vincent & the Blue Caps. RICHARD CROMELIN

TV REVIEW; 'SOMETHING WILDER' COULD GROW ON YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gene Wilder makes his TV series debut tonight in a pleasing, upbeat little NBC 
comedy that has the potential to grow creatively -- and to grow on viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilder plays Gene Bergman, and Hillary B. Smith is his wife, Annie.They're the 
parents of twin 4-year-old boys whose first exposure to preschool becomes the 
moderately amusing center of the premiere, as Annie panics about relinquishing 
their sons to another environment, and Gene tries to calm her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not being emotional!" she snaps at her lower-key husband. "It makes me 
want to scream when you say that!" 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Gene attempts to cope at his advertising agency, where one of his 
partners is his spacey brother-in-law who wants to use the image of Adolf 
Hitler to sell a restaurant, failing to understand why anyone would call that 
tasteless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to explain bad taste to someone who has it," Gene says. 
</P>
<P>
 That could apply, as well, to the perpetrators of most of the fall season's 
new comedies. Happily, "Something Wilder" rises above them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Bergman twins come under the category of gratingly cutesy sitcom 
kids, the premiere's streaks of gentle humor are what you remember, as well as 
the gifted, likable Wilder's benign paternalism, an effective counterpoint to 
the intensity of Smith's Annie. A nice start. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Something Wilder" premieres at 8 tonight on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).

PRODUCTS; NEW ITEMS FROM THE OL' FACTORY; CLEANERS AND PESTICIDES SCENTS 
SOMETHING NEW 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does your house smell like Mom's home cooking when all you did was clean the 
bathroom? Like a bouquet of flowers because you sprayed for bugs? 
</P>
<P>
 Carpet deodorizers, air fresheners, toilet cleaners and bug spray have all 
been putting on new airs lately. 
</P>
<P>
 And while most consumers have become accustomed to Lemon Fresh Pledge and 
potpourri room deodorizers, many still doubt what their noses are telling them 
when they get a whiff of Vanilla Carpet Fresh and Country Fresh Raid.  
</P>
<P>
 One need only tour the local supermarket to catch wind of the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Renuzit's Country Kitchen air freshener promises "the charm of cinnamon and 
spice," as if Mom had just finished baking an apple pie in the kitchen -- or 
the bath. Airwick has introduced a line of Air Waves air fresheners in 
fragrances that conjure up idyllic country settings: "morning rain," "cool 
cascade" and "wildberry knoll." Arm & Hammer has a carpet deodorizer that's 
scented with something called "vanilla meadows," so the whole house will smell 
good enough to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Even pesticides come out smelling like a rose. Hot Shot's roach and ant killer 
has a new "fresh floral scent," while Raid has introduced an ant and roach 
killer that smells "country fresh" -- even while it's wiping out colonies of 
country-bred invaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are manufacturers of these chemicals encouraging homeowners to stop and 
smell the bug spray? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago the purpose of adding fragrance to household products was to mask or 
obliterate bad smells, says Avery Gilbert, a psychologist on the staff of 
Givaudan-Roure, a company that creates and produces fragrances in Teaneck, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once upon a time you just wanted the thing to work -- to kill bugs, if it was 
a bug killer," Gilbert says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then product manufacturers caught on to consumers' love of potpourri. No 
longer were people simply stuffing a potpourri satchel in the back of a 
lingerie drawer. They were putting out entire bowlfuls of dried rose petals and 
orange peels to permeate their living quarters with scent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potpourri was pleasant in itself. That got taken up through the 
air-freshener market," Gilbert says. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon came a wave of potpourri-scented air fresheners, window cleaners, carpet 
deodorizers, furniture polish and toilet ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the emphasis is on fragrancing the home," Gilbert says. "They've switched 
from coverage to mood-setting." 
</P>
<P>
 From the woodsy, berry notes of potpourri, manufacturers have devised more 
sophisticated scents that lend themselves to attractive packaging and colorful 
ads. Who can say what a "morning rain" or a "cool cascade" really smells like? 
But the names go nicely with pictures of rushing waterfalls and dew-covered 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they create whole fragrance landscapes," Gilbert says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scents aren't created in a vacuum; they reflect what's happening in society at 
the time they're made, says Annette Green, president of the national Fragrance 
Foundation, the industry's nonprofit educational organization in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Many "odorscapes," such as Pledge's "country woods" furniture polish, are 
designed to make consumers feel the outdoors can be purchased in a can because 
nature and the environment have been shown to be popular concerns in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the trend is toward outdoor, fresh, clean fragrances," Green says. 
"Consumers are in an environmental awareness mode. They're looking for products 
that speak of the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers plumb the depth of their consumers' psyches to come up with 
fragrances they'll like, which explains why Givaudan-Roure employs a 
psychologist along with its team of perfumers. 
</P>
<P>
 They want to know which fragrances will conjure up positive images. Vanilla is 
being used in Carpet Fresh and other products because studies have shown it has 
a calming, soothing effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's connected to cooking, mother and home," Green says. "It makes people 
feel comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Comforting scents have grown stronger because people perceive the world as 
more threatening and stressful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The '80s wore us out in many ways, including financially and sexually. People 
are just trying to turn down the volume," Green says. "There's a lot of fear on 
the streets. Home is our haven." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why some air fresheners smell like cinnamon. 
</P>
<P>
 "What fragrance is more comforting than cinnamon and spice? It conjures up 
images of home, Thanksgiving and Christmas," Green says. 
</P>
<P>
 People find comfort in food, so Wizard now makes an air freshener that smells 
like "woodland fruits," and Glade makes one in "fresh berries." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why fresh berries? It's safe; it's yummy, and there aren't a lot of people 
who hate berries," Gilbert says. "On the other hand, you're not going to find 
an air freshener that smells like broccoli." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes manufacturers want their products to stink. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases you need to let some of the malodor of a product come through 
so it signals it's working," says Lisa Lewis, creative fragrance director of 
Givaudan-Roure. 
</P>
<P>
 A foul smell can also keep people from overexposing themselves to potentially 
harmful substances such as bleach or powerful insecticides. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want them inhaling something if it could be detrimental to their 
health," Lewis says. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, a pleasant scent can reassure consumers that a product such 
as Black Flag (now available in pine or lavender) won't do to them what it does 
to ants and roaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just bought a scented insecticide. I always had the feeling if they smelled 
bad, they must be dangerous," Green says. "This is one way to get across the 
idea that these particular insecticides are safer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While adding scent to a product improves its attraction to consumers, there 
are some cleaners, detergents and other products that people would rather not 
smell. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such products are advertised as fragrance-free, if they were truly 
unscented consumers would probably turn up their noses at them. The reason: 
Without ingredients that cover up their natural scents, many products smell 
rotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "When something's fragrance-free, it means it doesn't stink. Some scents need 
to be covered," Gilbert says. "Soap doesn't smell so good by itself. If you put 
your face in a bowl of soap chips that aren't scented, you'll ask for the 
perfume back pretty quick."

SEEDS OF KNOWLEDGE; IT'S A CONCEPT: 25 ACRES OF PUBLIC EDUCATION ON 
CONSERVATION, LANDSCAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARESA ARCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Botanical gardens have traditionally been places where plants are collected 
and categorized -- public spaces where people can walk among giant trees and 
exotic flowers. But few public gardens offer more in the way of practical 
gardening information than a spattering of horticulture workshops and plant 
shows. That may change in Orange County if plans proceed for a public garden in 
Irvine that would be educational as well as aesthetically interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Gardens Environmental Learning Center -- a proposed 25-acre, 
$25-million garden adjacent to the Irvine Ranch Water District's reclamation 
plant near the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve in Irvine -- would be a 
garden dedicated to demonstrating how water, energy and other natural resources 
can be conserved while still creating attractive landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, conceived by the Irvine Ranch Water District board of directors, 
calls for a series of demonstration gardens appropriate for the average 
suburban yard, public landscapes such as median strips and a technology center 
using computers to help visitors design energy- and water-efficient landscapes 
and select appropriate plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district board expects to review in mid-November the feasibility 
study for the garden -- including financing -- and decide on whether to go 
ahead with the project. If final approval is given, it is anticipated the 
project would take two years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The master plan calls for the garden be a nonprofit, self-sustaining venture 
to be supported by private financing and public funding. The Irvine Ranch Water 
District owns most of the 25-acre site; seven acres would be donated by the 
Irvine Co. if the project proceeds. If approved, the district's anticipated 
role would be to build, maintain and operate the facility. Private funding for 
building materials, technology and plants would be sought. A nominal entrance 
fee would be charged to help defray maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea to create a teaching garden came from a drought-tolerant 
demonstration garden created at UC Riverside during the last drought. The 
garden, opened in 1989, drew visitors from throughout Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 "People were coming from Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and San Diego counties," 
said Tom Ash, the horticulturist and education specialist who designed the 
garden. "And not just the general public but landscape professionals as well, 
because it was the only place they could come and learn anything about 
resource-conserving landscapes -- this little one-acre garden." 
</P>
<P>
 The water district's board of directors decided such a demonstration garden 
would be a valuable resource in this area and hired Ash to plan one. 
</P>
<P>
 In planning the garden, workshops were conducted with local government 
agencies, homeowner associations and other interest groups. The input from 
these groups was given to the design team that included landscape architect 
Lawrence Halprin, based in San Francisco; RJM Design Group in Mission Viejo; 
Wolff Lang, Christopher Architects of Rancho Cucamonga; Environmental Research 
Lab at the University of Arizona and the California Academy of Science in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Every portion of the Irvine garden would be planted to show energy and water 
efficiency as well as economic frugality. In general, water use in coastal 
urban areas is distributed with 40% for outdoors and 60% indoors. The ratio of 
outdoor consumption dramatically increases in hotter inland climates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a garden that will incorporate energy conservation with the 
economical value of proper landscaping," Ash said. "We'll also have information 
on how much it costs to put in each planting and the cost to maintain them. Our 
hope is that not only homeowners but municipalities and landscape professionals 
will use the garden."  
</P>
<P>
 The garden would be adjacent to the Irvine Ranch Water District's 
state-of-the-art reclamation plant, which processes 15 million gallons of water 
a day. Visitors to the garden could also tour the plant to see where their 
waste water goes and how it is treated before reuse. Among other things, the 
garden would demonstrate how water reuse can begin at home by rechanneling 
water instead of dumping all household waste water into the sewers. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed garden would be divided into several sections, all blending into 
one another. Here is what planners envision: Home Demonstration Gardens  
</P>
<P>
 Home demonstration gardens would be arranged like an actual neighborhood with 
a main street/ walkway and front and back yards. Each lot would be geared 
toward maximum conservation of water. Large, single-family lots and small 
condominium lots would be represented. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration gardens would emphasize three themes: water, climate control 
adjacent to structures and the economic impact of sound environmental 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the home garden plot closest to the San Joaquin Marsh would have 
a natural-looking water garden to complement the view of the marsh. Other plots 
would emphasize edible landscape, cut flowers, a butterfly garden and a native 
plant garden, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 The plots would each feature a house facade representative of the works of 
renowned architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Irving Gill and Greene and 
Greene.  
</P>
<P>
 Visitors would walk down the street to a computer kiosk where they could enter 
information on their own yards, such as size, climate and sunlight orientation. 
The computer would then tell them which of the garden lots would be closest to 
their own yard. At that lot they would find information explaining how and why 
that particular garden was created. They would also receive a computer printout 
of all the plants and other elements in the garden, estimated cost to build and 
maintain the landscape and where in the county plant and building materials 
could be purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors would be shown how to develop a water budget, allocating certain 
amounts of water for each area of a yard, and zoned irrigation systems. In all 
the plots, drainage would be directed for harvest and reuse. Technology Center  
</P>
<P>
 The center would include the main entrance to the garden as well as conference 
space, library, bookstore, exhibit space and food service. 
</P>
<P>
 Buildings would be constructed from recycled materials using the latest in 
environmental and economical construction techniques. Rather than cover up all 
the sub-structure, there would be glass windows in walls to show more efficient 
piping systems or electrical wiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Landscaping around the center would demonstrate proper garden organization and 
design and how that can result in increased property values and financial 
benefits in the form of energy savings and reduced maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The natural topography of the land would be used in the technology center by 
using the two small hills on either side of the site and linking them by the 
center's plaza. As with all areas of the garden, grading would be kept to a 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The technology center will be an interactive area where visitors can use 
computer technology to link them with the latest information on water 
conservation and other environmental issues. It's sort of a marrying of the 
Science and Industry Museum and a botanical garden," Ash said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indoor exhibits would emphasize hands-on learning of water conservation and 
its role in ecology. Visitors would be able to design their own garden through 
use of computers. There would be a glass wall that would show the root systems 
of trees planted adjacent to the buildings so people can better understand why 
roots can tear up foundations. Outside, glass block paving would reveal 
subterranean irrigation and drainage systems. 
</P>
<P>
 There would also be a technology library and resource center dedicated to 
water issues that would be linked electronically with other libraries. Urban 
Forest  
</P>
<P>
 The urban forest would show local habitats such as oak woodlands, chaparral, 
coastal sage scrub, riparian and grasslands. While introducing people to plant 
communities, the urban forest would also focus on demonstrations of irrigation, 
erosion control, slope planting and stream ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the urban forest would be to help the public understand biomass 
as a key part of the ecosystem. Property values for urban forests have been 
calculated to be as much as $10 more per square foot for lots with trees than 
those without, according to Ash. Entry / Streetscapes 
</P>
<P>
 The street medians and parking lot would show how paved areas can be cooled 
through the use of shade trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The three median strips would show different approaches: one planted with turf 
and large trees, such as palms, which require substantial watering; a 
Mediterranean planting, which takes minimal water, and a median with only 
California natives that receive no watering beyond rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The pavements themselves would be porous enough for water to percolate down to 
the water table, keeping polluted runoff from entering the riparian water 
system. Composting Site 
</P>
<P>
 Green waste from the garden would be "chipped" and composted to produce 
organic material that could then be used to enrich the garden's soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state says we have to cut the amount of green waste going to landfills by 
30%," Ash said. "That will mean telling the homeowner what they can do with 
grass trimmings and so forth. The compost site will show them." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, one of the home demonstration gardens would have an example of 
how to compost in the average suburban yard. Back-yard composting is an easy 
process by which lawn clippings, leaves, twigs and manure can be turned into 
rich organic material. Mixed together and left to decompose, these waste 
materials eventually become usable as fertilizer. Archeological Site  
</P>
<P>
 The site for the garden contains an ancient Native American burial ground, 
which would be preserved. Working with the Native American community, part of 
the surrounding area might be excavated to help illustrate the lifestyle of 
those who once lived in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The area would also be used to identify the elements in a coastal sage scrub 
plant community. Much of Orange County is still covered by these low-growing, 
drought-tolerant plants, but it is a habitat that is diminishing. Constructed 
Wetlands  
</P>
<P>
 Wetlands are one of the most important natural water filters in the ecosystem. 
The four-acre, man-made wetlands in the garden would include interpretive 
information explaining the importance of these habitats. "You hear 
environmentalists talk a lot about the importance of wetlands, but the average 
person may not understand how a marsh can improve their way of life," Ash said. 
</P>
<P>
 To show that, the wetlands would be used to filter-clean the system of 
streams, fountains and other water outlets in the garden's technology center. A 
cross-section of the wetlands, above and below water level, would be viewed 
from inside the technology center to show how the bio-filtering process works.

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; FISHING LINE SCREENS OUT PESKY GUESTS

 Q. The screens in our windows are basically in good shape, except a few have 
small tears. I'd like to close up these tears, as I suspect bugs get into the 
house through them. Can they be sewn? What should I use? 
</P>
<P>
 R.W., San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 A. People often make the mistake of sewing a hole in a screen with thread, 
says Katy Jackson of Maley's Glass in Anaheim. The thread wears out quickly, 
and the tears get bigger. You might try using light fishing line. It's strong, 
durable and easy to work with. Thin wire might be stronger, but it's harder to 
work with and can increase the tearing.

 Q. We bought a condo recently and are getting it ready to paint. In taking off 
the electrical outlet plates, I've noticed that a few of the outlets stick out 
from the wall, in some cases more than a half-inch. How can I correct these so 
they're flush with the wall? 
</P>
<P>
 C.C., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 A. There is an outlet plate available that has a lip around the edges that's 
larger than usual, says Mike McCoy of Current Supply in Westminster. But the 
extension is only about a quarter-inch. Unfortunately, while there are many 
solutions for an outlet box that is recessed too far, you don't have as many 
options when your outlet box is sticking out. The box is nailed into a stud and 
resetting it means removing some of the drywall around the box to remove and 
reattach it, which means you've got a good-sized drywall repair job after you 
finish. 
</P>

<P>
 Q. Our carpeting is fairly new, and we plan to do some painting. What do the 
pros use to get fresh paint stains out of carpeting? 
</P>
<P>
 K.F., Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A. The best way to get stains out is to prevent them from occurring, says 
Harold Brobst of Hal's Paint & Decorating in Fullerton. Completely mask off 
areas where you don't want paint and cover your floor. People who have tried to 
"be careful" rather than masking have ruined carpeting by accidentally kicking 
over a bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep a pail of water and a rag ready in case you need to mop up some paint. If 
it's a large stain, keep changing the water so that you're not putting diluted 
paint on the carpet. Detergent in the water can help break down the acrylic in 
the paint. If you're using an oil-based paint, use a rag and paint thinner. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. My patio has a surface made of small stones that are set in an epoxy. I 
need some touch-up work done and have not been able to find the materials. Any 
ideas? 
</P>
<P>
 D.R., Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 A. It's probably a product known as Futura Stone, which has an office in 
Orange, says Ken Newland of Tustin Block. It is relatively easy to apply. The 
rocks you select are mixed in with a resin, and it's troweled on the patio 
surface, like plaster. It's also durable, and it makes a good alternative to 
just having a plain concrete surface. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. We're considering putting in a white ceramic tile floor in our kitchen, but 
we'd like to use white grout also. Is it realistic to expect that the white 
grout won't discolor? 
</P>
<P>
 P.I., Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 A. I would give it a lot of thought before putting it in a kitchen, says 
Gloria Richey of Tile Importers in Anaheim. Kitchens are high-traffic areas, 
and it's going to be very hard to keep your white grout pristine. In order to 
maintain its appearance, you'll need to apply three coats of a sealer made 
especially for white grout. Other types of sealers can discolor your grout 
lines. You'll also have to apply it twice a year, because it wears down after 
repeated washing.

 Some pitchers are worth a thousand words, especially Tiffany & Co.'s sterling 
silver holloware pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a purity to the silver, and the movement of the pieces just shows 
through," said Jo Ellen Qualls, vice president of Tiffany at South Coast Plaza, 
Costa Mesa. "It is an artistic expression of a functional item." 
</P>
<P>
 Created by the Tiffany design staff in New York, the swirl bar pitcher and 
irregularly wrapped pitcher give Tiffany's traditional classicism and 
craftsmanship a modern perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pieces will work in any decor, from traditional to contemporary," Qualls 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The pitchers ($1,200 each) are part of a collection that includes a tulip vase 
and pineapple and banana jars. Affordable Chic

 Home Express has moved into the neighborhood, ready to spice up your decor. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200,000 items are on display in the 41,000-square-foot store, which 
opened last week in Laguna Niguel at the Marketplace on Alicia Parkway at 
Pacific Park Drive.  
</P>
<P>
 Home Express, which carries everything from bedding to towels to furniture to 
small electrics, envisions itself as a one-stop decorating and furnishing 
store. You can even bring home dinner, because the store sells food, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Small electrics abound at Home Express, which carries several items that are 
new on the market. A microwave popcorn popper (about $23) by Presto works with 
any corn and any oil. There's also a fabric-covered bread and tortilla warmer 
(about $20) by Venture and a portable massager (about $60) by Homedics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it is someone who is starting out or over, a college student in need 
of dorm room accessories, or simply an urge to update for the season, we offer 
the most variety at the best value," said Jim Patterson, executive vice 
president and general merchandise manager. Soothing Waters

 Sculptor Dan Skaggs knows how to coin a fountain. 
</P>
<P>
 With his latest work, the Temple series, Skaggs of Capistrano Beach combines 
the soothing qualities of a fountain with the suggestion of a temple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted a more architectural look that was slightly spiritual," said Skaggs, 
47. 
</P>
<P>
 An explorer of different media, Skaggs uses cast stone, marble, granite and 
bronze -- his favorite material -- in making the pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to mix things up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple I ($2,250), which is 4 feet 8 inches tall by 27 inches wide by 16 
inches deep, includes a tank in the base and submerged lighting. It is designed 
to butt against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple II ($3,000) is a free-standing sculpture. It is shown placed in a small 
pond ($450), which Skaggs can customize to a client's specifications. The 
fountain is 40 inches tall by 24 inches wide by 22 inches deep.  
</P>
<P>
 Both fountains, which can be used indoors or outside, have grid-like fronts 
with a three-dimensional appearance, resulting in a sparkling water effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Skaggs, who introduced his fountains at the Laguna Festival of Arts in August, 
says he has his football coach at Cal State Long Beach to thank for his move 
into the arts. "He was the one who told me to take art classes," said Skaggs, 
now an instructor at the Interior Designers Institute in Newport Beach. "He 
told me being a PE teacher is a pain in the neck." 
</P>
<P>
 For information on Skaggs' works, call (714) 240-5106.

GARDENING; PASSIONFLOWER HAS DIVINE ROOTS, DELICIOUS FRUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE REICH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did you ever wonder what passion is inspired by the "passion" in 
passionflowers and passion fruit? 
</P>
<P>
 The name came about because 17th-Century Christian missionaries saw in these 
flowers a teaching tool for spreading the Gospel of the Passion of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 petals were taken to represent the 10 Apostles present at the 
Crucifixion. The threadlike rays of the corona were taken for symbols of the 
crown of thorns. 
</P>
<P>
 The five stamens and three styles referred, respectively, to the five wounds 
of Christ and the three nails used in the Crucifixion. Even the rest of the 
plant figures in, with the three-lobed leaves representing the Trinity and the 
tendrils representing the scourges. 
</P>
<P>
 What about horticultural passions? Most passionflowers are tropical species, 
but one species is hardy enough to grow outdoors over much of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 This plant is commonly called maypop ( Passiflora incarnata ). The flowers, 
indistinguishable to non-botanists from the tropical species, are 1 1/2 to two 
inches across, with lavender petals and a purple crown that has a darker halo 
toward its base. The open blossoms exude a lemony musk aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 Maypop fruits can be as delicious as tropical passion fruit. (Even if you have 
never tasted passion fruit, you may be familiar with its flavor, the dominant 
one in Hawaiian Punch.) Maypop fruits are yellow to yellow-green, oval, and 1 
1/2 to two inches across. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a tropical passion fruit, the inside of a maypop fruit is filled with air 
and with seeds surrounded by a tasty gelatinous pulp. To quote a 19th-Century 
writer, maypop has "the bigness of a green apple, and hath manie azurine or 
blow kernels, like as a pomegranat, a good summer cooling fruit." 
</P>
<P>
 If you give the fruit a squeeze, it pops like a balloon, hence the name, 
maypop. 
</P>
<P>
 Maypop grows as a perennial vine, climbing by means of tendrils, then dying 
back down to the ground each winter. Growth begins late each season, with the 
shoots not poking up through the ground until June in northern areas. 
</P>
<P>
 When the shoots finally do show, stand back! They grow as much as 20 feet in a 
season. And the plant is every bit as vigorous below ground as it is above 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Plants growing along a sidewalk have been known to push under it and appear on 
the other side. Remove any unwanted suckers by merely jerking them out of the 
ground when they are three inches high. 
</P>
<P>
 Training maypops on some sort of a support brings the flowers to eye level. 
The support might be a fence, or even some early blooming shrub, such as lilac. 
The maypops, being "late risers" in the spring, do not interfere with the 
spring show of the lilac, and later in the season the lilac is covered again 
with blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Surround the shrub and the maypop with lawn, and your lawn mower can keep the 
aggressive maypop roots in bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although maypops are prolific bloomers, they do not always fruit well. (Two 
different plants and pollinating insects are needed, for starters.) But use of 
maypops need not end with the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Native Americans used maypop vines to treat insomnia, and maypop is the 
ingredient of tinctoriae passiflorae, used for similar purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, the plant is worth growing just for its passion-inspiring 
blossoms, which also are pretty indoors, floated in bowls of water.

HEIRLOOMS; DOWN MEMORY LANE WITH GRANDMA'S QUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETSY HALL HUTCHINSON, CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ad in the slick department-store catalogue tempts me: "Sale $69.95 
Handcrafted Quilts, Any Size." For a mere phone call and recital of my credit 
card number, I can acquire a king-size quilt that will transform my bedroom 
into the country look of a bygone era. 
</P>
<P>
 If, indeed, human hands were involved in the crafting of these quilts 
somewhere along a factory assembly line, is the product in any way close to the 
genuine article? What about fine workmanship? What about the stuff of which it 
is made? 
</P>
<P>
 In a chest at the foot of my bed is stored the quilt that Grandma Hall made 
for me when I was a child. She took on the task of creating a quilt for each 
granddaughter's bed. 
</P>
<P>
 With another child on the way, my dad had transformed the attic of our 
bungalow into a bedroom for his two older girls, so that the baby could sleep 
in the downstairs bedroom. He partitioned the attic, painted the wallboard 
apple green and laid knotty-pine patterned linoleum on the floor. Mom sewed 
curtains for the windows and flowered chintz slipcovers for a chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grandmother's Flower Garden" was my grandma's chosen quilt pattern, and I was 
summoned to her house to help. 
</P>
<P>
 It was always special to go to Grandma's. Her house was spacious and peaceful, 
with lots of interesting nooks to explore. A shopping bag full of toys hung on 
a hook by the basement stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was an abundance of flowers. Pots of African violets were lined up 
with other plants on the dining-room window sill. Huge, gilt-framed floral oil 
paintings adorned the walls. In a corner of the dining room was a fancy 
tilt-top table with a painted floral motif. Outside, gardens of tiger lilies, 
lily-of-the-valley, tulips, lilacs and peonies all seemed to thrive in the big, 
shady yard. 
</P>
<P>
 I clearly remember the day I sat with her in the ample dining room with its 
built-in mirrored sideboard. The mahogany table was piled high with pieces of 
old and new fabric. The new solid-colored goods were apple green, white, gold, 
yellow, lavender, rose, pink, blue. 
</P>
<P>
 There were dozens of different flower-sprigged pieces for the required 79 
flowers (no two the same) in the twin-size quilt. Most were scraps left over 
from my mother's sewing basket. We sat under the Tiffany chandelier and traced 
hexagon shapes over and over. I was reprimanded for not being precise enough in 
my tracing and cutting, a necessary requirement for the proper engineering of a 
quilt. I took it as a scolding rather than instruction. Afterward, we cleared 
the table and played anagrams and had hot chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 I just now counted and discovered that in the main body of the quilt are 2,923 
hexagon-shaped pieces. I scrutinize, for the first time, the logic of the 
pattern -- single bloom in the center, surrounded by increasingly larger 
circles of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must have taken Grandma years to make the three quilts, one for each 
granddaughter," I think. "No," Mom said, when I recently questioned her, "it 
didn't seem to take long at all. Grandma used to enjoy spending her evenings 
quilting while listening to the radio." 
</P>
<P>
 In my childhood memories this quilt was always on my bed, and I was free to 
flop on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-versed in the minimalist art and architecture theories of my college 
years, I shunned the cute and country look and chose the then-more-popular 
sleek and modern furnishings for my own home. The quilt was carefully wrapped 
and stored in an old chest. Every once in a while I took it out and tried to 
find a way to use it. I tried displaying it folded on a shelf for a homey 
touch. I considered hanging it on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 It made a charming spread in my teen-age daughter's room for a couple of years 
before it was returned to its place in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 I began to appreciate its value when attending antiques fairs and quilt shows 
and my younger sister became a serious quilt-maker. Never would I make pillows 
or a trendy jacket out of it -- or stiffen it to make a hanging sculpture (as I 
recently read about in a decorating magazine) or use "that old quilt" to buffer 
furniture when moving. 
</P>
<P>
 So, here it is today, spread out on my king-size bed for another look. 
Colorful blossoms of familiar material -- pieces of the soft homemade cotton 
housedresses (always with matching aprons) my mother and grandmother wore in 
the 1940s. Remnants of some of my favorite childhood clothes -- my 
"flyaway-birdie" dress, my "circle pocket" dress, my summer sunsuits, all with 
the secret pockets Mother sewed into the side seams. Doll clothes cut from the 
same fabric scraps. 
</P>
<P>
 King-size nostalgia in a twin-sized, authentic, grandmother-made, 
one-of-a-kind quilt.

GARDENING; BLOOMING FLOWERS MAKE THE BEST WINDOW DRESSING 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You'll be the toast of the neighborhood when you dress up your windows with 
flower-filled window boxes. These small gardens are a dream come true for 
time-pressured gardeners.Upkeep is easy. All it takes is watering, fertilizing 
and pinching.  
</P>
<P>
 To add flowery focal points to your windows, you'll need a container, soil, 
plants and only a small amount of time. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're baffled about which flowers will look good together, just look at a 
color wheel. Colors opposite each other make an eye-catching display every 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a window garden, plants' root systems are squeezed into a small space. 
Using the right soil mix is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunshine mix is a good choice; it has Canadian sphagnum peat moss, a wetting 
agent and a fertilizer. It is available at lawn and garden centers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Choose healthy plants from a reputable nursery. If you want a window garden 
that's immediately filled with bursting blooms, buy plants in four-inch pots. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember to place taller plants toward the back and center of the container 
and trailing plants toward the front and sides. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water the window garden thoroughly after planting. Frequent watering is 
critical for continuous blooms. 
</P>
<P>
 To display your finished window garden, mount the container with the top edge 
just below the windowsill.

ENVIRONMENT; 'BUY SMART, BUY SAFE' FOR CLEAN CONSCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN McGRATH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You're standing in the cleaning products aisle of the grocery store, trying to 
choose an all-purpose cleaner for the house -- you know, for walls and counters 
and stuff. A blizzard of options confronts you. New! Improved! Whitens! 
Brightens! Deodorizes! Ozone-friendly! Scours Without Scratching! 
</P>
<P>
 How is a person to choose? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there is Consumer Reports, of course, to help you rate effectiveness. 
And price is an important consideration. Some folks buy what Mom or Dad or the 
housekeeper used. Packaging is a factor, too. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about environmental criteria? Will the product linger in the air -- 
your personal, indoor air? Will it drift up to the stratosphere and assassinate 
our friends the ozone molecules? Is it toxic to aquatic life? 
</P>
<P>
 And what about more immediate hazards? Will you have to tape a bottle of 
ipecac and a spoon to it and surround it with coils of barbed wire? 
</P>
<P>
 Answers to these questions have been harder to come by -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot off the presses is "Buy Smart, Buy Safe," a consumer guide to less-toxic 
products produced by the Seattle-based Washington Toxics Coalition.  
</P>
<P>
 This 20-page booklet rates 350 name-brand household products according to four 
criteria: short-term health effects, or acute toxicity; long-term health 
effects, or chronic toxicity; physical/chemical hazards, which reflect 
flammability and chemical reactivity, and environmental impacts -- toxicity to 
wildlife, biodegradability, water pollution and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The product ratings evaluate "hazards the products or their ingredients may 
present during use, storage and disposal." 
</P>
<P>
 The evaluations were based on information gleaned from products' labels, 
Material Safety Data Sheets, manufacturers' brochures, ingredients lists and 
toxicology references. 
</P>
<P>
 The ratings do not evaluate the products' effectiveness, nor do they examine 
environmental impacts of manufacturing and packaging. 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet is very easy to read and use, and it manages to slide in a lot of 
helpful information without the booklet seeming crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in addition to product ratings, the booklet includes a section on 
recycling, some alternative cleaning recipes, tips for unclogging drains 
without the use of chemicals, advice on how best to remove lead-based paint 
safely and a recipe for a nontoxic fungicide that really works. 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet also has a nice tone. Unlike many "green shopping guides," it 
doesn't make the assumption that you're a card-carrying greenie. It simply 
presents you with the information and encourages you to make an informed 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how to put the booklet to use: Every time you use up a household 
product such as drain opener, toilet bowl cleaner or multipurpose cleanser, 
take a look in the booklet. Judging by the ratings it received, would you buy 
that product again? If not, which products look like likely replacements? 
</P>
<P>
 Keep the booklet with your reusable grocery bags and consult it at the store. 
That way, if you have to make a snap decision in front of the shelves -- if 
they're out of the brand you planned to buy, for instance -- you can use the 
booklet to shop around for an environmentally friendly substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 It is always hard to know what issues are worth putting a little extra time 
into. Is this one? Should you take the trouble to order a booklet, check the 
products you use, make some changes? You should. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that indoor air can be seven to 100 times as polluted as 
the vilest outdoor air. Much of that indoor air pollution comes from 
furnishings and building materials. But a lot of it sneaks out of cleaning and 
other household products and lingers, quietly contaminating your air. 
</P>
<P>
 Water quality is another reason to care. Primary and secondary sewage 
treatment are designed to remove solids from your waste water. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, most chemicals from household products swim blithely through, 
untreated, and end up in rivers, lakes and the ocean. Using least-toxic 
products at home will ensure that your household's chemical contribution will 
be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet's first press run is just about sold out. Copies from the second 
printing will be available this month.  
</P>
<P>
 To order a copy of "Buy Smart, Buy Safe," send a check or money order for $5 
(this includes postage) to Washington Toxics Coalition, 4516 University Way 
N.E., Seattle, WA 98105.

GUNMAN DRAWS 4 LIFE TERMS IN MALL ATTACK; VIOLENCE: AFTER AN EMOTIONAL APPEAL 
FROM THE GIRL HE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED, 19-YEAR-OLD DEFENDANT IS SENTENCED TO AT 
LEAST 64 YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
 In an effort to deter gang violence, a Superior Court judge Friday sentenced a 
19-year-old Santa Ana man to four consecutive life terms for shooting into a 
crowd and seriously wounding a 13-year-old girl at the Westminster Mall last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the maximum allowable sentencing imposed by Judge Luis A. Cardenas, 
Phong Thanh Dang will not be eligible for parole for at least 64 years. 
Prosecutors noted that the sentence was one of the harshest ever imposed in 
Orange County in a gang-related, nonfatal shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury found the former La Quinta High school student guilty in August of four 
counts of attempted murder, street terrorism and committing a crime as part of 
gang involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think, Mr. Dang, that I am making an example of you, the answer is yes 
I am," Cardenas said Friday as Dang listened impassively. "I hope you tell your 
buddies in jail what the consequences for this type of nonsense are." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's sentence requires Dang to serve an additional eight-year term 
before his life sentences begin, because he used a handgun and caused great 
bodily injury in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's this type of conduct that brings a community to the edge of anarchy," 
Cardenas added. 
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors, Dang fired at least four shots into a crowd of 
shoppers at the Westminster Mall on July 8, 1993, after receiving a "hard look" 
from another group of young people. During the shooting, a 13-year-old girl was 
struck in the back, while another bullet passed through the pant leg of a 
15-year-old girl, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl wounded in the shooting urged the judge Friday to impose the harshest 
sentence possible on Dang. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish he would go in for as long as possible for what he did to me," said 
Phuong Nguyen, now 14, who battled tears as she read from a brief statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who has recovered physically from her wound, testified the shooting 
has left her with emotional scars: she has trouble eating and sleeping and is 
afraid to go to crowded places. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere I go people know me as the girl who got shot in the mall," she 
said. "Sometimes I wished I would have died at the mall. I have nightmares 
about the shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl and her family declined to comment on the judge's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was entirely appropriate. He was a murderer waiting for a victim," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. David R. LaBahn. "People have a right to be free and safe." 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing, defense attorney Thomas Avdeef asked the judge to order 
another trial for his client. Avdeef argued Dang should be judged on a far less 
serious charge, assault with a deadly weapon, since intent to kill was never 
proved. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas rejected the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Avdeef was unavailable for further comment Friday.

4 SAVED IN NIGHTTIME RESCUE; NAVIGATION: THE FOUNDERING CRAFT WAS JUST TWO FEET 
ABOVE THE WATERLINE WHEN THE HARBOR PATROL ARRIVED. A BOAT THE SALVAGERS WERE 
TOWING DISINTEGRATED. 
</P>

<P>
 Four men on a sinking boat in pitch-black darkness narrowly escaped death 
Friday morning when they were rescued as only two feet of the bow and bridge 
remained above water. 
</P>
<P>
 The men had spent all day Thursday at sea, trying to salvage a boat they were 
towing from Dana Point to Long Beach for use by the Boy Scouts, when their own 
craft suddenly began to sink about 1 a.m. Friday, said William Cape, who runs 
the Sea Scout Boat Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Cape put out an emergency mayday call at 2:09 a.m. as water threatened to 
submerge his 36-foot Chris Craft cabin cruiser. But by the time the Sheriff's 
Department's Harbor Patrol reached the wayward ship at 2:54 a.m., three miles 
offshore between Newport Beach and Laguna Beach, only about two feet of the 
flying bridge and bow remained above water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no crybaby, but it's nothing I care to do again," said Cape, 48, who has 
been boating for two decades. "It was scary-spooky. You think a lot of weird 
things when you're out there in the water. You wonder, 'Are they going to find 
me? Are they going to see me? What am I going to do if the rest of the boat 
goes under?'  
</P>
<P>
 "You know it's going," Cape said, "you just don't know how long before it goes 
the rest of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 All four men were wearing life jackets, but Cape has a tube in his throat to 
help him breathe that malfunctions if water gets inside. Another passenger, 
Gilbert Upchurch, 47, does not know how to swim. 
</P>
<P>
 A long, dark night in the calm, 63-degree water might have killed all four, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what scared was until then. I'm not a person that scares easy, 
but that's a different kind of scared," said Upchurch, who lives in Utah but is 
vacationing in California. "I learned to pray real hard. I got to looking, and 
that's an awful lot of water. That's the first time I was ever glad to see a 
sheriff come." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy Brian Kleeman, one of two officers who rescued the men, said 
the incident was among the most frightening he has seen in 11 years on the 
Harbor Patrol, though no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 It took nearly an hour for Kleeman and his partner, John Luderman, to find the 
sinking boat because Cape had given an incorrect location when he called for 
help. Cape thought he was a mile offshore directly west of Newport Harbor, but 
in fact the boat was about three miles out and 6 1/2 miles southwest of the 
Newport Harbor Patrol station. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they found Cape's crew, Kleeman and Luderman contacted two fishing 
boats that they thought were the sinking craft, and lost all radio and radar 
contact with Cape. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could not find any boat resembling their description in the location they 
said they were in," Kleeman said. Almost by accident, Kleeman followed a 
florescent light that turned out to be the flares and flashlight Cape's crew 
were wildly waving. 
</P>
<P>
 As to what might have happened if the search had been delayed any longer, 
Kleeman said, "I don't even want to think about that part. I'm just real happy 
that it turned out the way it did and that they're OK. That was the key: no 
injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Cape nor police know what went wrong with the cabin cruiser, which 
also had been donated to the Sea Scout Boat Inc. about a year ago, Cape said. 
On Friday, a private towing company hauled the damaged boat to its port in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard spokesman Trent Jones said that white planks believed to belong to 
the sunken boat turned up off the shore of San Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
 Cape's company, Sea Scout Boats, has collected about 100 donated boats and 
refurbished many of them for use by the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and other 
charitable groups.  
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Cape, Upchurch and a volunteer carpenter and mechanic had gone 
to Dana Point to retrieve a leaky boat someone had offered to donate. After 
working on the 33-foot Bellows/Stewart power boat Wednesday night and Thursday 
morning, Cape's crew set off for the six- to eight-hour trek to Long Beach 
about 10 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But two hours into the journey, the smaller boat began to fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter Robert Sage, 47, tried to repair the Bellows/Stewart, but the damage 
grew worse until it disintegrated into "about 5,000 pieces," Cape said. 
Eventually, the crew gave up on saving the smaller boat and concentrated 
instead on plucking chunks of wood and other debris onto their vessel so as not 
to pollute and endanger the waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone was resting from the harrowing day when Cape noticed his own boat 
tilting to one side. He checked the engine room and found water leaking in. 
Within 10 minutes, the water had risen a foot. He called for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just kind of makes you realize how much you depend on everything being 
together and how much you depend on each other," said Sage, of Orange. "I just 
hoped I wouldn't have to swim all the way to shore before we could find 
somebody to help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Cape said he was thinking of the movie "Jaws" as he huddled on the footbridge 
waiting for the rescue boat. Upchurch was busy reviewing his life's memories. 
Sage and Robert Santora, the mechanic, were busy worrying about Upchurch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't bother me," said Santora, 55, of Long Beach. "I can swim . . . I'm 
the type that swims out beyond the limit anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Sage: "Now I'm looking forward to the next great adventure." The Sunken 
and the Saved 
</P>
<P>
 Four men were rescued after one boat sank without warning and another was on 
the verge of sinking off the coast near Newport Harbor early Friday. What is 
known so far: The boats: A 33-foot, wooden Bellows / Stewart built in 1920s 
disintergrated; a 36-foot wooden Chris Craft cabin cruiser built in 1963 was 
damaged but saved. What happened: The Chris Craft was towing the Bellows / 
Stewart from Dana Point to Long Beach for repairs. The Bellows / Stewart began 
falling apart and ultimatel disintergrated. After spending hours trying to 
repair the Bellows / Stewart and then picking pieces of it out of the water, 
the Cris Craft crew found that their own vessel had begun to sink. The 
aftermath: Debris of the Bellows / Stewart is floating on the water; the Chris 
Craft was towed by a private company to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were checked for injuries by the Harbor Patrol and released 
without treatment. Source: Orange County Sheriff's Harbor Patrol Chris Craft

MOTHER QUESTIONS POLICE SHOOTING; INVESTIGATION: PLACENTIA OFFICERS SAY THEY 
OPENED FIRE WHEN BLAKE LUNDQUIST TRIED TO RUN THEM OVER. HIS MOTHER ALLEGES 
THAT 'THEY MURDERED MY SON FOR NO REASON.' 
</P>

 The mother of a young man shot to death Thursday by Placentia police says she 
doesn't believe police claims that he tried to run over one of their officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a sweet, kind, gentle person with a family that loved him," Skipi 
Lundquist Smoot, a clinical psychologist in Laguna Niguel, said of her son, 
Blake Lundquist, 24. "He was a child; he hadn't even lived yet. They had no 
right to murder him in cold blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Corinne Loomis, a spokeswoman for the Placentia Police Department, 
declined to discuss the case Friday, pending the outcome of an investigation by 
the district attorney's office. A spokesman for the district attorney's office 
also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a short press release issued by the police, Lundquist, a 
part-time carpenter with a 5-year-old daughter, was killed about 1:30 p.m. 
during a police "surveillance" near Musial Street and McCormack Lane, a few 
blocks from the rented house Lundquist shared with his girlfriend. While police 
were trying to "make contact" with him, the press release said, "the suspect 
attempted to run over one of the officers. Both officers fired their weapons. 
The suspect sustained a gunshot wound." Police would not say what they were 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoot said she believes the police may have been looking for illegal drugs. 
But while Lundquist had been convicted twice of drug charges since 1991 and was 
still on parole after a year in prison for the last conviction, his mother 
said, "he had paid the price for it and he was home and he was trying to make 
something of himself. He was trying to become a good father to his little 
girl," who lives with her mother, Lundquist's former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday morning, she said, Lundquist and his girlfriend had risen early 
and gone out for breakfast. Returning home about 9:30, she said, they took a 
nap. Then Lundquist took a shower and told his girlfriend that he was going to 
visit a friend a few blocks away and would be right back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half an hour later she heard sirens," Smoot said. "A friend told a friend, 
who told her that they thought Blake had been shot by the police." 
</P>
<P>
 Smoot, who said she talked to witnesses, said she believes that her son was 
pulled over by two undercover officers while driving his Toyota truck. For some 
reason, she said, he apparently panicked and tried to drive away, whereupon one 
or both of the officers shot him in the head, chest and hand through the 
driver's-side window. He was not on drugs and was not armed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he'd been trying to run them over they would have shot him from the 
front," she said. "I don't have any problem with thinking they were 
investigating a drug deal over there, but they murdered my son for no reason. 
Even if he was trying to get away, that's no reason to kill him."

NEWSPAPER DRAWS LATINO STUDENTS' IRE; JOURNALISM: A CAL STATE FULLERTON 
ORGANIZATION PROTESTS THAT A COLUMNIST POKED FUN AT THEIR EFFORT TO RENAME A 
BUILDING AFTER CESAR E. CHAVEZ. THE EDITOR, A LATINA, DEFENDS HER PUBLICATION. 
</P>

<P>
 A joke playing off the name of late labor leader Cesar E. Chavez in a recent 
issue of Cal State Fullerton's student newspaper has reignited tension between 
a Mexican American student group and the publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA) complained to 
Daily Titan Executive Editor Annette Chavez after sports columnist Adam Rank 
poked fun at MEChA's campaign to rename a campus building after the labor 
leader, who died April 23, 1993. Students held a rally in May to support 
renaming the student services building after Chavez, who is internationally 
recognized as a crusader for farm workers' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that (professional boxer) Julio Cesar Chavez has beaten Meldrick Taylor, 
do you think there will be more marches to name University Hall after him?" 
Rank wrote in his Sept. 23 column. "He won. Can we eat grapes again?" 
</P>
<P>
 Letters from MEChA members in response to the column appeared Friday in the 
Daily Titan. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Hernandez, who wrote one of the letters, used boxing imagery to make 
the point that MEChA members will not relent in their activism. "If the Daily 
Titan decides to have front-row seats," she wrote, then "you and your paper 
better be prepared for blood, sweat and spit slapping you in the face!" 
</P>
<P>
 Rank was not available for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Editor Chavez said she was chilled by the letter but did not report it to 
campus police. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said Friday that she did not mean the letter as a threat, but just 
wanted to make clear that Latino students will continue to fight for their 
cause. And the comment in Rank's column was inexcusable, said Hernandez, who is 
chairwoman of the campus Chicano Studies Student Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 MEChA secretary Dulce Medina wrote another of the letters. "We as Chicanos 
don't think the joke was funny," she said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez said she allowed the joke to be published even though she expected an 
angry response. 
</P>
<P>
 "I chose to run it anyway, and, although I didn't plan on having to defend my 
education or heritage because of it, I would still run it again," Chavez, who 
is Mexican American, wrote in an editorial published Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar E. Chavez, the editorial states, was a "great historical figure," and 
Rank's joking comments about him "were not harmful, libelous, not to mention 
even significant compared to the thousands of other words we published in that 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, she further defended her decision: "The joke was not about 
Cesar Chavez and did not belittle him," she said. "It was just a dumb joke." 
</P>
<P>
 MEChA members have differed with the newspaper in the past, Chavez said. Last 
year, for example, some students were upset when a review of a Mexican 
restaurant made light of meats such as beef tongue, which is used in Mexican 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina said the newspaper does not portray MEChA fairly and does not write 
about MEChA's volunteer work, such as inviting high school students to visit 
the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez said the Daily Titan has a minority-affairs reporter and covers events 
of special interest to Mexican Americans, including Latino Heritage Month 
events in October.

BRITISH PROFESSOR WATCHES HIS LANGUAGE IN JOB SWAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To his Oxnard College students, David Frayne seems like a typical instructor, 
except for the clipped British accent and occasional unfamiliar idiom. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Frayne, a visiting business professor in the Fulbright Scholar 
Exchange Program, monitoring his dialect is the simplest of changes in his 
yearlong transition from southern England to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talk much slower to my students, and I make a point of being clear in my 
language," he said. "And I'm still trying to erase my vernacular English." 
</P>
<P>
 Frayne swapped the countryside of Sussex County for the Oxnard Plain in 
August, when he traded places with Oxnard College instructor Linda Crowl. She 
is spending the year teaching Frayne's classes at the Brighton College of 
Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 He stepped off a plane in San Francisco with his wife, Julie, and their two 
daughters on Aug. 6, before driving down the coast to begin his Fulbright 
exchange at Oxnard College a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 1994-95 school year, Frayne will be living in Crowl's house, driving 
her car and teaching in her classrooms. Meanwhile, about 6,000 miles away, in 
Brighton, England, Crowl is doing the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleasantly surprised by how well-behaved the students are," said Frayne, 
44. "I had heard stories about the high school model of students." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the students in his introduction to business, business math and 
business accounting classes are more diligent in their studies than their 
British counterparts, Frayne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mature class is more motivated," he said. "The older a student is, the 
more motivated because they're more concerned about their future." 
</P>
<P>
 Frayne admits he is a little fuzzy on the details of American business 
practices. In class on Wednesday, he was stumped when a student asked him the 
capital-gains tax rate in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've been able to bring my own experience and knowledge of the subjects 
to them," he said of his students. "I suppose I (bring) European and English 
flavors to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Students in his introductory business class agreed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's excellent," said Adriana Gutierrez, a 25-year-old business major 
from Oxnard. "He's got different points of view about the American ways of 
doing business and the English ways. I'm learning both, so it's kind of an 
advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Stevens of Ventura said Frayne is one of his more helpful instructors. 
"Things he doesn't know he is willing to take the time to find out," the 
30-year-old business major said. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Frayne is a marriage counselor at home in Brighton. But she has been 
unable so far to find any work in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different being here for a year than just on holiday," she said. "When 
you're on holiday, you're not getting homesick because you know you're going 
home soon." 
</P>
<P>
 But she is keeping busy, taking care of the couple's daughters, Emma, 11, and 
Alexandra, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've also joined the Gold Coast Choir, and I'm planning to do some volunteer 
work," she said. "It's all part of finding a way to get a place in the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 There is one aspect of the Southern California lifestyle that Frayne is still 
getting used to: having to drive virtually everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent trip to Downtown Los Angeles, David Frayne and his family missed 
the turnoff to the federal immigration office, prompting a lengthy diversion 
through some of the less-glamorous neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The freeways took a bit of getting used to," he said. "You have to be very 
focused on where you're going."

1ST MEDFLIES IN COUNTY DISCOVERED BY TRAPPERS; AGRICULTURE: QUARANTINE DECLARED 
ON FRUIT IN VICINITY WHERE TWO FERTILE FEMALE INSECTS WERE FOUND. FARMERS FEAR 
PESTS MAY THREATEN PROFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two fertile female Medflies -- the dreaded pests that devour soft fruit and 
destroy grower profits -- were captured Friday morning near a stand of 
Camarillo fig trees, marking the first time trappers have found the insects in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of the two Medflies drowned in the yeasty brew at the bottom of 
a glass-bottle trap horrified farmers, who fear the voracious pests could take 
a huge bite out of the county's $848-million agricultural industry. The 
blue-eyed insects, which sport distinctive brown-and-clear-striped wings, have 
already invaded much of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few things scare me as much as this," citrus grower Ken Gerry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medflies prefer to feast on soft fruits, such as plums and grapes. But they 
also burrow into strawberries, lemons, oranges and even avocados -- all key 
revenue-producing crops for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, even two dead Medflies present a major threat. Especially since 1,000 
live flies usually lurk nearby for every one captured in a trap, according to 
Rex Laird, executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medflies are worrisome, not just because of their appetite, but because of 
their reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 They bore into fruit and chomp through the tender flesh inside. They do not 
destroy trees, but they can tear up a whole crop. And they are so feared that 
once one fertile Medfly is found in a region, fruit from the entire area 
becomes suspect -- even if it's certified pest-free. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not good news. It will definitely be a public-relations challenge," said 
Stan Zervas of the Fillmore Insectary. 
</P>
<P>
 The county immediately slapped a quarantine on all fruit within a 4 1/2-mile 
radius of the Medfly discovery site, northeast of Upland and Lewis roads at the 
campus of St. John's Seminary in Camarillo.

 The quarantine zone includes several citrus groves, some row-crop vegetables 
and one strawberry field. For an unspecified period, fruit from those ranches 
will be banned from shipment, said Libby Ouellette, an insectary supervisor at 
Oxnard Pest Control and a member of the county's Medfly task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting this morning, county pest experts will hand-spray a blend of poison 
and bait on foliage within 200 meters of the discovery site. The spray mixes 
the chemical malathion, which kills adult Medflies, with sweet-smelling corn 
syrup, which should lure the insects to the site and dupe them into drinking 
the toxic pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors might notice droplets of the sticky pinkish-brown brew clinging to 
foliage. But Ouellette said the spraying would be minimal and it is safe to 
walk through the affected foliage immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 County workers will also fan out and set thousands of additional traps, made 
of square yellow paper coated with a sticky bait, in an attempt to discover 
just how many Medflies might have made it into Ventura County.  
</P>
<P>
 But those measures did not reassure farmers whose livelihood rests on 
untainted crops -- and overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese government has repeatedly threatened to boycott California crops 
if the Medfly infestation spreads. Already, the pest has been detected in Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and more than 1,500 
square miles in Southern California are under quarantine. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Friday's find in Ventura County marks an alarming foray north for the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major concern," agricultural consultant David Holden said late Friday. 
"We've all been on the phone for the past two hours, talking to each other and 
trading what we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Subduing Medflies is especially tough, Holden said, because they reproduce 
amazingly fast in warm weather, spawning eight generations a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not that hard to kill, but the problem is, they're so prolific. They 
reproduce so quickly that you soon have generations upon generations to kill," 
Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 To combat the voracious pest, the state has been releasing millions of sterile 
Medflies into the Los Angeles Basin each week, hoping they will mate with 
fertile females and winnow the ranks of future generations. Officials also 
sprayed malathion over the Riverside County cities of Corona and Norco last 
winter to kill the adult Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
 After more intensive investigation, including scrutiny of the 5,000 Medfly 
traps scattered around Ventura County, state officials will determine what 
other steps to take. 
</P>
<P>
 They could order heavier spraying, an expanded quarantine or more intense 
trapping. Whatever the decision, however, farmers said they fear Ventura County 
fruit will get a bad name -- even if no other Medflies are found in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just afraid the Japanese will shut their market right away," said grower 
Gerry, whose 60-acre lemon ranch lies within the quarantine zone, about three 
miles east of the discovery site.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 30% of Ventura County's fresh lemons are shipped to Japan, Laird said. 
Lemons brought in more than $166 million to the county last year, and a 
Japanese embargo could be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 Other citrus would suffer along with lemons. One study conducted by the 
University of California at Berkeley earlier this year estimated that an Asian 
boycott of the state's produce would slash in half revenues for Valencia 
oranges -- Ventura County's fifth-most lucrative crop. 
</P>
<P>
 And growers shut out of Asia would be forced to peddle their produce 
domestically, thereby glutting the market and driving down prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a double whammy," Laird said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Medfly infestation would hurt more than the growers' pocketbooks. Already, 
one pest-control expert reported that growers in the quarantine area have 
canceled orders for fall insecticide spraying because they do not want to waste 
money on a worthless crop. Packinghouses, trucking companies, irrigation firms 
and other support industries would suffer as well if the infestation grows. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't realize how much of every dollar that goes through this state is 
developed because of agriculture," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials are pleading with residents to respect the quarantine and 
leave home-grown fruit in their back yards.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would think in our county, everybody would cooperate with us," McPhail 
said. "Because the faster we get this thing eradicated, the less consternation 
it's going to cause everybody." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 To control Medflies, residents in the Camarillo area should leave all 
home-grown produce in their back yards. Growers or residents who discover 
maggots in fruit should contact the Medfly Project at (800) 491-1899. The 
county will hold an informational meeting on the Medfly at 10 a.m Tuesday at 
the Santa Paula Community Center.

GOLF COURSE SUGGESTED FOR AIRPORT USE; POINT MUGU: TERMINAL WOULD BE ON BASE 
LAND. THE STUDY ON PROPOSED CIVILIAN-MILITARY FACILITY SURPRISES PANEL AND NAVY 
OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A plan to develop a civilian-military airport at the Point Mugu Navy base may 
be imperiled if a consultant's recommendation -- which would put the passenger 
terminal on Navy property -- is followed, members of the committee 
investigating the proposal said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Point Mugu Joint Use Airfield Investigative Committee and Navy 
officials said they were caught off guard by a newly released feasibility study 
that recommended putting a passenger and air-cargo terminal on a 98-acre, 
nine-hole golf course on the base.  
</P>
<P>
 The Navy has said it will not consider a plan in which military land is used. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three sites considered, the base's John E. Clark golf course is 
best-suited for the terminal facility, according to the study by consultants 
with the Southern California Assn. of Governments. The feasibility study was 
commissioned by the investigative committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Although two other sites were considered, the SCAG report recommended only the 
golf course site. 
</P>
<P>
 The second site was a 64-acre parcel immediately north of the main runway, of 
which the Navy owns approximately 13 1/2 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 The third site, which also totals 64 acres and is on the base's northeastern 
border, would involve the use of 14 acres of Navy property.  
</P>
<P>
 The second and third options would require the purchase of additional 
property, including parcels of farmland and parts of a nearby trailer park, the 
report said. A taxiway to the main runway would also have to be constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the eight-person investigative committee, which includes three 
county supervisors and several members of local city councils, said they were 
surprised with the study's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may well be a fatal flaw, I don't know," said County Supervisor Maggie 
Kildee. "I'm also a little shocked that someone didn't think to include the 
Navy's warning in the study." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her colleague on the board, County Supervisor John K. Flynn, agreed, saying 
that although the golf course may be the logical and best choice for a 
passenger terminal facility, it would be unwise to pursue the development at 
that location, given the Navy's stance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that it would be a serious political mistake to go after the golf 
course," Flynn said. "I think what we should do is go after developing the site 
closer to the (Pacific Coast) highway and the Air National Guard base. I think 
that area would be far easier to develop." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Merwin, chief aviation analyst for SCAG, said that because land just 
outside the base would have to be purchased and because it is further from the 
main runway, the golf course was the best choice, despite the Navy's admonition 
that it would not give up the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Merwin could not explain why the study failed to note the Navy's opposition to 
any of its land on the base being developed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Merwin and Thousand Oaks City Councilman Frank Schillo said they believed 
the Navy might ultimately soften its position on the development of land within 
the base's perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy for years said they didn't want civilians flying in and out of their 
airfield and then, suddenly, last year they changed their minds," Schillo said. 
"I believe that it's very possible for them to change their minds on this 
issue, too. If they don't, I think we have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In March 1993, when Rear Adm. Bill Newman, then Point Mugu's commanding 
officer, invited county officials to his office to discuss the possibility of 
developing a joint military and civilian use airfield, he announced that the 
proposal came with four caveats, said Navy spokesman Alan Alpers. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpers said Newman pledged that the Navy would not fund the effort, that 
private aircraft would not be allowed on the airfield, that the shared use 
would not affect the base's military mission and that no Navy land would be 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 19 months later, Alpers said the Navy has not changed its mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were surprised to see the (golf course) recommended as strongly as it was 
in the report," said Navy Capt. Tom Boothe, the non-voting chairman of the 
investigative committee. "The Navy prefers that none of its land be used. It's 
not that we like golf so much, it's the fact that the course represents one of 
the last sites we have that can be developed by the Navy." 
</P>
<P>
 But because the proposal is still in an embryonic stage, Boothe, who is the 
base's public works officer, refused to immediately condemn the study's 
recommended terminal locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to jealously guard the land that we have left," Boothe said. 
"(The committee) can recommend whatever it wants and we will look at anything 
they put in front of us. However, that doesn't mean that we have to accept 
their recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigative committee will consider adopting the findings of the first 
phase of the SCAG feasibility report at its meeting next month. Officials said 
the second phase of the report, to be issued in late December or early January, 
will address the proposal's environmental impact, funding mechanisms and 
land-planning issues. Proposed Regional Airport

WIDENING OF INTERCHANGE CONSIDERED; VENTURA FREEWAY: COUNCIL MONDAY WILL VOTE 
ON A CALTRANS PROPOSAL AIMED AT UNCLOGGING ONE OF THE MOST CONGESTED AREAS IN 
VENTURA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to unclog one of the city's most congested intersections, the 
Ventura City Council will vote Monday on Caltrans' latest proposal to widen the 
Seaward Avenue-Ventura Freeway interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 As drafted by the California Department of Transportation, the expanded 
interchange would replace an older proposal to build an on-ramp a quarter of a 
mile away at Peninsula Street, which was dropped because of neighborhood 
opposition. The council vote would pave the way for Caltrans to begin work on 
the project, estimated to cost $7.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 City traffic engineer Nazir Lalani said the widened intersection would include 
state-of-the-art video surveillance equipment that would eventually allow the 
intersection to control itself, adjusting green-light times by automatically 
"seeing" how many cars are backed up at the lights. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, construction is scheduled to begin in 1997 on the project, which 
would increase the number of lanes on the Seaward Avenue bridge over the 
freeway from five to eight. Plans also call for adding two lanes to the 
northbound Ventura Freeway off-ramp and to northbound Harbor Boulevard at 
Seaward Avenue, and for adding another left-turn lane to southbound Harbor 
Boulevard at Seaward Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Rick Holland said construction should be completed two 
years after it begins. The work would be done in stages, and the interchange 
would never be completely closed, Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the plan to widen the Seaward Avenue interchange can be 
completed faster and at a lower cost to the city than the construction of a new 
on-ramp at Peninsula Street, as was initially proposed. The Peninsula Street 
plan would have required the city to acquire a new right of way and complete an 
environmental impact report, delaying construction and risking loss of state 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula Street residents support the new plan, which removes the threat of a 
new on-ramp bringing additional traffic to their street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really pleased with it," resident Jim Clark said. "It's by far the better 
way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Doubletree Hotel manager John Walters said he initially favored the Peninsula 
Street alternative, but now supports the plan to widen the Seaward Avenue 
interchange. He said he is pleased that construction will be completed three to 
five years sooner under the revised plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traffic trying to get down to the beaches and the harbor is obviously very 
congested and we welcome every improvement," Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to expanding the interchange, the City Council resolution provides 
for enclosing drainage ditches that are now open along the freeway. Parking on 
Harbor Boulevard would be forbidden from Seaward Avenue to 1,000 feet east of 
the intersection, and the Seaward Avenue bridge would be fortified to withstand 
a sizable earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The project includes high-tech electronics along with the steel and concrete. 
City traffic engineer Lalani said video cameras mounted on the traffic lights 
at the interchange would allow the city to monitor the intersection and adjust 
the timing of the lights from minute to minute. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be about 10 years before a computer program allows the video image of 
the intersection to control the traffic lights with no human intervention, 
Lalani predicted. In the meantime, video monitoring will allow traffic 
officials to detect and correct problems before residents complain, he said. 
Interchange Expansion Proposed changes to Seaward Avenue / Ventura Freeway 
interchange and Harbor Boulevard. Changes: 1. Add two lanes. 2. Widen bridge to 
eight lanes. 3. Add left-turn lane. 4. Add two lanes.

EX-SHERIFF'S SUPERVISOR CHANGES PLEA IN THEFT CASE; COURTS: HE INITIALLY 
PLEADED GUILTY TO A FELONY INVOLVING A GUN. BUT THE JUDGE NOW SAYS HE CAN'T 
REDUCE THE CONVICTION TO A MISDEMEANOR. 
</P>

<P>
 A former Sheriff's Department supervisor who pleaded guilty to stealing a gun 
from the evidence locker after being promised it would only mean a misdemeanor 
conviction -- and not a felony -- learned Friday that the deal was off. 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking a guilty plea from Norman A. Wade on Sept. 2, Acting Superior 
Court Judge Bruce A. Clark said he discovered that state law does not permit 
judges to cut such deals in cases involving stolen firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade, 49, had pleaded guilty to felony grand theft for stealing a gun from the 
property room and selling it at an Oxnard pawn shop for $125. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said probation officials recently informed him that the state 
Legislature stripped judges of the authority to reduce grand theft cases 
involving firearms from felonies three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat apologetically, Clark informed Wade that he had a legal right to 
withdraw his guilty plea since the court could not keep its word on reducing 
the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade immediately withdrew his guilty plea because he said a felony conviction 
could cause him to lose his job as a toxicologist with Arizona's Maricopa 
County medical examiner. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark set an Oct. 31 jury trial in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, who had objected to the plea agreement, were pleased with the 
day's events. Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert D. Meyers said Wade should be convicted 
of a felony because he had violated a position of trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a job that required him to be ethical, honest and truthful," Meyers 
argued outside court. "Obviously, stealing county property is not ethical." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert I. Schwartz, Wade's attorney, left the courtroom without commenting on 
his client's case. Schwartz could not be reached later for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade joined the Ventura County Sheriff's Department crime lab in June, 1990. 
He was forced to resign in June, 1992, after pleading no contest in an 
unrelated prosecution to charges that he stole a license plate registration 
sticker from the property room and falsified registration documents for his own 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 He was fined $300 and sentenced to two years' probation in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 A subsequent audit of a gun locker in the property room found a .357 magnum 
pistol missing. Recalling Wade's court case, detectives checked pawn slips that 
shops in Ventura County register with police agencies and traced the gun to 
Wade. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade had sold the gun to Get-More Loan & Jewelry in Oxnard in May, 1991, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators suspected Wade in the theft of other items from the property 
room, including jewelry, cash and a camera. But the pawned gun was the only 
item prosecutors could link to the former Sheriff's Department supervisor, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Clark promised to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor, Wade entered 
his guilty plea to the felony charge. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the judge called the case at Friday's sentencing hearing, he 
immediately told Wade that a mistake had been made. Clark said a probation 
report prepared for the case pointed out that, while judges can reduce 
convictions in grand theft cases, that is not an option if the stolen item is a 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers said prosecutors did not believe the plea agreement was appropriate 
when it was signed. That was confirmed, he said, when probation officials 
researched the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade faces up to three years in prison if convicted on the felony. 
</P>
<P>
 The misdemeanor conviction carried a lighter term -- no more than a year in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Wade's case, sheriff's officials say they have improved security of the 
property room.

 Two residents appeared before City Council members this week, urging them not 
to endorse Proposition 187, the initiative that would deny education, social 
services and all but emergency medical care to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, at its Sept. 12 meeting, heard a supporter of Proposition 187 
urge the council to give its endorsement to the measure.The council deferred 
action pending receipt of the full text of the initiative. But three council 
members spoke that night in favor of doing something to control illegal 
immigration, and no member spoke against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 But Father Mike Heher, pastor of St. Irenaeus Church in Cypress, on Monday 
offered the council 10 reasons not to endorse the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Heher's arguments included contentions that the initiative would not solve 
problems and might increase them. "We could lose 15 billion tax dollars because 
the proposition is at odds with federal law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heher also told council members that "you are well aware that denying benefits 
to non-citizens will not solve California's troubles." 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Carolyn Pryor, who also spoke against Proposition 187, told the 
council that the initiative "will cost us more money than it will ever save."  
</P>
<P>
 Monday night's council agenda did not include discussion of the initiative, 
and no council member commented about Heher's or Pryor's remarks. BILL BILLITER

<P>
 Beach Boulevard and Katella Avenue are now officially designated as "smart 
streets" under an amendment to the city's General Plan approved by the City 
Council last week. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the new designations were made to comply with the county's 
Master Plan of arterial highways, which is updated periodically to reflect 
street changes, such as lane additions and other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart streets, formerly called super streets, provide six to eight lanes of 
divided roadway with coordinated traffic signals, bus turnouts, no on-street 
parking and other modifications to increase the flow of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella Avenue is a six-lane divided smart street and Beach Boulevard is an 
eight-lane divided smart street.  
</P>
<P>
 Major arterials provide six-lane, divided highways that motorists use to 
travel from one community to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster Avenue and Fairview Road, both with three lanes in each direction, 
also are now considered major arterials, officials said.BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; MEASURE A DRAWS FIRE ON COUNCIL

 The City Council turned thumbs down on Measure A this week, a November 
initiative asking voters to require that a commercial airport be built at the 
El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 After unanimously passing a resolution against the ballot measure, council 
members called on the Irvine Co. to abandon its neutrality and oppose the 
countywide Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. should "come out and let us know where they truly stand on this 
issue, which is backed by the largest landowners in Orange County," said 
Councilwoman Paula Werner. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Christina L. Shea said the council's opposition to Measure A 
should not be interpreted as a vote either for or against a commercial airport 
at the military base. Council members are supporting the continuing study of 
potential uses for the Marine base by the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should support ballot box planning," Mayor Michael Ward 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Irvine Co. officials say they will not take a position on the ballot 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have taken no position on Measure A and we do not expect to do so," said 
Irvine Co. spokeswoman Dawn McCormick. "It's an issue best left to the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Werner argues that the Irvine Co. has a stake in defeating Measure A. Traffic 
and noise in the city could increase dramatically with a commercial airport 
nearby, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Irvine Co. is the landowner who has believed in having a planned 
community," Werner said. "This initiative takes away a lot of our planning 
authority and would preclude our ability to look at all the uses for El Toro."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: STANTON; 2ND SUSPECT IN LAUNDRY SLAYING HELD 
</P>

<P>
 Sheriff's investigators have arrested another suspect in connection with a 
fatal shooting at a Laundromat earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Mac Taula, 24, a transient, was arrested in the killing of Efrain 
Lobiono Rojas, 20, on May 23, according to Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 Rojas, 20, bleeding from wounds, was found on the floor of a Laundromat in the 
8900 block of Pacific Street about 9:30 p.m., police said. He died early the 
next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide detectives learned that the shooting was a result of a gang 
confrontation, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were led to Taula by Paul Siliga, 22, who was arrested on May 25 for 
having a firearm, a violation of his parole, Martini said. Siliga was later 
taken to Avenal State Prison in Kings County. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believed that Siliga was responsible for the shooting, and later 
identified Taula as a second suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office filed murder complaints against 
both Siliga and Taula early this week, leading to Taula's arrest. Taula is 
being held in the Orange County Jail on $250,000 bail, Martini said. MARK

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: DANA POINT; DELAY NOT EXPECTED TO AFFECT ROAD'S OPENING 
</P>

<P>
 Work crews repairing the La Ventana landslide area above Pacific Coast Highway 
are 10 to 14 days behind schedule, but that should not delay the January 
opening of the roadway, Dana Point officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent, brief landslide at the top of the newly constructed 75-foot bluff 
made it necessary to do some additional demolition this week on two of the 
homes that were destroyed in the 1993 slide, said Andy Anderson, the city's 
emergency services coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (new slide) was not something that came as a surprise," Anderson said. 
"But it was something we hoped would not occur. It was just one of those things 
decided by Mother Nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said the city and the contractor had expected some shifting of the 
reconstructed hillside.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the time spent on the recent slide and the additional demolition "can 
be made up during the next few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent slide undermined some of the remaining pieces of the two homes and 
left them hanging over the bluff top, with the crews working on the hillside 
below. 
</P>
<P>
 "That created a threat to the safety of the workers, and we couldn't have 
that," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight bluff-top homes were destroyed by the landslide on the night of Feb. 22, 
1993, when about 40,000 tons of dirt and debris cascaded down to Pacific Coast 
Highway, which has been closed to traffic ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of negotiations with the homeowners, the California Department of 
Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration, the city of Dana Point 
in June hired Santa Ana-based Sukut Construction Inc. to repair the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of concrete anchors will be embedded in the hillside, and the entire 
area will be landscaped and covered with a foot-thick concrete retainer 
sculpted to look like the natural bluff. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Pacific Coast Highway is part of the federal highway system, the 
federal government is funding the majority of the $3.1-million project. LEN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; RECYCLED GOODS ON CITY'S SHOPPING 
LIST

 Thousand Oaks managers will scour the stores to buy recycled memo pads, 
business cards, post-it notes and scissors, now that council members have 
approved new purchasing guidelines designed to limit waste. 
</P>
<P>
 To help build a market for recycled goods, council members are urging city 
buyers to look for products made from recycled material -- even if they cost 
slightly more.Compliance is voluntary, but officials expect widespread 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work of our recycling group has just been tremendous," City Manager Grant 
Brimhall said. "It's really exciting to see what kind of recycled materials we 
have to use." 
</P>
<P>
 The purchasing guidelines approved earlier this week also encourage 
contractors and consultants to use recycled paper and, where possible, other 
recycled products when dealing with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks already uses recycled paper in the city print shop, and has 
installed benches and trash cans made from recycled plastic milk jugs. The same 
plastic lumber has been crafted into wheel stops in the Civic Arts Plaza 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "So if you damage your car," Mayor Alex Fiore quipped, "it's no use crying 
over spilled milk." STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SPRINKLERS DAMPEN RESTAURANT ARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire sprinklers foiled two attempts by an arsonist Friday to burn down a Simi 
Valley restaurant that has been vacant since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone smashed a window at Tony Roma's A Place for Ribs, reached through to 
open a locked door, then lit separate fires in the downstairs bar and upstairs 
banquet room, said Capt. Keith Mashburn of the Ventura County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A California Highway Patrol officer driving past the restaurant on the Simi 
Valley Freeway saw the smoke and called the Fire Department just before 4 p.m. 
Friday, Mashburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within four minutes, firefighters arrived and began dousing flames in the 
smoke-filled building, he said. A second alarm was called 18 minutes later, 
putting a total of about 30 firefighters inside the restaurant to finish the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears the sprinklers held the fire so we could get to it and put it 
out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 County arson investigators are still looking into the exact cause of the 
fires, he said. MACK REED

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 3 YOUTHS ARRESTED IN CAR BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Thousand Oaks teen-agers arrested early Friday may have burglarized 
hundreds of cars owned by Ventura County residents over the past month, 
sheriff's deputies said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in Thousand Oaks, Oak Park, Simi Valley, Moorpark, Camarillo and 
Agoura have been asked to call the East County Sheriff's Station if they are 
missing stereos, credit cards, money, garage-door openers or other items from 
their cars or garages, Detective Joe Braga said. 
</P>
<P>
 The theft ring came to light early Friday when a resident of Myrtle Court in 
Oak Park called sheriff's deputies to report seeing three youths using 
flashlights to look into cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Vaijai,19, was arrested about 3 a.m. when deputies stopped his car and 
questioned him, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two juvenile boys, ages 16 and 17, were also taken into custody. Their names 
were not released because of their ages, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Braga said the teen-agers admitted they have been stealing from cars and 
garages for at least a month. They would slip out of their homes after midnight 
and begin prowling the streets for cars that were unlocked, Braga said. 
</P>
<P>
 If they found a garage-door opener in the car, they would use it to open the 
garage, Braga said. Then they would wait 45 minutes, and if no one emerged from 
the home to shut the door, the suspects stole whatever caught their eye, Braga 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths hit as many as 20 cars a night, Braga said. During their Friday 
morning spree alone, they burglarized as many as 18 cars, detectives estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday afternoon, only two victims had called the East County Sheriff's 
Station to report thefts or damage, Braga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Braga can be reached at 494-8201 or 494-8200. KAY SAILLANT

<P>
 The Los Angeles Times gave $46,000 Friday to eight Ventura County 
organizations as part of $225,000 distributed to help with recovery from the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The contributions were funded by the proceeds of The Times' book, "4:31: 
Images of the 1994 Los Angeles Earthquake," which sold more than 100,000 
copies.The paperback book is a history of the quake's devastation depicted in 
essays and photographs by the paper's editorial staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 29 organizations from the San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles, Ventura 
County and Santa Monica received grants that ranged from $5,000 to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, the groups that received money were the Fillmore Towne 
Theater, Food Share, Mano Y Mano, Our Lutheran Social Services, Samaritan 
Center in Simi Valley, Simi Valley Historical Society and the Thousand Oaks 
Library Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards were presented Friday during a luncheon at The Times' San Fernando 
Valley Edition plant in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim King, a representative of the Simi Valley Family YMCA, said the money 
would "go a long way toward paying the bills we incurred" in helping earthquake 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 With Friday's donations, The Times and its parent company, Times Mirror, have 
contributed nearly $500,000 to earthquake recovery efforts. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SPENDING CAP URGED IN AUDITOR'S RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rival candidate Richard Morrisset has called on Ventura County's appointed 
incumbent Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon to set a spending cap of $15,000 
apiece on the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrisset, who will face Mahon in the Nov. 8 election, said the amount would 
be more than enough for each candidate to run a competitive race.At the same 
time, he said it would demonstrate their commitment to being fiscally 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great way to show the public who can control expenditures," said 
Morrisset, who owns a Camarillo accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mahon said the spending limit would only hamper his campaign, making it 
more difficult to educate county voters on the auditor's job and about him. In 
addition to monitoring spending, the auditor-controller prepares the county's 
payroll and budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're running for office, I think you have a responsibility to do 
whatever you can to get your message out," said Mahon, who was appointed 
auditor-controller last year by the Board of Supervisors after serving 20 years 
as assistant auditor. CARLOS V. LOZANO

<P>
 A 26-year-old Moorpark man who has been unconscious since he hit his head 
during a fall in a concrete drainage ditch last weekend remains hospitalized 
and has fallen into extremely critical condition, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Soto is in the intensive care ward of Simi Valley Hospital, where he 
was admitted Sunday with a severe head injury, hospital officials and police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto apparently hit the back of his head when he fell while trying to climb 
through the Arroyo Simi Flood Control Channel that cuts through Moorpark, 
Ventura County Sheriff's Deputy Ernest Montagna said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soto was conscious but barely coherent when officers arrived at the scene, but 
later fell unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 His condition worsened toward the end of the week. MAIA DAVIS

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CITY COUNCIL OKS COLLEGE SWAP MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A community swap meet will be allowed to operate at Saddleback College, the 
City Council decided this week. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials said they will have the first swap meet on the weekend of 
Nov. 12 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members were impressed by the planning for parking, traffic and 
security that went into the proposal, presented on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a doubting Thomas at the beginning of the process," said Councilman 
Robert D. Breton. "I thought (the swap meet) was dead on arrival. I have slowly 
been convinced." 
</P>
<P>
 Several business owners had expressed concern that the swap meet would take 
business away from local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Planning Commission called for an independent study that concluded 
the swap meet would not draw customers away from existing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mission Viejo Chamber of Commerce expressed its support for the outdoor 
event at the council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Approving the swap meet required that the council amend the city General Plan 
to allow the sale of used goods at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials said proceeds from the swap meet will be used to support 
student activities and other needs at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the second time the college has tried sponsoring a swap meet. The 
first attempt in 1986 failed for business reasons after less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Berkery, a former Saddleback College Foundation president, said the swap 
meet is "an excellent opportunity to raise funds that are so hard to come by 
for the college." FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: STATE CURFEW LAW DRAWS HIGH PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBBIE KONG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contending that the control of young people is primarily a parent's 
responsibility, Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) on Friday lauded a new 
state law that will fine parents of curfew violators as much as $250. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, signed by Gov. Pete Wilson earlier this week, permits local law 
enforcement agencies to enforce curfews by transporting minors to the custody 
of their parents or legal guardians and charging parents a fee to recover the 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents in the past didn't face the question of paying the fine themselves," 
said Umberg, who authored Assembly Bill 3797. "This creates an added measure of 
enforcing the curfew law. Clearly this is not going to cure all our woes . . . 
but it will help (some) parents." 
</P>
<P>
 The law also will provide financially strapped local governments with a source 
of money to enforce curfews.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most cities and counties are now broke. Now each (one) has a curfew has a 
tool at their disposal," Umberg said. "We hope it's a tool that will be used 
throughout California." 
</P>
<P>
 Minors will receive a warning citation for their first violation, to be mailed 
to their parents.  
</P>
<P>
 After the second violation, parents will receive a fine equal to the cost of 
identifying, transporting and detaining minors. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost varies from city to city, with some as high as $250. There is no cap 
on the amount of the fine, but it can be waived if officials determine that 
parents have made a reasonable effort to exercise control over the minor, 
according to the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of Orange County's 31 cities have a curfew ordinance. Most cities' 
curfews run from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. and apply to those who are 17 years and 
younger.  
</P>
<P>
 Under existing laws, organized activities, such as sports games, and 
establishments like movies theaters and amusement parks are excluded from most 
curfews. First-offense fines in Orange County, levied against minors, are $25 
to $50. 
</P>
<P>
 "The taxpayer is not going to be paying for the cost of apprehending and 
transporting (curfew violators)," said Supervisor Harriett Wieder, who 
sponsored the bill. "The bottom line is we're going to be empowering the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials hope that the new law, by encouraging parents to make sure 
their children are home at night, will also reduce the number of teen-agers 
caught in the cross-fire of gang activity.  
</P>
<P>
 More than one-third of all gang crime occurs between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., said 
Michael Schumacher, chairman of the Orange County Gang Alliance and the 
county's chief probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of victims are not gang members. They are innocent 
bystanders, people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time," he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LOCAL GROUPS FEATURED IN LONG BEACH FESTIVAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Orange County performers will present the traditional dances of 
their homelands at a Long Beach multicultural festival today. 
</P>
<P>
 "When have you seen a multicultural event like this in Orange County? When?" 
asked Florinda Mintz, who this year was forced to cancel the Orange County 
mariachi festival she organizes for lack of sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Street International Festival and Expo begins in Long Beach at 10 
a.m. today with a "unity walk," and then features performers from 11 a.m. to 7 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Performing groups that are from Orange County include the Xipe Totec Aztec 
Dancers; the Polynesian Girls; the Cambodian Family Youth Dance Group; Grupo 
Renacamiento, which performs dances of Mexico and Latin America; the Joo Myung 
Sook Korean Dancing School; the Kaiman Hila Dancers, Hawaiian performers; 
Albert Ramon Y Su Tierra Chicana, and the Spanish Antonia Rojas Dance Theater. 
Four of the groups are based in Santa Ana, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A host of cultural events planned for Orange County were canceled this year, 
including Santa Ana's downtown Sept. 16 celebration of Mexican Independence, in 
part because sponsors pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Mintz said the Long Beach festival points out the richness of Orange County's 
multicultural artists. The community should be able to come together to 
celebrate that diversity here, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do any events in Orange County this year. They were all canceled," 
Mintz said. "Everyone thinks that in Orange County, everyone's white and 
Republican. It's not true. We choose multicultural dancers who live in the 
area. When we began doing research, we found them (in Orange County). There are 
artists here who really are fantastic." LEE ROMNEY

 The question was simple for Sandy Brinigar: Should she go to work or climb 
aboard her Harley-Davidson motorcycle and hit the open road? 
</P>
<P>
 Work never stood a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Brinigar, a molecular biologist from Fountain Valley, traded her 
white lab coat for a black leather jacket and black chaps and joined dozens of 
other motorcycle enthusiasts on a trip designed to raise money for a local 
homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a great feeling to get out there and help, especially raising money 
for the cause we're doing. It's just a lot of fun," said Brinigar, 36. 
</P>
<P>
 Brinigar was one of hundreds of riders from throughout Southern California to 
join "Harleys for the Homeless," which is expected to raise about $10,000 for 
HomeAid, a nonprofit group based in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 riders left from the Orange County Harley-Davidson dealership in 
Santa Ana on Friday morning and headed to Stateline, Nev.  
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, they met up in Victorville with groups from nearby counties for 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 The money raised through the $35-per-rider registration fee will go to build 
temporary shelters for families that need up to a year to regain their 
financial independence, said Donna Hahn, spokeswoman for HomeAid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crazy George" Reiter, 52, took a day off from Southern California Edison to 
lead the Orange County contingent. Nothing beats the sense of freedom and 
camaraderie of riding along with others who were born to be wild, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiter, of Costa Mesa, added, "You may be riding with a doctor or a lawyer or 
a ditch digger, but once you're on that hog, you're all of the same mind." JON

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; SCHOOL DISTRICT AGREES TO DEAL WITH SHELL 
OIL 
</P>

<P>
 The Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District has agreed to include a 
proposed 2,300-home development in its boundaries in exchange for the developer 
paying for a new elementary school and expansion of existing middle and high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shell Oil development site is just north of Yorba Linda city limits, 
within the Brea Olinda Unified School District boundaries.Yorba Linda expects 
to annex the 900-acre site, and city officials want children who live in the 
new development to attend Placentia-Yorba Linda schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea Olinda school officials have said they support the transfer because it 
keeps the district's boundaries consistent with city boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia-Yorba Linda school officials estimate that the development, expected 
to be built over the next 10 to 20 years, will house about 1,000 students. To 
accommodate them, the district wants a new elementary school built within the 
project, possibly near a park. The agreement also calls for Shell to pay for 
improving and expanding Yorba Linda Middle School and El Dorado High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The total cost of the new school and improvements is estimated by the district 
to be $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement between Shell and the district comes after two years of 
sometimes tense negotiations. At one point, the school board voted to accept 
the transfer, only to rescind the agreement after contending that Shell backed 
down from several provisions in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The new agreement must now be approved by the county Commission for 
Reorganization and the state Department of Education. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: POINT MUGU; ANNUAL AIR SHOW TAKES OFF TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Against the roar of jet engines and the unmistakable smell of aviation fuel, a 
dozen or so hot shot Navy and civilian pilots on Friday polished their acts to 
prepare for today's 32nd annual Point Mugu Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day show this year, billed as a demonstration of the workaday world of 
naval aviation, will not feature the flight demonstration teams such as the 
Navy's Blue Angels or the Canadian Air Force's Snowbirds due to scheduling 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday's practice show, played out before a crowd of about 5,000 county 
firefighters, police officers, Navy families and schoolchildren, had necks 
craning and jaws dropping as the Navy's sleek fighter jets, the F/A-18 Hornet 
and F-14 Tomcat, were put through their paces by Ventura County-based pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 The fastest and loudest jets flown Friday were from the Navy's newest aviation 
unit, VX-9 Detachment, Point Mugu, which was formally commissioned Friday 
morning in a formal Navy ceremony attended by three admirals. 
</P>
<P>
 But by midafternoon, when members of the new squadron took to the skies, low 
clouds rolled in off the ocean and obscured most of their flight demonstration 
-- including dogfights, strafing and bombing runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what happens when you're next to the ocean," said Navy spokesman Alan 
Alpers. "It can be sunny one moment and foggy the next." 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour after the clouds rolled in, the weather cleared, leaving the 
rest of the acts, mainly civilian aerobatic pilots, to soar across blue skies. 
</P>
<P>
 For today, National Weather Service meteorologist Michael Most forecast 
morning low clouds which are expected to burn off by 10 a.m. over the Point 
Mugu area. The rest of the day should be mostly sunny, with scattered clouds. 
High temperatures will be in the mid-70s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also showing off their skills were the pilots of the Channel Islands Air 
National Guard who, with their giant C-130 Hercules transport planes, 
demonstrated how the Guard fights fires from the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, at a solemn ceremony, Point Mugu's oldest tenant command, 
Squadron VX-4, was formally disbanded before a crowd of about 100 people, three 
admirals and scores of officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of VX-4, who evaluate and test weapons for Navy aircraft, formally 
eulogized their 42-year-old squadron and celebrated the birth of their new 
unit, VX-9 Detachment Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 The new detachment, now part of a squadron based at Point Mugu's sister base 
at China Lake, will focus on the F-14D Tomcat, the latest model of the two-seat 
Navy jet fighter, said Capt. Daniel McCort, the unit's commander. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the former squadron's six F/A-18 Hornets were transferred 
to China Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are deeply proud of the service this squadron has provided," McCort said. 
"It has pulled its weight and has saved lives. It leaves an honorable legacy." 
</P>
<P>
 For a list of air show events today and Sunday, please see the schedule at 
right. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MAN, 19, GETS 3 YEARS FOR ROLE IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old former Ventura man was sentenced to three years in state prison 
Friday for his part in a deadly shooting last July. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath sentenced Ruben Viveros to the maximum 
term allowed under state law for accessory to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said 23-year-old Roger Rowland was fatally shot July 21 by 
Viveros' co-defendant in the case, Thomas Al Corral, 23. Viveros drove Corral 
to Ventura from Las Vegas so Rowland could be killed, prosecutors alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 They say Corral was upset because Rowland was dating Melinda Corona, Corral's 
ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Corral burst through the door of Corona's Ventura home and shot Rowland, they 
said. Viveros, who pleaded guilty last month, drove Corral back to Las Vegas 
after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police arrested the two men in Las Vegas three days after the 
shooting. They say the victim and the defendants were gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, McGrath refused a defense attorney's request to sentence Viveros to 
a lesser term of 16 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "This defendant has a substantial (criminal) record," said the judge, adding 
that Viveros' past brushes with the law included violence against his own 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Brian Boles argued that Viveros had no idea that Corral 
planned to murder Rowland. He called Viveros a "passive participant" in the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Simon said Viveros should have known what to 
expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are going to visit someone at midnight (with a loaded gun), you 
should have some clue as to what might happen," the prosecutor said. DWAYNE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; NEW RESOLUTION ON PROP. 187 APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Putting financial and legal concerns ahead of humanitarian arguments, the 
Ventura school board has approved a resolution opposing Proposition 187 that is 
substantially different than the statement it initially considered. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 5 to 0 to oppose the November ballot measure that would deny 
public education, non-emergency health care and other social services to 
illegal immigrants.But the unanimous vote came only after the board agreed to 
revise the resolution it had considered two weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
 The board initially discussed a resolution opposing the measure because "it is 
in the best interest of the general public to educate all children, citizens or 
undocumented immigrants, when considering the alternative cost to the taxpayer 
if they are not provided this opportunity." MAIA DAVIS

DEFENSE QUESTIONS LEGALITY OF TORTURE LAW; COURTS: AN ATTORNEY CLAIMS THE STATE 
STATUTE AND THE COMPLAINTS AGAINST CYNTHIA MEDINA ARE VAGUE. SHE IS ACCUSED OF 
SEXUALLY ABUSING HER NEPHEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The attorney for a woman charged with torturing and sexually abusing a 
10-year-old boy called for the dismissal of all charges against his client 
Friday, arguing that the California statute on torture is vague and 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 During a hearing in Santa Ana Municipal Court, attorney Richard C. Gilbert 
also argued that the child abuse complaints against 31-year-old Cynthia Medina 
do not provide enough facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert agreed to wait for a ruling on his motion until Oct. 14, when Medina 
is scheduled to be arraigned. He said he is likely to appeal if he loses his 
bid to prove the torture statute unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Charles J. Middleton, deputy district attorney, said both the torture 
statute and the wording of his complaint are explicit enough to survive a 
constitutional challenge, and that all the charges are fair. The torture 
statute prohibits inflicting "unusual or extreme suffering . . . resulting in 
serious bodily injury." It matches the facts of the case exactly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say Medina, the boy's aunt, abused him over the past year by 
burning his tongue with heated knives and whipping him with electrical cords. 
On Sept. 7, authorities allege, she punished the boy for playing with her 
marijuana cigarettes by searing his tongue again, beating him with a miniature 
baseball bat and sodomizing him with it, causing severe internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina, who appeared disheveled and pale during the hearing Friday, claims the 
boy's internal injuries resulted from a "freak accident," according to Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was living with his maternal aunt because his mother could no longer 
care for him. The boy's father and maternal grandmother both have said they 
intend to seek custody of the child, who is now in temporary foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert complained that under the state's torture statute almost anyone could 
be charged with the crime. He also accused the district attorney's office of 
singling out his client. 
</P>
<P>
 "A football player who commits a face mask penalty . . . could be charged with 
torture and face a life sentence when we all thought it should be a 15-yard 
penalty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina is charged with three counts of felony child abuse and one count of 
torture. She could receive a life sentence if convicted of torture. She is the 
first person in the county to be charged with that crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Edward Medina, 45, has also been charged with three counts of 
felony child abuse for allegedly failing to stop the abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, Edward Medina, who had been held in jail on a $15,000 
bail order, was released Friday on his own recognizance. Middleton agreed to 
the request to release Medina in exchange for an agreement to keep the two 
cases together in a single trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleton said that because the boy will have to testify, he wants to keep the 
cases together in one trial to minimize further trauma to the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge B. Tam Nomoto also ordered Medina to have no contact with the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some family members who filled the first two rows of courtroom seats waved to 
Edward Medina as he left the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, the boy's father, who is not being identified to 
protect the child's anonymity, said he is shocked by the allegations but 
believes his son's story. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a terrible thing they did to him," he said, tearfully. "I still find it 
hard to believe. . . . But my son wouldn't lie to anybody."

CULTURAL CENTER LOAN APPLICATION REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The proposed construction of a city cultural center, which was intensely 
debated by City Council members, may have to wait awhile after all. 
</P>
<P>
 The city proposal to use federal community development block grants to pay for 
the construction has been turned down by the Housing and Urban Development 
Department, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City officials sought a $5.3-million HUD loan to build a cultural center, a 
park and renovate some 15th Street apartments across from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD officials said that the cultural center does not qualify for block grant 
money because it will not generate enough jobs to benefit low- and 
moderate-income people. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal guidelines, block grant money can only be used to aid low- and 
moderate-income residents, prevent and eliminate slums and blight, and meet 
urgent community needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The council Tuesday voted 3 to 2 to submit a revised $2.9-million loan, 
eliminating funding for the cultural center. Of the requested amount, $1.8 
million will be used to pay for the 3.8-acre Warner School site from the school 
district, where the cultural center could later be built. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the money would be used to build the park and renovate the 15th 
Street apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has set aside $3.3 million from a reserve fund for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But council members continued to argue whether to build the cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why finance this on the backs of low-income people?" argued Councilman Craig 
Schweisinger, who has joined Councilman Tony Lam in opposing the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the money is always allocated for "needy" groups," rarely for the middle 
class who pay the taxes," said Councilwoman Charmayne S. Bohman. "Everybody 
will benefit from this project." 
</P>
<P>
 The loan is an advance of the block grant money the city expects to receive 
from HUD over the next five years. It will be paid back over 10 years from the 
block grant money the city receives every year.

NEW EATERY IS APPROVED OVER NEIGHBORS' PROTESTS

 The chef at JW's restaurant in the Anaheim Marriott will be hitting the Bricks 
soon, on the heels of Newport Beach Planning Commission approval last week to 
open his own restaurant, Bricks, in a vacant bank building in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents of Larkspur Avenue, the street on one side of the triangular 
building at 3140 E. Coast Highway, opposed the plan because of tight parking in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents complained that patrons of a nearby tavern, the Quiet Woman, already 
park near their homes and disturb the neighborhood late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parking is a nightmare to start with, but the noise is the real problem," 
Larkspur resident Bing Starr told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commission voted 4 to 1 to waive some parking requirements and let 
chef John McLaughlin proceed. Commission chairwoman Norma Glover, who missed 
part of the discussion, abstained, and Commissioner Gary Di Sano was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to satisfy opponents, the commission agreed to allow the 
restaurant to operate as long as McLaughlin buys annual parking permits for 
employees to park in a nearby city lot and provides valet parking for the dozen 
on-site spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant is expected to be open from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 
5:30 to 10 p.m. Tuesdays through Thursdays, with an extra hour for dinner 
Fridays and Saturdays.

MAN GETS LIFE IN KILLING AT COMPUTER STORE; CRIME: WOMAN'S ARRIVAL APPARENTLY 
INTERRUPTED A ROBBERY. SHE WAS THERE TO PICK UP HER SON, A STORE EMPLOYEE. 
PAROLE IS NOT AN OPTION OF SENTENCE FOR SLAYER.

 A 23-year-old Los Angeles man was sentenced to life in prison without parole 
Friday for his role in the slaying of a woman who stumbled upon an armed 
robbery in 1991 at a Fountain Valley computer store. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric D. Clark, the second defendant in the case to be convicted of 
first-degree murder with special circumstances, has maintained his innocence in 
the slaying of Kathy Lee and tried unsuccessfully Friday to get a new trial and 
a new attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, a 49-year-old executive secretary at Hughes Aircraft in El Segundo whom 
friends described as a gifted artist, was shot once in the head on Oct. 18, 
1991, in the parking lot of CompUSA when she came to pick up her teen-age son 
who worked at the store. The mother of two apparently surprised the robbers, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees inside the store, including Lee's son who was 18 at the time, had 
been gagged and handcuffed at gunpoint to a restroom rail, but were not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's husband, overcome by emotion, did not speak before Judge Richard 
L. Weatherspoon on Friday, but in a previous written statement to the court 
said the murder of his wife, whom he described as his "best buddy," had "ruined 
his life." He told the court he hoped her killers would spend the rest of their 
lives in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Clark's family also attended the hearing, but made no statements to 
the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Another defendant has been convicted of first-degree murder and is awaiting 
sentencing, while a third, Clark's older brother, William, is awaiting trial. 
William Clark, along with a Los Angeles woman, also face charges of killing a 
key witness in the robbery case.

MAN SHOT 7 TIMES, CRITICALLY WOUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 41-year-old man was shot seven times Friday in what police called a domestic 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Sanchez Chavez, of Santa Ana, was shot just after 5:30 p.m. in a driveway 
in the 1300 block of West Civic Center Drive, according to Santa Ana Police 
Sgt. Dick Faust. He was taken to UCI Medical Center, where he was in critical

BUENA PARK COUNCIL WEIGHS GOALS FOR REDEVELOPMENT

 City planners laid out goals for the Redevelopment Agency for the next five 
years and gave City Council members some bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 They told the council that under a new state law, the state will not credit 
the city for previous affordable housing efforts.That means the city will have 
to provide 159 new affordable housing units within the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature passed a law last year requiring cities to prepare long-range 
plans that will eliminate blight, said May Hui, assistant director for 
development services. At the same time, cities must make sure that these new 
projects include affordable housing and boost jobs in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment money comes out of property taxes, with 20% of those funds set 
aside for affordable housing, Hui said. 
</P>
<P>
 The total budget for redevelopment this year is about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The public will be able to comment on the plans next month. Residents can 
review the document at City Hall beginning Wednesday and speak at a public 
hearing on Nov. 7.

LOCAL TEAMS HATE IT, WHATEVER IT'S CALLED; KINGS: GRETZKY DOESN'T SEE AN 
AGREEMENT BEING REACHED IN TWO WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Wayne Gretzky is traveling to the Bay Area for a game this weekend -- a 
football game, the Philadelphia Eagles against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 After Friday's NHL labor developments, Gretzky might be watching a lot more 
football in November, December and January too. He fears the entire season 
could be jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players realize this is not a two-week thing," he said Friday after the 
King players had met at Iceoplex in North Hills. "We are not going to be 
playing in two weeks. If we can't get an agreement done in 16 months, how are 
we going to get one in two weeks? It's just not going to happen. I'm not trying 
to be negative. I'm being realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "This two-week thing, as far as I'm concerned, is a bit of a cover. This is a 
delay. I don't see us playing hockey at Christmastime." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, down the freeway at the Forum, new King owner Joseph Cohen was 
answering questions about such issues as potential layoffs and ticket refunds. 
The two-week delay to the start of the season means the Kings would need to 
reschedule five games if the season does open on Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, who were set to start the season tonight in San Jose, are scheduled 
to play the Boston Bruins at the Forum on Oct. 15 and then leave on a 
seven-game trip, which begins on Oct. 18 against the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, who calls himself "eternally optimistic," said he still feels that way. 
He also said there would be no refunds issued now because the league intends to 
play a full season. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we weren't optimistic, we wouldn't be here today," Cohen said at a news 
conference with team President Bruce McNall, General Manager Sam McMaster and 
Coach Barry Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you know Bruce's history, he an optimist. We intend to be in our seats on 
Oct. 15, and we hope the building is full when the Bruins are here and we beat 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the reaction runs the gamut. We're among the more hopeful and 
optimistic clubs. Some owners are very skeptical. The reaction is all over the 
lot. . . . But there's no one rooting against an Oct. 15 start." 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose said the team had reserved practice time at Iceoplex on Monday but 
that he could not coach the players, merely observe. But the NHL Players Assn. 
said its members won't practice until an agreement is reached. Melrose does 
maintain that his players could be ready to start the season in two weeks if 
they keep skating on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever the decision is going to be, all 700 players will be doing the same 
thing," said King defenseman Rob Blake, who is the team's player 
representative. "Last time, we had a little trouble with that (in 1992). We 
want to be uniform this year. We knew it was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Three Kings -- Marty McSorley, Darryl Sydor and Blake -- were scheduled to fly 
to Toronto on Friday night for a noon meeting today of the NHLPA. Gretzky was 
present for the NHLPA's announcement on Thursday that it would pledge not to 
strike and play under the old agreement if there was no lockout by the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was saying what we did yesterday was a P.R. move and what they did 
today did was a P.R. move," Gretzky said. "Everyone is jockeying for position. 
I don't see how ours was a P.R. move when we said we'd play all year with the 
old agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saying we want to play. You would hope the fans would be happy with 
that." King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The team will return goaltender Jamie Storr to his junior team, as well as 
forward Matt Johnson, but General Manager Sam McMaster reached contract 
agreements with both players Friday night. Storr agreed to a three-year deal 
and Johnson's contract is for four years. Johnson will remain in Los Angeles to 
have treatment on an injured knee.

NHL PUTS START OF SEASON ON ICE FOR TWO WEEKS; HOCKEY: BETTMAN POSTPONES 
OPENERS UNTIL AT LEAST OCT. 15 AND URGES PLAYERS' UNION TO RESUME TALKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to accomplish in two weeks what he and the players have been unable to 
thrash out in 16 months, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman delayed today's season 
openers until Oct. 15 and urged the union to immediately resume intensive 
contract talks. Should the dispute carry beyond that date, Bettman said Friday, 
games would be lost for the first time in league history. 
</P>
<P>
 If the deadline approaches with negotiators not in accord but involved in what 
he called "substantial good faith negotiations," Bettman said he would consider 
accepting the no-strike, no-lockout pledge offered Thursday by the players' 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a league with profound economic problems," Bettman said at a news 
conference in New York. "Unless players are prepared to negotiate, simply 
agreeing to a no-strike pledge without a new agreement will only defer the 
inevitable and exacerbate the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The hockey players thus join major league baseball players on the outside, 
looking in. The baseball players went on strike in a similar dispute Aug. 12, 
and the rest of the season was canceled Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman instructed clubs to make ice time available for players to work out, 
but many players packed their gear and dispersed after hearing his 
announcement. Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., said 
players will not continue formal practices, but added he will continue 
negotiations with Bettman sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow was to meet today in Toronto with each team's union representative to 
discuss plans for the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good faith seems to me to mean his terms for an agreement," Goodenow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the substantial differences in how they would remedy the disparity of 
wealth among the NHL's 26 clubs, the two chief negotiators had different 
definitions of Bettman's latest decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioner insisted the delay does not constitute a lockout because, he 
said, he expects the season to be played in its entirety. He said the schedule 
would be picked up on Oct. 15 and postponed games would be sandwiched into what 
are now days off or made up at what would have been the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow, however, said he had received lockout notices from the governments 
of several Canadian provinces and planned to investigate the legal 
ramifications of delaying games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an owners' lockout, pure and simple," Goodenow said. "The season is not 
going on as scheduled, players are not being allowed to play and they're not 
being paid. It's a lockout. We are disappointed. We were ready to start on 
time, but the NHL won't let the games go on as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The negotiations have a possibility of moving the process forward. There's no 
sense of compromise from Mr. Bettman on the real issue. That remains to be seen 
as the process goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 As originally scheduled, the season would have gone through April 12 and the 
playoffs would have ended by June 12. A delay of two weeks or more would push 
the league to its latest finishing dates in both cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Players were skeptical that a settlement could be reached by Bettman's new 
deadline and feared their season might be wiped out, as was the baseball 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two weeks is not going to do it," the Kings' Wayne Gretzky said. "Right now, 
there are huge differences, and I just don't see hockey being played this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Brendan Shanahan of the St. Louis Blues said that in asking players to 
continue to practice without being paid, Bettman was questioning the players' 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody wants to fall out of shape," Shanahan said. "But at the 
same time I think it's ridiculous to suggest we're going to have a month and a 
half, two-month, three-month or five-month training camp." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pittsburgh's Kevin Stevens: "I'm not confident at all we can get 
something done by Oct. 15. That's just a lie." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman was flanked by representatives of 20 teams at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Several owners and club governors spoke of facing financial crises if players 
do not agree to a system that would control the salaries of entry-level 
players, eliminate salary arbitration and establish a form of revenue sharing 
to help subsidize small-market clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those issues, as well as the terms of free agency, form the core of this 
dispute. To help support clubs with limited sources of revenue, owners advocate 
a salary limit on each club and imposing a graduated levy on clubs that exceed 
the limit. The pooled proceeds would be redistributed to needy clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The players' proposal involves a 5.5% levy on the payrolls and gate receipts 
of the 16 highest revenue-producing clubs, the money to be shared by the 10 
lowest-revenue clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcel Aubut, president and governor of the Quebec Nordiques, warned that his 
club would fail without economic safeguards. Quebec is among the small-market 
clubs, as are Edmonton and Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, professional hockey may not be able to survive in Canada," Aubut 
said. "We have been working very hard in Quebec to compete with our fellow 
teams in the NHL and give our loyal fans in Quebec the best possible team to 
root for. We have tried to make our team something for all of Quebec to be 
proud of, but I don't know how much longer we can proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a system is not in place to make it possible for a team in the city of 
Quebec to compete on the ice with its fellow teams in other cities, we do not 
have a future. We cannot succeed over a long time without a new collective 
bargaining agreement to correct the economic imbalance under which we have been 
operating." 
</P>
<P>
 The few executives willing to acknowledge that their clubs are profitable 
joined Aubut in calling for an overhaul of the league's economic system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past four, five years I look at it like being run over by a Chevrolet and 
getting squashed a little," said Harry Sinden, the president and general 
manager of the Boston Bruins. "I'm worried that over the next four years, I'm 
going to be run over by a Mack truck and be squeezed flat." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cliff Fletcher, president and general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs: 
"As a 26-team entity, we have very critical issues that have to be addressed, 
and to be in this situation a year from now makes absolutely no sense. We 
support the position that before we drop the puck to play hockey this year, 
there has to be a new collective bargaining agreement in place. Hopefully, 
that'll be the 15th of October." 
</P>
<P>
 Bypassing the union, Bettman appealed directly to players for their support in 
a letter distributed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inability thus far to make a deal is a shared responsibility," he wrote. 
"It is not solely the fault of the NHL or the NHLPA. It is something I believe 
both sides sought to avoid. I have decided to write this letter because I think 
you are entitled to know what the league is seeking in a new agreement and why. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've given specific and detailed financial information to your union. 
Despite the growth of the NHL's revenues, the league has lost money in the past 
couple of years. We need a player-employment system that avoids making this a 
league of haves and have-nots. Unless we develop that type of system, our 
recent success will not solve our competitive and economic problems. This 
situation must be addressed and addressed now." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman said the NHL, in the last four years, "has gone from a collective 
profit to a substantial collective loss," but he would not state the extent of 
the losses or say how many clubs had lost money. He also said salaries had 
tripled in that span and that for every dollar clubs received in revenue, clubs 
had paid $1.14 in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow disputed Bettman's contention that the league had disclosed all 
relevant financial information. Nor was Goodenow softened by the owners' pleas 
of imminent poverty, saying a good accountant can legally juggle figures to 
make profits appear to be losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like an art form," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As signs of the NHL's vitality, he cited the entrance into the league last 
year of the Walt Disney Co.'s Mighty Ducks and the Florida Panthers -- owned by 
Blockbuster Video mogul Wayne Huizenga. He also pointed to the five-year, 
$155-million contract signed last month with the Fox TV network. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the objective information says the NHL is extremely healthy and 
prosperous," he said. "We don't have all the information on their profits. 
Originally, when the league and the players' association talked about financial 
data, we were offered (the data) on the proviso we had to negotiate along the 
terms of a salary cap. We refused. Later on in the process we received some 
selected data, but not profits." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Tavares, president of the Ducks, said he knew a majority of teams had 
lost money and said Goodenow had overestimated the effect of the Fox deal, not 
calculating that it is equally divided among the 26 clubs. Profits from the 
sales of NHL-licensed merchandise are also split. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you add up the total profits and total losses, significant losses were 
experienced league-wide, and if you look at a trend, what's happening 
league-wide is a deteriorating trend," Tavares said. "Even though the pie is 
expanding, it's not expanding as rapidly as in other sports." 
</P>
<P>
 ESPN2, which was to have begun its NHL coverage tonight, will instead show 
minor league games. ESPN will substitute a variety of events, including motor 
sports and Canadian Football League games, beginning Tuesday. Fox is not 
scheduled to televise a game until Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings were among the clubs not represented at the NHL news conference. A 
league spokesman said their absence, as well as that of executives of other 
clubs, was caused by scheduling conflicts and was not a sign of dissent.

LOCAL TEAMS HATE IT, WHATEVER IT'S CALLED; DUCKS: TAVARES SAYS BOTH SIDES ARE 
TO BLAME FOR IMPASSE. PLAYERS ARE NOT SURPRISED.

 The solitary fan sitting in a sea of empty seats is fast becoming a symbol of 
professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Tavares, the Mighty Ducks' president, says he will be the lonely fan on 
Oct. 9, the Sunday afternoon The Pond was supposed to reverberate with a 
celebration of the team's home opener against the Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be my protest," said Tavares -- as if forgetting he is president of 
one of the 26 teams that gave Commissioner Gary Bettman unanimous approval to 
postpone the scheduled opening of the NHL season today. "I'll be protesting the 
fact that we haven't been smart enough as a group -- both sides -- to figure 
out a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 The development is a particular letdown for the second-year team, eager for 
the debut of rookie Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya says he is disappointed, but "this is not something that's just come 
out of the blue." The battle lines were drawn before he arrived, but he hasn't 
hesitated since reaching the front. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy for me to back the union, because hopefully I'm going to be in the 
NHL a while," he said. "The veterans don't need to fight for the younger guys, 
but they're in there fighting for the new guys and the guys who are 15 years 
old and playing bantam hockey right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck players made a cursory appearance at the arena Friday to hear what they 
expected: Games called on account of labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman announced Friday that the first two weeks of the season have been 
"postponed" -- a term that has inspired an incendiary war of words on both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can say what you want about it, it's a play on words," defenseman Robert 
Dirk said. "We're not going to be playing. Is it a lockout or a postponement? 
I'm not working as of tomorrow, which I should be, and I'm not getting paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the season isn't starting, players will not receive their first 
paychecks, scheduled for Oct. 13. Players are not paid during training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Friday, they had the weekend off, awaiting word from union chief Bob 
Goodenow on what their practice procedures should be. Presumably they will 
practice on their own at a local rink where players have reserved time at $300 
an hour. Union representative Bob Corkum and several other players were 
expecting to go to Toronto or New York to meet with Goodenow. 
</P>
<P>
 Tavares and the players agree on at least one thing -- the negotiations have 
little hope of going anywhere until the sides understand one another's 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're spending too much time on terminology," Tavares said, referring to 
debate over highly charged terms such as lockout and salary cap. "Too much time 
is spent on name calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather play. But I'm not torn by the decision we've come to. I support 
it, because I believe it's necessary, as painful as this is -- and it's very 
painful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for a tourniquet. We don't need a Band-Aid." Mighty Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Fans who have tickets for Oct. 9, 12, and 14, home games affected by the 
two-week postponement, should hold them until the games are rescheduled or 
canceled. . . . Rookie right wing John Lilley, 22, was assigned to minor league 
affiliate San Diego of the International League.

TROJANS LEERY OF INJURED FOES; USC: OREGON LOSES STARTING QUARTERBACK, BUT 
ROBINSON RECALLS PAST AND WARNS AGAINST COMPLACENCY TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 John Robinson will coach his 100th USC game at the Coliseum today, against 
Oregon, in circumstances hauntingly similar to an Oregon-USC matchup here 23 
seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
 When Oregon Coach Rich Brooks announced this week that his senior quarterback, 
Danny O'Neil, had undergone finger surgery and would sit this one out, the 1971 
Oregon-USC game came back into focus in Robinsons' memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon beat John McKay's USC team, 28-23, on Oct. 9, 1971. Robinson was an 
Oregon assistant coach that year, then joined McKay's staff the next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan Fouts was our quarterback that year and he got hurt the previous week," 
Robinson recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a little guy named Harvey Winn at quarterback. Harvey was about 5 
foot 8. Nobody gave us much of a chance. But Harvey threw three touchdown 
passes that day and we won. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've reminded our team about that this week. This is a very similar 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 That 1971 Oregon victory was Oregon's last over the Trojans in the Coliseum. 
In the last 17 USC-Oregon games, USC leads, 15-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (2-1) will play with four offensive starters sidelined by injuries, 
including two who were hurt in practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman guard Phalen Pounds underwent an arthroscopic knee procedure 
Wednesday that will keep him out of at least two games. And sophomore tight end 
John Allred suffered a broken leg Wednesday and is sidelined for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior wide receiver Ed Hervey and junior tailback Leonard Green -- a 
sensation in summer training camp -- will also sit out today's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hervey has a knee injury and Green a pulled hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 And still sidelined is freshman tailback Delon Washington. USC announced last 
week it was withholding him from competition until an admissions matter 
regarding his eligibility is settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides O'Neil, a senior from Newport Beach, Oregon will be without cornerback 
Herman O'Berry and offensive tackle Paul Wiggins. Each has a knee injury. 
Sophomore Tony Graziani will make his first start at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil came down last week with a staph infection on the ring finger of his 
passing hand. He was hampered by it against Iowa last Saturday, then underwent 
surgery Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with O'Neil's swollen finger limiting him to a seven-for-17 passing for 
74 yards, Oregon (2-2) beat Iowa, 40-18. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon scored 20 points in five minutes of possession in the second quarter, 
then dominated the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Oregon had lost to Hawaii and Utah after opening with a 58-16 
victory over Portland State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, on a night Shawn Walters seemed to emerge as a big-time tailback 
with 31 carries for 207 yards, beat Baylor last Saturday, 37-27. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior quarterback Rob Johnson, who has a sore back, led an offense that piled 
up 583 total yards against Baylor, the Trojans' most in five seasons. He 
completed 27 of 39 passes for 364 yards. For the season, his completion 
percentage is 68.5%, highest in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had one of his best games last season at Oregon, completing 28 of 36 
passes for 307 yards and three touchdowns in a 24-13 USC victory. 
</P>
<P>
 With Hervey gone, his main targets have been Ken Grace, who has 16 catches; 
Allred, 10, and tight ends Tyler Cashman and Johnny McWilliams, who have eight 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 Cashman moves up into Allred's spot, with Jeff Diltz becoming the third tight 
end. Keyshawn Johnson, who returned last week from a thigh injury, has caught 
five passes for 110 yards.

BRUINS TAKING GUTTY APPROACH; UCLA: DONAHUE LOOKING FOR REPEAT OF 1990 UPSET OF 
WASHINGTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you buy the idea that history repeats itself, Terry Donahue is selling. The 
UCLA coach's pitch today will revolve around a game in 1990, when the Bruins 
were heavy underdogs, going nowhere and playing a national power. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a banged-up Bruin team, with its starting defensive line at home 
nursing injuries, and Washington was No. 2 in the country, having lost only 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the last time UCLA played in Seattle, and with 10 seconds to play, Brad 
Daluiso kicked a 43-yard field goal in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA 25, Washington 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played the second-string defensive line all day, and they did very well," 
Donahue recalled. "This year, we've got three of our five offensive linemen 
down. But there's a difference. These offensive linemen are real young kids. 
That defensive line wasn't that young." 
</P>
<P>
 This offensive line has two redshirt freshman starters in left guard Chad 
Sauter and right tackle Chad Overhauser. It has seldom-used junior Mike Rohme 
at right guard. Only left tackle Jonathan Ogden and center Mike Flanagan remain 
from the line that started the season's first two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is the memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Lambright has it too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember getting beat and being extremely disappointed as I walked off the 
field," said the Washington coach, who was an assistant in 1990. He 
particularly recalls the Seattle crowd, whose stunned silence grew into boos 
because of the Huskies' performance. 
</P>
<P>
 And his memory is even more vivid of a game last season, when Washington 
rolled up a 15-0 lead, then lost to the Bruins, 39-25, when Wayne Cook and J.J. 
Stokes hooked up for four touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes won't be here today. He stayed home because of a leg injury. So it 
remains for Cook to find other receivers, notably Kevin Jordan, who has caught 
28 passes for 458 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 But who else? 
</P>
<P>
 Cook is locking in on Jordan, and defenses are picking that up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's got confidence in him, and I don't blame him," Donahue said. 
"The quarterback wants to make plays. He wants to make things happen, and the 
only wide receiver on the field who's doing that now is Kevin Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook's counterpart, Washington's Damon Huard, is still struggling with 
interceptions. He has thrown five in three games after having thrown 10 last 
season. But Huard excelled a week ago when he passed for 217 yards, including a 
75-yard screen play to fullback Richard Thomas for a touchdown in a 38-20 
victory over Miami that ended the Hurricanes' record 58-game home winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 He's even running into better luck. Reserve tackle Bob Sapp recovered Huard's 
fumble in the end zone for a touchdown against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 But think Washington (2-1, 0-1 in the Pacific 10) and you think Napoleon 
Kaufman, the Pac-10's ultimate weapon. Kaufman, who lines up at tailback, split 
back and occasionally wide receiver, also returns punts and kickoffs and has 
624 total yards, including 443 rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of those guys who, every time he gets his hands on the ball, you 
hold your breath until he's on the ground," said Bob Field, UCLA's defensive 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman will be running against the Pac-10's last-place rushing defense. UCLA 
(2-2, 0-1) has given up 824 yards on the ground in four games, although that 
figure was inflated by the 484 yards gained by Nebraska two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins came up with a better defensive effort last week against Washington 
State, surrendering 249 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't much to do but get better from the week before," Field said. "We 
went back to Nebraska and played a great team, but we made them a great team. 
We could have played them better than we did. It was an embarrassment to all of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 The embarrassment last week was the offense, which listened to boos from a 
Rose Bowl crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're coming off a game when we didn't score and that doesn't happen to us 
very often," Donahue said. "We've got to rebound." 
</P>
<P>
 That will require a stepped-up effort from a young offensive line that has to 
protect Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 "Washington is hot, very talented, extremely impressive," Donahue said. "It'll 
take a Herculean effort for us to go up there and compete and win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 It will take history repeating itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Donahue: "When you're an underdog and nobody thinks you have much of a 
chance, sometimes people rise to the occasion, come together and say, 'We're 
going to get some respect and prove to people that we're better than people 
think we are.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he'll tell the Bruins a story about a 1990 team that did just that.

CONGRESS WON'T ACT ON BASEBALL EXEMPTION; LABOR: LEGISLATORS SAY THEY WILL TAKE 
UP ANTITRUST AGAIN IF DISPUTE HASN'T BEEN SETTLED BY JANUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Congress has given up trying to repeal baseball's antitrust exemption before 
it adjourns next Friday, meaning the players' union can fight unilateral 
implementation of a salary cap through the National Labor Relations Board but 
not the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators said Friday that if the labor dispute hasn't been resolved by the 
time Congress reconvenes in January, they will reconsider removal of the 
exemption, which has left baseball immune from antitrust laws since 1922. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) said he decided to give up his attempt to 
attach an amendment repealing the exemption as it applies to labor issues to an 
appropriations bill for the District of Columbia when notified by sponsors of a 
similar bill in the House that they would not be able to get it to a vote 
before adjournment. 
</P>
<P>
 He expressed confidence, however, that Congress would repeal the exemption if 
players are still on strike in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless Congress acts, the owners will continue to abuse the players, the 
cities and the fans because they don't give a damn," Metzenbaum said. "They are 
totally arrogant." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement that Metzenbaum's attempt 
would have been opposed by two-thirds of the Senate and that baseball was 
grateful for that support. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the position of the clubs that the labor laws of our country are based 
on the concept of free collective bargaining without governmental intervention, 
and that baseball's . . . exemption had nothing at all to do with the players' 
decision to strike," Selig said. "We are hopeful the players and their union 
will now make an earnest attempt to settle our dispute through collective 
bargaining." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Fehr, the union's executive director, had said the players would end 
their strike if Congress passed a bill that repealed the exemption and 
prevented a salary cap from going into effect until the courts decided if the 
owners had violated antitrust laws by implementing. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lauren Rich, assistant general counsel of the union: "Naturally, we're 
disappointed, but we feel that we made a lot of ground this term and made a lot 
of friends. We knew this would be difficult when Don began the (lobbying) 
process two years ago, but we feel that Congress is on the verge of treating 
players as other citizens are treated and treating baseball as every other big 
business is treated." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A newly formed operations committee, composed of club owners and 
executives, met in New York on Thursday and Friday to begin shaping the rules 
under which baseball will operate this winter and the final form of the 
proposal that the owners are expected to implement before Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Associated Press reported that nine of the 18 players on whose behalf 
the union had filed default notices have been paid by their respective clubs. 
The 18 lost their salaries when recalled from the minors shortly before or 
since the start of the strike Aug. 12. The notices said the players would be 
declared free agents if the clubs had not paid them in 10 days.

STRIKING BASEBALL PLAYERS CAN'T COLLECT UNEMPLOYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Striking baseball players will not be able to collect unemployment benefits in 
New York, state Labor Commissioner John Hudacs ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The action by Hudacs came after a state senator expressed outrage that New 
York was the only state where striking players could collect benefits.State 
Sen. Joseph Holland had promised to submit legislation that would keep major 
leaguers from collecting unemployment checks. 
</P>
<P>
 In making his decision, Hudacs cited state labor law that prohibits 
professional athletes from collecting benefits between seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudacs decided the season ended Sept. 14, when owners canceled the World 
Series, and that since most players have multiyear contracts there is a 
reasonable chance the 1995 season will start as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Only New York and Rhode Island, which doesn't have any major league teams, 
offer unemployment benefits to striking workers.

 Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle, on Stanford football Coach Bill 
Walsh: 
</P>
<P>
 "(Walsh) has been scrambling this week to play down and semi-deny his calling 
Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz a 'spoiled brat' two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This despite the fact that scientific research has proven that Lou Holtz is a 
spoiled brat, not to mention a whiny twerp." 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz might have added incentive when his team plays the Cardinal today in 
South Bend, Ind.

 Trivia time: Who holds the NCAA Division I-A record for most touchdowns on 
kickoff returns? Sweet Seventeen: Reader Paul Bergman of Los Angeles relates 
this story of late tennis star Vitas Gerulaitis: 
</P>
<P>
 After Gerulaitis had defeated Jimmy Connors in a match, an announcer asked him 
how he was finally able to do so after having lost to Connors 16 consecutive 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Vitas: "Hey, nobody beats Vitas Gerulaitis 17 times in a row!"

 Secret agent: Dallas Cowboy Coach Barry Switzer, defending his hands-off 
coaching style, took a jab at former coach Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy didn't coach, he marched around out there on the field," Switzer said. 
"I'm more of a behind-the-huddle (coach)." 
</P>
<P>
 A what? 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuttal: Johnson, wondering why Dallas owner Jerry Jones wants him to stop 
criticizing the Cowboys: 
</P>
<P>
 "In my role now -- with Fox, HBO and as a newspaper columnist -- I'm paid to 
give opinions and criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't just be about 27 teams and not the Cowboys. "They've trashed me 
for the last few months too." 
</P>
<P>
 Ho hum: Harold McLaren, 60, recently got a hole in one for the fourth time on 
the same hole -- the 125-yard eighth at the Tanner Valley Golf Club in 
Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very, very, very lucky, yes, indeed," McLaren said. "My friends are kind 
of amazed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No place to go: From David Letterman: "A recent poll reveals that 56% of 
Americans believe there is baseball in heaven. Unfortunately, of that number, 
95% believe the Mets have been mathematically eliminated for eternity."

 Suggestion: Woody Woodburn in the Ventura Star-Free Press: "The Raiders should 
replace the Pirate decal on their helmets with one of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; IF HE WAS AWAKE, MELVIN WOULD BE PROUD OF THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most NFL players, college memories spring from storied places such as 
South Bend and Tuscaloosa, revolving around the storied names of Bear and Bo 
and Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
 For the NFL's best all-around running back this season, Chris Warren of the 
Seattle Seahawks, flashbacks are different. 
</P>
<P>
 The place: A dirt field in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The name: Melvin Trent. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was our college trainer," Warren said. "Well, not really a trainer. Like, 
a paramedic. Well, not really a paramedic. Like, an intern." 
</P>
<P>
 As the man carrying the medical bag for the Ferrum College Panthers, a 
Division III school with about 1,200 students, Trent was one of the biggest 
influences on Warren's career. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the one who taught Warren to grip the ball in all sorts of pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Because before every game, he would accidentally tape Warren's hands too 
tightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Problem was, he didn't really know how to tape hands, or tape anything," 
Warren said. "So when he taped mine, my fingers would turn numb and purple." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren emphasized that this was only a problem when Trent was not sleeping on 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "Which wasn't often," he said. "Any time anybody got hurt on our team, the 
first thing we would have to do was wake up Melvin." 
</P>
<P>
 With a knack for working as hard as he laughed, Warren survived long enough to 
be discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar qualities can be found in most of the several dozen players who have 
succeeded in the NFL today, despite their small-college backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, those players are in underdog situations, they might have a little 
better work ethic," said Tom Donahoe, director of football operations for the 
Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 While watching an obscure speck on an obscure college all-star game film, 
Donahoe found All-Pro linebacker Greg Lloyd from tiny Ft. Valley State in 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, who is tied with the San Francisco 49ers' Jerry Rice for the league 
lead with six touchdowns while ranking sixth in the league in total yards from 
scrimmage, was discovered in an even odder spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Would you believe a rest area? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was on Interstate 81 between Roanoke and North Carolina," recalled Mike 
Allman, the Seahawks' player personnel director. "We went to visit him at 
Ferrum, but while we were in his coach's office, he calls from the side of the 
road to say that his car broke down. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we told him to stay put, and we drove to pick him up. We didn't have much 
time, so we cleared out parking spaces at the rest area and threw him a few 
passes." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that workout, and his 4,583 total yards in two seasons at Ferrum, 
Warren was selected in the fourth round in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, running soft but hitting hard with his 6-foot-2, 225-pound frame, 
Warren has opened eyes everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 He even made the Pro Bowl last year, not bad for a player whose collegiate 
program boasted no playbook and a field with no grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "People asked me if I thought about playing in the NFL back then," Warren 
said, shaking his head to confirm that the thought rarely crossed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, all I had to do was look around at where I was," he said. "What were 
the chances of anybody ever making it in the NFL from there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Warren is only one of many small-college stars who beat those odds, some of 
whom are listed here on the All-Melvin Trent team: OFFENSE 
</P>
<P>
 QUARTERBACK -- Dave Krieg, Detroit Lions, Milton College, Milton, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 A lifetime member of the Melvin Trent team because his college was so small. 
It has since gone out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 RUNNING BACKS -- Warren and Ron Moore, Arizona Cardinals, Pittsburg State, 
Pittsburg, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 TIGHT END -- Eric Green, Steelers, Liberty University, Lynchburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Most competitive position, featuring Ben Coates of Livingstone College in 
Salisbury, N.C.; Shannon Sharpe of Savannah State in Georgia, and Pete 
Metzelaars of Wabash College in Indiana, an all-male institution of 860. 
</P>
<P>
 Green is the winner based solely on the image of him sitting next to 
chancellor Jerry Falwell at a school fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 WIDE RECEIVERS -- Andre Reed, Buffalo Bills, Kutztown State, Kutztown, Pa.; 
John Taylor, San Francisco 49ers, Delaware State. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined enrollments of those schools is about 12,000. The combined number 
of touchdown passes caught by these two is 96. 
</P>
<P>
 CENTER -- John Gesek, Washington Redskins, Cal State Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it's not that small. But he is one of the few centers in the league who 
is not from some major Midwestern program where linemen spend entire semesters 
wearing their baseball caps backward and tossing drunks out of downtown bars. 
</P>
<P>
 GUARDS -- Shawn Bouwens, Detroit Lions, Nebraska Wesleyan, Lincoln, Neb.; Tom 
Newberry, Rams, Wisconsin La Crosse. 
</P>
<P>
 TACKLES -- Howard Ballard, Seahawks, Alabama A&M; Erik Williams, Dallas 
Cowboys, Central State, Wilberforce, Ohio. DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
 LINEMEN -- Donald Evans, New York Jets, Winston-Salem (N.C.) State; Leon Lett, 
Cowboys, Emporia State, Emporia, Kan.; Pierce Holt, Atlanta Falcons, Angelo 
State, San Angelo, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it any wonder Lett spends much of his free time in hiding? His college had 
fewer students -- about 6,000 -- than media credentials issued for the last 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 LINEBACKERS -- Lloyd, Bryan Cox, Miami Dolphins, Western Illinois; Jessie 
Tuggle, Falcons, Valdosta State, Valdosta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 CORNERBACKS -- Lorenzo Lynch, Cardinals, Cal State Sacramento; Mike Brim, 
Cincinnati Bengals, Virginia Union, Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 SAFETIES -- Eddie Anderson, Raiders, Ft. Valley (Ga.) State; David Whitmore, 
Kansas City Chiefs, Stephen F. Austin State, Nacogdoches, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 PUNTER -- Brian Hansen, New York Jets, Sioux Falls (S.D.) College. 
</P>
<P>
 KICKER -- Steve Christie, Buffalo Bills, William and Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH -- Chuck Knox, Rams, Juniata College, Huntingdon, Pa. WHO'S HOT, WHO'S 
NOT 
</P>
<P>
 HOT -- Ralph Friedgen, offensive coordinator, San Diego Chargers: Last week, 
he forgot who was playing quarterback for him and still called three plays that 
gained 15 yards and began a game-winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
 After it was apparent that Stan Humphries could not take the field for the 
Chargers' final drive against the Raiders because of a knee injury, Friedgen, 
in the press box, began calling plays for backup Gale Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 He called three plays, including one short pass, all of them favorites of 
Gilbert. The Chargers managed a first down. The strategy was working. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he finally noticed his quarterback's number. 
</P>
<P>
 The man under center was not Gilbert. It was a courageous Humphries. 
</P>
<P>
 Now does everybody believe this team is going to make the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 NOT -- Desmond Howard, receiver, Redskins: Having been replaced by the likes 
of Olanda Truitt and Tydus Winans last week, isn't it time to certify him as 
another former Heisman Trophy Winner bust? 
</P>
<P>
 HOT -- Steve Young, quarterback, 49ers: In the first four games, playing 
behind an injury-wracked offensive line missing all five starters from last 
year's NFC championship game, he has been sacked 13 times. At that pace the 
49ers will break the club record for sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Young has yet to break a bone. In fact, he hasn't even missed a snap. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say that before it's too late, the 49ers should change their offense so 
Young can receive more protection. Young says no, he can't play that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Our guess is that he will soon learn that he can't play the other way, either. 
</P>
<P>
 NOT -- New Orleans Saint running backs: The only way the Saints' rushing 
attack could be any worse is if punter Tommy Barnhardt left the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was Barnhardt their leading rusher last week with 21 yards on one 
carry, but that run was the longest by a Saint running back this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's 171-yard rushing total after four games is worse than 19 other 
individuals in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's leading rusher, Derek Brown, is averaging two yards per carry for 
84 yards after averaging 3.9 yards last year for 705 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 You're wondering if we can figure out a way to blame quarterback Jim Everett 
for this, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Well . . . his offensive line has given up a league-low two sacks. Could they 
be so worried about pass blocking for their new leader that they have forgotten 
how to run block? 
</P>
<P>
 HOT -- Dan Reeves, coach, New York Giants: He is not only the best active 
coach in the game today, he is also the most rested. He gave his team an entire 
week's vacation during their bye, even though they have lost three consecutive 
games after byes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wonder if it had anything to do with the fact that they are playing those 
Saints this week? 
</P>
<P>
 NOT -- Dale Carter, cornerback, Chiefs: After losing to the Rams last week, 
Carter was asked about the performance of Ram quarterback Chris Chandler, who 
had played the entire game, throwing 21 passes, running the ball five times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is Chris Chandler?" Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 HOT -- Wade Phillips, coach, Broncos: He still has his job, doesn't he? 
Considering his team is winless after having chances to win three games of 
their four in the final minutes, he should consider himself the luckiest man on 
the face of the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps buoyed by the sight of his paycheck, last week he visited the Broncos' 
press room carrying a newspaper story that questioned whether quarterback John 
Elway had lost some of his magic. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of startled reporters, he ripped the story in two. 
</P>
<P>
 We only wonder when owner Pat Bowlen will do the same to Phillips' contract. 
</P>
<P>
 NOT -- Sterling Sharpe, receiver, Green Bay Packers: He is on the verge of 
breaking the all-time club receiving record held by James Lofton, so Sharpe was 
asked if he has ever seen tapes of the former great. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never," Sharpe said. "Why would I? I don't have time for that during the 
season, and in the off-season the last thing I'm going to do is watch football 
tapes. I only met the man once. I can't help you."  
</P>
<P>
 And to think that Lofton spent the last week heaping praise on Sharpe to 
whoever would listen. 
</P>
<P>
 ABSOLUTELY NOT -- Lorenzo Lynch, safety, Cardinals: Just when some frustrated 
Cardinals were wondering if the only way to escape Buddy Ryan was to get thrown 
in jail, Lynch did just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch was locked up this week after violating probation by failing to perform 
community service as part of a 1992 misdemeanor assault conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of his 30-day sentence, he can leave the Maricopa County jail 
every morning and on weekends to practice and play with the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The original charges involve a fight with an acquaintance at a barber shop in 
Mesa. Talk about a bad haircut. QUICK HITTERS 
</P>
<P>
 * RADIO STATIC: None other than the son of rules guru Don Shula is the latest 
to complain about the coach-to-quarterback radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Shula an assistant coach with the Chicago Bears and former Alabama 
quarterback who is considered another head-coaching prospect among the Shula 
boys, has struggled while working the radio on sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many others in the league, he says he has no way of knowing when the 
league official in the press box has activated the radio so he can begin 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
 It's supposed to happen immediately after every play, but there are a lot of 
things that are supposed to happen during the heat of battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Shula pushes a button, begins talking, then realizes five seconds 
later that the radio is not activated and the quarterback cannot hear him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no communication with the operators whatsoever," Shula said. "By the 
time you start getting the message to your quarterback, sometimes you've wasted 
five or six seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the radio receiver is located in the quarterback's helmet, Shula 
said the message is hard to hear during loud moments. That explains this year's 
favorite shot of TV directors -- a quarterback looking pleadingly to the 
sidelines while holding his hands over his helmet ear holes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our game last week, trouble with the radio cost the Jets two timeouts," 
Shula said. "When the radio works, it works great. But it needs to be 
fine-tuned." 
</P>
<P>
 Why use the regular season for that fine tuning? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh well. At least it has been a couple of weeks since a quarterback tuned in 
to a concessionaire, ordering sausages. 
</P>
<P>
 * ABSOLUTELY LAST SHULA REFERENCE: After the Cincinnati Bengals' 20-13 loss to 
the Houston Oilers last week, Bengal veteran safety Louis Oliver derided their 
game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was some of the dumbest . . . I've ever seen in the last three minutes," 
he told reporters. "I'm trying to figure out the play calling. What did they 
think? That we were in the first quarter? . . . You can't be running draws and 
stuff. That's bull. You need the two-minute offense out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Shula promptly scolded Oliver for speaking out. So what happens? The next day, 
Oliver opened up again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't take too much more of this," he said. "It's embarrassing to go out 
and say you play ball for the Bengals." 
</P>
<P>
 And you don't think Dave is gone even if he does beat his father on Sunday 
night? 
</P>
<P>
 * GO FIGURE: After telling fans that they had a winner in town, Buddy Ryan has 
watched his Arizona Cardinals lead for exactly 6:04 of their first 180 minutes 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A trade that hurt both teams: The Green Bay Packers acquired free-agent 
running back Reggie Cobb from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the off-season. After 
four games, neither club has scored a rushing touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Buffalo Bills are 3-1, but have scored touchdowns in only two of their 
four games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vinny Testaverde has scored the Cleveland Browns' only rushing touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Since beginning his pro career in 1983, Miami Dolphin quarterback Dan 
Marino has played in only 15 games in which one of his running backs rushed for 
100 yards or more. And he has never had a 1,000-yard rusher. 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Elway, who was instrumental in Dan Reeves' departure from Denver, has 
32 fourth-quarter, game-saving comebacks in his career. Thirty-one occurred 
under Reeves, one under Wade Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 * VIEWER'S NOTE: Nowhere is the difference between the hourlong pregame shows 
on Fox and ESPN better illustrated than with this: 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday, when ESPN expert Phil Simms was asked by his anchormen about a 
contract offer from Buddy Ryan, he honestly said that he would be interested. 
</P>
<P>
 When Fox expert Jimmy Johnson was asked by his anchormen about a contract 
offer from the Rams, he refused to give a straight answer.

 Starting guard Leo Goeas and starting linebacker Roman Phifer practiced for 
the first time all week Friday in preparation for Sunday's game against the 
Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said he expects Goeas, who was on crutches after last week's 
game because of an ankle injury, to play without problem.Phifer will wear a 
splint on his hyper-extended elbow, which Knox said will still allow for him to 
make tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will decide today if Chris Miller or Tommy Maddox will back up 
starter Chris Chandler at quarterback. Knox said Miller still is bothered by a 
shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Sean Gilbert sat out a second consecutive practice because of 
a bruised shoulder.

 Wayne Gandy, the team's No. 1 draft pick, continues to toil as backup to 
Clarence Jones and Jackie Slater.

<P>
 Defensive end Brad Ottis, the team's second-round pick, is healthy, but Knox 
designated him inactive for this week's game, along with running back James 
Bostic, the team's No. 3 draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the team's 10 draft selections will start this week, although wide 
receivers Isaac Bruce and Chris Brantley and safeties Toby Wright and Keith 
Lyle are expected to play. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Rams are expected to draw about 30,000 Sunday after a 16-0 victory over 
Kansas City. Knox was asked if he was surprised by the lack of fan interest.

<P>
 "I have no comment on that," Knox said. T.J. SIMERS

 Despite the time away, Lynch is expected to start at strong safety when the 
Cardinals play host to Minnesota on Sunday, Coach Buddy Ryan said. 
</P>

 Sanders was arrested Aug. 8 and charged with misdemeanor counts of failing to 
provide a driver's license and resisting arrest during a confrontation with an 
off-duty police officer working as a guard at Riverfront Stadium, where Sanders 
was playing for the Cincinnati Reds. The officer said Sanders, who made the 
last out in a game that night, tried to leave on his motor scooter through a 
pedestrian gate, argued when stopped and then drove away when told he was under 
arrest. The officer, Herb Kohus, said he was dragged about 30 feet.

 A former minority owner of the New England Patriots sued the NFL, claiming 
league officials set out to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
 In a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, Francis W. Murray 
claims the NFL violated federal antitrust laws by blocking his efforts in the 
past two years to bid for a new franchise in St. Louis or to move the Patriots 
to Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the NFL's meddling, the suit said, Murray is no longer a competitor 
for a league franchise. If Murray wins his antitrust case, the defendants would 
be liable for triple damages. He said his losses were over $100,000 but was not 
more specific.

 Roy Tarpley, banned for life from the NBA three years ago, was reinstated by 
the league Friday as the Dallas Mavericks moved closer to re-signing their 
former star. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is working hard, he recognizes the extraordinary opportunity that he now 
has, and he understands what is at stake if he is unable to remain drug free," 
Commissioner David Stern said in a written statement.

 Tarpley, 29, averaged 12.6 points and 10.5 rebounds in five seasons for the 
Mavericks. But the seven-foot forward-center drew what was termed a lifetime 
suspension on Oct. 16, 1991, after he refused to take a drug test, his third 
violation of the NBA's drug policy.

MCGIRT SAYS HE WILL BE READY TO FIGHT WHITAKER THIS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD FINN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This time it will be a fair fight. 
</P>
<P>
 So said James (Buddy) McGirt of his rematch with World Boxing Council 
welterweight champion Pernell Whitaker, here in the champion's hometown tonight 
before an expected capacity crowd of 10,500 at the Scope. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen months ago, McGirt lost the 147-pound crown to Whitaker in a 12-round 
unanimous decision at Madison Square Garden, a result the New Yorker contends 
was caused by a left shoulder injury that turned him into an one-armed fighter 
through the last six rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what cost me the title," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although doctors had diagnosed the injury before the fight as simple 
tendinitis, it proved to be a ruptured tendon, which required surgery a week 
after the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 McGirt promised matters would be quite different this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to take it to him from Round 1 to 12 with both hands firing 
thunder," said McGirt, who has a 63-3-1 record with 44 knockouts. "I'm going to 
give him the worst whipping he has ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last time I didn't have two guns and I went to the gunfight at the O.K. 
Corral with only one thing, six bullets, and there were seven guys. . . . You 
can shoot six of them, but one is going to be standing and he's the one who is 
going to tear you up." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Whitaker, 33-1-1 with 15 knockouts, had easily dominated the first 
fight, the fact that he had to go the distance to win inspires confidence in 
the challenger's camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitaker side dismisses all the talk as that of a sore loser. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he stepped in the ring he was 100%," said the 30-year-old Whitaker, a 
1984 Olympic gold medalist. "He had to reach for something when he started 
losing because no one wants to accept losing. Excuses, excuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Whitaker's co-manager, Lou Duva: "He's a whiner." RICHARD FINN

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; AT THE END, THEY WERE HEARING BELLS 
</P>

<P>
 Six days, four fight cards. 
</P>
<P>
 For six days and nights, through a quirk of scheduling, the Los Angeles area 
was the site of an unofficial boxing festival, a blurry parade of blistering 
performances, ring-card girls, boos and Chuck Bodak. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 20 fights, and every time someone blinked, Bodak, the flamboyant 
cut man who plasters signs and cartoons onto his bald head as the mood strikes 
him, was popping up in a corner, in a locker room, on television. . . . And the 
one night nobody saw him, the absence was wholly distracting. 
</P>
<P>
 The odyssey began last Saturday night at the Grand Olympic Auditorium, moved 
to the Forum on Monday night, careened to the Huntington Park Casino for a late 
Wednesday program, then ended at the Irvine Marriott Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Before it was over, the boxing glutton had seen one man fight twice, one boxer 
knocked unconscious and dozens of little-known men punch each other until 
somebody told them to stop. Here's how it went: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Saturday night, Grand Olympic Auditorium: There's a crowd of about 1,200, a 
good-sized total for the struggling Olympic. 
</P>
<P>
 Young featherweight prospect Robert Garcia is the headline fighter, but newly 
crowned World Boxing Council junior-lightweight champion Gabriel Ruelas gets 
the most attention, wandering through the building with his belt and a wide 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
 As the news of Oliver McCall's stunning upset over Lennox Lewis filters 
through the crowd, light-heavyweights Troy Weaver and Keith McMurray hold, 
shove and showboat, frustrating the loud pack of about 100 on hand in support 
of the obviously more talented Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous decision, however, goes to McMurray, enraging the Weaver crowd 
for about 30 seconds. Then the music starts again and the fans quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that'd happened 15 years ago, there'd have been some bottles in the ring," 
says Olympic owner Steve Needleman as he walks by press row. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days earlier, promoter Bob Arum had been fretting about his inability to 
draw large crowds to the Olympic six months into its second life as a boxing 
showplace. The next card isn't scheduled until November. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Olympic has been disappointing," Arum said. "I'm certainly not making 
money on it, but we've controlled the losses, at least, and I have good people 
working on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I have no reason to quit on it, yet. I still think I could hold a big card 
with the Ruelases (Gabriel and his brother, International Boxing Federation 
lightweight champion Rafael) on it there without worrying it'd not make a 
profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Where's Bodak? He's on TV from London, in the middle of McCall's celebration, 
wearing stickers on his head and working as the cut man for the new World 
Boxing Council heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Monday night, the Forum: Dodger catcher Mike Piazza is a judge, Magic 
Johnson is in the house, and it isn't because Ricky Hesia vs. Florencio Ibarra 
promises to be a welterweight slugfest. 
</P>
<P>
 Classy Manuel Medina is the headliner on the four-fight card, and the Forum is 
the most consistent boxing operation in California, but this is Miss Ringsider 
Contest finals night. 
</P>
<P>
 So the roars are for Camille and Sandy and Christina, the tension builds 
toward the announcement of the winner, and Ibarra's surging victory over Hesia 
is a vague preliminary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the virtually unnoticed first fight, local middleweight Chris (Captain 
Crunch) Wright wins when Don Goodwin can't answer the third-round bell. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the night, Christina wins the $15,000 prize, and there is a 
quiet rush of mumbling in the crowd of about 3,700, many of whom came with huge 
banners supporting their favorite ringsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Where's Bodak? He's in Medina's corner, with a huge sign bearing the fighter's 
name on his head surrounded by stickers saluting the ringsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wednesday night, Huntington Park Casino: It's a small room with a low 
ceiling, bright lights, and, except for ring announcer Jimmy Lennon Jr., the 
language spoken is Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 In this crowd, fans routinely get the attention of fighters in the ring by 
yelling out instructions or venting their anger. One preliminary fighter 
answers back in a stream of Spanish that almost sounds apologetic. 
</P>
<P>
 There is not a boxer on the card whom anyone but the most dedicated fight fan 
would ever have heard of, but the fights are competitive, the 500-600 in 
attendance are knowledgeable and excited, and the night ends at 11 p.m. when 
129-pounder Hector Monhardin stops Raul Contrerars with a vicious left-right 
combination in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no secret, the Mexican boxing fan is my ally," hyperactive promoter 
Peter Broudy says at one point. "I'm losing money tonight, but I'm going for 
the high up side. If I can get this place going twice monthly, get the Mexican 
boxing fans here regularly, this will be great." 
</P>
<P>
 Bodak? He's spotted in the locker room during a costume change into Monhardin 
headgear. 
</P>
<P>
 "If his name was any longer, I'd need a bigger head," says Bodak, wearing an 
Oliver McCall robe. "And I brought my small head tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thursday night, Irvine Marriott: In the first fight, John Vasquez knocks 
Pablito Barrios unconscious for several scary minutes, which slows the suburban 
crowd's traditional shower of money into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, because a heavyweight bout is canceled, Captain Crunch Wright, who won 
the opening bout Monday at the Forum, is back in the ring for the replacement 
fight.

 State commission rules say that because Wright was in a four-rounder at the 
Forum, he needs to be off for only two days. On Tuesday, Wright got the call 
from Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 9 p.m. Thursday, he is fighting Luis Mejia. Four rounds into the 
scheduled five-rounder, referee Fritz Werner stops the bout because of a deep 
cut over Mejia's left eye. Werner rules the cut was caused by a head butt from 
Wright, who is five inches shorter than Mejia, so the fight is ruled a draw, 
even though Wright is winning on the scorecards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit him in the first round with a right hook, that's what caused the cut, I 
know it!" Wright screams in his dressing room after the decision. "It's bull! 
It wasn't a butt. You know, I'd rather lose the fight, that's better than a . . 
. draw!" 
</P>
<P>
 In four days, Wright's record has gone from 4-1 to 5-1-1, and he has earned 
$500 and $600 purses. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bodak is missing. He had said Wednesday that he would be at Irvine but he 
isn't, and nobody knows why. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geez, he's usually a major feature at the shows," one commission employee 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the same without him. Boxing Notes

 Tests by a new doctor have given Zack Padilla new hope for a possible return 
to boxing after he was first told he had a blood clot near his brain. That's 
the word from Victor Valenzuela, who co-manages the Azusa-based World Boxing 
Organization junior-welterweight champion with Rudy Ayon. Although Valenzuela, 
Ayon and Padilla's promoter, Top Rank, Inc., remain cautious, the new doctor 
has told Padilla "there's no reason for him not to continue boxing," Valenzuela 
said. "He took (an MRI) Sunday, and he said everything looks good," Valenzuela 
said. "There was a little damage, a little fluid, but very, very small. His 
brain looks normal. The doctor said he couldn't tell by looking at it that he 
was a boxer." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bob Arum is already planning a card featuring world title defenses by 
Gabriel and Rafael Ruelas, Gabriel, for one, isn't so sure he would like that. 
"Everyone's going to want it, but I don't like fighting on the same card," the 
World Boxing Council junior-lightweight champion said. "I get nervous when Rafa 
fights. I used to hate it when we used to do it. Like I told Dan (Goossen, the 
Ruelas brothers' manager and a Top Rank executive), it's going to be hard and 
it's going to take money for you guys to get us together the same day." 
</P>
<P>
 Oliver McCall's knockout of Lennox Lewis, the World Boxing Council heavyweight 
champion, last weekend changed everything, including the focus on former 
champion Riddick Bowe's fight Dec. 3 against undefeated Larry Donald. Before 
Lewis lost his title, Bowe-Donald was a tuneup for Bowe before his March fight 
with Lewis. Now, with Lewis out of the picture, Bowe needs to dominate Donald. 
</P>
<P>
 Time-Warner, which includes HBO and its pay-per-view arm, TVKO, would like to 
put together a match between Bowe and Michael Moorer, the International Boxing 
Federation and World Boxing Assn. champion who, as does Bowe, has a deal with 
Time-Warner. But without an impressive showing by Bowe, and because of mutual 
distrust by the fighters, there probably won't be enough push from fans and the 
media to make the fight happen unless Bowe is considered to be at the top of 
his game. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Futch, Bowe's trainer, says he isn't concerned that Bowe, who showed 
serious signs of rustiness in his controversial late-hit, no-decision fight 
with Buster Mathis Jr. last month, will be unprepared for the long-armed 
Donald. "If Donald was either a big puncher or a great boxer, I'd be worried," 
Futch said. "I'm not worried."

MCNALL CREDITORS MIGHT NOT GET MUCH; JURISPRUDENCE: TRUSTEE REPORT SAYS HE 
COULD OWE $300 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The trustee overseeing the bankruptcy case of King President Bruce McNall says 
that his creditors will receive "only a small fraction" of what they are owed. 
</P>
<P>
 His report, filed Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles, also said 
that McNall's 28% stake in the team "provides the greatest single hope for any 
meaningful payment to remaining creditors." The report says that total claims 
against McNall could be as much as $300 million, although McNall and his 
lawyers dispute some of them. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall bankruptcy lawyer Richard Wynne said it is premature to say that 
McNall's creditors won't get much money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a safe, conservative conclusion for a trustee to make. My conclusion is 
that it's too early to tell," Wynne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which recommends that McNall's finances continue to be reorganized 
instead of liquidated, contains background information about McNall's crumbled 
financial empire -- including that it once involved 65 different companies and 
more than 130 bank accounts, a number of them foreign accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, the trustee, R. Todd Neilson, has recovered sports 
memorabilia items from McNall's former business associate Joanna Orehek, which 
may be worth as much as $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the inventory are four albums containing what is alleged to be a 
complete set of 1952 Topps baseball cards, King game jerseys worn in 1991 and 
1992 and baseball jerseys autographed by players who wore them -- Carl 
Yastrzemski, Pete Rose, Warren Spahn, Sandy Koufax and Mickey Mantle, to name a 
few. 
</P>
<P>
 Other glimpses of the once high-flying business empire emerged from the 
report. Neilson said that McNall has an interest in about 46 racehorses in the 
United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall also owns a condominium apartment at Trump Plaza in New York. The debt 
on the apartment is more than $423,000, which appears to exceed its value. 
McNall's Boeing 727, which the Kings once used on trips, has recently been 
levied by the U.S. Marshal, which plans a judgment sale on Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also provides more extensive details regarding the financial 
pressures that forced McNall to sell majority interest in the Kings, saying 
that "there is substantial evidence that McNall and the McNall companies were 
in significant financial trouble by 1993," and that McNall admitted to one of 
his executives, James Bailey, as early as 1992 that he was insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
 It also states that in January, 1992, Bailey found "various financial 
improprieties, including a bank account of the Los Angeles Kings that was not 
kept on its accounting books and into which millions of dollars were 
transferred during 1993-94." 
</P>
<P>
 As previously reported, McNall has agreed to plead guilty to four criminal 
counts stemming from a federal investigation into his banking practices. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall's lawyers earlier this week reached an agreement with Neilson to give 
Neilson firm control over McNall's assets, including his stake in the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the NHL has made it clear to Neilson that he is subject to restrictions 
under NHL bylaws regarding sale of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Neilson and the lawyer representing him, Leonard L. Gumport of the law firm 
Hufstedler & Kaus, had alleged that McNall was improperly shielding his assets 
through a special "creditors trust" set up just before he entered bankruptcy 
proceedings.

WALSH, WILLIS LEAD BYU OVER UTAH STATE, 34-6

<P>
 John Walsh threw for two touchdowns and Jamal Willis ran for two scores as 
Brigham Young rolled past penalty-plagued Utah State, 34-6, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was moved up a day to avoid conflicting with conferences being held 
by BYU's parent Mormon Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, who left the game with one quarter to play, completed 17 of 27 passes 
with no interceptions for 306 yards for BYU (4-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Willis was held to 51 yards by Utah State but still reached a school-record 34 
career touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah State (1-4) was penalized nine times for 96 yards, including two 
unsportsmanlike conduct calls against Coach Charlie Weatherbie.

<TEXT>
<P>
 So, what did happen in the NHL on Friday? 
</P>
<P>
 There won't be any hockey for at least two weeks, but there was no clear-cut 
consensus on just what to call it.Despite what many fans believe, the players 
are not on strike. That's about the only thing players and owners seem to agree 
upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound bites from a day of dissension: 
</P>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman: "We are going to reconfigure the schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, head of the players' union: "It's an owners' lockout, pure and 
simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Duck defenseman Robert Dirk: "You can say what you want about it, it's 
a play on words. We're not going to be playing. Is it a lockout or a 
postponement? I'm not working as of tomorrow, which I should be, and I'm not 
getting paid." 
</P>
<P>
 King center Wayne Gretzky: "This two-week thing, as far as I'm concerned, is a 
bit of a cover." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles labor lawyer Lester G. Ostrov: "It's typical for both unions and 
employers who are in the public eye to posture, and to try to say it in a way 
that puts them in the best light. But if it walks like a duck . . . no pun 
intended." LISA DILLMAN

FAIRPLEX; EARLY DUEL BENEFITS ANGI GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Roger Stein, who was upset at everybody connected with Steff Graf on 
Sept. 14 when that filly challenged his Southern Truce for the early lead in 
the E.B. Johnston Stakes, is the one who has to answer that same question 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did he allow David Flores and Southern Truce to hook up with heavily 
favored Magical Maiden in Friday's $100,000 Las Madrinas Handicap at Fairplex 
Park? 
</P>
<P>
 The two horses covered the first half-mile in 45 4/5 seconds, the fastest time 
of the meet for a distance race and it compromised both of their chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein couldn't be found for an answer, but Angi Go, under a skillful ride by 
Fernando Valenzuela, was positioned perfectly to catch the tiring front-runners 
and he scored a half-length victory over Kelkyko, ridden by Paul Atkinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Nakatani got Magical Maiden home in third place in the 1 1/16-mile race, 
much to the relief of one bettor in Viejas who plunked down $14,000 on the 
horse to show. It created a minus pool when Magical Maiden finished third and 
the track lost $3,011. The bettor made a $700 profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Magical Maiden, clearly the class of the five-horse field, broke quickly along 
with Southern Truce and the two of them were clear by five lengths at the 
half-mile pole. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was fine with us," trainer Dave Hofmans said. "Our filly has won in the 
bullring before. I had told Fernando to play it by ear. She has a lot of speed 
and could have gone out with the leaders, but he rode her just right." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela was also happy with Angi Go's early position. "I didn't want to 
make the lead too early because she kind of gets to holding herself back, which 
she tried to do today. If not, we would have won easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Angi Go made her move around the far turn and ran outside of Magical Maiden, 
then beat Kelkyko to the wire. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 It was a strong day for chalk players, which made for a low Pick-Six, $116.40, 
the smallest of the meeting. . . . Berillon, a 24-1 upset winner in last year's 
Pomona Invitational Handicap, has drawn the No. 8 post position for Sunday's 
16th edition of the $150,000 race. Berillon will face nine rivals in the 1 
1/8-mile race for 3-year-olds and up. The field in order: Southern Wish, Corey 
Nakatani, 116; Half Past Ten, Joy Scott, 106; Lyphard Lizard, Paul Atkinson, 
114; Sand Lizard, Danny Sorenson, 113; Risen Roman, Gary Stevens, 114; Seahawk 
Gold, G.F. Almeida, 117; Lovely One, Martin Pedroza, 114; Berillon, Adalberto 
Lopez, 114; Nancys French Fry, Fernando Valenzuela, 118; Marfamatic, David 
Flores, 115. . . . Wing It heads a field of seven in the $15,000 Silver and 
Gold Invitational Handicap for Appaloosas, which will be the second race on 
Sunday. . . . Letthebiggatorout and P.V. Battle, both thoroughbreds, will take 
on quarter horses in the Pomona 870 Handicap, the third race on Sunday's card. 
. . . Trainer David Bernstein has recovered from a recent bout of 
periocarditis, an ailment in which excess fluid forms around the heart. 
Bernstein says he hopes to have The Wicked North ready to race again in 
January.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SULFUR ODOR AT AMGEN FOUND TO BE 
HARMLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A suspicious sulfur odor coming from a drain pipe on Friday prompted 
evacuation of an Amgen parking garage and a large response by the county Fire 
Department's hazardous materials unit. 
</P>
<P>
 An employee at the biotechnology company's Thousand Oaks campus reported a 
strong rotten-egg smell coming from the bottom level of a three-story parking 
garage just before 11 a.m. and alerted the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 fire personnel and members of the hazardous materials team 
investigated the smell. Two engine companies, a truck and the hazardous 
materials truck blocked employees' entry to the main campus throughout the 
lunch hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Kappen, a spokesman for the Fire Department, said the hazardous 
materials team was brought because of concern that high levels of hydrogen 
sulfide gas might have been in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you have that sulfur smell you have the chance of severe injury," 
Kappen said. "With hydrogen sulfide gas, if it's strong enough, it can make you 
stop breathing." 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen spokesman David Kaye said about 2,400 people work on the Thousand Oaks 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department flushed the drain with water and concluded that 
decomposing material had caused the smell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever it was has dissipated," Kaye said. "The assumption is it was just 
stagnant water in the sump line." 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported. All was back to normal on the campus by 1:30 p.m., 
Kaye said. MARY F. POLS

CITY ACCUSED OF HIDING SIGNIFICANCE OF BONES; RELIGION: ANGRY CHUMASH SAY 
THOUSAND OAKS VIOLATED STATE LAW WHEN REMAINS WERE FOUND IN AN AREA PLANNED FOR 
USE AS A PUBLIC PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Angry Native Americans accused Thousand Oaks city and park officials Friday of 
hiding the significance of human remains found on Lang Ranch to ensure that a 
neighborhood park is built there. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting late Thursday, city officials told a group of Native Americans 
that the city had re-evaluated the importance of bone fragments and beads found 
on the eight-acre site and determined they were not part of a Chumash cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 An archeologist hired by the city said Friday, however, that he found strong 
indications four years ago that the site was a burial ground, but no more bones 
were discovered because Conejo Recreation and Park District officials asked him 
at that time to halt his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's claim that no burial site exists could clear the way for a public 
park, officials said. If the park is not built, the land would be returned to 
Lang Ranch developers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's ruling this week infuriated local Chumash, who also charged that 
the city violated state law by not notifying state heritage officials and the 
coroner when the skull and bone fragments were discovered in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either they should cancel any plans to put baseball diamonds and soccer 
fields on that site, or they should do a completely new investigation of the 
site," said Paul Varela, director of the Native American Interpretive Center in 
Thousand Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 "What's clear to me is that we have been misled by the city in order for them 
to build their park without anyone complaining," he said. "I can't find the 
words to express how angry I am about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither planner Greg Smith, the city's representative at Thursday's meeting, 
nor Tex Ward, the park district's general manager, could be reached for comment 
Friday. Other park officials would not comment on the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thousand Oaks City Atty. Mark Sellers said the city has acted properly in 
investigating the significance of the bone fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether or not it is a burial site, the site is going to be a park," Sellers 
said. "And the city has no say in how the land will be used. That's up to the 
park district to decide." 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers said the fact the land will be a park does not mean it has to be 
incompatible with use as a burial site. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may just require some further investigation to see if there's a way to 
satisfy everyone's needs," Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Schillo said he was surprised by the city's new position, and 
he said he will ask for an investigation to see if city staff members did 
anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a matter of significant interest that the City Council look 
into it," Schillo said. "I will take the initiative to do that on Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo attended an August meeting where Smith told a group of Chumash that 
bone fragments had been found on the site.  
</P>
<P>
 After learning of the find, Native Americans informed Ward that they did not 
want visitors roasting hot dogs where their ancestors are buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward was adamant that he needed the park site because it would be the only one 
set aside for recreation for 5,000 families expected to live in the Lang Ranch 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Folkes, a Chumash who attended Thursday's meeting, said local 
officials wanted a park so badly that they downplayed the bone fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seemed like they wanted to stretch the truth," Folkes said. "They 
kept saying to us, 'You know that if Park and Rec doesn't develop the land, 
Lang Ranch will come in and build houses on it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Park officials said they had no firm plans for equipping the park, but such a 
site typically includes a cement basketball court, picnic tables, baseball 
backstops and playground space. 
</P>
<P>
 That, according to the local Chumash, would be unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply will not let them do that," said Leo Valenzuela, chairman of the 
Oakbrook Park Chumash Indian Corp. "We cannot have kids playing baseball on our 
ancestors' graves." 
</P>
<P>
 The other issue that troubles Schillo and area Native Americans is the 
allegation that the archeologist hired by the city, the Chumash monitor and 
city officials all failed to notify the coroner or the state Native American 
Heritage Commission when the bones were discovered four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Heritage Commission officials in Sacramento and county Deputy Coroner Jim 
Wingate said Friday their offices have no record of the Lang Ranch find. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers said city officials made no call to the coroner on the advice of the 
Native American monitors the city hired to ensure that burial grounds are not 
destroyed. He said city officials did not think it was necessary to call the 
coroner because the bones were "so obviously ancient." 
</P>
<P>
 But a Heritage Commission official said such notification is mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law is very clear that if even the smallest bone fragment is found the 
coroner should be called immediately," said Larry Myers, the Heritage 
Commission's executive secretary. "It's important not only because the bones 
could be recent, but because we can record the location of the finding." 
</P>
<P>
 Archeologist William Clewlow, who studied the Lang Ranch site, said he should 
have called the coroner but did not. 
</P>
<P>
 "My recollection is that everyone wanted to be quiet about it so that the site 
did not get publicized," Clewlow said. "I suppose, if anyone was responsible 
for calling the coroner it probably was me." 
</P>
<P>
 Clewlow said his investigation turned up significant evidence of a cemetery, 
including the bone fragments, increased numbers of beads and quartz crystals 
and soil of a quality consistent with that of a burial site. 
</P>
<P>
 The site was similar to numerous other Chumash cemeteries he has encountered, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the fragments were found, no further excavation was done because he 
and Chumash monitor Richard Angulo were told by Park District officials that 
the land would be a passive park. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us there was no need to go further because of the way the land 
would be used, and everyone agreed," Clewlow said. "If nothing was going to be 
built, any further work would have just done more damage to the sanctity of the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 Angulo reburied the remains in 1990, and the whole site was covered with six 
feet of dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Folkes said she hopes the site will be left in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to leave it alone, but if they insist on pursuing their park, I 
think the city should re-investigate the site," Folkes said. "It's the only way 
we're going to be able to put this to rest."

FROZEN IN MEMORY, CONEJO VALLEY ICE RINK IS NOW FACING CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The place is a dump, no doubt about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Every wall covered with black smears from the impact of 17 years worth of 
hockey pucks flying off the ice. Hasty plywood repairs on the boards behind the 
goalies' nets. Only a forlorn hot drinks vending machine offering dubious 
relief from constant damp and cold. 
</P>
<P>
 But still, there is something besides mustiness in the air of the Conejo 
Valley Ice Skating Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Memories of that solid check that sent the other hockey player slamming into 
the boards, the perfect slap shot, a small skater's first completed spin, the 
arabesque that lasted the length of the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quaint," said Caren Kiner, watching her 5-year-old son Ben race around 
the ice in unsteady circles earlier this week. "That is what I would say about 
this dump. It's quaint." 
</P>
<P>
 Another hockey mom, Carol Gutesha, paused before hustling 3-year-old Alex out 
of the dark rink and into the bright sunlight of Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "This rink is run-down, but it sure has character," Gutesha said. "I would 
love to see it stay here." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Conejo Valley Ice Skating Center, on Ventu Park Road just off the 
Ventura Freeway, is most likely headed for a serious defrosting. Sean 
McGillivray, the Nova Scotia native and hockey enthusiast who has run the rink 
for the last seven years, is relocating to another man-made piece of perpetual 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 McGillivray has just built an Olympic-size rink and a National Hockey 
League-size rink side by side in Simi Valley. When they open, probably as soon 
as next week, he and his teaching and coaching staff will depart the Newbury 
Park rink forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Depot, just next door, owns the building housing the rink. Brian Marino, 
the store's manager, said he was not sure what would happen to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know, we are not going to take that property as part of the 
store," Marino said. "I assume we're going to have another tenant in there. But 
I really don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 McGillivray said the Newbury Park rink, though tiny and run-down, has long 
been the only place in the area to ice-skate. Even though the rink was far from 
perfect, he struggled to keep it open, taking over its management in 1987 after 
it nearly closed down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to keep the ice up so that we could keep the sport alive," 
McGillivray said. "We just worked really hard to keep it open. It was an old 
building and it was never designed properly to be a rink. We've been keeping it 
together almost literally with bubble gum and Band-Aids." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Skating instructor Jennifer Laumann remembers when the Conejo Valley rink was 
brand new: the biggest, the nicest, the best-polished sheet of ice around. She 
skated here as a young girl, eventually turning pro and performing with Walt 
Disney's World on Ice. She skated the part of the Evil Queen in Snow White. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of blood, sweat and tears in this rink," Laumann said, looking out 
fondly on the now bumpy expanse of ice, made uneven by expanding permafrost 
under its surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing the beauty you can get," she said as a few young skaters passed 
by on long, graceful legs. "This beautiful sport in a rink that maybe needs a 
face lift." 
</P>
<P>
 "A piece of my own personal history is going to be closing," Laumann said. 
"You know how you finish high school or you move? You don't think about it, 
then all of a sudden it hits you. This is part of me that I'm leaving behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Others also got their start in Newbury Park and continued into professional 
skating careers. Todd Sands and Natasha Kuchiki were U.S. National pairs 
champions in 1991 and 1992. Steve Bogoyevac, captain of the Los Angles Blades, 
the professional roller hockey team, began his hockey career skating here. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood types have even dropped in from time to time. Alan Thicke, star of 
the old television series "Growing Pains," played hockey in the rink's adult 
league. Actor Chad Lowe, better known as the brother of actor Rob Lowe, got 
checked into these boards by a professional woman hockey player from Finland, 
McGillivray said. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the Tonya Harding saga created two new stars who trained on the 
Newbury Park ice. Tisha Walker, a 1992 Olympics contender, was the skating 
double for an actress playing Harding in an NBC made-for-TV movie about the 
Nancy Kerrigan knee-whacking incident. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Shaub, a tiny 5-year-old from Moorpark, with a blond ponytail, blue eyes 
and a lot of natural talent, played a young Tonya Harding in the same movie. 
</P>
<P>
 While Sarah spun happily away on center ice Thursday, her mother Joan said she 
would be happy to relocate from what she refers to as "the bomb" to the brand 
new facility in Simi Valley, which features, among other amenities, heated 
locker rooms and a restaurant. She said her daughter has yet to see the new 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't even taken her over there," Shaub said. "She'll drive me nuts when 
she sees it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah had little to say on the matter beyond an emphatic head shake when asked 
if she would miss the Newbury Park rink. 
</P>
<P>
 But McGillivray was more sentimental. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll miss everything about it," he said, "from being up there at 4 a.m. 
coaching, to walking in and smelling the old rink, to seeing the kids grow. 
Just seeing it close, I'll probably shed a tear."

AUTHORITIES SAY GUARD MADE UP 'ASSAULT' BY VANDALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A security guard's claim that he had been attacked by armed vandals in 
Moorpark prompted a full-scale police response Thursday, but a helicopter crew, 
14 sheriff's deputies and two police dogs found only that the guard made the 
whole story up. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathon David Smith, 21, of Oxnard was arrested on suspicion of falsely 
reporting an assault about 11 p.m. Thursday, authorities said, three hours 
after launching the $4,000 wild-goose chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was held briefly in the east county jail before being released Friday 
morning, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Steve Bourke said he had no idea why Smith cooked up the story. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the man may have wanted to see all the emergency equipment in action. 
Or he may have watched too many cop shows, Bourke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure he had his own reasons," he said. "I stopped asking those questions 
a long time ago to save my sanity." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith dialed 911 about 8 p.m. Thursday and said that he had been shot at by 
three suspects while guarding a construction site at 700 Science Drive in 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith told deputies he confronted the suspects as they painted graffiti at the 
site. They shot at him with a revolver and a shotgun before running away, Smith 
told police. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard also said he hurt his leg, prompting a medical response from Pruner 
Ambulance, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 An extensive search of the area ensued because of the serious nature of the 
call, Bourke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When somebody says they've been shot at and there are multiple suspects with 
multiple weapons, we're going to respond with whatever we've got," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the search turned up no suspects, physical evidence or other clues to 
support Smith's report, deputies questioned him and he admitted lying, Bourke 
said. There was no attack and no taggers, Bourke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials estimate that Smith's tall tale cost taxpayers at least 
$4,000. The helicopter costs about $700 an hour to fly and each deputy costs 
about 75 cents a minute, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they were unsure whether they would try to recover the costs 
from Smith or his employer. 
</P>
<P>
 A security guard for Mail Marketing, the San Fernando Valley company that is 
building large offices at the Moorpark site, said Thursday was Smith's first 
night working the night shift. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was employed by Burns International Security Services in Ventura. Joe 
Allen, a spokesman for Burns' parent company, Chicago-based Borg-Warner 
Security Corp., said Smith had passed a pre-employment screening. 
</P>
<P>
 But a psychological test given to all employees "indicated he had some 
emotional instability," Allen said.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith has been suspended without pay while the incident is investigated, Allen 
said. Smith could not be reached for comment Friday.

CONDO GROUP SETTLES FOR $8.6 MILLION; COURT: HIDDEN CANYON HOMEOWNERS ASSN. IN 
THOUSAND OAKS CHARGED GRIFFIN HOMES AND SUBCONTRACTORS WITH SHODDY 
CONSTRUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurers for a developer and subcontractors that built a condominium project 
in the Hidden Canyon area of Thousand Oaks will pay $8.6 million to a 
homeowners' association to settle a lawsuit charging them with shoddy 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The complicated 4-year-old suit against Calabasas-based Griffin Homes and 
dozens of subcontractors was finally settled last week after an exhaustive 
three weeks of court-ordered mediation sessions, the attorney for the 
association, Alexander Robertson IV, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad it's over, I was looking forward to having it end," said Linda E. 
Meyer, a professor at Pepperdine University School of Law who conducted the 
mediation. "It was emotionally draining for everyone involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hidden Canyon Homeowners Assn. originally sought $50 million in damages 
against Griffin Homes, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992, Robertson said. A 
handful of subcontractors were ordered to pay $540,000 to the association last 
fall in partial settlement of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents contended in the lawsuit that the 648-unit complex was poorly 
constructed and began to deteriorate soon after it was built. They complained 
about leaky roofs, cracked walls and uneven floors. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the bankruptcy protected the Griffin Homes' assets from seizure, the 
association tried to recoup its losses through the developer's insurance 
company, Robertson said. The insurance companies fiercely contested the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their policies contained numerous exclusions for various types of damages," 
Robertson said. "That's the reason for the big difference," between what the 
homeowners originally sought and what they received. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Cohen, an attorney who represented the developer, could not be reached for 
comment Friday. But last year he said he hoped the matter would be settled out 
of court. He suggested that the subcontractors, and not Griffin Homes, should 
be held liable. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson has maintained that memos by Griffin Homes to subcontractors show 
that the developer knew about the defects and urged subcontractors to ignore 
them. For example, according to Robertson, one subcontractor notified Griffin 
Homes that the builder had failed to waterproof Sheetrock used in construction, 
which would cause leaks after the walls were covered with stucco. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson said the warning was ignored and the subcontractor was told to 
proceed with work. 
</P>
<P>
 In another instance, Griffin Homes hired a roofing expert from Texas to 
examine the roof after the developer had made several repairs, Robertson said. 
The consultant informed Griffin Homes in writing that the roof had serious 
problems that would continue for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson said homeowners were never told about the consultant's report. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit became complicated after Griffin Homes went bankrupt, said Meyer, who 
has a private mediation practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "That made the case more difficult to settle," she said. "You had to first 
show there was a problem and that the problem was covered under" the various 
insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the large number of defendants and insurance companies further 
complicated the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were 20 insurance companies at least, that represented the developer 
and the subcontractors," she said. "The developer had four different insurance 
companies, all of whom were making claims that the coverage was not in their 
policy, or that it should be restricted to a particular year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had this case not been settled, there would have to have been 300 depositions 
taken," she added.

LOCAL TEAMS HATE IT, WHATEVER IT'S CALLED; DUCKS: TAVARES SAYS BOTH SIDES ARE 
TO BLAME FOR IMPASSE. PLAYERS ARE NOT SURPRISED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The solitary fan sitting in a sea of empty seats is fast becoming a symbol of 
professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Tavares, president of the Mighty Ducks, says the lonely fan will be him 
on Oct. 9, the Sunday afternoon The Pond of Anaheim was supposed to reverberate 
with the mega-hype celebration of the Mighty Ducks' home-opener against the 
Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be my protest," said Tavares -- almost as if forgetting for a moment 
he is president of one of the 26 teams that gave Commissioner Gary Bettman 
their unanimous approval to call off the scheduled opening of the NHL season 
today, initiating a work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be protesting the fact that we haven't been smart enough as a group -- 
both sides -- to figure out a solution," Tavares said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL-imposed work stoppage is a particular letdown for the second-year 
team, still giddy from last year's success and eager for the much-anticipated 
debut of rookie Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya says he is disappointed, but "this is not something that has just come 
out of the blue." The battle lines were drawn before he arrived, but he hasn't 
hesitated since reaching the front. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy for me to back the union, because hopefully I'm going to be in the 
NHL a while," he said. "The veterans don't need to fight for the younger guys, 
but they're in there fighting for the new guys and the guys who are 
15-years-old and playing bantam hockey right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck players made a cursory appearance at the arena Friday to hear what they 
expected to hear: Games called on account of labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gut feelings were shown yesterday on this team when we packed our bags 
and pulled out of here," said defenseman Tom Kurvers. "I'm not overly 
optimistic, I'm not overly pessimistic. I don't know. . . . We were ready to 
play. No matter how well training camp is going or how poorly, you're basically 
gearing up for the first game." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman announced Friday the first two weeks of the season have been 
"postponed" -- a rhetorical term that has inspired an incendiary war of words 
on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can say what you want about it, it's a play on words," defenseman Robert 
Dirk said. "We're not going to be playing. Is it a lockout or a postponement? 
I'm not working as of tomorrow, which I should be, and I'm not getting paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the regular season has not begun, Duck players will not receive their 
first paychecks, scheduled for Oct. 13. If the season were to start Oct. 15, 
they would receive their first checks Oct. 27. Players are not paid during 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Friday, they had the weekend off, awaiting word from NHL Players Assn. 
chief Bob Goodenow on what their practice procedures should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck players have reserved ice time at Glacial Garden ice rink in Anaheim 
beginning Monday at a cost of $300 an hour, to be paid by the NHLPA, which 
declined Duck management's offer to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our understanding that we're going to stay sharp by skating at Glacial 
Garden and going to the fitness center as a team," Dirk said. "Management has 
been very good in letting us take our equipment to stay in shape. It's a little 
different here than some other places. There's good rapport between players and 
management in this organization. We both want there to be hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of the few pieces of common ground. Asked if he believes the owners' 
claim that "more than half" of NHL teams are losing money, Dirk said, "No." 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe a couple are. My question would be, why are so many people willing 
to line up to buy expansion teams if they know it's a money-losing business?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tavares -- who notes that the NHL has offered to open its books -- said the 
negotiations have little hope of going anywhere until the sides trust each 
other. For now, much of the discussion among the rank and file has been 
centered on the definitions of highly charged terms such as lockout and salary 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're spending too much time on terminology. Terminology is not the problem," 
Tavares said. "Too much time is spent on name-calling and what description 
we're going to use for not starting the season on time. It's highly 
irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
 The most relevant thing today is that it's opening day, and the NHL season 
isn't opening. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In a work stoppage-related move, rookie right wing John Lilley, 22, was 
assigned to San Diego of the International Hockey League. Lilley made the Duck 
team but was assigned for conditioning purposes.

 Gary Bettman stood in there Friday, unflinching, and explained to millions of 
hockey fans across the continent that he was not postponing the start of the 
NHL season, or locking out the players at the start of the NHL season, or 
automatically invalidating the 200,000 tickets sold in advance for this 
weekend's openers. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Bettman said, he was simply "going to reconfigure" the schedule of the NHL 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 This was particularly brave of the commissioner, considering that some 48 
hours earlier, Chicago Blackhawks defenseman and aspiring Goodfella Chris 
Chelios wondered about the possibility of "some crazed fan or player" -- anyone 
you might know, Chris? -- setting out to reconfigure Bettman's face. 
</P>
<P>
 What does that mean -- reconfigure the schedule? 
</P>
<P>
 Push the openers back to Oct. 15 and cross your fingers that between now and 
then the heavens breach, lightning bolts crackle and a stone tablet is dropped 
from the sky, bearing the inscription, "THOU SHALT DROP THE PUCK ALREADY"? 
</P>
<P>
 Or push the openers back to Oct. 15, get to Oct. 15, see that Bettman and 
union chief Bob Goodenow are still gritting their teeth and making animal 
noises at one another, announce you're pushing the openers back to Oct. 30, get 
to Oct. 30, announce you're pushing the openers back to Nov. 15, and so on, and 
so on, until it's February and time to announce that "pitchers and catchers 
report on the 16th, along with forwards and defensemen"? 
</P>
<P>
 According to Boston Bruins' owner Jeremy Jacobs, Friday's announcement "gives 
us the next two weeks to work toward achieving our goal -- labor peace." And if 
you believe that, I have a fantasy hockey pool you might be interested in 
joining. Entry fee: $1,000, non-refundable, payable up front. 
</P>
<P>
 This new Oct. 15 deadline is no different than the old Oct. 1 deadline. Both 
were made to be broken, as will future deadlines -- or, to cop the owners' spin 
on the term, "ever valuable and beneficial extensions for further negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky says he believes the hockey stalemate will drag on until 
Christmas. Great. Now kids in Canada, and maybe some players, too, will be 
singing, "All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth and a new collective 
bargaining agreement." It should be a joy to behold. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other pre-work stoppage buzz holds that the first NHL games of the 
1994-1995 season will be played some time in January, 1995, just as soon as the 
new Fox television contract kicks in. 
</P>
<P>
 And Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals? July 4, anyone? Bastille Day? Or maybe 
the night traditionally reserved for baseball's all-star game. Good chance 
baseball won't be needing it next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday was Fan Appeasement Day, no question about it. Thursday, Goodenow 
scored a public relations hat trick with his offer to start the season 
immediately with a no-strike pledge through the playoffs by the union. It was a 
brilliant stroke, and it forced Bettman to respond in kind, meaning with tact, 
which is not his nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Bettman countered according to form, he would have told Goodenow where to 
stick it, pronounced the season postponed until "I'm damn good and ready," and, 
probably, declared martial law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chelios Cretins would have been marching on Toronto by the morning, and 
the league wanted no part of that. You know the NHL credo: All major acts of 
violence accepted, but only on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 So Bettman tried to placate the fans, best he could, by holding out hope that 
in two weeks' time, Hockey Night In North America will be back on the air. Fat 
chance of that, of course, but the owners are scrambling here, desperate to 
find a way to prevent mass revolt by advance ticket buyers now demanding 
refunds. This is the best they could come up with. 
</P>
<P>
 The gesture is as cynical as it is empty. Friday, Bettman said he didn't 
believe the players were forthright in their no-strike offer, claiming that 
"there is some question of their bargaining in good faith." Goodenow, in turn, 
said he didn't believe the owners' assertion that the league is on the brink of 
economic disaster, noting the recent franchise purchases by Disney, Blockbuster 
and ITT Cablevision. Mutual distrust is at a fever pitch and the two sides are 
more polarized today than they were a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen more days are going to make everything swell again? 
</P>
<P>
 After Wednesday night's Kings-Sharks exhibition at the Forum, which very 
likely could end up being the last NHL played in California in 1994, Kings 
winger Tony Granato said he and his colleagues were digging in for the long 
term, preparing themselves for the absolute worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the owners have drawn up a 50-game schedule," Granato said. "We know 
teams are renting ice time into the summer. They think the players are going to 
buckle. They think the players will come crawling back. There's just no way." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman won his current position as NHL commissioner largely on his reputation 
as NBA salary-cap wonder boy, the man who helped create the financial structure 
that helped usher in the golden age of professional hoops in the early 80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Granato disputed the concept, saying that "it was Magic and Jordan and Bird 
and Barkley who were responsible for the growth of the NBA, not some salary 
structure or anything like that. It's the players." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, Granato said, the NHL has those kind of players. Gretzky. Bure. 
Messier. Fedorov. Kariya, if and when. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the continued growth of the NHL is contingent on those players 
being on the ice. But at the moment, only the season is on ice, and no magic 
number pulled out of a top hat is likely to change that. Especially not Oct. 
15.

CHAPMAN MOVES UP TO NEXT WEIGHT CLASS AT REDLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Redlands football Coach Mike Maynard predicted this. 
</P>
<P>
 In August 1993, when Chapman football was still lacking such essentials as 
coaches and players, Maynard said the Panthers would be immediately competitive 
with the best teams in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Chapman has easily handled two weaker SCIAC opponents, Whittier, 
30-13, and Claremont-Mudd, 34-14. But tonight at 7 p.m., the Panthers play at 
Redlands in a game that should test Maynard's theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands won three consecutive conference titles before tying for third last 
season. The Bulldogs are 2-0 this season after beating Azusa Pacific, 31-14, 
and Pomoma-Pitzer, 39-15. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been telling the team that this is a real measuring stick to see 
where we are," Chapman Coach Ken Visser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maynard, however, said his team isn't formidable yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't really been that impressive," he said, noting that the Bulldogs 
only led Pomona-Pitzer, 18-15, before scoring 21-consecutive points in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people think that because we show up with 95 players, we are an 
awesome team," Maynard said. "We're not an awesome team." 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands has been depending on its running game; the Bulldogs are leading the 
SCIAC in rushing with a 304-yard average. Running back Anthony Jones rushed for 
213 yards and two touchdowns against Pomona-Pitzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands has the SCIAC's most effective defense against the rush, giving up 
only 81.5 yards per game. Linebacker Joe Kelly was named the conference player 
of the week with 18 tackles against Pomona-Pitzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Maynard said he likes the Bulldogs' chances if they can keep the game close. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chapman is so explosive," Maynard said. "They are a team that can pull away 
from you. They have fast receivers and a fast quarterback. I hope they don't 
get away from us early." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman quarterback Curtis Robinson, who sat out last week with a separated 
shoulder, will likely start and his return should open up Chapman's options. 
Robinson gained 272 yards in total offense and accounted for four touchdowns 
against Whittier. Last week, with a rusty Todd Gragnano at quarterback, the 
Panthers stayed mostly on the ground and tailback Darnell Morgan gained 200 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can hang the whole game on running our tailback inside," 
Visser said. "We thought we could do that against Claremont and we did, but 
it's not going to work against these people."

OREGON'S MCLEMORE WISHES HIS BIGGEST FAN COULD BE AT GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing against USC would be special in any season for Oregon wide receiver 
Cristin McLemore, who grew up in Torrance and was a football star at Marina 
High after moving to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago in Eugene, McLemore caught seven passes for 68 yards and two 
touchdowns, but the Trojans won, 24-13. It was one of his better performances 
in a sparkling sophomore season. Only his game against Stanford, in which he 
had 11 receptions for 230 yards and three touchdowns, was better. 
</P>
<P>
 For the season, McLemore had 50 catches for 791 yards and 10 touchdowns, 
ranking him among the nation's top 50 receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's game against USC at the Coliseum, however, will take on even more 
importance for McLemore. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a personal homecoming, and McLemore could use a calculator to keep 
track of family members and friends who plan to attend the game. The group will 
include one of his uncles, Mark McLemore, an infielder with the Baltimore 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 But this game has become even more special to McLemore because of someone who 
won't be there. Victor Marin died in May of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was like my godfather," McLemore said. "He meant a lot to me, and it's 
really been hard for me to realize he's gone. He really cared a lot about me 
and my career. He was a great USC football fan, but I know if he were there he 
would be pulling for me to do well. I've sort of dedicated this season to him." 
</P>
<P>
 McLemore spent considerable time in the Marin home in Los Angeles while 
growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Victor's wife, Rita, provided our child care when I was working," said 
McLemore's mother, Janet, who still lives in Torrance. "I was a single parent, 
and I was working as a nursing administrator. Victor and his wife were 
wonderful to us as a family, and Victor took great interest in Cristin. This is 
the first death of someone close to him that Cristin has had to face." 
</P>
<P>
 McLemore's mother and father separated, then divorced in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things his mother and I decided was that I would always be a big 
part of his life," said his father, Lou, who is in sales and lives in Irvine. 
"I feel I've been able to do that." Cristin moved to Huntington Beach to live 
with his father for his final three years of high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Marin remained a big fan at that point, as well. "He always really enjoyed 
coming to watch Cristin play football," Lou said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cristin McLemore remembers well. "He could just look at you, and smile, and 
make you feel better when you were down about something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been fortunate, he said, to have the support he has received from Marin 
and his parents, as well as Mark McLemore. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad has really been my man," Cristin McLemore said. "He's played the sport 
himself, and I really trust what he tells me. He keeps me up emotionally all 
the time. Whenever I'm down, he always tells me there are bigger and better 
things ahead for me. I really enjoy the relationships I have with him and with 
my mother." 
</P>
<P>
 His father played football and baseball at San Diego Hoover High. He was more 
successful in baseball, a sport he played for three years in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 They both say Mark has been someone Cristin has looked up to. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's definitely been an inspiration to me," McLemore said. "He's someone who 
is at the pinnacle in his sport, and you really have to appreciate that. He's 
also helped me with some situations that have been frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet says Mark has been "a positive force" for the whole family, including 
Cristin's younger brother, Brandon, a senior at Bishop Montgomery High in 
Torrance. Brandon, 6 feet 4 and 185 pounds, is a starter in football and 
basketball. He plays wide receiver and has attracted college scouts' attention 
for his play as a free safety. He says he would like to play in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon, primarily a passing team in the last decade, has been putting more 
emphasis on the running game this season and is 2-2. McLemore, who was a 
redshirt his freshman year, didn't have a pass thrown his way last Saturday in 
the Ducks' 40-18 victory over Iowa, ending a streak of 18 consecutive games in 
which he had at least one reception. He had 11 catches for 128 yards and two 
touchdowns in the first three games. A year ago at this stage, he had 10 
receptions for 195. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week was kind of frustrating," McLemore said. "But they were trying to 
establish the running game, and it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's game is Oregon's first Pac-10 outing of the season, and the Ducks will 
be without quarterback Danny O'Neil of Newport Beach. O'Neil, who played at 
Mater Dei, is sidelined because of an infected finger on his passing hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel as badly for Danny as anything," McLemore said. "He really wanted to 
play in this game. We'll miss him, but I don't think there will be any big 
dropoff between Danny and Tony." Sophomore Tony Graziani, who has thrown only 
24 passes in two seasons, will replace O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks completed only eight passes against Iowa, but McLemore expects more 
passing this week, despite O'Neil's absence. 
</P>
<P>
 And McLemore remains confident he still can have a good year despite a 
relatively slow start against nonconference opponents. McLemore is hoping for a 
hot streak, such as the one he had last season. During a six-game stretch in 
the middle of the season, McLemore caught 39 passes, scoring eight times. His 
11-touchdown total for the season tied the school record set by Ahmad Rashad. 
</P>
<P>
 McLemore, who played quarterback during his senior year at Marina, also passed 
for two touchdowns last season, including one to tight end Josh Wilcox that 
clinched the Ducks' victory over Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, McLemore hopes good things start happening today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been about as excited as I can possibly be this week," McLemore said. 
"It's a special thing because I want to have a good game for Victor. I've been 
thinking about that every day before I go to practice. And it's special because 
of all the members of my family who will be at the game, too."

FULTON'S SPECIAL DELIVERY SPARKS RANCHO SANTIAGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Fulton had already signed and even sealed a letter of intent. But Fulton, 
on the advice of his father, never allowed the letter to be delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of being at Lindenwood College, an NAIA school in St. Charles, Mo., 
he is a sophomore at Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton had been a three-year starter at Villa Park High, each year at a 
different position. But he didn't generate much interest from four-year 
colleges so got help from a recruiting service. The organization helped Fulton 
get a 75% scholarship to Lindenwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Excited to be going away, he signed the letter of intent and was about to head 
to the post office when his father asked to him to consider his options 
overnight. The letter remains on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured that I could do just as well or better after two years at Rancho 
Santiago," Fulton said. "I have no regrets coming here. It was the right 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulton wasn't so quick to offer that opinion during his first season. As a 
freshman, he spent much of his time watching and learning on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating at times," he said. "But it's unbelievable how much I 
learned." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no question that Fulton would get an opportunity this season, but he 
wasn't sure where. He was a defensive tackle, nose guard and linebacker at 
Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 He practiced at linebacker last season and began this season expecting to be a 
middle linebacker. But after the Dons lost their first game to El Camino, 
55-28, the Rancho Santiago coaching staff decided to shake things up. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Fulton moved to a down position called the "whip." He plays about 
two yards off the ball and has run and pass responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense was at its best last week in a 31-14 upset of Palomar, which had a 
20-game winning streak stopped. Fulton credited the new defense but also a new 
attitude by the sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the freshmen were saying that the sophomores were messing around too 
much on the field," Fulton said. "They were right. I'm glad they said 
something. The sophomores decided to show them how we need to come together as 
a team. The defense needs to keep doing that every week." 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Mission Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (3-0) vs. Rancho Santiago (1-1), Santa Ana Stadium, 1:30 p.m. -- 
Long Beach has already beaten Golden West, Saddleback and Riverside. Patrick 
Norris has rushed for 431 yards in 64 carries for the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (0-2) vs. Palomar (1-1), San Marcos High, 1:30 p.m. -- The teams 
have combined to win the last three J.C. Grid-Wire national championships. 
Palomar won in 1991 and 1993. Saddleback was 11-0 and won it in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. San Antonio (1-0-1) at Orange Coast (0-2), 1:30 p.m. -- The Orange Coast 
defense must be at its best to slow down Mt. San Antonio, which is averaging 48 
points a game. The Mounties beat Southwestern, 58-18, last Saturday. OCC's Jeff 
Clayton, a preseason All-American, has rushed for 223 yards in 40 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino (2-0) vs. Golden West (0-2-1), Orange Coast, 7 p.m. -- Golden West 
must apply pressure to El Camino quarterback Steve Sarkisian who has thrown for 
854 yards and nine touchdowns. Golden West quarterback Brian Schneider has 
passed for 572 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (0-2) at Pasadena (1-0-1), 7 p.m. -- Fullerton played solid defense 
for much of the second half in a 28-10 loss to El Camino but will need as 
strong an effort against Pasadena because of running back Saladin McCullough 
(44 carries for 250 yards).

NEWPORT HARBOR GETS A SCARE FROM CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newport Harbor-Canyon game wasn't supposed to be a big game. The Comanches 
were unbeaten but with suspect credentials -- their three victories came 
against schools that were a combined 0-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon, however, proved to be as much a real thing as Newport Harbor on 
Friday, and the Sailors were lucky to escape with a 21-19 victory before an 
estimated crowd of 400. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor -- which has a showdown with Savanna next week -- kept its 
record spotless because it had enough defense to survive a 267-yard passing 
night by Comanche quarterback Adam Hoover, who completed 26 of 43 passes with 
two touchdowns. The Sailors did sack Hoover four times, two by senior noseguard 
Bill Johns, and Johns came up with the biggest save of the game -- recovering a 
fumble by Hoover with 6:44 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody hit (Hoover) and I just dove on the ball," Johns said. "I had to 
hang on because he was clawing at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors, outscored 9-0 in the second half, made sure Canyon (3-1) never 
saw the ball again. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Newport Harbor quarterback John Girodani was also having an excellent 
night -- 11 for 20, 167 yards and a touchdown -- they handed the ball to 
running back Jeremy Mason on 12 consecutive plays, from the 50 to the Canyon 
16, and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor Coach Jeff Brinkley was clearly impressed by Canyon. "Even with 
the (21-10) lead in the first half, our defense wasn't controlling them," 
Brinkley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also got conservative. We don't like to get into scoring contests. But 
their offensive line protected better than we anticipated. Four sacks is not 
enough for a team that throws that much." 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the robotic reaction from Canyon Coach Bob Hughes afterward -- 
"Just say how hard we played, that I'm really proud of them" -- it was evident 
he was surprised to be that close to Newport Harbor at the end. "They just 
murdered Foothill, who we thought might be the best team in our league," Hughes 
had said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 It helped the Comanches that Greg Jacobs -- the county's leading receiver -- 
was able to play despite nursing a separated right shoulder (he's left-handed) 
and bruises to the rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs caught nine passes for 103 yards, including a nine-yard touchdown. But 
Hoover was willing to share the wealth; Larry Witt and Ryan McGonigal combined 
for 12 catches and 107 yards.

RELATORES' LATE SCORE HELPS TROY WIN, 40-38; FOOTBALL: WARRIORS' VICTORY 
OFFSETS CHATMAN'S FIVE TOUCHDOWNS FOR COSTA MESA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is something about Troy playing Costa Mesa that brings out the best in 
both teams. Apparently, that is also true of their backfields. 
</P>
<P>
 With three of the county's top 20 runners -- and a fourth who couldn't play -- 
both teams pounded away at each other until Troy's Ryl Relatores scored with 16 
seconds left to give the Warriors a 40-38 nonleague victory Friday at Newport 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatores' final score put an end to awesome performances by him, teammate 
Larry Montgomery and Costa Mesa's Charles Chatman. Another, DeWayne Crenshaw, 
missed his second game in a row; last week sat out because of a hamstring 
injury. He was suspended after getting in a fight at school Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw will be back next week when Costa Mesa (3-1) plays Santa Ana. But it 
would have been hard for Crenshaw to top Chatman, who rushed 40 times for 269 
yards and five touchdowns in a losing effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman's performance was almost enough for the Mustangs, but they were 
equally unable to contain Relatores and Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatores, a senior, rushed 17 times for 190 yards and three touchdowns. 
Montgomery carried 14 times for 156 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another suspenseful game between the two teams. Troy (3-1) has won the 
last three meetings -- 42-35 in 1992, and 14-13 last year when Costa Mesa fell 
short on a two-point conversion late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 This game, too, was decided at the end. Chatman gave Costa Mesa a 38-33 lead 
with 2:11 left when he went 54 yards on a trap to the left. The two-point 
conversion attempt failed when Joey Archuletta was stopped by the Troy 
defensive front. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery returned the ensuing kickoff 19 yards to the Warrior 43. Two plays 
later, Relatores went 43 yards and was tackled at the nine by Costa Mesa 
defensive back Brian Reeves. On third down from the two, Relatores went behind 
right tackle, unmolested. Eric Urban kicked the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa got a final chance from its 32. Ryan Taylor, who completed one of 
seven passes, threw downfield to group of receivers; the ball was tipped in the 
air and intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept in there when we could have dropped our heads," Relatores said. "Now 
we know we can play with anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa is ranked third in the State Division III, according to Cal-Hi 
Sports. And it would have been pretty easy for either team to drop its head. 
There were seven lead changes in the game, including four in the fourth 
quarter. Troy had taken a 33-32 lead with 4:37 to go on Montgomery's 40-yard 
run, a bit of redemption for his two fumbles -- one of which led to Costa 
Mesa's first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we scored too quick," Troy Coach John Turek said of Montgomery's 
score. "Chatman is a fine running back, but I think the world of our two backs, 
too."

MACKENZIE TAKES HIS REVENGE; FOOTBALL: AFTER BEING HIT HARD, CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
SOPHOMORE RUNS FOR TWO FOURTH-QUARTER TOUCHDOWNS IN A 21-3 VICTORY OVER EL 
MODENA. 
</P>

<P>
 Anger is most dangerous when it manifests itself in the young and strong -- 
especially if the hostile youngster is surrounded by the targets of his angst. 
</P>
<P>
 So while El Modena High's defenders reveled in repeatedly knocking around 
Capistrano Valley sophomore running back Malaefou Mackenzie during the first 
three quarters Friday night, they might have been better served treating the 
kid a little nicer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mackenzie didn't care that they were just doing their jobs, and retaliated 
with two long, fourth-quarter touchdown runs that powered the Cougars past the 
visiting Vanguards, 21-3, in a nonleague game in front of 1,800. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was frustrated," Mackenzie said. "I should have broken away more than I did 
(earlier in the game). I knew that I could do better." 
</P>
<P>
 Now El Modena knows. 
</P>
<P>
 Mackenzie gained a game-high 188 yards in 21 carries. He was at his best after 
halftime, totaling 178 yards in 11 second-half rushes. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored on a 65-yard touchdown run with 5 minutes 49 seconds left in the 
fourth quarter. He was hit four times behind the line of scrimmage before 
racing untouched the rest of the way to the end zone. Brett Thompson's second 
point-after kick gave the Cougars (2-2) a 14-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit him (four) times," said Vanguard Coach Steven Howard, whose team 
dropped to 2-2. "He's sure good." 
</P>
<P>
 Mackenzie sealed the game with his second touchdown, a 63-yard run on a 
reverse with 4:01 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars led, 7-3, at halftime despite their offense, which managed to gain 
only 30 yards from scrimmage in seven first-half possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In five of those possessions, Capistrano Valley was forced to punt after 
running three plays. It ran four plays and punted in another, and allowed time 
to expire in the half the final time it had the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for the Cougars, El Modena's offense seemed only slightly more awake. 
The half's lone touchdown came on a 20-yard fumble recovery by senior 
linebacker Roman Felix with 6:00 remaining in the first quarter.

SORE TUATO STILL WREAKS HAVOC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Amigos was able to holster its offense early Friday night, removing its 
starters in a 41-6 victory over La Quinta at Garden Grove High. 
</P>
<P>
 But one Lobo left a little earlier, which gave Coach Roger Takahashi his only 
concern of the game. Ape Tuato, the Lobos' standout quarterback and defensive 
back, left in the second quarter after re-injuring his rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuato, a big reason the Lobos (4-0, 1-0) are favored to win the Garden Grove 
League, suffered the injury the first week of the season while lifting weights. 
He was hurt again Friday night after being hit at the end of a 23-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not the way the Lobos, ranked fifth in Orange County, wanted to begin 
league play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's serious, but we'll have to see," Takahashi said. "We 
didn't need this." 
</P>
<P>
 Takahashi said that Tuato will likely play against Aliso Niguel next week. 
Tuato said he could have continued Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something we didn't want to risk," Tuato said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tuato was on the field, he and the Lobos were as good as billed. He threw 
two touchdown passes in a 22-point first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuato suckered La Quinta safety Rod Saucedo with a play-action fake, then hit 
a wide open Ken Carr for a 45-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob Sanchez recovered a fumble on La Quinta's first play following the 
touchdown. Tuato then connected with Greg Fausto on a 28-yard pass on the next 
play. The Lobos led, 22-0, and began substituting liberally. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta (1-3, 0-1) turned the ball over four times, help the Lobos didn't 
need. 
</P>
<P>
 Fausto had 454 yards rushing coming into the game. He finished with 75 yards 
in 11 carries, including a four-yard touchdown run on the Lobos' first series. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth time in four games the Lobos had scored on their first 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really seem to come out sharp in games," Takahashi said. "We seem to be 
prepared right out of the gate." 
</P>
<P>
 Fausto later scored on a 20-yard run, then took the second half off. He has 12 
touchdowns on the season. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta lost quarterback C.J. Livernois early in the first half. His knee 
buckled on a rollout for the second consecutive week. Coach Fred Valko said 
that Livernois may be out for the season.

WAKEFIELD KEYS WOODBRIDGE'S 24-10 VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
 Theo Wakefield caught a touchdown pass, ran for one score and recovered two 
fumbles to lead Woodbridge to a 24-10 nonleague victory over Century on Friday 
at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Wakefield caught a screen pass from quarterback Brian Millat and broke several 
tackles, turning a short play into a 30-yard touchdown reception, giving the 
seventh-ranked Warriors a 17-10 lead with 3 minutes 9 seconds left in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Woodbridge's second possession of the second half, Wakefield ran 79 
yards on a sweep for his second touchdown and a 24-10 lead with 3:01 left in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge's defense took care of the rest. It sacked Century quarterback 
Stanley Villanueva six times, and held the Centurions to 26 yards rushing. 
Justin Dufour had three sacks for Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Villanueva, who entered the week as the third-leading passer in the county, 
completed 11 of 23 passes for 139 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored the Centurions' only touchdown on a one-yard sneak with 8:56 left in 
the second quarter, giving Century (2-2) a 10-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge (4-0) scored on its next drive, going 74 yards in seven plays. 
Millat hit Nate Perrizo with a short pass at the Century 30-yard line, and 
Perrizo broke an attempted tackle by Rolando Cortez and turned the play into a 
41-yard touchdown to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Wakefield led Woodbridge with 92 yards rushing in eight carries. Millat 
completed eight of 16 passes for 121 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Beau Wallace was Century's leading rusher with 32 yards in 14 carries.

</P>
<P>
 Kevin Feterik, Los Alamitos' quarterback to start the season, returned to the 
Griffin lineup Thursday. Feterik, who suffered a broken left hand in the team's 
opener, was the holder for the the last extra point in Los Alamitos' 39-12 
victory over Pasadena Muir. 
</P>
<P>
 "We scored and Kevin said, 'Coach, I'll hold for the point,' " Coach John 
Barnes said. "I said, 'Sure.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Barnes must have realized what was at stake. He chased Feterik out onto 
the field, shouting, "Hold it with your right hand! Hold it with your right 
hand!" 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik's left hand, the injured one, is his throwing hand. MICKEY MOUSE TIME 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora Coach Mark Takkinen will get to keep a set of Mickey Mouse ears for at 
least a year after the Raiders' 14-3 victory over University on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-year Sonora coach said he and Trojan Coach Mark Cunningham agreed 
the winning coach could wear the mouse ears until they meet again next season. 
Takkinen donned the ears after each victory when he served as an assistant 
coach at University. EARLY CELEBRATION 
</P>
<P>
 Century quarterback Stanley Villanueva plunged up the middle and into the end 
zone from the four-yard line, let out a whoop and leaped into the waiting arms 
of his lineman to celebrate an apparent touchdown Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He received congratulations from the entire offense before realizing the 
officials marked the ball at the one. No problem. Villanueva ran up the middle 
again on the next play for a touchdown that counted. But Century lost the game, 
24-10. ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "We may have lost three players, but they're out a tuba guy." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dave Demarest, La Quinta baseball coach, while watching the Aztecs get beat 
up by Los Amigos, 41-6, Friday saw a Lobo band member being worked on by 
trainers. LOOKING AHEAD 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna and Newport Harbor put their undefeated records on the line Thursday 
night at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring along your calculators: the Rebels are averaging 45 points, the Sailors 
26. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Esperanza will get more than a mere tuneup for its Sunset League 
opener against Edison when the Aztecs travel to Long Beach Veterans Stadium to 
play Long Beach Poly. The Jackrabbits are ranked fourth in the most recent 
Southern Section Division I poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Another interesting nonleague matchup Friday is Anaheim against Orange at El 
Modena High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colonists will be trying to keep their momentum going before starting a 
rugged Orange League campaign. The Panthers, who have already surpassed their 
victory total of last season, will be looking to provide Dick Hill with his 
200th career victory as a coach in the county. Friday's Best

</P>
<P>
 With 16 minutes to go in the pregame warm-ups, the National Anthem began 
playing over the loudspeakers at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 Both players and fans thought it was just a microphone check -- then they 
weren't sure what to do as the anthem continued. Both Corona del Mar and 
Saddleback players and the fans stopped, stood up and took off their helmets or 
hats. 
</P>
<P>
 After the music stopped, it started up again. Finally, the public address 
announcer said, "Sorry, guys." The music didn't start again until Michelle 
Dupree, a senior at Corona del Mar, began singing at the scheduled time. 
SKATING AWAY 
</P>
<P>
 Although many fans attended the Servite-Fountain Valley football game at 
Huntington Beach High's stadium Friday, there was a group of individuals at the 
site who could care less about football. Several youngsters took advantage of a 
small concrete skateboard facility, just outside of the refurbished home 
entrance to the stadium. Only in Surf City. OFFICIAL ASSIST 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado defensive back David Meyers got an assist from the referee when 
Fullerton quarterback Chad Lukkes' pass bounced off the referee's back as he 
attempted to duck out of the way. Instead of falling for an incomplete pass, 
the ball bounced into Meyers' hands for an interception. BELL WARNING 
</P>
<P>
 The Estancia-Costa Mesa rivalry got off to an early start Thursday at Newport 
Harbor High, where about 25 Costa Mesa players showed up and cheered wildly for 
Ocean View in the Seahawks' nonleague game against Estancia. The players 
chanted and offered verbal encouragement, but Ocean View fell, 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa and Estancia meet in the "Battle of the Bell" at 7 p.m., Oct. 28, 
at Newport Harbor.

 Senior running back Mike Flores rushed for 150 yards and two touchdowns, 
pacing Savanna in its 34-7 rout of Buena Park in a nonleague game Friday at 
Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores had touchdown runs of 62 and 72 yards as the Rebels (4-0) controlled 
the game clock by giving the ball to their three primary running threats.Eric 
Shine, Savanna's 150-pound running back, rushed for 98 yards and two touchdowns 
on 10 carries and Daven King, another running back, contributed 48 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 After forcing Buena Park to punt on its first possession of the first quarter, 
Savanna took over at its 41 and promptly drove 59 yards on nine plays to take 
an early lead, 7-0. King set up a three-yard touchdown run by Shine with a 
17-yard burst up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coyotes (0-4) moved the ball aggressively on its next possession, thanks 
to a 44-yard run by quarterback, David Barrios, which placed the ball on the 
Savanna 27. Three plays and two penalties later, Buena Park was forced to punt, 
ending its lone solid drive of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the second quarter, Flores returned a Buena Park punt 24 yards 
to the Coyotes' 25. Shine responded with his second touchdown, a 23-yard 
scramble up the middle to give the Rebels a 14-0 lead and control of the game.

SUNNY HILLS TURNS TURNOVERS INTO VICTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunny Hills converted three turnovers into touchdowns and running back Chris 
Velotta rushed for 92 yards as the Lancers defeated Mission Viejo, 27-21, for 
their first victory of the season, Friday night at Buena Park High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers (1-3) got on the board first as Velotta broke three tackles for a 
15-yard touchdown run.Two series later, Sunny Hills linebacker Dereck Cretz 
intercepted Diablo quarterback Austin Moherman's pass at the Mission Viejo 16 
and powered his way into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mission Viejo fumbled the ensuing kickoff, Lancer quarterback Greg 
Gearand hit wide receiver Jeff Renaud for a 25-yard pass in the corner of the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 20-0, Mission Viejo finally got on the board with nine seconds 
remaining in the first half when Diablo running back Todd Fielding scored on a 
three-yard run to cap a five-play, 50-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 At the opening of the third quarter, Mission Viejo committed yet another 
turnover as Fielding mishandled the pitch into the backfield, allowing the 
Lancers to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers' Gearand completed a six-play, 51-yard drive with an eight-yard 
touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo tried to come back on wide receiver Ryan Ballas' eight catches 
for a 126 yards -- including 19-yard and a 30-yard touchdown catches late in 
the game. MICHAEL LYNCH

 Quarterback Paul Acosta led Walnut in passing and rushing Friday, accounting 
for two scores, as the Mustangs ran their record to 4-0 with a 21-6 victory 
over La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta completed 10 of 24 passes for 92 yards and one touchdown and rushed for 
another 89 yards and a score late in the fourth quarter that sealed the victory 
despite throwing three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra (1-3) could only muster 150 yards against a Mustang defense that 
sacked quarterback Sonje Berg three times. Walnut's Eddie Diaz had two 
second-half sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Walnut scored on its opening drive, going 72 yards on 13 plays. Sergio 
Arellano, who rushed for 43 yards in 13 carries, scored from three yards to put 
the Mustangs ahead, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter, Acosta connected with Asanti Danzie in the end zone for 
an 11-yard score to give the Mustangs a 14-0 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra's Will McIntosh, who replaced a shaken-up Berg late in the third 
quarter, scored from five yards to pull the Highlanders to within 14-6.

 Katella High's Josh Welton missed a 25-yard field goal attempt as time 
expired, giving Brea-Olinda a 7-6 victory in a nonleague game Friday night at 
Wildcat Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Welton had brought the Knights to within a point when he caught a nine-yard 
touchdown pass from quarterback Sal Viramontes.The play came with 4 minutes 14 
seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The snap was bad on the Knights' extra-point attempt, and holder Chris Marquez 
picked up the ball, but his pass into the end zone fell incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella (0-4) got the ball back with 1:58 left after Brea (3-1) punted from 
its own nine-yard line. The Knights took over on the Brea 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Viramontes connected on first-down passes of 18 yards to Timmy Ho and 17 yards 
to Dan Schmidt before the Knights ran the clock down to three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Welton's kick was wide right. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea broke the scoreless tie with 1:09 left in the first half. Jerome Owens 
scored on a three-yard touchdown run up the middle. Owens led all rushers with 
102 yards in 27 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea limited Katella to 32 yards in total offense in the first half, but the 
Knights moved the ball much better in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Viramontes was seven of 14 for 133 yards. DALE RUHE

But on the next play from scrimmage the Trojans Alan Price fumbled the ball 
away.

 Chris Stretch passed for 154 yards in the first half and Dahrin Footman scored 
four touchdowns as Esperanza rolled over Santa Maria, 56-14, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs (3-1), ranked third in county, jumped ahead on the second play of 
the game on a 61-yard scoring dash by Footman.But the Saints (0-4), who dressed 
only 28 players, fought back quickly and led the game, 7-6, two minutes into 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs never looked back, scoring five more touchdowns in the first half 
for a 42-14 halftime lead. Stretch completed nine of 11 passes for the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Chris showed he can put the ball where he wants it," Aztec Coach Gary 
Meek said. "We could have really opened it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Meek pulled Stretch out two plays into the second half. Esperanza 
backup quarterback Dave Parrish filled in with limited success. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman had rushed for 139 yards and two touchdowns by halftime. He finished 
the game with 15 carries for 174 yards. Footman had several large gains called 
back because of Aztec penalties, and was removed from the game in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dahrin could have easily had 270 yards," Meek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Brian Forth got most of his yards after the catch, leading the 
Aztecs with six catches for 110 yards. Running back Jamal Footman added 42 
yards in six carries. PETER HARTLAUB

Friday night.

second half, scoring 36 points in less than seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>

with a five-yard touchdown run to put the Tritons ahead for good, 24-21. Insley 
caught 11 passes for 147 yards.

HUNTINGTON BEACH HOLDS ON TO BEAT TUSTIN FOR FIRST VICTORY OF SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The breaks and bounces went Huntington Beach's way, and with them came the 
team's first victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 For Tustin, it was another frustrating loss, its 10th in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Bartusick kicked a 21-yard field goal with 11 minutes 4 seconds 
remaining in the game and the Oilers held on for a 13-10 nonleague victory over 
host Tustin on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers (1-3) stopped a late threat by the Tillers, who drove to the 
Oilers' 25 with more than two minutes left, but came away empty. 
</P>
<P>
 A relieved Huntington Beach Coach George Pascoe just shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're 0-3, you don't know how to put a game away." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin (0-4) had a first down at the Oilers' 25 after a 36-yard reception by 
sophomore Pierre Sanjurjo from quarterback Kevin Timone with 2:44 left. Tustin 
coaches believed they would get additional yardage when an official threw a 
flag after Sanjurjo appeared to be the victim of a late hit. But the officials 
ruled no penalty was committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Four plays later, the drive stalled, as Huntington Beach stopped Timone on 
fourth down at its 27, then ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin never trailed until Bartusick kicked the game-winner. The Tillers took 
a 7-0 lead on a 19-yard touchdown run by fullback Gabe Nava with 7:20 left in 
the first quarter. Huntington Beach tied the score on a two-yard run by 
tailback Brenton Wood with 5:35 remaining in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin took a 10-7 lead with 2:08 remaining in the quarter on Ryan Bunch's 
41-yard field goal. But a 50-yard field by Bartusick, which hit the center of 
the crossbar, then bounced over, left the two teams tied, 10-10, at halftime.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Justin Starkey scored two touchdowns to lead Western's 31-20 victory over 
Downey Warren Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A 51-yard run by Starkey on the opening drive set up Western's first 
score.David Bell caught a three-yard touchdown pass from Dean Chambers two 
plays later to give the Pioneers a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Western scored again on its next drive when Chambers, who completed his first 
six passes, found Starkey on a 13-yard screen pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Penalties both hurt and aided Warren on a drive late in the second quarter. 
After three penalties forced a first and 30 situation, two passes and a 
face-mask penalty against the Pioneers put Warren in scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears (1-3) scored when lineman David Orloff recovered a fumble by 
teammate Darnell Robertson and ran the ball two yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren tied the score when quarterback Matt Sorensen scored on a 12-yard 
scramble. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers (4-0) regained the lead on a 27-yard field goal by Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 A fumble late in the third quarter gave Western the ball on the Bears' 30-yard 
line. Matt Frembling later scored on a one-yard dive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers put the game out of reach when Starkey scored on a 29-yard run to 
give Western a 31-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren scored once more when Mike Hem caught a 15-yard pass from Sorensen with 
1:27 left in the game. JASON HILL

ANAHEIM'S DROUGHNS RUNS FOR 265 YARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rueben Droughns dashed 75 yards for the game-winning touchdown with seven 
minutes remaining to lead Anaheim past Cypress, 13-8, in a nonleague game 
Friday night at Handel Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns rushed for 265 yards in 32 carries as the Colonists pushed their 
season winning streak to four games.He has 744 yards rushing this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress had a chance to win in the last two minutes, when David Wheeler found 
Bryan Huskey on consecutive plays for his first -- and only -- two completions. 
But two plays later, Wheeler threw a pass up for grabs that landed in the 
waiting arms of Anaheim's Robert Droughns. 
</P>
<P>
 The score could have been more lopsided but for several missed opportunities 
by the Colonists. The most glaring came at the start of the fourth quarter with 
Cypress clinging to an 8-7 lead. A snap sailed high over the head of Cypress 
punter Bryce Brunsting, who was downed at the Centurion seven-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Droughns appeared to score from 10 yards, but the play was 
nullified by an illegal block, pushing the ball back to the 22. The Centurions 
stopped the next two plays cold and on fourth down, Anaheim kicker Tony Vasquez 
missed wide left on a 41-yard field goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim struck first on a one-yard run by Rueben Droughns, but Cypress 
answered that drive with an eight-play, 75-yarder capped by Bobby Brito's 
four-yard run. Brito's run for the two-point conversion gave the Centurions 
(1-3) the lead. AHMED V. ORTIZ

EL DORADO SHUTS DOWN FULLERTON, 14-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Dorado football coach Rick Jones got the improved defensive play he wanted 
from his team Friday night, and the Golden Hawks also came up with their first 
victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Hawks shut down Fullerton, 14-0, at the Fullerton District Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado (1-3) allowed the Indians (2-2) only three yards into its territory 
in the first half. The Hawks held the Indians to only eight yards passing and 
allowed its leading rusher only 23 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defensively we really started to tackle better and get off the ball quicker," 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones had preached improvement on defense after a close loss to Valencia last 
week. He called Friday night's shutout a definite improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Williams led the Hawks with 83 yards in 10 carries in the first half 
but left the game with a broken leg with 7:30 left in the half. David Meyers 
and Ismail Abdullah with 40 and 38 yards respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks took control of the game early. On its third play from scrimmage, a 
pass by Fullerton's Chad Lukkes was intercepted by Ismail and returned 23 yards 
for the first score of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second quarter, the Hawks got the ball at the Indians' 38-yard 
line after a short punt. A few plays later, Williams ran for a 13-yard 
touchdown. Quarterback Mike Marzicola ran in the two point conversion to push 
the lead to 14-0. TED APODACA

MARINA STARTS FAST, RUSHES PAST WESTMINSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marina rushed for 433 yards and scored on seven of its first nine possessions, 
cruising to a 49-14 victory over Westminster Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings are 4-0 for the first time since 1981, thanks in large part to 
their top-notch runners.Junior Mike Williams carried 11 times for 195 yards and 
four touchdowns. Junior Micah Harrison rushed for 139 yards and scored once in 
eight carries. Quarterbacks Matt Roberson and Matt Wentz added another 62 
rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Westminster (2-2) never got things going. The Lions' offense was 
missing a couple of important players. Leading rusher Leonard Ibarra was 
missing because of an elbow injury, and starting quarterback Jerry Allison was 
not in uniform for personal reasons. Without those two, Westminster managed 
only one extended drive. The Lions started both of their scoring drives in 
Marina territory thanks to a recovered onside kick and a Viking fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Marina did its damage with efficiency. Five of the seven 
touchdown drives took two minutes or less, and the Vikings only faced two 
fourth downs in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The only negative for the Vikings was in the penalty department -- they were 
called for 18 penalties for 182 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But even yellow flags could not stop the Vikings. At one point in the third 
quarter, Marina was whistled for four penalties without a play being run. 
Facing third and 23 at their own 13, the Vikings sent Williams through the 
right side and he went 87 yards for a touchdown. ERIC MADDY

SERVITE DEFENSE HANDLES BARONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ryan Schley and the Servite defense took center stage in the Friars' 23-7 
victory against Fountain Valley in a nonleague football game Friday at 
Huntington Beach High. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, running back David Bedard scored two touchdowns and quarterback David 
Martin had two touchdown passes, but the Friar defense came within 43 seconds 
of a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 Schley, a 6-foot-3, 210-pound senior, intercepted a pass and recovered a 
fumble and defensive tackle Trey Patterson sacked Fountain Valley quarterback 
Mitch Ryerson for a safety as Servite held the Barons to minus-one yard rushing 
in 24 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley's only score came on a one-yard touchdown run by sophomore 
Andrew Medley with 43 seconds remaining, long after the Friars had put away the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a good team and they're improving every week," Fountain Valley Coach 
George Berg said. "We're going to have to find a way to get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Servite (2-2) got better as the game wore on. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Greg Cicero missed a 30-yard field-goal attempt on Servite's first 
possession, Schley got the ball back for the Friars with a minute remaining in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting quarterback Chris Ponchak attempted a screen pass to Robert Alvarez, 
but Schley picked it off and returned the ball to the Fountain Valley 23. Three 
plays later, Servite's Richard McDonald caught an 11-yard touchdown pass from 
Martin to make the score 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the second quarter, Bedard took over, helping the Friars move 
60 yards in seven plays for another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard gained all 60 yards on the drive, including a 41-yard reception from 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard carried the ball on the other six plays, capping the drive with a 
six-yard touchdown run with 4 minutes 59 seconds remaining in the second 
quarter. Bedard also caught a pass from Martin for the two-point conversion and 
a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley's first chance came late in the second quarter, but David 
Watters intercepted a pass from Ponchak in the end zone with 18 seconds 
remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very pleased with the effort of the defense tonight," Servite Coach 
Larry Toner said. "The defense has had some injuries early, but we've been 
getting people back and we're starting to put it all together." 
</P>
<P>
 Servite's defense forced three turnovers, had three sacks, and forced the 
Barons to turn over the ball on downs twice in the fourth quarter. Fountain 
Valley (1-3) had 167 yards passing, but the Baron quarterbacks completed only 
11 of 32 passes.

TRABUCO HILLS BEATS FUMBLE-PRONE CHAMINADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE WOJCIECHOWSKI

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Trabuco Hills defense forced four turnovers, including two on West Hills 
Chaminade's final two possessions, to preserve a 16-14 victory at Trabuco Hills 
High Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs (3-1) struggled early in the game against Chaminade's defense, 
and they weren't able to move the ball until they switched to their "greyhound 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
 "They take their Chicago Bear-style defense seriously," Trabuco Hills Coach 
Jim Barnett said. "They loop and stunt more than Buddy Ryan did with the Bears. 
But they do a good job on defense and they make it tough on you." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the greyhound offense, in which the Mustang receivers run short, quick 
patterns, Trabuco Hills moved 68 yards on eight plays in just 57 seconds and 
scored when Chad Collins threw a seven-yard touchdown pass to J.C. Pintsak on 
fourth and goal to tie score, 7-7, just before the half. 
</P>
<P>
 After Chaminade forced a Pintsak fumble on the opening series on the second 
half, it drove 31 yards on eight plays and took the lead when Jason 
Giovannettone caught a one-yard touchdown pass from Tom Racius. Bill Sayer's 
kick made it 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mike Junge's 28-yard field goal made it 14-10, the Mustang defense 
forced a Chaminade punt, which Bryan Carter returned 19 yards to the Eagle 25. 
Eight plays later, Collins threw four yards to Bryan Flournoy to put the 
Mustangs up 16-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade had one last chance to win, but with 1:21 left to play, 
Giovannettone mishandled a pitch on fourth and two and Trabuco Hills recovered 
the ball and ran the clock out. JOE WOJCIECHOWSKI

BO JACKSON DELAYS RETIREMENT FOR AT LEAST ONE MORE SEASON; BASEBALL: DESIGNATED 
HITTER ELIGIBLE FOR FREE AGENCY; ANGELS PLAN TO OFFER A ONE-YEAR DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bo Jackson, who contemplated retirement this year, said Friday he has decided 
to return for at least one baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, all my intentions are to come back next year and play," Jackson 
said from his home in Burr Ridge, Ill. "I would love to come back with the 
Angels. If something better comes up, I'll have to look at my options. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if I'm healthy, I'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who spurned an offer in August to trade Jackson to the Cleveland 
Indians, were delighted with the news. They plan to offer Jackson, who's 
eligible for free agency, a one-year contract and use him as a pinch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's definite interest," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said, "but it 
will fluctuate depending on (designated hitter) Chili Davis. The role will have 
to be limited. We don't want to work him in the outfield as much as we did, or 
not even close to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible a guy like that will want to DH, but we'll have to see if we're 
going to butt heads on that or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, considered perhaps the world's greatest athlete until his 1992 
reconstructive hip surgery, said his performance last season might have been 
the most gratifying of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Projected to be almost exclusively a pinch-hitter, Jackson instead played in 
75 of the Angels' 115 games -- including 46 games in the outfield. He batted 
.279 with 13 homers and 43 runs batted in, hitting more homers than every 
teammate except Davis and Tim Salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson even stole second base -- the first since his hip surgery -- in the 
final game of the Angels' season. He pulled the base out of the ground while 
walking off the field that Aug. 10 night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was skeptical about what would happen this year," Jackson said, 
"even myself. But I had a great time all year. I loved it. I played more, I got 
more done . . . the whole ball of wax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people didn't think my hip could last one year, but this is my third 
year with it, and it's not bothering me one bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bavasi: "This is a weird guy. He doesn't know he's not supposed to do the 
things he did. He did more than we ever hoped." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he anticipates only one stumbling block to playing in 1995. He 
wouldn't cross the picket line if the players are still striking in spring 
training, and warns any of his brethren who are contemplating the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people think things are bad now," Jackson said, "just wait. Nobody's going 
to bust up our union. And if anybody tries to play when we're on strike, those 
players will be shunned, outcasts. Believe me, it'll get ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those players will have targets on their backs. If somebody beans them, he's 
going to have to fight by himself because we're not going to go out and help 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, 31, who said he began working out Thursday in anticipation of playing 
again, predicts that several players who announced their retirement will be 
back in 1995. Toronto Blue Jay pitcher Dave Stewart already has informed his 
agent, Tony Attanasio, that he has changed his mind and wants to play one more 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "All veterans talk about retiring," Jackson said, "but I don't think you could 
definitely say you're retiring until everything has run its course. I think 
guys who go public with that are just trying to get their name in the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not being critical of anybody, but if a player can still go out there and 
make money, why not keep playing? Come on, everybody in the game is trying to 
make money. The owners. Coaches. Players. Clubhouse managers. That's what keeps 
everybody going. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why when I'm done playing sports, you won't see me. I'll be out of 
sports for good. Baseball, and the other professional sports, are just a means 
of employment, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who recently read a few TV scripts, and aired a new commercial 
endorsing a breakfast cereal, said he turned down the opportunity to become a 
commentator on the NFL broadcasts for the Fox network. Instead, he plans to 
spend his winter at home in the Chicago area, eagerly anticipating the opening 
of deer hunting season today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to sit back now, and see if the hockey guys go on strike," 
Jackson said. "The way things are going these days, nobody's going to be 
playing anymore but the college kids."

NO TIME TO LOSE; GREG HANCOCK WILL NEED FAST STARTS IN U.S. SPEEDWAY NATIONALS 
AT COSTA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Speedway motorcycle racing on the big tracks of the British League and the 
tiny oval at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa, where the 26th U.S. 
Nationals will be held tonight, can be as different as the NFL is from Arena 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Europe, where the tracks are about a quarter-mile around, riders say the 
race is usually won or lost in the first 30 meters -- a drag race to the first 
turn," Greg Hancock said after arriving from England to ride tonight. "At Costa 
Mesa, the smallest track in the world (180 yards), it's maybe the first five 
meters that count most. You've got to explode off the line to get to the turn 
first." 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock learned the knack of speedway racing -- pitching a 500cc bike 
completely sideways at around 50 m.p.h. in a more or less continuous power 
slide without brakes -- at Costa Mesa. He started riding there when he was 11, 
tagging after his racing idols, two-time world champion Bruce Penhall and 
two-time national champion Bobby Schwartz, and riding in junior speedway races. 
</P>
<P>
 When he turned 18, just out of Edison High, he followed the advice of Penhall 
and went to England for a postgraduate course. 
</P>
<P>
 After six years with Cradley Heath, Penhall's old team, Hancock, 24, has 
developed into one of the world's best riders. He has three world championship 
trophies, the 1992 World Pairs and the 1992 and 1993 World Team Cup, and he 
narrowly missed winning the individual championship last month in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, against 15 riders, including defending U.S. and world champion Sam 
Ermolenko of Cypress, Hancock will make his first attempt at winning his 
country's championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never won a big major meet at Costa Mesa, but I was only 18 when I left 
so I didn't have many opportunities," he said. "It was my training ground, 
where I became an established rider, so I think I can get back in the groove 
for the nationals." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Hancock rode in the United States, he won all five heats to 
score a perfect 15 points and win the American Final last May at Ventura 
Raceway, a qualifying round for the world championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The format tonight will be the same. Sixteen riders will compete in 20 
four-lap races, four riders to a race, in which every rider races every other 
rider once. Points are scored 3-2-1-0 and the one with the most at the end of 
the night is the champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "My focus will be to get five good starts," Hancock said. "I have confidence 
in my starts, that's my strong point. Starting is probably 80% of my race. I'm 
not the best of riders at passing, but there is very little passing at Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really will be no different than riding in Europe, because it all comes 
down to how well you can control yourself over two hours. You have to reach a 
fine line. You need to be pumped up to win, to rocket off the starting line, 
but you also must control yourself and not overdo it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keeping your mind focused for the two hours is very important. The actual 
night's racing will be only about five minutes of work, about one minute a 
race, but it's two hours of concentration." 
</P>
<P>
 Travel is Hancock's biggest problem in Europe. He rides five to seven nights a 
week and is captain and No. 1 rider of three teams: Cradley Heath in England, 
Getingarna in Sweden and Leszno in Poland. In a typical week, he races two or 
three nights in England, Tuesdays in Sweden and Sundays in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he still considers Huntington Beach home, Hancock lives eight months 
a year in Tamworth, a suburb of Birmingham in central England. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is still the same as it was when I first went to England in 1989, to 
follow in Bruce (Penhall's) footsteps and win a world championship," he said. 
"I came so close this year that I know I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the finals at Vojens, Denmark, Hancock won three of his first four races 
and when the favorite, Hans Nielsen of Denmark, fell and failed to score in one 
heat, Hancock found himself tied for first place with Australia's Craig Boyce. 
The next-to-last race would decide their fate. If either Hancock or Boyce won, 
he would be the champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock finished third behind Sweden's Tony Rickardsson and Boyce, falling one 
point shy of a podium finish when Rickardsson, Boyce and Nielsen ended up with 
12 points each to Hancock's 11. Rickardsson won the run-off for his first 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "All three of us got great starts," Hancock said. "We were dead level in the 
first corner, but when we came off the turn, Rickardsson was ahead and Boyce 
was right on his handlebar. I felt like I was in a good position, just to the 
right of them, but I could never get by. It was one of the closest heats of the 
meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Speedway racing, once one of Britain's most popular sports, has declined in 
interest since Penhall retired in 1982 after winning consecutive world 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruce was the golden boy of speedway," Hancock said. "He had been retired 
seven years before I went over there, but everywhere I went, the people wanted 
to know more about the blond Southern Californian who left surfing to become 
one of Britain's most popular athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to be part of reviving interest in speedway. I think it can be done, 
if Chris (Manchester), Billy (Hamill) or myself can step up and win the world 
championship and be heroes in England. We're three young American riders who 
can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Manchester, 19, the 1992 U.S. champion from Hesperia, is also riding tonight, 
but Hamill, 23, Hancock's Cradley Heath teammate from Monrovia, did not 
qualify. 
</P>

commentator. Speedway Facts

 Super-scooper: Joel Rojas passed along a crime report from the city of Rancho 
Palos Verdes, which included one truly far-out incident.

 "Grand Theft -- The victim . . . stated that while he was home he heard a loud

saw a helicopter hovering, and hoisting his patio umbrella. The helicopter flew 
south with his umbrella and out of view."

 How you gonna keep Fifi down on the farm?An airline passenger who claims her 
poodle was flown to Nebraska instead of L.A. is suing an airline for $5 
million, claiming her protests were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassie Hughes says in court documents that she glanced out her window before a 
Thanksgiving, 1993, flight from Denver and saw Fifi being loaded onto the wrong 
plane. Hughes' lawsuit, which alleges false imprisonment and intentional 
infliction of emotional distress, says that flight attendants refused to let 
her off the plane.

 Instead, they offered her a drink.

eucalyptus fragrances.

 "The first thing some people ask is whether they're underarm deodorants," said 
Goldberg, the owner of Petkin Pet Care Systems. Actually, they're for the 
entire body. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg used to hear even stranger comments when he marketed a shampoo for 
stuffed toy animals: "I'll never forget the (mail) order I got from a woman who 
said, 'Please rush. I'm taking my bears camping."

 The idea lost favor when it was revealed that the same proposal had been made 
15 years earlier -- by MAD magazine. miscelLAny In a survey of mail delivered 
between May 28 and Sept. 16, Long Beach received the fifth-best service in the 
nation. Ninety percentof the letters that were supposed to be delivered 
overnight to addresses in the city reached their destinations on time. In a 
survey earlier this year, Washington, D.C., had the worst service. Is that why 
some officeholders aren't listening to their constituents?

SIMPSON JURY QUESTION LIST PROBES RANGE OF ATTITUDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the first of 304 potential jurors in the O.J Simpson case return to court 
this month, they will be quizzed on a sweeping questionnaire about their 
attitudes toward Simpson, the two people he is accused of killing, celebrities 
in general, domestic violence, DNA testing and interracial marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospective jurors have filled out the unusual, 79-page questionnaire, made 
public by the court Friday. The survey, containing 294 questions, is designed 
to test each potential juror's suitability for the celebrated trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions range from the mundane to the provocative: "Do you seek out 
positions of leadership? . . . Have you seen O.J. Simpson in any form of 
advertising, such as television commercials for Hertz Corp. or in orange juice 
advertisements? . . . What is your impression of Nicole Brown Simpson based 
upon what has been reported or published in the media? . . . Have you ever felt 
sufficiently frustrated within a domestic relationship that you considered 
violence?" 
</P>
<P>
 There is even a question asking whether the jury candidate owns any "special 
knives." 
</P>
<P>
 "A person who himself owns a collection of knives is not going to think of 
themselves as violent," said UCLA law professor Peter Arenella, who believes 
that the question was devised by the defense to reveal attitudes potential 
jurors might have about people who own knife collections, as Simpson reportedly 
does. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who do have such collectibles, Arenella said, probably "would not draw 
any inference that Mr. Simpson would be violent merely because he owns knives." 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, who released blank copies of the 
questionnaire Friday, worked with lawyers from the defense and prosecution to 
draft the document. Ito and the attorneys are expected to use the results, 
along with further questioning in court, to help select the 12 jurors and eight 
alternates for the double murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Long and involved jury questionnaires are usually only used in high-profile 
cases such as Simpson's in which a defendant is sufficiently affluent to hire a 
jury consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty in the June 12 knife slayings of his ex-wife 
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman outside her Brentwood condominium. 
Prosecutors believe the murder weapon was a 15-inch German-made Stiletto that 
they contend Simpson bought six weeks before the killings at a Downtown Los 
Angeles cutlery store. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the query about knives, the questionnaire seeks to explore -- 
much more extensively -- the jury candidates' attitudes toward the media, race 
and the type of DNA blood testing that prosecutors plan to use to connect the 
former football star to the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 A full 13 pages of questions -- representing one of the largest sections in 
the survey -- are devoted to jurors' views of the media, including the tabloid 
press and television shows that are generally seen as more entertainment than 
journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Which of the following best describes how you would describe the media 
coverage overall?" one question asks, offering answers that range from 
"accurate" to "sometimes accurate-sometimes not" to "inaccurate." 
</P>
<P>
 The question that asks jurors whether they have seen Simpson in TV advertising 
is followed by a further query: "If yes, describe the image that O.J. Simpson 
seemed to portray in your opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Jury consultants representing the prosecution and defense have helped to 
tailor the questions to eliminate bias. The goal of prosecutors is to detect 
jurors who might have more sympathy than objectivity in weighing the fate of a 
man who has spent his career cultivating a very likable image, experts noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneyswould like to ferret out those who might have negative 
feelings toward Simpson based on race or other factors. One questions deals 
with attitudes toward interracial marriage.  
</P>
<P>
 Another question asks point-blank: "How big a problem do you think racial 
discrimination against African Americans is in Southern California?" 
</P>
<P>
 A question apparently aimed at DNA testing asks jurors whether they have given 
blood samples to a doctor and whether they ever felt uncomfortable with the 
accuracy of the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about domestic violence are seen as important because information 
about O.J. Simpson's past physical abuse of Nicole Simpson could become 
evidence in the murder trial. Simpson pleaded no contest in 1989 to misdemeanor 
spousal abuse against his then wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors scheduled to return to court Oct. 12 will be asked about their 
responses to some, but not necessarily all, of the questions. This will be part 
of voir dire, the portion of jury selection that seeks to screen out those who 
have made up their minds about the case, have biases against either side, or 
who cannot set aside information they have gained from sources outside court. 
</P>
<P>
 If necessary, a second group from the jury pool is expected to start voir dire 
Oct. 17, and a third group Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 If the entire pool of 304 potential jurors does not yield the needed number of 
untainted panelists and alternates, Ito will begin creating another pool. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Robert L. Shapiro, one of Simpson's lead attorneys, said in court 
this week that he could not imagine that the 20 could not be picked from among 
the 304. Jury Questionnaire Excerpts

THE BUS STOPPED HERE; SANTA MONICA'S GREYHOUND STATION CLOSES AFTER 48 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT WYNNE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 48 years they have come -- troops heading to the Korean War, hippies and 
housewives, Caribbean tourists in dreadlocks, even the occasional Hollywood 
star. And for 48 years, Gertrude Miles has sold them tickets, helping them "Go 
Greyhound" to places as near as Santa Barbara and as far as Bar Harbor, Me. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, however, that half-century of service came to an end. Friday, at 
5:15 p.m., the Santa Monica Greyhound station dispatched its last bus -- San 
Francisco-bound No. 6754, with stops in San Luis Obispo, Salinas and San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Greyhound, which has been closing terminals throughout the country in recent 
years, decided to vacate the squat brick building on 5th Street in Santa Monica 
because of low ridership, a company spokesman said. For riders, that means the 
closest Greyhound station will now be in Downtown Los Angeles, 20 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 For Miles, 81, the closing means retirement -- time to hang up her 
company-issue dark purple skirt, matching vest and white shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be sad. I think a lot of people are going to miss us," Miles, 
the station's manager, said Friday. "I just feel like I want to cry, and yet I 
don't want to cry." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Greyhound station has stood on 5th Street, north of Broadway, 
since the late 1950s, when it moved from 6th Street and Santa Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It had a hollow look on its last day of service. GTE workers unscrewed pay 
phones from the walls. The lockers and vending machines had long since been 
removed, leaving only the dull-yellow linoleum floor, the orange plastic seats 
and the dingy brown walls. 
</P>
<P>
 As she sold tickets, checked schedules and cleared out her office Friday, 
Miles reflected on the station's healthier days decades ago, when it echoed 
with the hubbub of hundreds of passengers, clanging pinball machines and an 
ever-playing jukebox. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1940s, she said, the riders were different from today's 
passengers, most of whom take the bus out of necessity rather than for 
pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "(They were) just kind of family people," said Miles, a native of Chester, 
Pa., who moved to Santa Monica in 1938 with her husband, Earl -- now deceased 
-- a television repairman. "Everybody looked up to Greyhound in those days. 
They would travel everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, families were joined on the buses by soldiers preparing to fight 
in the Korean War. But it was in the 1960s and '70s, Miles says, that business 
boomed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People knew they could get on the bus and go anywhere they wanted," she said. 
"We had families of six or eight people. And we had a lot of Japanese people 
come over for tours. We would make hotel reservations and sightseeing tours for 
them all over the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miles cracks a smile when she recalls the young people who flocked to 
California then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember calling them hippies," she said "But they were fast people, 
what with their bags and sacks and their long hair." 
</P>
<P>
 The station even got its share of Hollywood glitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the 1960s, James Arness, star of TV's "Gunsmoke," booked a one-day 
charter tour to a local dude ranch. And occasionally the depot served as a 
backdrop for productions ranging from the TV show "Jake and the Fat Man" to a 
film now in production, starring Al Franken of "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
 Miles marks the station's decline from the gas shortages of the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when everything started to go down," she said Friday. "People stopped 
traveling and the world started to turn upside down. . . . At one time, we had 
64 buses a day and they just kept cutting the service. Now it's down to six 
buses a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Riders were advised of the shutdown by a sign taped to the station's front and 
back doors: "Effective October 1 this station will be closed. Nearest station 
is Los Angeles, 1716 East 7th Street." 
</P>
<P>
 For many using the terminal this week, the news didn't make much of an 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
 British tourists Anna Slidel and Mark Godden were in no mood to remark on a 
bus station's passing Thursday -- not after arriving from Phoenix minus their 
luggage. Mindful that they were scheduled to board a plane Friday for the Cook 
Islands, they wanted to know when their suitcases would show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be here all bloody day," Slidel said. 
</P>
<P>
 To others, the terminal's closing held more meaning. Wayne Schneider of Santa 
Monica, a frequent rider in the late 1950s and '60s, stopped by Friday to see 
the place one more time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember (Miles) from back then," he said. "They used to have a good (food) 
counter that ran along the wall, and they served hamburgers and coffee. It used 
to be a lot more lively." 
</P>
<P>
 No one, however, will miss the commotion more than Miles, who worked at 
Douglas Aircraft as a parts procurer during World War II. After being laid off 
at the close of the war, she joined Greyhound as a ticket seller, becoming 
station manager in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was, to be sure, the downside of bus station life -- the dozens of 
break-ins, for instance, and the two times she was robbed. In one robbery in 
the late 1970s, a man brandishing a gun knocked her over and emptied the cash 
register. She yelled for help and police caught her assailant at a restaurant 
down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Miles there were many more good times than bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best memories I have are taking care of people who were stranded here . . 
. a family of five or six who had no place to go," she said. Summoned from her 
Santa Monica home late at night, she would go to the bus station and phone 
local charities to find the travelers a place to spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, the Greyhound terminal has had only two full-time employees 
-- Miles and Fausto Canal, a ticket seller. Canal, a three-year veteran of the 
Santa Monica depot, expects to be reassigned to another station in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles, however, has sold her last ticket. She says she is planning a vacation, 
only her second in the past 48 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But she won't be taking a bus. Her destination is Hawaii.

GIRL,10, KILLED BY HIT-RUN DRIVER; CRIME: SUSPECT REPORTEDLY TOLD WITNESS, 'I 
DON'T CARE' BEFORE SPEEDING AWAY. HE WAS CAUGHT AFTER CHASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A driver who ran a red light and killed a 10-year-old Inglewood girl as she 
crossed the street in front of her home told a witness who chased him down that 
he knew he hit her. "I don't care," the driver allegedly said as he sped away 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-mile chase at speeds of up to 100 m.p.h., Inglewood police 
arrested Derrick G. Saunders, 25, of Hawthorne, who was driving a rented moving 
van, on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and felony hit and run, authorities 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Erica Jauraqui was in a crosswalk less than 50 yards from her front door on 
Arbor Vitae Street about 6 p.m. Thursday when she was struck, Inglewood Police 
Sgt. Hampton Cantrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother had asked her to buy a carton of milk at the market across the 
street for her 3-year-old brother, relatives said. The street is busy, but it 
has a traffic light, and Erica had crossed it safely many times before, they 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Edwin Zelada, whose family witnessed the accident and chased the driver, 
confronted the man when he stopped at a red light a few blocks away. "I told 
him to get out . . . because he just hit a little girl," said Zelada, 18. "He 
said, 'I don't care' and hit the gas." 
</P>
<P>
 Another witness said the driver ran a red light at Arbor Vitae and Oak streets 
and then hit the girl. "I just saw this truck coming like 50 m.p.h.," said 
Maria Calix, 22, of Inglewood. "I honked my horn so (the girl) would see or he 
would stop, but nothing worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Calix followed the truck and waved down a police car as the driver headed for 
the San Diego Freeway, police said. An Inglewood officer pursued the vehicle, 
and Saunders was arrested several miles from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliodoro Duran, 44, a close friend of the family, was working in the front 
yard of the building where the young girl lived when she was hit. He said he 
turned away from Erica when she stepped off the curb, then glanced back at her 
a moment later and saw her unconscious by the side of the road. "I was so 
desperate, I couldn't believe it," Duran said.  
</P>
<P>
 Erica's family grieved Friday in the family's small stucco apartment that 
looks out onto the intersection where she was killed.  
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, Rosalina Jauraqui, was under medication to calm her nerves as she 
rested on a sofa in the family's living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been sitting there all day," said Carmen Raya, 28, a friend of the 
family. "She doesn't want to eat or drink nothing. She hasn't eaten since 
yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department has established a trust fund to help the family pay for 
funeral expenses. Donations may be sent to the department's I-COPPS Division, 1 
Manchester Blvd., P.O. Box 6500, Inglewood, Calif. 90301.

CITYSCAPES / ERIC SLATER: 'ONE DAY ONE OF MY CUSTOMERS TOLD ME THIS WAS 
WINNETKA. . . . ALL THOSE YEARS I THOUGHT IT WAS CANOGA PARK.'; IT'S A SHELL 
GAME WHEN TRYING TO FIND THOSE IN WINNETKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Winnetka, stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you're mailing a letter to Ruth Richter, either you get it right or you 
get it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get mail addressed 'Canoga Park' and I write, 'Unknown at this address, 
return to sender,' " she says. "I've done that for 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is just about the same amount of time she's been trying to explain to 
folks -- both around the San Fernando Valley and over the back fence -- that 
Winnetka is not just a long straight street. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a drive-in theater, either -- the Winnetka 6 is in Chatsworth. It's 
not a section of Reseda or Northridge or Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Canoga Park, is what it really is," explained a directory assistance 
operator helpfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Lies. All lies, says Richter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Covering just 18 city blocks and surrounded -- squashed, some would say -- by 
five other West Valley communities, Winnetka is one of the smallest communities 
in the city of Los Angeles. And despite its lively beginnings as a utopian 
chicken farm, it is one of the most forgotten -- by the history books, by the 
census takers and even by some who live there. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Domine, now president of the Winnetka Chamber of Commerce, grew up smack 
in the middle of the community. But he was thirtysomething before he learned 
just which community that was. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day one of my customers told me this was Winnetka and not Canoga Park," 
the business owner said. "All those years I thought it was Canoga Park." 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for the community's relative anonymity and oft-mistaken identity 
are many, residents say. Its simple, agrarian roots (they're not given to 
bragging). The lack of newsworthy events (Northridge has its earthquake; Reseda 
was home to "The Karate Kid"). Its diminutive size. 
</P>
<P>
 But the old-timers all point in the same direction when explaining the primary 
cause of confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The post office done it," states Winnetka Honorary Mayor Art Hieber. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hieber, who says he's "five years older than dirt," and others tell it, the 
lines and loyalties began to grow fuzzy during the Eisenhower era, when the 
increasingly modern Canoga Park Post Office offered the first "mounted 
delivery" in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Door-to-door service, they promised the Winnetkans. No more daily trips to the 
local post office. But on one Faustian condition: Keep your 91306 ZIP code, 
keep your street address, just tell people to address your mail "Canoga Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who insisted on living in "Winnetka," however, would still have to pick 
up their mail in person. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents jumped ship in droves. Who lives where -- and what is what -- has 
been in question ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The community -- bordered by Nordhoff Street on the north, Victory Boulevard 
on the south, Corbin Avenue on the east and De Soto Avenue on the west -- was 
an anomaly from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 The brainchild of a philosopher-cum-chicken farmer who had also helped develop 
Winnetka, Ill., the town was first designated Weeks' Colony, in honor of its 
founder, Charles Weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 A back-to-the-land proponent in the style of Henry David Thoreau, Weeks began 
developing the community in 1920. He envisioned a settlement of educated, 
artistic naturalists in a town to be part commune, part farm, part business 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Each one-acre lot would have 2,500 laying hens, a house set back 100 feet from 
the road, a straight line of well-groomed fruit trees and a clover lawn to draw 
bees for pollination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here in these sequestered garden homes man may attain that serenity conducive 
to the gentlest arts and thus be able to reveal new worlds of joy and emotion," 
Weeks wrote in his typical style, melding flowery prose and huckster-like 
salesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1924, nearly 500 families had signed on, and the town blossomed. They 
established schools, a community center and the Weeks Colony Orchestra, in 
between gathering the eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 In his desire to see the community flourish, Weeks helped underwrite many of 
the colonists' loans. And when the Great Depression hit, the bill collectors 
came calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks left the state in 1934, and as his colony lost focus, members gave up 
the name Weeks. The area became known as Winnetka, and fairly well-known at 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the big-time Canoga Park Post Office showed up with its newfangled 
delivery trucks, spreading a confusion that would only grow murkier as families 
came and went and forgot just exactly where Winnetka was. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have people talking about Canoga Park ending on one street, and others 
talking about Winnetka starting on another," said Juan Rodriguez, the field 
deputy from Councilwoman Laura Chick's office who oversees much of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In all fairness, it should be made clear that Canoga Park Postmaster Mike 
Madrigal had no hand in any alleged postal name trading. He had never even 
heard such a story and says that, as far as he's concerned, it is quite 
irrelevant. He will get your mail to you regardless, as long as the ZIP code is 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnetka, Canoga, "it doesn't matter to us," Madrigal said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When many Valley neighborhoods began breaking away from their communities in 
the 1980s -- to distance themselves from community names that connoted high 
crime or low rent -- Winnetkans began once again to assert their identity. 
After all, part of Canoga Park was rechristened West Hills and Sepulveda ceased 
to exist. The Winnetkans already had their own name and figured it was time 
people knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 At their urging, the city hung shiny blue Welcome to Winnetka signs along the 
"border." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce prompts businesses to "add a touch of class, use the 
name in your address." 
</P>
<P>
 And Hieber -- who still raises chickens and hands out business cards that 
read, "Winnetka -- the of the Valley" -- published 12,500 booklets a couple 
years back detailing Winnetka's eclectic beginnings and proper boundaries. He 
delivered them door to door, postal-style, to every house in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me a whole year," Hieber said. "Wore out four pairs of shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 His devotion is understandable, especially when you consider the etymology of 
the word itself. Winnetka comes from the Potawatomi Indian language. It means 
beautiful place.

A FINAL SALUTE FOR BASE THAT ONCE WAS A GATEWAY FOR MANY TO STATE; CEREMONIES: 
OFFICERS, SAILORS AND VETERANS SHARE MEMORIES AND BID FAREWELL AS LONG BEACH 
NAVAL STATION CLOSES. 
</P>

<P>
 Even as the flags were marched away and the final ship's bell rang Friday, 
marking the end of the Long Beach Naval Station, it was clear that few were 
willing to surrender.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this base was once the epitome of the Navy on the West Coast. The 
observation tower, the forest of spiked gray masts and swarm of white uniforms 
were symbols of strength in hard times.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe next year, someone will decide we really need Naval Station Long 
Beach," said the base commander, Capt. Isaiah J. Jones. "But it will always be 
here in one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Navy hospital was closed this year, along with two large housing 
complexes for Navy personnel on the city's west side, that seems unlikely. 
Already, cities and agencies are haggling over development plans for the 
abandoned properties. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the station remains only in memory, the sailors who passed through 
it helped shape Southern California. The base was the gateway to California for 
tens of thousands of young men arriving during World War II and the Korean War. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Fine weather and a glut of jobs in the region's growing defense industry 
convinced many to move their families here, eventually helping create the great 
Southern California boom.  
</P>
<P>
 "Long Beach told them life was better here than in snowy Buffalo or humid 
Atlanta," said Donald Waldie, public information officer for the city of 
Lakewood. Waldie, who is writing a book that details the area's growth, can 
trace his own history to the Long Beach base. His father fell in love with 
Southern California after landing here in 1942 as a lieutenant commander 
serving on the Bradford. He left Manhattan for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "These young men helped fuel the boom," Waldie said. "By 1950, just in time 
for the Korean conflict, they were beginning construction on 50 houses a day 
(in Lakewood). In 33 months, 17,500 homes were built here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach was not the Navy's only port. Bases in San Diego and Santa Barbara 
created parallel growth. Long Beach is the region's first base to close -- the 
victim of post-Cold War downsizing, a lingering recession and political 
pressures to reduce military spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15,000 officers and enlisted personnel who used to serve the 38-ship fleet 
in Long Beach have nearly vanished. They have retired, been reassigned or are 
waiting out the next round of base closures at the Navy shipyard next door to 
the naval station. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 2,500 active-duty personnel left on base after Friday, nearly half 
belong to the Tarawa. But the amphibious assault ship is due to return to San 
Diego by the end of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 The shipyard was narrowly saved from closure last summer when the commission 
voted 4 to 3 to keep it open. The commission is expected to reconsider the 
shipyard next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a crying shame," said retired Chief Boatswain Mate Lawrence F. 
FitzGerald, who served in Korea and World War II. "I experienced what we went 
through when they shrunk the service after the Second World War. I saw ships 
torn apart. And then all they had was a bucket of rocks and a big stick (at the 
beginning of the Korean War)." 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many others at Friday's closing ceremony, FitzGerald's memories of the 
base were entwined with recollections of overseas battles. Asked how they felt 
about the station's demise, retirees told stories about troops sent ashore 
disguised as softball players, pre-dawn launches and the silence of waiting in 
a submarine. 
</P>
<P>
 Before and after overseas tours and wars, they knew Long Beach was waiting. 
Jones remembered his first date with his wife -- July 4, 1963, at the Pike 
amusement park, which is closed. Others remembered a downtown swamped in 
sailors' whites or the spot just outside base where civilians would stop to 
give a Navy man a ride into town. To most of them, Long Beach without a Navy 
was inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
 That unwillingness to accept the base's demise was evident in a program 
printed for the ceremony. It was titled "The Third Disestablishment" -- a 
reminder that the Navy's fortunes have swelled here as often as they have 
plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1919, Long Beach was the Pacific Fleet's home port, even though the base 
was not officially established until 1942. The station was closed in April, 
1950, then reopened 10 months later. It closed again in June, 1974, but was 
reopened in October, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 The base may be closing for good this time, but most chose to believe that 
there would always be a Navy in Long Beach. In front of the Officers' Club, a 
marquee held an almost defiant proclamation. It said: "O Club Will Remain 
Open."

RIORDAN PUSHES PLAN TO BOOST ECONOMY; CITY HALL: HE PROMISES REDUCED REGULATION 
AND OFFERS PROPOSAL FOR A CONSOLIDATED BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what was billed as his first major speech on the Los Angeles economy, Mayor 
Richard Riordan on Friday predicted that the city would soon emerge from its 
worst recession since the Great Depression and pledged to consolidate the 
city's economic development efforts to smooth the way for a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's 20-minute address to a gathering of about 300 business leaders 
outside City Hall promised an improved business atmosphere and reduced 
regulation at City Hall, but offered no tax reductions or other hard economic 
incentives for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the programs Riordan discussed have been rolled out in the first 15 
months of his Administration, although he did announce formation of a 
centralized office to submit government loan applications, the One Stop Capital 
Shop, and the commencement of a series of business round-table discussions to 
allow industries to vent their frustrations with government. 
</P>
<P>
 The early morning address, delivered from the same steps where Riordan was 
inaugurated, was generally well received by the invited guests, although it 
remains unclear how the City Council will react to one central proposal: a plan 
for a consolidated economic development office. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and the City Council agreed this year that a system that diffuses 
economic development among at least four departments does not work and that a 
single location for business promotion would work better. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan's earlier consolidation proposal was rejected by the council, 
which said it de-emphasized low-income housing construction by eliminating an 
independent housing department. The council also said that Riordan's office had 
not determined how it would provide retirement benefits for employees of the 
new office. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor declined to provide details of his new consolidation effort, but 
said he believes it will be better received, in part, because it will maintain 
a separate city housing department. Advocates of affordable housing had said 
elimination of the department, just a few years after its formation, would 
reduce the city's focus on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said he plans to make the housing department even larger by adding 
some housing programs that had been under the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
"I've challenged our housing department to double the annual production of 
affordable housing over the next three years," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's plans may create a power struggle with the City Council. Some 
members, led by Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, remain intent on taking over 
control of the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has been a potent political and economic tool, allowing the city to 
pour tax dollars into distressed communities. Riordan's proposal would leave 
redevelopment in his hands, through his own commission.  
</P>
<P>
 Hearings on the matter are scheduled to begin this month. Riordan said he will 
veto any council attempt to take over the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of who wins the power struggle, the mayor has succeeded this week 
in having the council approve a 19-person office, under his control, that will 
help him respond to specific dilemmas posed by the business community. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the office will help speed city permits to companies and connect them 
with government loans, it will not be able to offer tax cuts or other hard 
financial incentives, Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a business gross receipts tax, which a lot of other cities and other 
states don't have," he said in an interview after the speech. "We have a lot of 
fees that are really way too high. . . (But) we need the revenue in the short 
run to make the city safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan was looking tanned and fit after a weekend getaway in Squaw Valley. He 
left at midday Friday for a 17-day European cycling vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The assembled business leaders greeted Riordan with sparse applause and many 
said they were more pleased with the tone than won over by any single proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles 
County, praised Riordan's upbeat attitude and said the consolidation of 
economic development programs is "extremely important." 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a roster of all these economic development agencies (within the 
city) and what you're looking at is a touch of schizophrenia," Kyser said. "By 
combining them, people will have a single source to go to, and you're going to 
be much more effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow with the Center for the New West public 
policy think tank, said he believed that Riordan was subtly attempting to lean 
on the City Council to get his economic development initiatives approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick Riordan was elected with a very strong mandate to do certain things, but 
the council was not elected on the same ticket," Kotkin said. "What he's got to 
do is develop very strong support in the business community and the community 
in general to push through some of these reforms." 
</P>
<P>
 John W. Mack, executive director of the Los Angeles Urban League, said he was 
most pleased that Riordan had moved beyond "his laser beam single focus on 
adding more police to the LAPD." Mack called on Riordan next to "become more 
aggressive and focus on job creation and African American business 
opportunities south of the Santa Monica Freeway."

CHURCH BURGLARY DISMAYS PARISH; CRIME: THIEVES STEAL A BRONZE TABERNACLE, 
VALUED AT $3,000, AND ITS SACRED CONTENTS. POLICE SUSPECT AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE 
ARE INVOLVED. 
</P>

<P>
 The theft of a bronze tabernacle and its holy contents from a Catholic church 
has left a parish in dismay and a pastor simmering with anger and sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "What breaks my heart is the desecration of the tabernacle," said Father John 
D. Murray, pastor of Our Lady of the Valley Catholic Church. "It was locked, so 
they probably smashed it open or pried it apart. They must have been 
disappointed when they opened it. The host just looks like bread." 
</P>
<P>
 The bronze tabernacle, valued at more than $3,000, and its contents -- blessed 
bread representing the body of Jesus Christ, served during the Holy Communion 
-- was stolen by thieves who gained entrance to the locked, guarded parish hall 
during the night of Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 They did not rush. The burglars left behind a pair of cigarette butts, 
apparently smoked as they raided the building of the tabernacle and other 
booty, including a classroom VCR bolted to the wall and several goblets and 
bowls sometimes used during services. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Thursday that fingerprints left by the culprit -- or culprits -- 
turned up no leads. The total value of the goods stolen is estimated at about 
$3,500. But it is the loss of the tabernacle's contents that has most deeply 
hurt Murray, who said he has difficulty grappling with the idea of the 
Eucharistic presence being toted around by thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect that at least two people carried out the heist, because the 
tabernacle -- a rectangular, cabinet-like chest about 10 inches tall, 16 inches 
deep and 20 inches wide -- would be difficult for one person to haul away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's heavy," Murray said. "It's like a small safe, with doors that open with 
a key." 
</P>
<P>
 Police don't know how burglars gained entry to the hall, where services for 
the 2,000-family parish have been held since the January earthquake badly 
damaged the sanctuary on Gault Street. There was no sign of forced entry, 
broken windows or locks. Security guards patrol the grounds twice nightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, services have continued uninterrupted, thanks to a 
neighboring parish that lent the church a tabernacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray hopes the thieves will not try to sell the tabernacle and will leave it 
some place where it can be found. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep the sacred host inside, the blessed bread we served to our sick 
parishioners," he said. "We are all devastated. Our only consolation is that 
all things return to dust. God has a way of taking care of these things 
himself."

MISHANDLING OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE ALLEGED; MEDICINE: OFFICIALS ARE INVESTIGATING 
WHETHER HAZARDOUS MATERIAL POSED A HEALTH RISK AT A LANCASTER HOSPITAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State and county officials said Friday that they are investigating allegations 
that staff members mishandled radioactive waste in patients' rooms at the 
county-operated High Desert Hospital in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 A hospital spokesman acknowledged that handling errors occurred, but said the 
facility had begun correcting the problem even before a county health 
investigator arrived Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry M. Harris, associate administrator of the 170-bed hospital, also said 
any improper handling of radioactive materials had posed no health hazards. 
"There was no problem in terms of safety to patients or employees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem arose in the past month when four patients were given radioactive 
iodine capsules to swallow as treatment for thyroid disorders. Some hospital 
linens, patient gowns, eating utensils and other supplies they used, tainted by 
radiation, were not taken to a protected waste-disposal area behind the 
hospital, as is required by state regulation, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That material has to be put in a containment area and stored long enough for 
the level of radiation to go down," a period lasting up to 80 days, he said. 
"Then it can be shipped to a hazardous waste disposal site." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the recent cases, radioactive materials were mixed with other 
medical waste and picked up by a disposal company, he said. During processing 
by the company, a Geiger counter picked up radioactivity, and the company asked 
the hospital to retrieve the material and put it in the containment area, 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It basically was a breakdown in communication. We have policies and 
procedures" for handling radioactive materials that were not followed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said staff members may have forgotten the rules because the thyroid 
radiation treatment had not been administered at the hospital for several 
years, "then all of a sudden we had four cases within about a month." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said hospital employees will receive more training to prevent a 
recurrence. "If we make a mistake, we want to correct it, and that's what we're 
doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Physician Claudette Robbins, the hospital's chief radiologist, said she 
believed the incidents had been "blown out of proportion" by hospital employees 
who were not working directly with the patients receiving radiation treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing things properly in such a way as there are no safety issues," 
Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Hamrick, a county health physicist who is investigating the radiation 
complaint, would not comment Friday on whether the hospital's handling posed 
any health risks, and referred all questions to her supervisor at the Los 
Angeles County Office of Radiation Management, which was closed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The national Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations 
also is looking into the allegations of mishandling of radioactive materials at 
High Desert, said Suzanne Gylfe, a commission spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigations began when an anonymous caller recently complained to the 
state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Wong, chief of compliance for the department's Southern California 
Radiological Health Branch, said he referred the matter to county investigators 
because they have jurisdiction over the High Desert. He said the results of the 
county's probe will be sent to his supervisors in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said people who take radioactive iodine on an outpatient basis are 
usually urged to stay away from pregnant women and small children for three 
days for safety reasons. But he said such patients transmit only a small, 
relatively harmless amount of radiation to fabrics they wear and utensils they 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're exposed to contaminated linen or utensils, you're not apt to have 
any kind of a health threat," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he said, hospitals are required to follow strict rules in 
handling radioactive material in order to keep exposure levels as low as 
possible.

MAYOR REQUESTS NEW AID DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying he worries that many earthquake victims are only now discovering the 
true extent of damage to their property, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan 
requested Friday that the deadline to seek federal aid be extended from Oct. 17 
to Jan. 17, the first anniversary of the deadly temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief letter, Riordan asked the Governor's Office of Emergency Services 
to formally request the extension from the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
and the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "While some have progressed through damage assessments and moved on to repair 
and reconstruction, others are only now beginning to define their needs and 
apply for assistance," Riordan wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 He also asked that disaster assistance centers remain open until Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 OES spokesman Dennis Williams said the state agency was considering an 
extension of the deadline even before Riordan sent the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are evaluating that right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A FEMA spokesman said he had not received the letter, but added: "We'll 
consider any request on its merits and needs." 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline had been previously extended from Sept. 17 to Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 As of this week, FEMA and SBA had received 634,852 requests for assistance, 
according to officials. The SBA has received 212,722 loan requests and approved 
105,492 applications for loans totaling $3.4 billion. Another 88,459 
applications were rejected and 16,205 were withdrawn by the applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 An SBA spokesman said his agency is still receiving 200 to 300 loan 
applications daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and Los Angeles Controller Rick Tuttle said they fear that many 
quake-damaged businesses need additional time and assistance to apply for aid. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, an SBA survey found that many quake victims failed to apply for aid 
because they did not understand the agency's loan-application process. In 
response, FEMA and SBA sent out 632,950 letters in the past few weeks, offering 
additional help and toll-free telephone information numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan and Tuttle are concerned that the letters may not have reached 
every quake-damaged business in the city. Both have sent letters to FEMA asking 
the agency to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Controller Tim Lynch said federal officials told him that only 21,000 
businesses in Los Angeles have received copies of the letter, even though the 
total of SBA applications from businesses far exceeds that number. 
</P>
<P>
 But FEMA spokesman Russ Edmonston disagreed. He said every business and 
individual who filled out an application for aid has received a letter. In 
addition, he said, 21,000 businesses that qualify for a special city assistance 
program got copies of a letter that explains that program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who registered with FEMA or SBA got a letter," Edmonston said.

 The Los Angeles Times awarded more than $225,000 in earthquake aid at a 
luncheon Friday to 29 nonprofit organizations from the San Fernando Valley, 
Ventura County, Los Angeles and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants of $5,000 to $20,000 each were funded by proceeds from the sale of 
"4:31: Images of the 1994 Los Angeles Earthquake," The Times book of essays and 
photos of the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, published in February, has sold more than 100,000 copies and was on 
the Los Angeles Times' Paperback Bestsellers list for nonfiction for two months 
-- making it one of the best-selling books the paper has published. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased to be able to help these organizations, which have provided 
such valuable services to our communities at such a critical time," said 
Richard T. Schlosberg III, The Times' publisher and chief executive officer. 
"The Times' contribution to their recovery is an endorsement of their hard work 
and dedication." 
</P>
<P>
 The awards luncheon was held at The Times' Valley Edition plant in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, The Times and its parent company, Times Mirror Co., have given out 
almost $500,000 in earthquake assistance. In the days after the quake, the two 
companies donated $100,000 to the United Way Earthquake Relief Fund. In 
February, The Times gave $23,000 to the School of Journalism at Cal State 
Northridge to help rebuild its devastated journalism lab.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Times Fund has also given more than $130,000 to 22 youth 
agencies in the Valley and Los Angeles.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; WATER DISTRICT TO BUY PRIVATE INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned over a sharp increase in premiums for liability insurance, the Las 
Virgenes Municipal Water District has decided to cancel its contract with a 
public agency that is providing coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's board of directors voted this week to allow its staff to 
withdraw from its contract with the Sacramento-based Joint Powers Insurance 
Authority and sign with a private firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are simply concerned that the cost has escalated to $322,000, up from 
$226,000" a year, said Michael Garrick, the district's director of finance and 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's staff will recommend the signing of a 90-day binder, or 
temporary agreement, with Hartford Insurance Group, he said. The firm, he said, 
has "given us a range, about $70,000, dependent upon the binder." 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford is offering a $10-million policy with a $1-million deductible, which 
would make the district self-insured, said Wayne Lemieux, the district's legal 
counsel. Being self-insured, he said, could actually help protect the district 
from being sued. 
</P>
<P>
 "People know that the district is really going to challenge claims if it is 
self-insured," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40% of the increase in premiums was due to the district's losses 
increasing from $130,000 to about $200,000 over the last year, said Dan Klaff, 
assistant general manager of Joint Powers. Another factor was that the 
district's payroll has risen from $6.4 million to $6.6 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaff questioned whether the district will actually save money by going with a 
private firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can reduce premiums, but in doing so they are going to raise their 
self-insurance retention, which means that the district will assume a greater 
dollar value on each loss," said Klaff. "They'll assume more risk on their 
own." 
</P>
<P>
 That's similar, he said, to a person increasing the deductible on an auto 
insurance policy to save money. FRANK MANNING

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
COUNTY'S CREDIT RATING SLIGHTLY DOWNGRADED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reflecting the state's deteriorating economy, Los Angeles County's credit 
rating was downgraded a notch Friday.Standard & Poor's reduced its rating on 
the county's general obligation bonds to A+ from AA-. 
</P>
<P>
 The move by S & P follows a similar downgrading by Moody's Investor Service in 
March. S & P officials said the rating change reflects financial pressures on 
counties as a result of the state government's financial bind and the 
vulnerability of counties to future state budgetary problems. 
</P>
<P>
 County Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed said she was assured by S & P 
analysts that the downgrading was not the result of the county's debt level or 
its plan to issue more than $1 billion in pension obligation bonds this year.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HUNTINGTON PARK; 2 HELD 
IN SHOOTING OF OFF-DUTY OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and robbery after an 
off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer was shot while using a pay phone 
Thursday night in Huntington Park, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old officer, whose namewas not released, was shot in the legs but 
not seriously wounded in the attack in the 3000 block of Florence Avenue, said 
Sgt. Ron Spear of the Sheriff's Department.The officer had been using the phone 
when two men approached and one thrust a gun in his stomach, Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 A struggle followed and the suspect's gun went off, striking both the 
officer's legs, Spear said. The officer returned gunfire as the two men fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park police later arrested Aaron Ibarra, 31, after he sought 
treatment for a gunshot wound at Martin Luther King/Drew Medical Center. He was 
in custody and in stable condition Friday at Los Angeles County-USC Medical 
Center, Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation led to the arrest of Freddie Santiago, 25, at a home in South 
Gate. Santiago is suspected of driving the getaway vehicle, a red Blazer that 
had been reported stolen in Los Angeles, Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 A third suspect was being sought, but details about his role in the attack 
were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer was treated at County-USC Medical Center and released.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
EX-DEPUTY GETS 5 MONTHS IN MONEY-SKIMMING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ex-Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy was sentenced Friday to five months 
in prison and five months of home confinement for his role in a corruption case 
involving a drug investigative unit.  
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ballestros, who hid $150,000 that a former colleague stole, was found 
guilty at his retrial of obstruction of justice.The 34-year-old Norwalk 
resident will remain free on $25,000 bond pending his appeal. U.S. District 
Judge Mariana Pfaelzer denied his motion for a new trial and acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballestros was the 23rd of 26 deputies assigned to the sheriff's elite 
narcotics investigations teams to be convicted in a money-skimming scandal. He 
initially was charged with conspiracy, obstructing justice, money laundering 
and being an accessory after the fact. He was acquitted of most of those 
charges this year and was retried on the obstruction of justice count.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy John Hurtado, who stole the cash and gave it to Ballestros to conceal, 
has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Disabled American Veterans has donated two new shuttle vans to the 
Sepulveda Veterans Medical Center in North Hills to use for transporting 
disabled veterans to and from the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical center's shuttle fleet, now at four, serves an average of 200 to 
300 veterans who sustained a disabling injury while on active duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle program was initiated in 1987, when budget constraints forced the 
medical center to eliminate vouchers disbursed to patients needing 
transportation to the hospital or clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Operated by a corps of 25 volunteers under the supervision of a local DAV 
transportation coordinator, the vans run routes in the San Fernando Valley, 
Antelope Valley, Simi Valley and other parts of Ventura County weekdays from 8 
a.m. to 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 To schedule an appointment for shuttle service, call (818) 895-9408 for the 
San Fernando Valley, (805) 974-0448 for the Lancaster area, (805) 526-9237 for 
Simi Valley and (805) 385-8500 for other Ventura County communities. 
Appointments must be made three days in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Those wishing to volunteer for the program should call (818) 895-9408. ANTONIO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; SERIOUS CRIME DOWN 15% FROM 1992 TO '93 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Serious crime dropped approximately 15% in the city between 1992 and 1993, 
ranking Agoura Hills in sixth place among Los Angeles County cities that showed 
significant decreases in crime during that period, according to a study. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crimes and property crimes dropped from a combined total of 718 in 
1992 to 610 in 1993, according to Tyler A. Foshe, a crime analyst for Crime 
Watch Consultants of Marina del Rey.The study did not break down the crimes by 
category. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Madre showed the largest decrease at 18.4%, according to the study. 
Malibu was second at 18.2% while Maywood was third, at 17.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 That was followed by Lynwood, at 17.8% and Bell, at 17.6%, the study said. San 
Fernando was seventh, with a 14.3% decrease. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Joe Grasso, a public information officer at the Lost Hills Sheriff's 
Station, said serious crime decreased throughout much of the county during that 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials aren't sure why crime is down but they have some 
theories. One is that the many natural disasters in 1993, such as flooding, 
curtailed criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Criminals do not like to come out in the rain," he said. "We've noticed that 
when it's raining, crime drops." 
</P>
<P>
 The fires last fall could also have curtailed some kinds of criminal activity, 
such as burglary, he said, because so many residential areas were inaccessible. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also speculate, Grasso said, that the disasters might have made 
people less likely to report crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it boils down to is reported crime versus unreported crime," he said. 
After disasters, "they trivialize things and people accept it: 'I've just been 
through fire, earthquakes and floods. If my stereo got ripped off, I'll just 
accept it.' " FRANK MANNING

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; POLICE EXPECT MORE SUBSTATIONS IN PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.D. STRAUB 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police hope a new substation, opened this week in a North 
Hollywood park as part of the department's community policing efforts, 
represents a trend toward institutionalizing police presence in the city's 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Service Center, located in the Park Center of Valley Plaza Park, 
will be staffed on a limited basis for the foreseeable future, according to 
LAPD Community Relations Sgt. Bill Martin. "Ultimately, of course, we would 
like to be full-service," he said. "But for now we are limited in hours. We are 
really short on manpower all over." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials, including Mayor Richard Riordan and Councilman Joe Wachs, expressed 
hope at Thursday's ceremonies marking the substation's inauguration -- the 
first to be located in a San Fernando Valley public park -- that it would be 
the model for other park-based police centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Ray Davies, of the North Hollywood Division, expressed support for the 
placement of substations in city parks. "They are a natural gathering place for 
the community," Davies said, "and people will get to know where (the station) 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Capt. Richard Wahler, the visibility of these substations creates 
a comfort zone for the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "These substations are like outposts for us," said Wahler. "We can put a sign 
on the door and park a black and white outside and people know we're there." 
</P>
<P>
 Wahler said he helped set up such a center in the Westlake area of Los 
Angeles. "Within just a couple of months it made a world of difference. Not 
because of anything that we did, but just letting people see us there," Wahler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The substation, located at 12240 Archwood St. and housed in the same building 
as the gymnasium and park director's office, will be staffed by officers on 
bicycles approximately eight hours a week on a regular basis, though the 
schedule has not been determined. The officers also work out of the Sun Valley 
Community Service Center at 8128 Sunland Blvd. No additional officers have been 
hired to staff the new center. 
</P>
<P>
 The substation also will be used by officers on other regular patrol in the 
area who need the office space to file reports and question witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens are encouraged to use the center to report crimes and "bring their 
concerns to the police," said Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, for Ruben Derma, the senior lead officer for the North Hollywood area in 
which the new substation is located, getting the center open took more than 
just the cooperation of the Police Department and community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing that (held) us up opening this center (was) the phone lines. 
They kept telling us 'tomorrow, tomorrow,' " Derma said. "We just couldn't get 
the phone lines installed." L.D. STRAUB

REASON FOR DISASTERS: LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION; RECOVERY: UCLA CONFERENCE 
MEMBERS AGREE THAT MOST TRAGEDIES RESULT FROM PEOPLE BUILDING WHERE THEY 
SHOULDN'T. SOLUTIONS ARE MUCH HARDER TO COME BY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the Great Fire of London devoured the city in 1666, the government 
issued a simple decree: Stop building with so much wood. It was a direct, 
effective response to disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But at a UCLA conference Friday on disaster recovery, state and federal 
officials as well as academics and environmentalists agreed that in Southern 
California today, the problems of rebuilding after fires, floods and 
earthquakes are more complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to identify what the problems are," said Paul Flores, deputy 
director of the state's office of emergency services. "But it is much harder to 
find solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the tricky questions: Who should pay for recovery? Should victims be 
allowed to rebuild in hazardous areas, such as mountainsides? And how much of 
what are written off as "acts of God" can be prevented? 
</P>
<P>
 "We usually find out, when all of the damage is tallied up, that God was not 
at all at fault," said Katherine Stone, a Ventura lawyer who represents cities. 
"There is always someone to point the finger at." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those attending the daylong workshop sponsored by the UCLA Extension 
Public Policy Program agreed that although disasters have tragic consequences, 
they are almost always the result of people building in areas where, ideally, 
they should not. 
</P>
<P>
 Such areas include most of Southern California, a region that owes its scenic 
beauty to the unstable geologic faults that run like spider webs miles 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we humans call disasters are really just part of the natural cycle," 
environmental lawyer D. Dwight Worden said. He and others questioned the wisdom 
of allowing new houses to sprout on charred or collapsed foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you build on the train tracks, you should not complain when the train hits 
you and we should not pay you to rebuild on those same tracks," Worden said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one solution suggested by some people after last fall's firestorms was 
for local officials to refuse permission to rebuild in areas prone to wildfires 
or landslides. Although the idea is attractive because of its simplicity in 
theory, most consider it unworkable because of its complexity in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners have a constitutional right to use of their property. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has ruled that if local governments want private property to 
remain undeveloped -- even if that could save lives -- they generally have to 
buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 But government often ends up footing at least part of the bill when the same 
property owners are left homeless by disaster. Or worse, the government gets 
sued by homeowners who are angry over being allowed to build in a dangerous 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we are still letting people rebuild is because we have no choice," 
Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth Frank said. "If we don't allow someone to 
rebuild, we get sued. If we allow them to rebuild and they get swept away, we 
get sued." 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1989 and 1996, federal taxpayers will have paid about $7 million a day 
to bandage the wounds caused by California disasters -- from the Loma Prieta to 
the Northridge earthquakes, according to Federal Emergency Management Agency 
figures, making California the biggest drain on national disaster funds.  
</P>
<P>
 William Ahern, deputy commissioner of the state insurance department, said 
there needs to be a fundamental overhaul of the insurance system to spread 
risks evenly among all residents. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, residents in high-risk fire areas such as the Santa Monica Mountains 
are subsidized by the state Fair Plan, which provides low-cost insurance to 
homes that private companies refuse to cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now rely on government," Ahern said, calling it "the least rational, most 
political, messy system you can think of." 
</P>
<P>
 But spreading the risk further did not rest well with some. Calabasas Planning 
Commissioner David Brown said he resents paying more in taxes and more for 
insurance so others can live on slide-prone hillsides with great views. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to focus the risks on the individual," Brown said. "They should not 
pass the risks on to the general public." 
</P>
<P>
 As daunting as rebuilding efforts seem, conference participants said each new 
disaster makes Southern California better prepared for the next. Earthquakes 
exercise a sort of "structural Darwinism" by destroying weak and old buildings, 
which can be replaced with newer, more stable ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake problem in California will never go away," said Jim Buika, a 
manager with FEMA. "But we can get better at it and obviously we have."

MTA HIRES OUTSIDE FIRM TO PROBE USE OF WOOD BRACES IN SUBWAY TUNNELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is hiring an outside consulting firm 
to investigate why and how project engineers allowed a contractor to use wood 
instead of steel bracing for subway tunnels beneath Hollywood Boulevard, 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring of the firm was announced by MTA Chief Executive Officer Franklin 
E. White, who said he would seek remuneration for all costs associated with the 
probe from any contractors found to be responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "My intention is to get for taxpayers what they paid for," White said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of the wood wedges has been cited by project engineers as part of 
the reason for ground sinkages in Hollywood of up to nine inches. Tunneling has 
been shut down since Aug. 18, while local and federal investigators review the 
construction methods and engineering decisions involved. 
</P>
<P>
 White has said the excavation in Hollywood -- part of the largest-ever subway 
contract in Los Angeles -- will not resume until experts are satisfied that it 
is safe to do so. The joint venture of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny two years ago won the 
contract to construct 12 miles of twin tunnels connecting Wilshire Boulevard 
with Hollywood Boulevard with a bid of $165 million. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials said Friday that the consulting firm being hired -- Wiss, 
Janney, Elstner Associates -- is expected to complete its review within three 
weeks. The Chicago-area company also assisted with a review launched by White 
last year of subway tunnels built Downtown with concrete thinner than 
specified. Wiss, Janney is continuing to monitor repairs to those tunnels, 
which are being performed by the original construction contractor at no cost to 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the new review, White said it will focus on Metro Rail engineers' 
decision two years ago to approve use of the wood bracing and the recent 
supervision of the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 White also said Wiss, Janney will oversee tests of concrete poured alongside 
the wood bracing. Early tests have found that the concrete was of less strength 
than required by the contract. Additionally, White said, the new testing will 
verify the nature of what he called "foreign matter" apparently contained in 
the expansion gaps in the outer tunnel shell along with the wood and concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Project engineers' approval of the tunnel builder's use of the 32-inch-long 
wood wedges, instead of metal struts, was reported Tuesday by The Times. 
Outside engineering experts told the newspaper that the wood as specified for 
the bracing was inadequate to bear the expected soil loads. The MTA later 
reported that recent "preliminary" strength tests of the wood used in the 
construction found it to be weaker than engineers had assumed when they 
approved its use. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the wood wedges are less expensive than the metal struts, transit 
agency engineers declined to seek any credit from the tunnel builder, 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny. Shea representatives have declined comment on any aspect of 
the construction, citing terms of their contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervision of the construction has been handled by the MTA's management firm, 
Parsons-Dillingham. White already has voiced waning confidence in that firm and 
the project's design engineers, led by Parsons Brinckerhoff of New York. Both 
firms were responsible for reviewing and approving the substitution of the wood 
wedges. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Patsaouras, an appointee to the MTA board, said White needs to go further 
than commissioning another outside review. Noting that specialists who studied 
the thin tunnel walls Downtown concluded in March that Parsons-Dillingham fell 
short of "acceptable industry practice" in its inspections, Patsaouras said 
major changes are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This substitution (of wood wedges for metal struts) is absolutely 
outrageous," said Patsaouras, who is an engineer. "I feel at this point that 
White has to get past the independent panel syndrome and replace some people to 
regain the confidence of the taxpaying public." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Parsons-Dillingham, based in Pasadena, said Friday that the 
firm "looks forward to an independent investigation."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; BUILDER HIRED FOR AUDITORIUM GARAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week hired a Glendale contractor to build a parking 
structure for nearly $6 million, rejecting the claim by a Van Nuys company 
whose bid was $85,000 lower that it was disqualified so the job would go to a 
hometown firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 0 to award a $5.6-million contract to George C. Hopkins 
Construction Co. to build a three-level, 375-space garage at the Glendale Civic 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six firms that competed for the job, Hopkins submitted the 
second-lowest bid, but city officials said Neko Construction, which offered to 
build the structure for about $5.5 million, failed to properly fill out the 
necessary paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Neko officials argued that they were passed over on a "minor technicality," 
for failing to list addresses for the subcontractors they intended to use. Bob 
Nehoray, a principal of the company, said he believed the city was showing 
favoritism to Hopkins, which has built several other city projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something fishy's going on," Nehoray said in an interview this week. "I can't 
prove it but I can sense it. The city is willing to spend $85,000 more of the 
public's money, and that I don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 The parking structure is part of a three-phase plan to revamp and enlarge the 
aging civic auditorium. While work on the auditorium itself has been put on 
hold due to budget constraints, the parking structure is also part of another 
plan to help alleviate a parking shortage at Glendale Community College. 
Officials hope to have it completed in time for the fall 1995 semester. 
</P>
<P>
 The city actually solicited contractor's bids on the project twice. In July, 
three contractors submitted bids for the job, including Hopkins, but Hopkins' 
bid was thrown out because it arrived in the city clerk's office late. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, Hopkins officials contacted the city attorney and urged 
that the other bids be disqualified because the companies had not listed 
complete information on their subcontractors, a violation of state law, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Reese, assistant director of parks and recreation, said he presided over 
a "pre-bid meeting" with all the contractors who bid on the project the second 
time around, including Neko, and explicitly told them to fill out the bid forms 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said that every line of every form must be filled out, and I made it known 
that if they weren't, they may be subject to rejection," Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese said there was no collusion between the city and Hopkins and even if it 
seems Neko was disqualified on a minor point, the city was bound to follow the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bidding process must be fair and square to all bidders, nobody should be 
given an advantage over anybody else," he added. "If the council had already 
rejected all the bids on one occasion for that reason, they would have to do it 
again." STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; PARENTS WORK SO CHILDREN AT PARK CAN PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE and ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing pickup football in Pacoima sometimes means making do. On a recent 
afternoon, the field was a half-acre lot covered in asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 Diving tackles were rare. 
</P>
<P>
 If blacktop is not the surface of choice for aspiring quarterbacks, at least 
cars don't speed through the playground at Haddon Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 The games used to take place along Goleta Street and Amboy Avenue, said 
Josefina Munoz, and often included her three sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Muy peligroso, " she said. "Very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Exasperated that the nearest park is nearly two miles away, and tired of 
fearing the screech of brakes that would signal an accident in their streets, 
parents of Haddon Elementary students found a way to keep their children 
occupied and safe after the school bell rings. These parents organized to take 
shifts at the school playground where they oversee volleyball and soccer 
matches, and teach the children to make woven keychains and work with wood. 
</P>
<P>
 The group calls itself the Pacoima Village People and follows the philosophy 
of African tribes who teach "it takes an entire community to raise a child," 
said Richard Guerrero, an organizer for the nonprofit Hope in Youth program 
that helped found the playground program. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero got involved several months ago upon hearing about the lack of parks 
in the area. He stepped in to organize a community where neighbors of 15 years 
still didn't know each other, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A meeting was called in late August to address the parks issue. When none of 
the invited local politicians showed up, the parents decided to take matters 
into their own hands. They went to Haddon principal Loraine Mason to propose 
that the playground be used for expanded after-school activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The playground was already open and supervised until 6:30 p.m. each weekday, 
but the coach provided by the city had his hands full just keeping an eye on 
the 30 or so children who played there. 
</P>
<P>
 "One person wasn't enough," Mason said. She quickly gave her approval for 
parents to help supervise the playground. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the volunteer adults plan arts and crafts projects and watch over many of 
the younger children, who seldom went to the lot before because of the lack of 
activities for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach, Brian Burke, welcomed the help he got from the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the parents, it allows me to run activities like hockey, football, 
soccer," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd on this afternoon consisted of more than 50 children, nearly double 
the number who used to show up at the playground. And more are coming all the 
time, said Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
 The place is no Dodger Stadium, parents acknowledged -- there's not a blade of 
grass in sight. And turning a patch of asphalt into a football field is not 
going to unite an entire community. But it's a start. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is step one," said Guerrero. "Step two is we're going to approach local 
politicians and see if we can get a (real) park."ERIC SLATER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; $1.6 MILLION OKD FOR JOBS PROGRAM 
</P>

<P>
 An agency that helps former Lockheed employees and other defense industry 
workers who have lost their jobs will receive a $1.6-million state grant to 
continue putting people back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson approved the grant -- which comes from the state's share of 
federal Job Training Partnership Act funds -- on Friday for the Verdugo Private 
Industry Council. The money will support career counseling, job assessment 
testing, job placement assistance and training programs for the next 18 months, 
said Sandra Burton, a senior analyst with the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge for us has been to find a wide range of jobs for the dislocated 
workers to enter," Burton said. "One thing we've learned is that no great 
number of people can be retrained in any one thing at the same time, or you 
begin to find a shortage of jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The local Private Industry Council was formed in the early 1980s under the 
federal job-training program, but it has become flooded with clients since the 
late 1980s when Lockheed Corp., which once employed 13,000 workers at its 
Burbank plant, began a series of layoffs and eventually closed that facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the council opened the Verdugo Center for Jobs and Retraining in 
Burbank. That center has assisted aerospace and defense workers from all 
echelons -- from office workers to machinists to engineers -- in finding new 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the center tries to help clients find jobs in their career field, 
but if such positions are scarce, it offers training in a variety of different 
career areas, ranging from transportation to health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major part of its program is personal counseling for those who suffer 
emotionally from the recession's effects, Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very common for a person to become depressed and angry in the wake of a 
layoff and the continued rejections involved in a job search," she said. "But 
it's very important to keep a good state of mental health to keep that search 
going and to present a good impression to potential employers." STEVE RYFLE

<P>
 Habitat for Humanity, a nationwide nonprofit organization that helps needy 
families become homeowners, will start construction today on its first project 
in the city of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 A groundbreaking ceremony will be held at 10 a.m. at 531 Allen St., where 
Habitat for Humanity's San Gabriel Valley chapter and the city's Housing 
Authority will build a four-unit townhouse project for very-low-income 
families, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will consist of three-bedroom townhouses of about 1,100 square 
feet, which will be sold for $50,000 to $75,000 each. Families earning less 
than half the county median income, or $24,150 for a family of four, will be 
eligible to participate in the buying program. 
</P>
<P>
 Preference will be given to Glendale families who are able to make a 1% down 
payment, pay a small mortgage and provide "sweat equity" -- physically helping 
to build the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitat for Humanity uses volunteer labor and donations to build homes. The 
Housing Authority purchases the property and pays development fees for the 
project, officials said. STEVE RYFLE

COUNCILMAN DROPS BY PARTY HOUSE UNINVITED; STUDIO CITY: WACHS DECLARES 
BACCHANALIAN DISTURBANCES ARE OVER. BUT THE TENANT SAYS HE DIDN'T SIGN OWNER'S 
AGREEMENT. 
</P>

 Jerry Bolduc watched indolently from atop his veranda as Councilman Joel 
Wachs, outside the gates of Bolduc's rented mansion, proclaimed the victory of 
public virtue over all manner of private vice Friday at the hillside 
community's most notorious residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no longer any loud parties, any commercial activities, any sale 
of alcohol, any loud music," Wachs announced during a morning news conference 
at 3240 Wrightwood Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 And no more public sex either, the councilman declared, as two gray cats 
frisked in the driveway behind him, quickly disappearing from prying eyes 
beneath a red Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Bolduc, the party isn't over, despite a good-faith agreement 
signed this week by the home's owner and mortgage holder to curb festivities 
that have drawn 1,000 people at a time as well as an MTV film crew, a famous 
rap star, women in negligees and fire from nettled neighbors (who, for the 
record, were sometimes invited). 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, which awaits approval from a judge Oct. 17, bans the illegal 
sale of alcohol, advertised events and parties after 10 p.m. or with more than 
25 guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "My signature appears nowhere on it," said Bolduc -- "Jerry Bo" to friends. 
"(As) part of my tenancy, I did not agree to a 10 o'clock curfew." And, natch, 
"there's not much of a party if it's only 25 people." 
</P>
<P>
 The 7,500-square-foot bluff-top mansion, valued at $2.1 million, can fit far 
more than 25 people. Ever the genial host, Bolduc invited a gaggle of reporters 
to view the spacious -- but sparsely furnished -- home that he has occupied for 
a year, the site of several themed revels: a beach party, a toga party, an "Age 
of Aquarius & Classic Disco" party, a "Tax Relief" party. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit filed by the city attorney's office alleged that such Bacchanalia 
has resulted in public lewdness, parking problems, liquor and safety violations 
and general unneighborliness. Undercover officers were even sent "to 
infiltrate" the parties and gather evidence, Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just like living on a major thoroughfare on this narrow, quiet little 
street," said Margot Lachman, a television news writer who lives next to No. 
3240. "It just got to the point where it was impossible to live with this." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachman, 29, said the excessive merrymaking has given residents headaches for 
three years and agreed with Bolduc's claim that the problems predate his 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just rents the place. He's like some transient who lives there," Lachman 
said before zipping off to work at KCBS, one of several local stations that 
showed up to cover the Wachs-and-Bolduc show Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Though tenants of owner Paul Campbell, Bolduc and housemate Michael Dupre are 
nonetheless bound by the agreement, Deputy City Atty. Deborah Sanchez warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may not have signed it, but it's the owner's responsibility to care for 
the property, and in the stipulation it does have a provision that if the 
(agreement is) violated, eviction proceedings would start immediately," Sanchez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the judge formalizes the agreement as a permanent injunction on Oct. 17, 
Bolduc could also be held in contempt of court, Sanchez added. 
</P>
<P>
 Contempt was already evident on Bolduc's face Friday as he stood on his back 
porch, surrounded by cameras and reporters, some of whom were visibly impressed 
by the home, its back-yard pool, volleyball court and commanding vista of the 
fog- and smog-enshrouded San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not been abusive," Bolduc said. "Most of the problems that occurred 
were before I got here. . . . Of course I want to be a good neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
 So will he be having a party anytime soon? 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe one for you guys," he told reporters.

DISABILITY GROUP SUES OVER CALL BOX ACCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying disabled drivers are left "without assistance and often in grave 
danger" when their cars break down, a disabled-rights group sued three 
government agencies Friday to make freeway call boxes more accessible to people 
who are deaf or in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that county and state agencies have discriminated against the 
disabled by requiring voice and aural communication at the call boxes. The 
boxes are also situated on slopes, uneven ground or behind curbs, putting them 
out of reach for people who cannot walk easily, according to the suit, which 
seeks no damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a suit about money. We just want them fixed," said David Raizman, 
executive director of the Western Law Center for Disability Rights, which 
brought the lawsuit on behalf of three deaf county residents and one woman who 
suffers from multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4,200 call boxes, which connect motorists directly to the California 
Highway Patrol, line local freeways on land owned by Caltrans. The Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority puts up and maintains the boxes, first installed in 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
 All three agencies are named as defendants in the suit, which accuses 
officials of violating the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act and other state 
and federal statutes. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials expressed surprise at the legal action, saying it seemed 
premature since the agency is awaiting final federal guidelines on redesigning 
call boxes to comply with the ADA and intends to abide by them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That document is still in production," said spokeswoman Clara Potes-Fellow. 
</P>
<P>
 Two drafts of the regulations have been issued, but not a final version, MTA 
officials said. The agency has already contacted contractors about retrofitting 
the call boxes when the guidelines come through, probably at the end of the 
year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures outlined in the draft reports include slicing away some sections of 
curb and laying plastic pads on the ground to enable those in wheelchairs to 
roll to the call boxes more easily. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs also demand that call boxes be outfitted with TDDs, or 
telecommunications devices for the deaf. Raizman said such equipment would 
benefit everyone, since loud freeway traffic and occasional poor connections 
can make speaking and listening difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit describes difficulties experienced by the four plaintiffs when 
their vehicles broke down on area freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 In one incident, plaintiff Carol Anne Wright, who uses a wheelchair because of 
multiple sclerosis, was forced to crawl from a curb along the San Diego Freeway 
to the call box, only to find it was out of order, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP and Caltrans officials declined comment on the lawsuit.

 It has the epic proportions of "Schindler's List" and employs state-of-the-art 
technology like "Jurassic Park," but Steven Spielberg's newest 
multimillion-dollar project will never make a dime at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the three-time Academy Award winner's latest enterprise is 
strictly a labor of love: He intends to capture the eyewitness testimony of 
thousands of survivors of the Nazi Holocaust on videotape and create the first 
major archival database using multiple media. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he plans to create educational software based on the interviews and make 
them accessible enough so that any seventh-grader who knows how to go on-line 
will be able to see and hear these vivid accounts of survival in the face of 
genocide.  
</P>
<P>
 The filmmaker calls the ambitious effort "a race against time" because most of 
the survivors are 62 to 100 years old. "My whole dream is to take as many 
testimonies as is humanly possible and make their stories available for no fee 
for those who want it," Spielberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 With $16 million in seed money from his own funds and contributions from movie 
studios, he has founded the nonprofit Survivors of the Shoah (Hebrew for 
"Holocaust") Visual History Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 In June the foundation launched a pilot program in the Los Angeles area, where 
it has collected more than 100 interviews. Next month, interviewers -- who 
include filmmakers, rabbis, therapists, professors and adult children of 
Holocaust survivors -- will begin 20 hours of training in New York, Toronto and 
South Florida. The project is expected to cover the globe and cost $50 million 
to $60 million over several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he hopes to expand the project to include non-Jewish survivors, the 
first thrust, Spielberg said, will be to tape Jewish survivors "because the 
Holocaust was really about what happened to European Jewry -- the destruction 
of Jewish culture on that continent." 
</P>
<P>
 "You should know," he said, "that some people would not talk to us. There are 
a lot of Jewish survivors that would like this to die with them because the 
memories are too horrible to confront." 
</P>
<P>
 The interviews will make up what he believes will be the largest multimedia 
database in Holocaust studies, incorporating visual, aural and written 
material.  
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg emphasized that his interdisciplinary team of filmmakers, computer 
hardware manufacturers, software developers, historians, archivists and 
educators is "not reinventing the wheel. We're committed to sharing resources 
and joining forces with important organizations engaged in Holocaust survivor 
documentation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the institutions that are training the foundation's interviewers are 
the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University; the 
Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York; the United States Holocaust Memorial 
Museum in Washington, D.C.; Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' 
Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los 
Angeles. They will also serve as the initial repositories for the collection.  
</P>
<P>
 The interviews, each two to three hours long, include accounts not only of 
pain and loss, but also details of how, after losing so much, survivors managed 
to rebuild their lives. Photographs and documents are preserved on tape. When 
possible, spouses and children appear on camera during the final moments. Each 
survivor receives a copy. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Spielberg's near-obsession with cutting-edge technology, researchers 
using computers will be able to call up the interviews or portions of them 
using keywords. They will be able to select interviews by a subject's surname, 
gender or hometown, or a topic mentioned in the interview, such as the name of 
a concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
 James Moll, one of two hands-on producers overseeing the project, said the 
team is using the latest digital technology that will allow the interviews to 
be stored for long periods of time and copied without any loss of quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the database, which will be used mainly by scholars, the foundation is 
developing educational software programs for different age and grade levels, 
Moll said. A student might "walk through" the barracks of a concentration camp 
and see different faces. He or she could then click on a face to hear that 
person's story. The program could also include documentary film footage. If the 
programs are sold, he said, all profits would be channeled back to the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moll and fellow producer June Beallor, who had teamed up to make documentary 
educational and promotional films before being tapped by Spielberg for the 
foundation, see their work as "a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" and 
acknowledge that it has a highly emotional aspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "James and I have always worked on projects that we consider meaningful," 
Beallor said, "but this one has changed our lives. We put our whole heart into 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up Jewish," she said. "But it's one thing to read or hear about the 
Holocaust and another to watch an eyewitness account." 
</P>
<P>
 She was deeply affected, she said, by the story of a man who was forced by the 
Nazis to hang his own father. She received a moving letter of thanks from 
another man whose father had never been able to talk to him directly about his 
experiences in the death camps. But the father volunteered to be interviewed by 
the foundation and then gave the taped interview to his son. Only then, the son 
wrote, did they begin to talk openly about the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Moll, who is not Jewish, said: "I don't know how to respond when people ask me 
how I can be so dedicated to documenting the stories of Jewish survivors. I 
don't understand how they don't understand," he said softly. "The other 
non-Jewish people on our staff feel the same way."  
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg said the idea came to him in the middle of making "Schindler's 
List," the 1993 film based on the Thomas Keneally book about Nazi industrialist 
Oskar Schindler, who saved more than 1,000 Jews during World War II. "I felt 
that a much more important contribution to remembering the Shoah would be an 
aural-visual history," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 46-year-old director's own interest in the Holocaust goes back to early 
childhood. "My grandparents were a major presence in my life. . . . Because of 
them," he said, "I had a bar mitzvah in an Orthodox synagogue and kept kosher 
for most of my formative life. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were not survivors," he added, "but many of their friends were, and my 
awareness (of the Holocaust) came from them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, because of my mom's interest in classical music, a lot of survivors who 
were musicians would come to our house in Cincinnati," he said. "There were 
people playing cellos and violas with Auschwitz-Birkenau tattoos on their arms. 
I remember when I was 3 years old learning to count by touching the numbers on 
the forearm of one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long before 'Schindler's List' was even written, I would read everything I 
could and see documentaries on the subject." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his main reasons for undertaking the foundation project, he said, was 
to give young people a more vivid sense of history, help them "wake up to the 
fact that we are all part of every episode that has happened."  
</P>
<P>
 The Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation is trying to contact 
Holocaust survivors and recruit interviewers around the world. Inquiries can be 
made in writing to P.O. Box 8940, Universal City, CA 91608-0940, or by 
telephone from within the United States and Canada at (800) 661-2092.

KENNEDY DROPS RELIGION AS ISSUE IN SENATE RACE; POLITICS: A CATHOLIC, HE HAD 
BEEN CRITICIZED FOR RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT PRACTICES OF MORMON CHURCH, TO 
WHICH HIS OPPONENT BELONGS. THEY ARE IN A DEAD HEAT IN MASSACHUSETTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), an Irish Catholic in a state with an 
overwhelmingly Catholic population, learned a bitter lesson this week about the 
dangers of introducing religion into a political contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, who has served in the Senate for 32 years, is running the race of his 
life againstconservative Republican Mitt Romney, a former Mormon bishop and a 
self-made millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy and Romney are in a virtual dead heat in the Senate race. The most 
recent poll by Cambridge-based Opinion Dynamics showed 43% of the voters 
favoring Romney, 42% Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy has drawn criticism throughout the campaign for repeatedly raising 
questions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- in 
particular, the Mormon church's refusal to ordain women and its former 
practice, abolished in 1978, of barring blacks from the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy also has indulged in theological politicking within his own religious 
tradition, asserting that the Vatican should ordain women. 
</P>
<P>
 Such tactics have earned him stinging rebukes in both journalistic and 
political circles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Kennedy camp would win more votes standing firmly on secular high 
ground," declared a Sept. 28 Boston Globe editorial. "It's fine to ask Romney 
what he thinks about welfare and other social issues, but don't hit him for 
following the tenets of faith within a religious community." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Manning, Romney's political consultant, said Kennedy was using 
religion to divert attention from his liberal record on welfare, crime control 
and other issues. Romney accused the senator of betraying his brother John F. 
Kennedy's stand against religious bigotry in 1960, when he became the first 
Roman Catholic to be elected President. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the criticism, Kennedy has done a dramatic about-face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Religion should not be an issue in this campaign," Kennedy told the 
Associated Press this week. "The way to make it so is to stop talking about it 
and to focus on issues like jobs, education and health care, which is exactly 
what I intend to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The political differences are clear between Kennedy, a champion of health care 
reform and programs for the poor, and Romney, a venture capitalist who wants to 
lower taxes, trim government spending on social programs and institute 
drug-testing for welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Romney's campaign advertising on welfare reform takes Kennedy to task for 
helping create the present system. "Despite billions spent over the last 32 
years," one ad said, "poverty and illegitimate births are at an all-time high." 
</P>
<P>
 The personal differences between the two candidates are even more striking. 
</P>
<P>
 In more than three decades of public life, the hard-driving Kennedy has worn 
his character flaws as openly as his personal charisma. Divorced and now 
remarried to a divorced mother of two, Kennedy publicly apologized for his 
heavy drinking and vowed to mend his ways. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Republican Senate candidate, who has never held elected 
office, has no public record and maintains a squeaky-clean image. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most visible and salable advantage Mitt Romney has is his lifestyle: his 
beautiful wife, five sons," said Romney supporter and fellow Mormon Tony 
Kimball, a professor of government at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass. 
"There's no dirt to dig up on Mitt Romney. He doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, 
there's no extra-marital sex, no premarital sex." 
</P>
<P>
 But the clean-cut Mormon lifestyle has a political downside of its own, 
Kimball said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public perception of Mormons is that they're just too goody-goody or that 
they want to exclude people who are not of their kind," he said. "There's a 
perception out there that with no apparent flaws people can identify with, 
Romney is just too good to be true." 
</P>
<P>
 In the view of Robert Royal, a conservative analyst at the Ethics and Public 
Policy Center in Washington, the flap over religion in the Massachusetts Senate 
race only proves that it is becoming increasingly difficult to determine 
exactly who is good and what is true in the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a whole lot easier to attack people for their religious beliefs these 
days than for their political positions," Royal said. "All sides seem to be 
cynically manipulating religion. We cannot tar politicians for their religion 
any more than we can attack them for their personal sins. If we were all 
saints, we'd already be in heaven."

AUTOPSY SCHEDULED ON MAN WHO DIED IN VAN NUYS JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man arrested by police on suspicion of being drunk in public died in a jail 
cell, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy to determine why the 37-year-old man died is scheduled to be 
performed next week, and investigators from the Police Department's 
Robbery-Homicide division are investigating the death, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The identity of the victim, believed to be a transient, has not been released 
pending notification of his family, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was arrested Thursday about 1:05 p.m. when officers searching for a 
burglar found him lying in an alley near the 11900 block of Addison Street in 
North Hollywood, said police spokeswoman Sandra Castello. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers believed the man fit the description of the burglar, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The police called an ambulance, and paramedics told officers that the man was 
well enough to be arrested and taken to jail, Castello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of going to the North Hollywood facility, which was closer, the 
officers took him to the Van Nuys Jail, which has a doctor and dispensary, said 
police spokesman Rigo Romero. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was booked on suspicion of public drunkenness because there was not 
enough evidence to arrest him for burglary, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Chuck Peterson, the jailer who was on duty when the man was brought in, 
said the man was examined by a doctor before he was placed in a cell, and "was 
constantly under observation." 
</P>
<P>
 But about four hours later at 4:55 p.m., the man -- who was lying on his bunk 
-- did not respond during a routine check by the jail's nurse and a jail 
physician was unable to revive him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was pronounced dead at Valley Hospital Medical Center at 5:31 p.m., 
authorities said.

 The Good Samaritan Counseling Center opens today, offering mental health 
services to member churches and the public at four South Bay locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the South Coast Ecumenical Council, a consortium of 125 
congregations and related ministries in the South Bay-Long Beach-Lakewood area, 
the center is the fulfillment of a dream for the Rev. Lester E. Kim, who has 
had a counseling ministry with the council for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are continuing our tradition of distinctively Christian, spiritually 
grounded counseling," said Kim, who holds a doctorate in pastoral counseling 
from USC. "And our policy is that of turning no one away who can use our 
service but is unable to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 As head of community relations, Kim will work with the Rev. William C. Scar, 
who arrived from Ohio this week to become director of the center. Scar, a 
Lutheran minister, was the founding director of the Samaritan Counseling Center 
in Cincinnati. He earned a doctorate of ministry in pastoral counseling from 
Lutheran School of Theology in Chicago and is a fellow of the American Assn. of 
Pastoral Counselors. Recently, he was recognized as an approved supervisor by 
the American Assn. for Marriage and Family Therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Scar said the center has consultants in psychiatry, clinical psychology, 
clinical social work and marriage and family counseling.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are not a bunch of pastors doing counseling, and we are not counselors who 
happen to have an overlay of spirituality. Nor are we pastors who happen to 
know something about psychology," Scar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone here is held accountable for the interface of psychiatry, values and 
spirituality. We are so medically grounded that we hope to become the referral 
agency of choice for physicians and attorneys, not to mention pastors, who come 
into contact with the same person over and over again who is not getting well 
-- including cases involving deep pathology and violence, child custody and 
alcoholism." 
</P>
<P>
 Scar said the center is accepting appointments now; fees for the services will 
be based on one's ability to pay. On Thursday, the center will participate in 
National Depression Screening Day, sponsored by the American Psychiatric Assn., 
Harvard Medical School and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The central office is at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, 1350 W. 25th St., San 
Pedro. Satellite offices will be at First United Methodist Church in Lakewood, 
First Baptist Church in Rolling Hills Estates, and Neighborhood Church on the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula. For information, (310) 514-3000.

CONFERENCE TAKES LOOK AT REBUILDING PROBLEMS; DISASTERS: WITH FIRES, FLOODS AND 
EARTHQUAKES, EXPERTS AGREE THAT THE RECOVERY CHALLENGES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
ARE COMPLEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After the Great Fire of London devoured the city in 1666, the government 
issued a simple decree: Stop building with so much wood. It was a direct, 
effective response to disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a UCLA conference Friday on disaster recovery, state and federal 
officials as well as academics and environmentalists agreed that in Southern 
California today, the problems of rebuilding after fires, floods and 
earthquakes are more complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to identify what the problems are," said Paul Flores, deputy 
director of the state's Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it is much harder to find solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the tricky questions: Who should pay for recovery? Should victims be 
allowed to rebuild in hazardous areas, such as mountainsides? And how much of 
what are written off as "acts of God" can be prevented? 
</P>
<P>
 "We usually find out, when all of the damage is tallied up, that God was not 
at all at fault," said Katherine Stone, a Ventura lawyer who represents cities. 
"There is always someone to point the finger at." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those attending the daylong workshop sponsored by the UCLA Extension 
Public Policy Program agreed that while disasters have tragic consequences, 
they are almost always the result of people building in areas where, ideally, 
they should not. 
</P>
<P>
 Such areas include most of Southern California, a region that owes its scenic 
beauty to the unstable geologic faults that run much like spider webs miles 
underground. 
</P>

 "What we humans call disasters are really just part of the natural cycle," 
environmental lawyer D. Dwight Worden said. He and others questioned the wisdom 
of allowing new houses to sprout on charred or collapsed foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you build on the train tracks, you should not complain when the train hits 
you and we should not pay you to rebuild on those same tracks," Worden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one solution suggested by some after last fall's firestorms was for 
local officials to refuse permission to rebuild in areas prone to wildfires or 
landslides. Attractive because of its simplicity in theory, most consider the 
idea unworkable because of its complexity in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners have a Constitutional right to use of their property. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has ruled that if local governments want private property to 
remain undeveloped -- even if that could save lives -- they generally have to 
buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet government often ends up footing at least part of the bill when those same 
property owners are left homeless by natural disaster. Or worse, the government 
gets sued by homeowners angry over being allowed to build in a dangerous spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we are still letting people rebuild is because we have no choice," 
Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth Frank said. "If we don't allow someone to 
rebuild, we get sued. If we allow them to rebuild and they get swept away, we 
get sued." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Between 1989 and 1996, federal taxpayers will shell out roughly $7 million a 
day to bandage the wounds caused by California disasters -- from the Loma 
Prieta to the Northridge earthquakes, according to Federal Emergency Management 
Agency figures, making California the biggest drain on the national disaster 
purse. 
</P>
<P>
 William Ahern, deputy commissioner of the state insurance department, said 
there needs to be a fundamental overhaul of the insurance system to spread 
risks evenly among all residents. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, residents in high-risk fire areas such as the Santa Monica Mountains 
are subsidized by the state Fair Plan program, which provides low-cost 
insurance to residences that private companies refuse to cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now rely on government," Ahern said, calling it "the least rational, most 
political, messy system you can think of. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But spreading the risk further did not rest well with some. Calabasas Planning 
Commissioner David Brown said he resents paying more in taxes and for insurance 
so others can live on slide-prone hillsides with great views. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to focus the risks on the individual," Brown said. "They should not 
pass the risks on to the general public." 
</P>
<P>
 As daunting as rebuilding efforts seem, conference participants said each new 
disaster makes Southern California better prepared for the next. Earthquakes, 
for instance, exercise a sort of "structural Darwinism" by destroying weak and 
old buildings, which can be replaced with newer, more stable ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake problem in California will never go away," said Jim Buika, a 
manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. "But we can get better at 
it and obviously we have."

NURSE WHO JUMPED BAIL IN 1992 IS ARRESTED IN MEXICO; CRIME: SHE HAD BEEN 
INDICTED FOR TAMPERING WITH PATIENTS' INJECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Lomita nurse who claimed that she orchestrated her own arrest to get 
treatment for recurring headaches -- and who then jumped bail in 1992 and fled 
to Mexico -- has been arrested in Puerto Vallarta, the FBI announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lissette Christina Nukida, 35, was arrested Thursday by Mexican authorities, 
the FBI and the United States Marshal's Service almost three years to the day 
after she was indicted by a federal grand jury for tampering with the 
intravenous injections of her patients, FBI Special Agent Charlie J. Parsons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nukida was accused by the grand jury of illegally administering insulin taken 
from a storeroom, causing two patients at the Casa Colina Peninsula 
Rehabilitation Center to suffer accelerated heart rates, increased blood 
pressure and dangerously low levels of blood sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the patients recovered, Nukida was indicted after telling authorities 
that she had contaminated the injections so she could be sent to prison and 
receive treatment for her headaches, FBI agents said. In May, 1992, she was 
released on bail from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles and fled 
before her trial, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nukida was arrested along with her husband, Roger David Brown, 41, whom she 
had married while in jail. Parsons said the couple apparently fled together.

WILSON SIGNS LAW ELIMINATING NEED FOR SOUTH PASADENA TO OK FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson removed another major obstacle to the long-delayed Long Beach 
Freeway extension Friday by signing a bill that eliminates the need for South 
Pasadena to approve the eight-lane highway's passage through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly four decades, the San Gabriel Valley city has refused to approve 
the extension linking the San Bernardino and Foothill freeways because it would 
split its city in half, threaten 1,000 homes and 6,000 trees. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Wilson signed the bill into law Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a move to calm fears of historic preservationists, Wilson said he would 
direct Caltrans "to fully comply with all federal and state statutes, 
regulations and executive orders regarding the consideration of cultural and 
natural resources." There are many historic houses along the route. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation comes two weeks after the California Transportation Commission 
gave final state approval to the project. The Federal Highway Administration 
must still approve the $670-million project before it can go forward.

AUDIT FINDS NO FRAUD IN CHARTER SCHOOL RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An investigation into student attendance reports at the Edutrain Charter 
School found incomplete record-keeping but no evidence of fraud, an audit by 
the Los Angeles Unified School District said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Edutrain, one of 10 charter schools in the district that receive state funds, 
caters to students at risk of dropping out or falling behind.Unlike the other 
charter campuses, Edutrain was not an existing public school but was founded by 
community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 A routine inspection by state and district officials in May found that 
attendance records were poorly organized and appeared to indicate that the 
school was being paid for more students than were enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Dolby, president of the Edutrain board of governors and vice 
chancellor of student affairs at UCLA, said Friday that the source of the 
problem was rapid enrollment increases. A new record-keeping system is being 
implemented, Dolby said.

AIR NATIONAL GUARD UNIT TO GET NEW FIREFIGHTING EQUIPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Air National Guard unit based on the Ventura County coast will 
receive new equipment to fight forest fires under a defense spending bill 
approved this week by both houses of Congress, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Guard wing, which was based for many years at Van Nuys Airport and has 
many San Fernando Valley residents in its ranks, moved several years ago to a 
base near the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
 A defense appropriations bill passed Thursday, which will soon be placed on 
President Clinton's desk for signature, provides about $15 million for new, 
more powerful replacements for the firefighting systems that can be mounted in 
the wing's four-engine C-130 cargo planes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The units pump out fire retardant as the planes pass over brush and forest 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The appropriation was spurred by a bill introduced last year by Rep. Elton 
Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 Air National Guard crews from the Channel Islands base flew nearly 600 
firefighting missions over California, Arizona and Idaho this summer, dropping 
an estimated 1.6-million gallons of fire retardant.

WILSON VETOES BILL TO ALLOW NEW FUNDING METHOD FOR LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second year in a row, Gov. Pete Wilson on Friday vetoed a bill to give 
libraries a new funding mechanism that supporters said was desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, authored by state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), would have 
allowed local officials to levy a benefit assessment on property owners if a 
majority approved it in a local election. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson called the proposal a tax masquerading as a benefit assessment, and 
said it should be subject to the same two-thirds vote requirement as all new 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The money could have been used to keep existing libraries open or build new 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Library supporters statewide were hoping for Wilson's signature on the bill, 
but it was Los Angeles County officials who approached Roberti to ask him to 
carry the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am profoundly disappointed by the governor's veto," Roberti said in a 
statement. "With (libraries) comes not only personal growth, but commercial 
growth as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that Wilson's veto in the end will hurt California's economic 
position, Roberti said, "The net result is that more students will get to spend 
their non-school hours watching TV or playing video games. And we wonder why 
we're not competitive?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although Roberti said he made a number of concessions to concerns Wilson 
voiced in last year's veto, the governor still objected to the bill's basic 
idea -- that having a library in the community is enough to justify making 
property owners pay a special benefit assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Before levying a new benefit assessment, the county needs to win approval of 
only a simple majority of voters. But a new tax requires a "yes" vote of 
two-thirds of the voters.

GOVERNOR REJECTS TAX BREAK BILL FOR EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Governor Pete Wilson on Friday vetoed a bill that would have provided an 
additional tax break to victims of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would have allowed taxpayers to deduct all uninsured quake losses of 
more than $100 from state taxable income. Supporters of the bill said this 
would have provided as much as a 22% state tax cut for some quake victims. 
Currently, such deductions are limited to the amount over 10% of the taxpayer's 
adjusted gross income. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state has already provided tax relief to earthquake victims in the amount 
of $300 million in income tax relief and a substantial amount in property tax 
relief," Wilson said in his veto message. "While I am sympathetic to the 
financial hardship incurred by victims of the earthquake, this bill would offer 
only illusory relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a minimum, this bill is premature, and would excite false expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson earlier this year signed legislation that would allow quake victims to 
deduct losses from their income on tax returns spread out over the next five 
years. The governor also issued executive orders allowing property taxes to be 
assessed on the lower, post-earthquake value of damaged property. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bill vetoed Friday, sponsored by state senator Herschel Rosenthal 
(D-Los Angeles), would have eliminated limits on the amount of losses that 
could be deducted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilson's action is a terrible blow to taxpayers in the San Fernando Valley 
and other areas that have suffered losses as a result of this quake," said 
Rosenthal in a news release issued after the veto. 
</P>
<P>
 The state senator said the veto could affect a vote on a similar federal bill 
now pending. 
</P>
<P>
 "His veto has essentially made it impossible for the federal companion bill to 
pass," Rosenthal said in the release. "Why would a congressman from Minnesota 
care about California when California's own governor doesn't think that this 
tax break is important?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Flynn, an aide to Rosenthal, said the legislator would reintroduce the 
bill next year.

L.A. GROUP ASKS ARGENTINA TO JAIL FORMER NAZI OFFICER; HOLOCAUST: WIESENTHAL 
CENTER OFFICIALS ALSO SEEK SPEEDY EXTRADITION. JEWISH LEADERS MEET WITH 
PRESIDENT MENEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Officials of the Simon Wiesenthal Center asked Argentine President Carlos Saul 
Menem on Friday to jail a former Nazi SS officer who is being held under house 
arrest while he fights extradition to Italy, where he is wanted for war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Erich Priebke, 81, found a haven in Argentina, where he has lived since 1948. 
He has admitted participating in the execution of 335 Italian civilians -- 
including 75 Jews -- in March, 1944, outside Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Priebke was arrested in the mountain resort of Bariloche, 1,000 miles south of 
Buenos Aires, after admitting his role in the Ardeatine Caves massacre during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were found shot in the back of the head, and Priebke confessed to 
shooting two, said Rabbi Daniel Landes, the Wiesenthal Center's national 
education director. 
</P>
<P>
 Priebke's job "was to bind the victims' hands and to check them off as they 
were shot one by one," Landes said. "He also carried out Nazi orders to round 
up Jews in Italy." 
</P>
<P>
 Priebke's "continued freedom mocks the memory of his victims," the Wiesenthal 
Center said in a letter handed to Menem. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Friday, Menem, who is in Los Angeles promoting Argentina 
as an attractive economy for foreign investors, said he had not had an 
opportunity to read the letter from the Jewish leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 He met Friday with 20 representatives from Los Angeles' Jewish community, and 
the Priebke case did not come up during those talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine judicial officials have favorably received Italy's request for 
Priebke's extradition, Menem said, but Priebke's "defense has been delaying the 
case with various claims." 
</P>
<P>
 During a May speech in Bariloche, a town with a large German community, Menem 
reportedly equated extraditing Priebke with a hypothetical extradition of 
former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the extradition of former SS Officer Erich Priebke is being requested on 
the grounds that the Jewish Holocaust was a war crime, so was the sinking of 
the cruiser General Belgrano, and in that case Argentina should request the 
extradition of former British Prime Minister Thatcher," the independent NA news 
agency quoted Menem as saying at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The sinking of the Argentine cruiser during the 10-week Falklands War in 1982 
claimed 323 lives among its crew of 1,093. About 6 million Jews were killed by 
the Nazis during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wiesenthal Center letter to Menem said the organization is "deeply 
concerned by the slow pace of legal efforts" in connection with Italy's request 
to extradite Priebke. 
</P>
<P>
 "The local magistrate has agreed to the defense attorney's request that all 
documents related to Priebke's actions in World War II be first translated into 
Spanish," the letter said. That tactic could take more than a year, according 
to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish leaders applaud the moral leadership Menem has provided, especially in 
the wake of a bombing that killed nearly 100 people at a Buenos Aires Jewish 
community center in July. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech Friday to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, Menem said he had 
told Jewish leaders in Boston, New York and Los Angeles that Argentina is 
"perhaps the only country where, after these attacks, we opened our doors to 
intelligence agencies from other countries." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the American Jewish Committee has said Argentina has the least 
anti-Semitic activity of any country in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are hoping to find those responsible for the Buenos Aires bombing 
as soon as possible, Menem said, "but it is not an easy task." He reminded his 
audience at the Beverly Hilton Hotel that it took 22 years to track down the 
last culprit in the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Menem, whose parents immigrated to Argentina from Syria, was the first 
Argentine president to visit Israel.

CITIES JOIN FORCES TO TACKLE COMMON PROBLEMS WHILE CUTTING COSTS; GOVERNMENT: 
COALITION SEEKS TO GIVE COMMUNITIES MORE CLOUT AND ACCESS TO FUNDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The borders marking city limits in Southeast Los Angeles County symbolize 
municipal pride, independence and a sense of friendly competition to residents. 
But some of those boundaries are beginning to blur as leaders of eight cities 
in the region increasingly cooperate to attack nagging social and economic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of regional collaboration -- combining the resources of individual 
cities to address common concerns, cut costs and improve service to residents 
-- has been proposed in the region for years, but little has come of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, inspired partly by the sluggish economy and years of budget cuts, the 
eight cities are seeking new joint methods to bring jobs, education, 
transportation and safety to the area's estimated 370,000 residents. Their 
efforts follow a national trend, experts say, and may be more comprehensive 
than most. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,500 jobs have been lost in the last year as industry continues to 
trickle out of the region, analysts say. Most of the cities have adopted a 
utility users tax to stabilize budgets rocked by the loss of state funding 
during recent budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the problems are population density, below-average education 
levels -- up to 70% of the adults in the area do not have high school diplomas 
-- and high unemployment, which hovers around 10%, according to a report 
compiled by the office of Assemblywoman Martha M. Escutia (D-Huntington Park). 
</P>
<P>
 Under Escutia's leadership, the cities formed the Southeast Community 
Development Corp. last spring. The coalition unites Bell, Bell Gardens, 
Commerce, Cudahy, Huntington Park, Maywood, South Gate and Vernon under a 
nonprofit umbrella.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the corporation's first proposals is to create a trolley system using 
alternative-fuel vehicles to feed into the Blue Line and Metrolink systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the $500,000 plan, individual cities would pool unused funds from the 
Air Quality Management District and apply to the AQMD for matching funds to pay 
for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD collects money from motor vehicle registration fees and distributes a 
percentage to cities to be used for local transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Because each city's share is based on population, an individual municipality 
may not have enough money to fund its own project.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DEVELOPER'S INSURERS AGREE TO PAY $8.6 MILLION 
TO CONDO GROUP; COURTS: HIDDEN CANYON HOMEOWNERS ASSN. HAD CHARGED BUILDER WITH 
SHODDY CONSTRUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurers for a Calabasas-based developer of a condominium project in the 
Hidden Canyon area of Thousand Oaks will pay $8.6 million to a homeowners 
association to settle a lawsuit charging them with shoddy construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The complicated 4-year-old suit against Griffin Homes and dozens of 
subcontractors was finally settled after an exhaustive three weeks of 
court-ordered mediation sessions, the attorney for the association, Alexander 
Robertson IV, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad it's over, I was looking forward to having it end," said Linda E. 
Meyer, a professor at Pepperdine University School of Law who conducted the 
mediation. "It was emotionally draining for everyone involved." 
</P>
<P>
 A prior mediation attempt about a year ago was unsuccessful, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hidden Canyon Homeowners Assn. originally sought $50 million in damages 
against Griffin Homes, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992, said Robertson. A 
handful of subcontractors were ordered to pay $540,000 to the association last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents contended in the lawsuit that the 648-unit complex was poorly 
constructed and began to deteriorate soon after it was built. They complained 
about leaky roofs, cracked walls and uneven floors. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the bankruptcy protected the Calabasas-based Griffin Homes' assets 
from seizure, the association tried to recoup its losses through the 
developer's insurance company, Robertson said. The insurance companies fiercely 
contested the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their policies contained numerous exclusions for various types of damages," 
said Robertson. "That's the reason for the big difference" between what the 
homeowners originally sought and what they received." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Cohen, an attorney who represented the developer, could not be reached for 
comment Friday on the suit. But he said in a July, 1993, article in The Times 
that he was hoping the matter would be settled out of court. He suggested that 
the subcontractors, and not Griffin Homes, should be held liable. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson has maintained that memos by Griffin Homes to subcontractors show 
that the developer knew about the defects and urged subcontractors to ignore 
them. For example, according to Robertson, one subcontractor notified Griffin 
Homes that the builder had failed to waterproof Sheetrock used in construction, 
which would cause leaks after the walls were covered with stucco. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson said the warning was ignored and the subcontractor was told to 
proceed with the work. 
</P>
<P>
 In another instance, Griffin Homes hired a roofing expert from Texas to 
examine the roof after the developer had made several repairs, according to 
Robertson. The consultant informed Griffin Homes in writing that the roof had 
serious problems that would last for years. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Robertson, homeowners were never told about the consultant's 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit became complicated after Griffin Homes went bankrupt, said Meyer, who 
has a private mediation practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "That made the case more difficult to settle," she said. "You had to first 
show there was a problem and that the problem was covered under" the various 
insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that the number of parties involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were 20 insurance companies at least, that represented the developer 
and the subcontractors," she said. "The developer had four different insurance 
companies, all of whom were making claims that the coverage was not in their 
policy, or that it should be restricted to a particular year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had this case not been settled there would have to have been 300 depositions 
taken," she added. "And the trial would have been four to six months."

MEDFLIES DISCOVERED IN VENTURA COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two female Medflies were discovered Friday morning near a stand of fig trees 
in Camarillo -- the first time trappers have captured the dreaded fruit-gnawing 
insects in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The find alarmed farmers, who fear that a Mediterranean fruit fly infestation 
could devastate the county's $848-million agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few things would scare me as much as this," grower Ken Gerry said. "I'm 
just afraid the Japanese will shut their markets right away." 
</P>
<P>
 The county slapped a quarantine on all fruit within a 4.5-mile radius of the 
Medfly discovery. During the quarantine, county officials will ban the sale or 
shipment of citrus, vegetables and strawberries growing in that district, said 
Libby Ouellette, a member of the county's Medfly task force. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning, county pest experts will begin hand-spraying a potent blend of 
poison and bait on foliage within 200 meters of the discovery site. The spray 
mixes the chemical malathion, which kills adult Medfly, with sweet-smelling 
corn syrup, which lures the insects to the bait. 
</P>
<P>
 But those measures did not reassure farmers who depend on exporting their 
crops. In warm weather, Medflies reproduce amazingly fast, spawning up to eight 
generations in a year.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're not that hard to kill, but the problem is, they're so prolific, they 
reproduce so quickly, that you soon have generations upon generations to kill," 
said David Holden, an agricultural consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 After intensive spraying over 500 square miles of Southern California, pest 
experts believed that they had eradicated the Medfly in 1990. But a year later, 
the insect reappeared in parts of Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 To battle the pests, officials released millions of sterile Medflies, hoping 
that they would mate with fertile females. Officials also sprayed malathion 
over parts of Riverside County this year, blanketing the cities of Corona and 
Norco despite community outcry.

KENNEDY FOILED BY PAT MISS; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: GRANADA HILLS TURNS BACK CITY 
RIVAL ON KEY BLOCK AND FOURTH-QUARTER TOUCHDOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Down a point to arch-rival Granada Hills High with three-and-a-half minutes to 
go, Kennedy quarterback Dan McMullen wore an anguished expression as he stared 
at the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get me the ball, just get me the ball," McMullen pleaded in a whisper. But 
the Highlanders had no intention of giving McMullen another shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Embarking on a 10-play drive that ate up the game's final five minutes, 
Granada Hills and quarterback Brian MacLean hung on to defeat the Golden 
Cougars, 7-6, in a Northwest Valley Conference opener Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy (2-2) scored the game's first points on a 16-yard pass from McMullen 
to Aaron Lewis with five minutes to play in the third quarter, but Robert 
Cervantes' extra-point attempt was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that it was all Cervantes' fault. The exchange between center and holder 
was slow and a slew of Highlander defenders swarmed in, engulfing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Six minutes later, facing third and 10 from the Kennedy 32, MacLean faked a 
handoff, drifted right, and lofted a floating touchdown pass down the middle of 
the field to tight end Jason Ascencio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was only supposed to be a five-yard route, but (Ascencio) was covered and 
I thought if I rolled out, he'd get open," MacLean said. "Right when I threw it 
I knew it was a TD." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan De Jong's extra-point try sailed over the bar for the winning margin 
with 11 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars gave Cervantes a chance at redemption by driving to the Granada 
Hills six-yard line with five minutes to play, but the kicker's 22-yard attempt 
was wide right. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders (2-2) ran out the clock by running four quarterback sneaks in 
their final 10 plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense knew I was coming," MacLean said. "But I thought we had the game 
in the bag as long as I held on to the ball every time." 
</P>
<P>
 MacLean completed 10 of 20 passes for 165 yards and the Highlander touchdown. 
Ascencio had four receptions for 76 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Eric Richardson paced the ground attack with 55 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kennedy, McMullen completed 11 of 22 passes for 150 yards and a touchdown 
with an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy tailback Antwane Smith rushed for 125 yards in 31 carries.

CRESPI DUSTED BY NOTRE DAME; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: KNIGHTS BREAK 17-17 TIE WITH 
CELTS BY SCORING 17 CONSECUTIVE POINTS IN THIRD QUARTER.

 Notre Dame High exploded for 17 points in the third quarter to break open a 
seesaw contest and defeat Crespi, 34-24, in a nonleague game Friday night at 
Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior quarterback Ryan Bowne, who completed 17 of 29 passes for 187 yards, 
drove the Knights to a field goal and a pair of touchdowns after an exciting 
first half that ended with the score tied, 17-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame (4-0) went ahead to stay on a 46-yard field goal by Chris Sailer. 
On the next play from scrimmage, Troy Garner intercepted a pass by Crespi's 
Dave Lins at the Crespi 33-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Crespi's only turnover, but Bowne made the Celts pay. Six plays later, 
he rolled right and hit tight end Andy Breman with a five-yard touchdown pass 
to give the Knights a 10-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights' third drive of the second half, an eight-play, 58-yard march, 
culminated with a one-yard touchdown run by John Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were moving the ball all night, but we really weren't clicking until the 
third quarter," Bowne said. "Our receivers ran perfect routes." 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame's defense, coming off a 38-0 victory over Glendale, gave ground but 
held when it had to. Crespi (2-2) outgained Notre Dame, 393 yards to 282. Lins 
completed 19 of 43 for 278 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Lins tossed a 16-yard touchdown pass to Marcos Solorzano early in the fourth 
quarter to close the gap to 34-24. But Lins was sacked three times and spent 
the final minutes playing with one shoulder pad exposed from his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi drove 67 yards on the game's opening possession and took a 7-0 lead on 
Jamian Barbour's 19-yard run. Notre Dame pulled even on the ensuing kickoff, 
which Steve Lee returned 80 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame went ahead, 14-7, with a 12-play, 69-yard drive that ended with 
Garcia diving one yard for a touchdown early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two minutes later, Barbour broke off tackle and ran 52 yards for a touchdown 
to pull Crespi even, 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour led all ballcarriers with 113 yards in 14 carries. Garcia led Notre 
Dame with 54 yards in 20 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams engineered lengthy drives in the final minutes of the half that 
resulted in field goals. Sailer's 31-yarder gave Notre Dame a 17-14 lead. 
Crespi's Greg Boskin connected from 25 yards to tie the game, 17-17, with two 
minutes left.

NORTHRIDGE GOES DOWN FIGHTING IN 2-0 FRACAS; SOCCER: MATADORS ARE BRUISED, 
BEATEN AND ELBOWED ASIDE IN LOSING THEIR SECOND CONSECUTIVE HOME GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The bullies are no more. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge, a soccer team that used to beat up just about any 
opponent who dared venture into North Campus Stadium, no longer reigns as king 
of its own turf. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors not only lost, 2-0, to the University of San Diego on Friday 
night, they were roundly beaten up in the process. When it was over, two 
Northridge players were bleeding from gashes in their faces and another was 
gingerly cradling his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Fright night, fight night. 
</P>
<P>
 Marwan Ass'ad, Northridge's coach, complained bitterly afterward that San 
Diego's Toreros, like UC Irvine players before them in a 3-2 Northridge defeat, 
battered their Matador counterparts with elbows. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence, Ass'ad needed only to point in the direction of defender Ross 
Linhart, his face splattered in red from a cut on his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 By the match's 80th minute, Matador forward Keith West had taken enough. He 
squared off against San Diego's Stephen Shipley and both players traded blows. 
Ditto about 30 seconds later, for Northridge's Anthony Carrillo and San Diego's 
Emile Wakim. 
</P>
<P>
 All four players were given red cards and ejected. Linhart followed about 
three minutes later after being called for tripping. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge ended the game with eight players -- the minimum allowed. San Diego 
had only a one-player advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 But by then the match had long since been decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillermo Jara scored for San Diego 25 minutes into the match, driving a shot 
from 18 yards over the outstretched arms of Northridge goalie Mark Macdonald. 
The Toreros (5-3) added an insurance goal in the 60th minute when Shipley 
kicked in a rebound after Macdonald blocked his first try. 
</P>
<P>
 "We blink twice and they score twice," Ass'ad said. "When you make mistakes 
against a good team, it can cost you the game, and today it did." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (5-3), was shut out for the second time this season, although the 
Matadors outshot the Toreros, 10-6, and had plenty of chances. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego defender Jimmy Wang thwarted Northridge's best chance with a 
tremendous individual effort in the match's 57th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 With Torero goalie Tom Tate out of position, West lofted a perfect pass in 
front of the goal, but Keith Rosenberg's header was body-blocked by Wang. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took some good shots," Ass'ad said. "We're playing better. We need to be 
sharper and more consistent. I'm not down at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, he would seem to have reason to be. In its final nonconference 
tuneup next Tuesday against Loyola Marymount, Northridge will be without the 
three players given red cards. West might be out much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 He was led away from the fracas in pain and favoring his right shoulder. 
Ass'ad said the injury appeared to be either a dislocation or break.

</P>
<P>
 Playing its first Northwest Valley Conference game Friday night since moving 
from the Valley Pac-8 Conference, Birmingham showed it could hold its own by 
taking defending conference champion Taft to the wire before falling, 17-15. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first loss of the season for the Braves (3-1, 0-1 in conference 
play). 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids played a strong game against a strong team," Birmingham Coach 
Chick Epstein said. "Heck, they played great." 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein's resurgent squad had a chance to tie the game late in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior running back Courtney Blunt scored on a 13-yard sprint around left end 
on a fourth-down-and-inches play, pulling the Braves to within two points with 
2 minutes 34 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But Birmingham went to Blunt once too often. He was tackled behind the line of 
scrimmage on a two-point conversion try. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft (3-1, 1-0) recovered an onside kick and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 And though Birmingham took solace in a narrow defeat to a talented team, Taft 
players and coaches were not pleased with their performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the worst game we've played in the three years I've been here," 
running back Jerry Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Troy Starr offered a terse assessment: "We played poorly. We were 
fortunate to win this ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 They did, after all, have Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham had just pulled to within 10-7 in the third quarter, on a 67-yard 
touchdown pass from Paul Prince to receiver Jason Howard, who caught seven 
passes for 138 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the next play from scrimmage, Brown took a handoff and swept right, 
outracing two Birmingham defenders to the sideline, then turned upfield and 
slipped three arm tackles while dancing up the sideline for an 82-yard 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were getting close so I knew I had to come up with a big play," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown missed part of the first half because of breathing difficulties, which 
he and a team doctor attributed to dehydration. However, he finished with some 
healthy numbers: 181 yards in 21 carries.

GROUNDED WESTLAKE WINS, 28-7; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: WARRIORS TAKE AIR OUT OF 
THE BALL AND DEFLATE THOUSAND OAKS IN MARMONTE OPENER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Far be it for the Westlake High football team to be inflexible. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors, with All-American receiver Billy Miller, have a reputation as a 
passing team, but they ran their way to a 28-7 Marmonte League victory over 
Thousand Oaks on Friday night at Thousand Oaks High. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior fullback Craig Walendy led the way with 139 yards and two touchdowns in 
15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had this offense all the time," Walendy said. "It's just the brains of 
(Coach Jim) Benkert. He knows how to beat teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, though, he just figured out how to beat Thousand Oaks. The 
Warriors, who share a home stadium with the Lancers, had not beaten their 
crosstown rivals since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 As the final seconds ticked off the clock, Westlake players doused Benkert in 
ice water. 
</P>
<P>
 Benkert said he planned to use more of a running game than the Warriors (3-1, 
1-0) have in the past, particularly after last week's 20-7 setback to Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just felt like the last few weeks, people had really tried to take away 
our passing lanes," he said. "So we had to put our ears back and run the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake gained 218 yards on the ground. Quarterback Scott Spruill, who won 
the starting job from Brian Shubin, completed five of eight passes for 78 
yards. Miller caught three passes for 31 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Jackson gained 36 yards in nine carries and Scott McEwan completed 
four of five passes for 32 yards for Thousand Oaks (1-3, 0-1), which had only 
109 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Lancers took a 7-0 lead in the first quarter when Bill Sperry 
scored on a 15-yard pass from McEwan on a fourth-and-four play. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake came right back, tying the game on a two-yard run by Jamal Harris. 
Westlake took the lead on a one-yard run by Walendy with 8 minutes 44 seconds 
to play in the first half. Holder Mike Leibin took a bad snap on the 
extra-point attempt and ran it in for a two-point conversion, giving Westlake a 
15-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Walendy added a nine-yard scoring run and Jason Victor scored from eight 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was delayed about 15 minutes in the final quarter when Thousand Oaks 
running back Mike Thomas was carried off the field with a hip injury.

a nonleague game Friday at Canyon High. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart (4-0) trailed in the first quarter, 14-7, before the Indians scored 49 
unanswered points.Palmdale (0-4) took its early lead on a pair of touchdown 
passes from quarterback Johnny Gillespie to Jamel White.

MARQUEZ HAS HAT TRICK, SYLMAR WINS EASILY, 29-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Monroe High Coach Fred Cuccia, whose under-manned team lost a Valley Pac-8 
Conference opener to Sylmar, 29-0, boldly made two predictions before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuccia's first prognostication -- that his Vikings would not get a first down 
-- was wrong.They had two. 
</P>
<P>
 But his second prediction -- that Sylmar would win the City Section 4-A 
Division title -- could turn out to be a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Spartan quarterback Greg Marquez threw three first-half touchdown passes and 
the Sylmar defense earned its second consecutive shutout. Marquez, who 
completed six of eight passes for 86 yards, threw scoring passes of 19, 21 and 
14 yards as Sylmar coasted to a 21-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans (4-0 overall, 1-0 in the conference), despite losing tailback 
Durell Price in the second quarter with a strained left knee, were equally 
adept on the ground, finishing with 252 yards in 33 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our success down the road depends on us being more balanced and not letting 
teams key on certain guys," Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, who finished with 65 yards in eight carries and is expected to play 
next week against Canoga Park, was kept out of the second half because of 
convenience, not necessity. He was replaced by Gerrod Taylor (nine carries, 75 
yards) and Tyrone Morgan (five carries, 44 yards, one touchdown).

MONTCLAIR PREP PLAYERS SUSPENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRYAN RODGERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Montclair Prep Principal Vernon Simpson kept his word and suspended five 
football players for Friday's game against Kilpatrick. Akil Anderson, Demetrius 
Green, Kenny Peffer, Simone Shouhead and Langston Woodberry did not suit up for 
the Mounties' 26-14 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The players were suspended for allegedly rough-housing a junior varsity player 
on the school bus after practice. Simpson said he received an anonymous letter 
about the situation. Coach George Giannini punished the players by making them 
run laps, but faculty members at the Van Nuys campus expressed concern that the 
punishment was too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of at least two suspended players have stated that the suspensions 
were racially motivated. Of the five players suspended, three are black and two 
are white. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm offended about the implication that this had anything to do with race," 
Simpson said. "This was an equal-opportunity benching."

22-20, in a Valley Pac-8 Conference opener Friday night at Van Nuys.

McPherson, filling in for Reed, gained 46 yards in 16 carries.

interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys opened the scoring on quarterback Chris Byfield's three-yard run, and 
increased its lead to 15-0 when Byfield tossed a 31-yard scoring pass to 
Gilbert Casillas. McPherson ran for the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 After North Hollywood closed to 15-12 in the third period, Byfield connected 
with Casillas on a 10-yard pass for a 22-12 lead.

OAK PARK TAKES CONTROL OF NORDHOFF WITH ALLEN AND DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nordhoff High running back Josh Hawkins was one of the most-feared rushers in 
the area. Oak Park running back Ryan Johnson in three games had established 
himself as the new kid on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Would Johnson upstage Hawkins in Friday's game at Oak Park? Or would the Hawk 
show the Eagles how to fly? 
</P>
<P>
 Neither. Oak Park's 17-10 nonleague victory was all about defense and 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins, who finished with 130 yards in 26 carries, was held to 30 yards in 11 
carries in the second half. Johnson, who had both Eagle touchdowns and 112 
yards in 16 carries, wasn't as important to Oak Park (4-0) on this night as 
quarterback Ron Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen completed only seven of 15 passes for 77 yards, but most completions 
resulted in first downs in key situations. He rushed six times for 63 yards -- 
including bursts of 20 and 26 yards on option plays -- and kept Nordhoff (3-1) 
from keying on Johnson. He accounted for 140 of Oak Park's 282 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't seem like they were worried about me," Allen said. "On the option, 
they were keying on Johnson. Let everybody key on him." 
</P>
<P>
 With Hawkins getting stuffed at the line, Nordhoff quarterback Mike Gardia 
tried to rally his team from a 17-7 deficit in the fourth quarter. He completed 
five of his final six passes, but couldn't put his team into the end zone. 
Brian Farrar kicked a 28-yard field goal with 1:17 left, after he was short on 
a 25-yard attempt in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardia, who completed eight of 18 passes for 111 yards with one interception, 
missed on his first six passes. Many were overthrown or underthrown to open 
receivers. He also rushed three times for minus-38 yards. A bad snap from 
center cost him 26 yards on third down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just making my reads wrong," Gardia said. "I had good time, but I was 
rushing myself and I wasn't hitting it. I'm just glad my coaches kept their 
confidence in me." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson scored the first touchdown on a 21-yard run over left tackle in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff retaliated with Hawkins. He rushed on eight of 10 plays, gaining 50 
of 65 yards on the Rangers' next possession and tied the score with a two-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 A 34-yard field goal by Josh Nicassio gave the Eagles a 10-7 lead at halftime. 
They scored again in the third quarter on a two-yard run by Johnson.

ANTELOPE VALLEY HAS HISTORY ON ITS SIDE AGAINST LOYOLA; FOOTBALL: ANTELOPES 
UPSET THE CUBS A YEAR AGO AND HOPE FOR SIMILAR RESULT TONIGHT AT GLENDALE HIGH. 
</P>

<P>
 The Antelope Valley High football team hopes recent history repeats itself 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third week of the season last year, the Antelopes suffered their first 
loss, falling to Bakersfield, then ranked No. 3 in the state. The next week, 
Antelope Valley rebounded to defeat Loyola, ranked sixth in the state, 15-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Antelope Valley lost to Bakersfield, again ranked third in the 
state, 35-13, and must face eighth-ranked Loyola in a nonleague game at 7:30 
tonight at Glendale High. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley had been ranked 16th in the state before the Bakersfield game, 
but dropped out of the latest poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (3-0) posted an impressive 28-0 victory over previously unbeaten Saugus 
last week. Quarterback Kyle Speilbuhler completed 11 of 13 passes for 194 yards 
and three touchdowns against the Centurions. 
</P>
<P>
 Speilbuhler has completed 27 of 41 passes for 409 yards and four touchdowns. 
Dan Farmer has 13 receptions for 229 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Ellison leads the Cub running game with 234 yards in 32 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to play great for all four quarters if we want a chance 
to win," Antelope Valley Coach Brent Newcomb said. "We got a little break last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Antelope Valley was held to minus-six yards in the first half 
before scoring two fourth-quarter touchdowns to defeat Loyola for the first 
time in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Before allowing five touchdowns against Bakersfield, Antelope Valley (2-1) had 
not yielded a point in victories over Hesperia, 8-0, and West Bakersfield, 
14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Jermaine Lewis leads Antelope Valley with 217 yards in 46 carries. In 
last year's game, Lewis gained 108 yards in 20 carries, including a 62-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley quarterback Trymon Redick, who has been hampered by a finger 
injury, has completed four of 13 passes for 139 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 In other 7:30 games tonight, Bishop Diego plays Santa Clara at Channel Islands 
High, Orange Lutheran plays Village Christian at Kennedy High, St. Genevieve 
and Murphy play at Jackie Robinson Stadium, and Bell-Jeff is at La Salle.

THOMAS FINDS THE OPEN FIELD; RECORD-SETTING CAL LUTHERAN TAILBACK DASHES PAST A 
SERIES OF OBSTACLES, FINALLY GAINING A STARTING POSITION AS A SENIOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terrence Thomas is at Cal Lutheran football practice, sprinting up to 
obstacles, bouncing off or slide-stepping around them. Legs churning, direction 
changing, Thomas darts away from one, only to hit another. Finally, he reaches 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 For Thomas, the drill seems symbolic of the past seven years of his football 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond every obstacle, another looms: 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' opportunity to play college football immediately after high school is 
pulled away at the last minute because of academic red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Bang.  
</P>
<P>
 He travels 3,000 miles to a strange junior college, only to find himself stuck 
on the bench, behind one of the top runners in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop . 
</P>
<P>
 A Division I college finally offers him a scholarship and playing time, but 
after he arrives, the school produces neither. 
</P>
<P>
 Smack.  
</P>
<P>
 After he spends a season as a redshirt, the school drops football. 
</P>
<P>
 Whack.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally finding a home at Division III, Thomas becomes the No. 1 tailback and 
goes on a record-setting yardage binge in the first two weeks of his senior 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Touchdown.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've just been unfortunate," Thomas said. "Something always happens. I always 
bounce back, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas has finally performed the way he always thought he could. After two 
games, he has rushed for 349 yards, leading the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. He broke the Cal Lutheran single-game 
record last week with 224 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 His speed and strength make him equally dangerous to bust over the middle for 
a first down or to take the ball on a sweep and turn the corner. He will make 
his 1994 Mt. Clef Stadium debut today, when the Kingsmen play Occidental at 1 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But at 24, Thomas is facing the final season of his football career, unless he 
can overcome the biggest obstacle of all -- being a 5-foot-9 Division III 
tailback -- and achieve his dream of playing pro football. 
</P>
<P>
 A long shot? Yes. But not out of the question, said Cal Lutheran running back 
coach John Burton. At Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Burton coached Louis Jackson, 
who played for the New York Giants in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terrence can be in there somewhere," Burton said. "If someone was willing to 
give him a chance, he's got something there." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' talent was unappreciated by just about everyone but himself until this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 A star tailback at Brunswick High in southeast Georgia in 1987, Thomas was set 
to play at Southwest Georgia. The obstacle in this case was the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test. Thomas finally scored high enough to gain admittance to the NAIA 
school, but by that time the registration deadline had passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas figured he could sit out a year and enroll at Southwest Georgia, but 
the school dropped football the following season. 
</P>
<P>
 He seemed destined for a life of working as a clerk at the post office and 
moving furniture. He spent two years after his 1988 high school graduation 
working, sometimes up to 13 hours a day. In whatever free time he had, he went 
to his old high school to work out, in hopes that he might play football again. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I didn't think I would have another chance to play," he said, "but 
when James (Williams, a former teammate) called and told me about Moorpark, I 
started getting excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was an assistant coach at Moorpark College when he called his friend 
on the other side of the continent and convinced him that a college football 
opportunity awaited him on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who hadn't played a down of football in nearly three years, arrived at 
Moorpark for the 1990 season, but Freddy Bradley was there. Bradley, one of the 
best junior college backs ever to play in California, left few carries for 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, with Bradley gone, Thomas had nagging knee injuries and gained 382 
yards in 69 -- respectable, not eye-popping. But he was still courted by Cal 
State Fullerton. Coaches there promised Thomas a scholarship and plenty of 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played with me," he said. "They told me they were going to give me a 
scholarship, but at the last minute, they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was bitter because I thought you should be up front with me and be a man 
and let me know what's going on, not pull me with a string." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was redshirted at Fullerton in 1992, but more disappointment was on the 
way. After the season, Fullerton dropped football. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like everything was going wrong for me," Thomas said. "I was always at 
the point to be the top man and something always happened." 
</P>
<P>
 So Thomas returned to school at Moorpark. After a few months, Moorpark coaches 
tried to interest Thomas and Cal Lutheran coaches in each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Cal Lutheran) was a small school," Thomas said, "but it was a chance to be a 
big fish in a small pond." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas played sparingly in his first season at Cal Lutheran. Although there 
were no dominant running backs ahead of him, he carried only 53 times for 151 
yards. He had trouble picking up the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being from the South, he's a little more laid back and he learns a little 
different than everyone else," Burton said. "You have to deal with that. On 
Monday and Tuesday he may not understand stuff, but by Thursday or Friday he'll 
be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the offense has sunken in now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting to see the manifestation of his ability," Cal Lutheran Coach 
Joe Harper said. "A year ago it was there, but there was always something 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 In his first game this season, and second start at Cal Lutheran, Thomas gained 
125 yards in just three quarters. He came out because of a sore elbow, or 
because of two fumbles, depending on whom you ask. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week against San Diego, Thomas had no such problems. He broke three 
runs of more than 40 yards on his way to his record-setting effort. The 
single-season record is also well within Thomas' reach. Because Cal Lutheran 
was a passing team for so many years, the Kingsmen have produced only one 
1,000-yard rusher -- Hank Bauer gained 1,024 in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, though, Cal Lutheran has a new quarterback and a batch of new 
receivers, meaning Thomas is the most dependable weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terrence is almost the most-steady fixture we have and he's only been in the 
program for two years," Burton said. "It's almost like God put him here to be 
in the right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally.
