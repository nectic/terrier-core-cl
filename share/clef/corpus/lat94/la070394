 Remember when man went to the moon? You may have missed it. Lots of us did. 
The summer of 1969 was tipped steeply toward the future, and for those of us 
who were certain that the U.S. empire was in its final days, who were making 
sandwiches for the radical underground or packing our bags for the back-country 
communes, and for millions of the less alienated as well, Neil Armstrong's 
first step onto another world seemed, already, ancient history. A couple of 
white guys on the moon? A flag held out with wire? It was more artifact than 
harbinger, and to prove it, there was the voice of the trickster himself, 
Richard Nixon, looping back through space, congratulating himself on behalf of 
all humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought then that the Moon deserved better. I think today that Apollo 
deserved better. 
</P>
<P>
 As Andrew Chaikin points out in "A Man on the Moon," "Apollo was the last 
great act this country played out of optimism, if looking forward to the 
future." But the America that Kennedy pointed toward the moon in 1961 was not 
the America that arrived there in 1969. It had been shattered and transformed 
by youth revolt and racial conflict. The irony of Apollo was that its 
achievement spanned one of the century's pivotal decades and was overshadowed 
by another of humanity's watershed triumphs: Vietnam, the first decisive 
military victory of a Third World people over a neocolonial superpower. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this was the fault of Apollo, which was one of the great voyages in 
human history, and we are nothing if not a voyaging species. Together with the 
Russians (for the cosmonauts provided the stimulus of competition, even if they 
turned out to have been only shadowboxing with the Moon), Apollo yanked the 
world from suborbital to off-planet flight, recapitulating aviation's dizzying 
half-century of progress in less than a decade. And did it, let it be said, 
with grace and style and even a certain uncharacteristic (for America, and for 
science) humility. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't have to turn out that way. Apollo was a compromise from the start, a 
hybrid of Nazi rocketry, Cold War competition, L.B.J. pork-barrel politics and 
Kennedy glamour (with the astronauts as runway models). Yet it succeeded so 
magnificently because it had unique strengths. The Russians failed 
organizationally, not scientifically, with competing agencies fighting behind a 
wall of secrecy. NASA, by contrast not only with the Russians but with our own 
growing secretiveness, operated in the daylight with an extraordinary clarity 
of purpose and willingness to experiment. Perhaps most fortunate, NASA was 
independent of the military. By the time NASA become a proper, calcified, 
hypocritical, full-blown bureaucracy, Apollo was history and the footprints 
were on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercury/Gemini/Apollo is one story, and a story that has been told many times, 
by journalists and historians and hacks, by astronauts such as Frank Borman, 
Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin, and by belles-lettres luminaries such as 
Norman Mailer, Tom Wolfe and even James Michener, who made of space a sort of 
sub-subzero South Pacific. It was to be expected that the 25th anniversary of 
Apollo 11 this summer would produce a fresh new spate of books. And I am 
pleased to note that one of them, Andrew Chaikin's "A Man on the Moon," is more 
than worthy of its grand subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaikin's eight years of labor and hundreds of hours of interviews have 
yielded what will surely be considered the authoritative history of Apollo. A 
second newcomer, "Deke!," ranks with Michael Collins' earlier "Carrying the 
Fire" as one of the most vivid personal accounts. And a third, "Moon Shot," 
falls back and burns in the atmosphere, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 All three books claim to tell the inside, the untold, the secret story of 
Apollo. But the real secret of Apollo is that there were no secrets. (Indeed, 
one wonders if we would have made it to the moon on Kennedy's schedule -- 
"before this decade is out" -- if the Russians had been as open, and we had 
known how far behind they were.) There are details, trivia, personal glimpses 
(such as astronaut Pete Conrad's bet with Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci as 
to what his first words on the moon would be), but there are no shocking 
revelations. Perhaps that is appropriate, for unlike the poles or the upper 
Amazon, the Moon was an explorers' goal everyone had already seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaikin's book belongs to that new breed of personalized history perhaps best 
exemplified by the late Randy Shilts ("And the Band Played On") or James Gleick 
("Chaos: Making a New Science") in which the scientific or political adventure 
is seen through the lens of personality. Chaikin lets the astronauts "take us" 
through the program and to the moon, but he doesn't slight the less-known 
characters (some with peculiarly American names such as Chuck Berry, Tom Paine 
and Christopher Columbus Kraft) who built and ran NASA. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially memorable here are the geologists: Lee Silver, who took the 
astronauts on field trips to the Orocopia Mountains and taught them to collect 
rocks, and Farouk el-Baz ("Have we run out of geologists in this country?" 
asked Alan Shepard), who taught the command module pilots to not only look at 
but see the lunar terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 While authoritative, Chaikin's book is anything but dry. Through the 
astronauts' own eyes we see the luminous plains and dark escarpments; we feel 
the thrill, and the letdown as well ("It's kind of like the song: Is that all 
there is?" astronaut Al Bean mused). And we never lose touch with the fear that 
is a pilot's most trusted companion, especially so far from home. Every time a 
ship gets ready to lift off the moon, or even just to change orbits, the 
unspoken question rises, unbidden: "Is it going to light?" 
</P>
<P>
 And as we already know, it lights, every time. Apollo was blessed with that 
essential of the explorer, luck. Even the bad luck turned good. The fatal 
Apollo I fire forced a redesign of the capsule that couldn't have happened if 
the fire had occurred off the pad. The explosion (another electrical fire) on 
Apollo 13 happened at the right time, and with the right commander, Jim Lovell, 
a veteran who had already been once around the Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaikin's "A Man on the Moon" starts with the Apollo I fire that claimed Roger 
Chaffee, Ed White and the man who might have been the first to walk on the 
moon, Gus Grissom, and ends with the Apollo 17 astronauts' disgust at Nixon's 
on-the-air dismissal of further space travel (" . . . this may be the last time 
in this century that men will walk on the moon"). "Moon Shot" covers more 
ground, from the Mercury and Gemini programs through the Apollo-Soyuz linkups, 
and it looks promising, as it's (ostensibly, at least) written by two of the 
top astronauts, Deke Slayton and Alan Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepard, who was the only one of the original "Mercury Seven" to make it to 
the moon, combines in one person the high and low points of the program. 
Landing on the moon with Apollo 14, he steps out, looks up at the earth and, 
surprising himself, weeps like a child; or rather, like a man. The next day he 
trivializes the whole experience by swatting a golf ball out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepard and Slayton, who was chief astronaut and also one of the Mercury 
Seven, were genuine "right-stuff" guys. Just cautious enough, they knew how far 
you could push hardware; they knew teamwork; and they knew how to fly. They 
have a story to tell, but unfortunately their book reads as if it had been 
cobbled together out of first drafts of press releases. Here's Armstrong during 
the Moon landing: "(He) gripped the hand controller in his fist, firm and 
strong, with a touch honed by years of flight in jets and rockets." A 
description of air combat: "The sword play of flashing wings and howling 
engines in the thin, cold air of a high-altitude struggle where man met man." 
And then: "The year 1967 rolled in like a political garbage truck with its 
wheels on fire." Only those who have seen a political garbage truck with 
burning wheels, rolling, can appreciate just how precise that image is. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pity, but when all the books are telling essentially the same story, 
the telling is all. The hype, the hysteria and the sentimentality studiously 
avoided in the Chaikin book seems to have all ended up in "Moon Shot," which 
spins out of control on almost every page. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Apollo was the quintessential team enterprise, there were a few 
individuals who seem irreplaceable: James Webb, who ran interference with 
Congress; Wernher von Braun, who hit London with the V-2 and was convinced that 
his Saturn could do the same for the moon; George Low, who rushed the schedule 
to make Apollo Eight the first manned circumlunar flight (the Russians had done 
it, but the astronaut was a turtle). 
</P>
<P>
 The thing about astronauts is that they all can fly. The only one of them who 
seems essential to the success of Apollo is the one who never made it to the 
moon. It was one of the great fortunes of Apollo that Deke Slayton was grounded 
with a heart irregularity, for in "Father Slayton" NASA had a man who could set 
the rotations, pick the terms and make the decisions the astronauts wouldn't 
have accepted from a bureaucrat or a scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 If "A Man on the Moon" is the authoritative masterpiece, "Deke!" is the book I 
read in one gulp. Slayton, who knew he was dying of cancer when he started 
writing, was fortunate to find as a collaborator Michael Cassutt, a respected 
science-fiction author good enough to make himself transparent. "Deke!" reaches 
back the farthest of any of the books -- into Slayton's days as a 19-year-old 
flying B-25s over Monte Cassino. If Slayton sometimes scants the personal, he's 
intimate about the hardware in every area of his life. He discusses with 
affection and loathing not only the Saturn and the lunar landing module, but 
the F-100, the C-47, a creaky military transport and the Studebaker Light Six 
(which didn't have the V-8's weak valves). 
</P>
<P>
 Slayton was with NASA for 20 years, and finally made it into orbit as part of 
a Russian-American team. He is generous but candid about what happened to our 
space program after Apollo. When the shuttle blew up, he understood 
immediately: "The solid rocket motors simply weren't designed to be launched 
with ice hanging off them." He rates Jim Webb, the first administrator, as the 
best, and he left when the Reagan Administration replaced him. 
</P>
<P>
 Slayton never retired. Instead of going for one of the corporate board 
positions routinely tendered to astronauts, he characteristically ended his 
days playing with rockets, as head of a private company trying to launch (among 
other things) human remains into orbit. He died a year ago, the most 
down-to-earth man who ever went into space. 
</P>
<P>
 One closes these books with regret. Humankind may yet have a future in space, 
but the earth-tethered shuttle program isn't it. Mars calls, but no one is 
answering. It's as if Columbus, instead of returning to the "new world," had 
settled for harbor cruises. As astronaut Stuart Roosa puts it, "Apollo was our 
unfinished obelisk. It's like we started building this beautiful thing and then 
we quit." Neither America nor Russia could do it today. The blueprints for the 
F-1 engines are lost, and if you want to see the business end of a Saturn 
rocket, you have to look into a mirror at the Air and Space Museum, for even 
that giant hall can only hold half. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to watch a Saturn V lift off, and hear the roar as the heavens 
split open, and feel the earth shake as it slings a man toward the moon -- 
well, it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
 You missed it.

NOONAN IN PURSUIT OF HERSELF; LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, BY 
PEGGY NOONAN (RANDOM HOUSE: $ 23 ; 255 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Peter Haldeman, Peter Haldeman is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In case you'd filed the name away with Strategic Defense Initiative and floppy 
bow ties for women, Peggy Noonan is the one who morphed from news producer for 
Dan Rather to speech writer for Ronald Reagan and documented her reincarnation 
in the rosily titled "What I Saw at the Revolution." (Her political memoir 
earned Noonan tags like "poet laureate of resurgent Republicanism.") The 
post-revolutionary years find Peggy Noonan back in New York City, free-lancing 
for Mirabella and Vanity Fair, dispensing right-wing wisdom on the 
McNeil-Lehrer News Hour, and completing another ambitious-sounding memoir, 
"Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness." 
</P>
<P>
 If memoir is the word. Chronologically, "Life" picks up where "What I Saw" 
left off. Formally and thematically, it swerves into less familiar territory. 
The first book concerned serving the cause; the second details a life, as 
Noonan has it, "on pause." Where "What I Saw" was personal and chatty, "Life" 
is philosophical and kind of talky. "Life" begins in a hair salon "high above 
the avenues of Manhattan"; a shampoo and the sound of traffic below prompt the 
following reverie: "Prosperity and mobility: these have changed our time, 
changed our country and lives so completely and dramatically, and the funny 
thing is we all know it, but I don't think we've ever fully absorbed it. . . . 
There is Old America and New America, and, you know, I miss the hungry years. 
Okay, now, we're all done ." This last line belongs to the hair washer. 
</P>
<P>
 If this volume has a dominant mood, it's nostalgia. Noonan writes, as she 
says, from "an inescapably political perspective," and it is, in every sense, 
conservative. She riffs engagingly on the culture clashes she inevitably 
experiences as a citizen of New York -- on coping with her 6-year-old son's 
paranoia about marine mammals dying at the hands of capitalist polluters, for 
instance, or coping with a reelection rally for mayor David Dinkins: "I'd 
planned to stand in back but there was no back, so I stood up front, twenty 
feet from the stage. Gloria Steinem spoke and said, 'Look behind you -- behind 
you is a revolutionary brother,' and even these people looked around and 
laughed: Hey lady, behind me is probably a pickpocket." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime and taxes continue to erode the "liberal era"; ever since we were 
deceived by George Bush's lips, Noonan concedes, the revolution hasn't been 
what it was, either. The middle portion of "Life" zeros in on Washington. 
Noonan spends a good portion of 1991 shuttling down to the beltway to help 
jump-start Bush's reelection campaign, but her efforts ultimately fizzle. She 
discerns an inertia in the White House, a lot of squabbling and a dangerous 
laxity, as evidenced by the president's inability to get a cup of tea promptly 
delivered -- forget about a White House car. There's also the problem of the 
vision thing: "They kept saying, 'You'll be in charge of the message.' I kept 
saying, 'But what is the message?' " The problem, by Noonan's reckoning, 
outlasts the Administration: "Clinton seems to have a general philosophy -- a 
kind of emotional liberalism. But the particulars aren't there." 
</P>
<P>
 Noonan sizes up the '96 Republican hopefuls -- none of whom fire her up quite 
the way the Great Communicator did, and apparently still does. Without making a 
direct appearance, her former boss casts a Rushmore-size shadow across these 
pages. Very casually, in bites and throwaways, she manages to relieve Ronald 
Reagan of any responsibility for his term's darker aspects: Iran-Contra 
"delegitimized" not the presidency but the television networks, which created 
the clamor for the hostage release. A brief exegesis on "what is called the 
homeless situation" cleverly concludes: "This is where thirty years of urban 
liberalism have gotten us: in New York dogs can't (defecate) on the sidewalks 
but people can." While she envisions a socially moderate Republican succeeding 
Clinton, Noonan's personal sympathies appear to square with the tougher talk 
out of Atlanta two years ago: Hollywood is poisoning the culture, homosexual 
"lifestyles" shouldn't be "espoused" in schools -- oh, and it's time we stop 
applauding single mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of her firm family values, one might reasonably expect some 
discussion regarding the circumstances of Noonan's own single motherhood, but 
fathers don't figure in this telling. "If there is any revolution" in her 
second book, Noonan writes, "it is one that is happening within me" -- a 
reference to the author's rediscovery of her Catholic faith, which forms the 
focus of "Life's" final section. Odd, then, that this is the less intimate 
work. The voice is confiding, but the confidences, where they occur, usually 
concern others. A "knower of the people in the columns" now, Noonan always 
seems to be sitting next to someone in Washington (Clarence Thomas, Pamela 
Harriman), in New York (Barry Diller, Donald Trump) and probably in between. 
We're privy to Trump's analysis of his dinner date's anatomy, to the sympathy 
Katherine Graham feels for Barbra Streisand (all those pesky autograph 
hounds!). "Success for me," Noonan discloses, "has been, essentially, getting 
invited to things I don't want to go to but like saying I went to." Got it. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet . . . the invitations begin to pale: "I found I wasn't drawn to and 
charmed by experience anymore -- at least the kind of experience that is being 
at the party, the convention, in the hot air balloon." She consults a former 
Jesuit priest. She prays and attends Mass during the week and convenes with 
friends to study the Bible. "Bible-study groups," Noonan advises, "are where 
the real ecumenism is happening in America." Possibly, but as she describes it, 
there's something less than inclusive about Noonan's spiritual awakening. 
Consider her response to a friend's account of a religious retreat with a 
well-known Indian guru: "Maybe the good thing about ashrams and all this is it 
can make clear to you that God is the destination. Then you go home and sit 
down and figure, this is a good destination but I think I'll take another 
route. I think I'll go by that church down the block and get a road map." 
</P>
<P>
 In "What I Saw at the Revolution" Noonan convincingly characterized her 
political rebirth as a response to hypocrisies she perceived within the 
anti-war movement. Her disaffection with boomer-style cafe society is also 
understandable; but this time around her convert's zeal is less becoming. 
Inescapably, political perspectives have their limitations. They probably serve 
speech writers well, and revolutionaries of all stripes, but from our poets 
laureate, whatever their persuasions, we expect more encompassing visions.

THEY WERE ONLY CHILDREN; THE VIOLENCE RECOUNTED IN AN ARKANSAS STUDENT'S MEMOIR 
IS AN EYE-OPENER; WARRIORS DON'T CRY: A SEARING MEMOIR OF THE BATTLE TO 
INTEGRATE LITTLE ROCK'S CENTRAL HIGH, BY MELBA PATTILLO BEALS (POCKET BOOKS: 
$22; 312 PP.)  
</P>

<BYLINE>

By Jervey Tervalon, Jervey Tervalon is the author of Understand This, a novel 
set in South-Central L.A. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the first day of class in the fall of 1957, in Little Rock, Ark., a mob 
bent on preventing nine black students from entering Central High School chased 
the new students to the principal's office. There the children heard their life 
being debated between two sheriffs: 
</P>
<P>
 "What are we gonna do about the nigger children?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowd is moving fast. They've broken the barricades. These kids are 
trapped in here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Good lord, you're right," another voice said. "We may have to let the mob 
have one of these kids so we can distract them long enough to get the others 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let one of those kids hang? How's that gonna look? Niggers or not, they're 
children and we got a job to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the kids were saved and lived to fear for their lives for the 
duration of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Melba Pattillo Beals' memoir of integrating Little Rock's Central High School, 
"Warriors Don't Cry," is a painful but important document that shows how 
difficult the path of racial integration has been for this country and, more 
important, how high the price has been for families in the vanguard of the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The memoir starts with Melba's return to Central High after a 30-year absence 
to be reunited with her fellow Little Rock warriors of integration as honored 
guests of then-Gov. Bill Clinton. The bitter memories of her year at Central 
High hadn't been numbed even after years of progress on the racial front. 
</P>
<P>
 But how could they be numbed? What Beals had experienced as a child was one 
step from ethnic cleansing. It seemed that what kept her and her fellow black 
students from being lynched that very first day of classes at Central High was 
sheer luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the yearlong nightmare of integrating Central High commenced, life 
in Little Rock was far from a picnic for the black community. Beals had a 
healthy fear of whites and of the harm that was often inflicted on her family 
and community by them. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I was 3 years old I was already so afraid of white people that 
when my red-haired, white-skinned cousin came to baby-sit, I hid beneath 
mother's bed." And though Beals' childhood is filled with such memories, she 
and her family show Gandhi-like resilience and self-control in the face of 
vicious, racist treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The comparison to Gandhi is more than coincidence. Beals' grandmother, India, 
is a follower of Gandhi's teachings and impressed upon her granddaughter the 
importance and need for personal sacrifice to accomplish even modest social 
change; this willingness to sacrifice is a major theme of the book. Beals is in 
every sense a nonviolent warrior of integration. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the 10th day, their nonstop torture made me feel as if I were losing my 
mind. I had to keep telling myself what Grandma said: I couldn't lose my mind 
because God is my mind. Still, I imagined I had one of those machine guns 
television gangsters use. I would fire round after round . . . to clear my 
thoughts. I would have to do more prayer for them and for me. I know guns were 
forbidden even in my thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly at times it seems as if Beals was more frightened of disappointing her 
grandmother than of the wrath of the racists of Little Rock. Interestingly 
enough, though the grandmother encouraged Beals to follow Gandhi's example, she 
herself slept nights by the front window, shotgun in hand, ready to defend her 
sleeping family from midnight marauders. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the love of her grandma and mother, the lack of support from her 
father is hardly felt. It also helps that Melba Beals' mother is a teacher and 
makes enough of a salary so that when the girl's father runs in to voice his 
disapproval of the integration effort (and disappears again), it has no 
apparent affect on the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the backing of Beals' family and as much encouragement and logistic 
support as she receives from the NAACP and the churches, it is astonishing that 
the mother and grandmother would consent to send their daughter to such a 
hellish year at Central High. As the book is constructed, vivid first-person 
recollections of torture and diary entries of a young girl tested to a degree 
no adult should be, it stands on its own, a testament to sacrifice and 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet I want to know more. I want to know exactly what the mother and 
grandmother were thinking. Were they willing to lose their child for racial 
progress? Even years after having weathered what must have been one of the 
worst experiences of her life, Beals still admits to being influenced by what 
happened at Central High. When she married, she chose a white military man -- a 
protector who, she says, seems much like Johnny Black, the soldier from the 
101st Airborne, her bodyguard who made those first few months bearable. When 
Johnny Black was called away, it almost broke her spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the memoir she presents a surprising bit of information. One 
white student, Link, took it upon himself to protect her and save her from 
further pain at the hands of his classmates; he may even have saved her life. 
He did these acts grudgingly, however, and Beals was so uncertain of his 
motivations that she feared he was plotting to betray her. Only years later did 
she understand him: 
</P>
<P>
 "Until my marriage, I had been hearing from my old friend Link, living in 
faraway places as he piled up awards and degrees. . . . He was livid about my 
marriage, saying I'd all along told him we couldn't date because he was white, 
and now look what I'd gone and done. I never heard from him again." I was 
surprised to be told only as a kind of afterthought that Link was romantically 
interested in her. 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, I wanted more self-reflection from Beals: more than the four- or 
five-page summation of the rest of her life, less of the daily account of the 
cruelty inflicted upon her. It's as though Beals felt the impact of the events 
after that hellish year weren't worth exploring at greater length. But even so, 
her memoir is a compelling and memorable one. I am amazed at what she endured 
and sacrificed to further integration and the cause of civil rights.

OH FOR A LITTLE DESPAIR; TRY, BY DENNIS COOPER (GROVE ATLANTIC: $20; 288 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Cunningham, Michael Cunningham is the author of the novel, A Home at 
the End of the World (a Farrar, Straus & Giroux/Bantam paperback). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Jean Genet and Paul Bowles could have had a child together, he might have 
grown up to be a writer like Dennis Cooper. I've learned not to push Cooper's 
work on just anybody, but if a friend seems even halfway receptive I usually 
prepare him or her by saying something like, "Cooper is appalling, but so is 
the modern world." I go on to remind him or her that "Lolita" was generally 
considered perverse to the point of dangerousness when it first appeared. As 
was "Madame Bovary." 
</P>
<P>
 "Try," Dennis Cooper's third novel, is the story of a ravaged, omnisexual 
16-year-old named Ziggy and his hopeless romance with Calhoun, a straight 
heroin addict who, in his own words, "hates all emotion." The book traces their 
impossible love through a world so fried bydrugs and brutality that a feeling 
as concrete as despair would be a relief. "Try" is a true original, full of 
perversely moving moments and a bleaker-than-bleak, strangely comic vision. It 
may be some kind of screwed-up American classic. 
</P>
<P>
 In his grungy L.A. loft, Calhoun floats above emotions on an icy little cloud 
of heroin. Ziggy, stuck in the suburbs, crackles with emotions so electric and 
unpredictable he can scarcely stand upright. As a "hyper-active, hard-to-place 
two- year-old" he was adopted by Roger and Brice, two gay men making a "stab at 
heterosexual-style bliss." The bliss thinned out quickly, Roger moved to New 
York, and Brice started molesting Ziggy the year Ziggy turned 8. Now Roger has 
decided it's his turn with Ziggy. He flies back to Los Angeles from New York 
with sedatives and a pair of skin-tight Lycra bikini shorts for his adopted 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziggy copes as best he can by fixating on Calhoun, by sleeping with a kind and 
pretty rich girl named Nicole, and by insisting that every new atrocity 
practiced on him is good material for his homemade magazine, "I Apologize: A 
Magazine for the Sexually Abused." To sidestep the avalanches of terror and 
self-hatred that periodically overwhelm him, he writes up his tales of abuse -- 
sometimes as they're happening -- with avid detachment. He's like a journalist 
blandly reporting his own murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Calhoun, roughly equally damaged, depends on Ziggy's devotion but will not, 
can not, respond. For Calhoun, an actual emotion would be too ragged and harsh. 
It's better to shoot up and drift away. He's ostensibly writing a novel, which 
appears only as a spectral presence on his laptop, "that glimmering rectangular 
blueness, that spooky night light." The laptop is always turned on but never, 
ever, used. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Cooper has been charting this bleached, nervous terrain for almost a 
decade and a half now. His novels, stories and poetry work and rework a few 
essentials -- the word themes is probably too mild. The word obsessions may 
even be too mild. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cooper's fictional world, love and torture are so closely related as to be 
nearly indistinguishable. Emotional connection is too difficult, so Cooper's 
characters invade their loved ones' bodies in search of the fundamental human 
essence that's getting blocked on every other channel. Cooper's lust objects 
tend to be young boys, and I mean young boys. By age 10 or so, they're viable. 
By 16 or 17, they're over the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Try" is Cooper's least horrifying novel, and it may also be his best. In his 
last novel, "Frisk," a character fantasized about torturing a little boy in 
such salacious detail that I remember thinking, as I read it: "This is a 
fascinating book, and when I'm finished reading it, I don't want it in the 
house." Cooper is a scary guy, and reading him doesn't feel particularly safe. 
One moment you feel as if you're in the company of a significant artist who 
doesn't flinch over the numbed violence of our lives right now. The next moment 
you feel like a kid who's hitched a ride with John Wayne Gacy. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Try," Cooper lightens up a little without sacrificing any of his edge, 
though anyone who reads "Try" without knowing the larger body of Cooper's work 
may be hard pressed to imagine that it involves a "lightening up" of any kind. 
In Cooperland, when a 13-year-old overdoses, the man he's been sleeping with 
doesn't call the hospital; he calls the gentleman who'll pay top dollar for a 
few hours alone with the corpse. At least in "Try" he closes the bedroom door. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's fiction bridges a gap between the behavior chronicled in Literature 
with a capital L and the behavior chronicled in the juicier newspapers, the 
ones that keep us informed about serial murders and fetishes that end in death. 
Cooper is important because he aims his flashlight beam toward the darkest 
places; he's frightening because he admits to having an appetite for whatever 
he finds there. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's voice is full of a zoned-out adolescent poetry, at once brimming with 
emotion and reticent about showing any emotion at all. He's Mr. Cool -- grand 
passions are for geeks. The most he'll allow his characters is scraps of 
intimacy and a vaguely apologetic devotion to highly diluted beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 There are times when Cooper's vision feels as grimly, impenetrably romantic as 
an adolescent's, and subject to adolescent limitations. Even as a fan I've 
found myself growing impatient with a world so resolutely centered on the 
young, white and miserable. It can feel like a cramped little universe, more 
generously filled with morbid curiosities than actual truths. It can be hard to 
remember that this is the same planet and species that produced Tolstoy, 
Dickens, Garcia Marquez, Toni Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Try," however, Cooper expands his range. Women (well, girls) appear for 
the first time as sympathetic characters and as objects of desire. Love exists 
beyond the worship of the flesh, and some kind of grubby, compromised 
redemption might even be possible. The limitations imposed on the characters in 
"Try" are not wholly different from the limitations of the culture in general, 
in that soaring emotions aren't all that easy to maintain in the face of 
assorted addictions, endless violence and a sorrow so large it doesn't really 
have a name. After reading "Try" you might feel, at least for a while, that 
almost every other contemporary American novel is a little forced and 
melodramatic, full of wishful thinking rather than hard human facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper is an important and highly idiosyncratic writer, with a nose for some 
of the least presentable living odors. In "Try" he has produced a harrowing, 
intricately accomplished work of art. It should be read. It might even endure, 
if that doesn't sound too geeky.

RICHARD EDER: WILD SOLUTIONS FOR WOMEN'S ILLS; ANIMAL ACTS, BY RHODA LERMAN 
(HENRY HOLT: $22.50; 263 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Rhoda Lerman's beleaguered fable, the worst possible outcome for Beauty 
would be for her Beast to turn into a Prince. Beasts -- in this case a great 
ape -- are infinitely preferable. 
</P>
<P>
 Lerman's specialty is wild solutions for women, mostly for demonstrating the 
wilderness of the problem. She is like nobody else in the United States. She 
has some kinship with the English writers Fay Weldon and the late Angela Carter 
-- closer to the lush extravagance of the latter than to the tauter devices of 
the former, although all three are conceptual tear-aways. 
</P>
<P>
 Lerman's last novel, "God's Ear," was an unbelted transcontinental rampage, in 
the course of which the only solution for her incandescent and wonderfully 
insatiable Jewish heroine was to effect the impossible and become a Hasidic 
rabbi. In "Animal Acts," another unbounded woman, less wonderful, bursts the 
male order by deserting her rich, kind husband and her ruthless, sexy lover to 
take off with a gorilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich and kind is repressive; so is ruthless and sexy -- when either pair 
modifies the noun man. Linda, Lerman's protagonist, reaches this conclusion in 
the course of her eventful flight from Long Island to Florida in a truck 
specially fitted with a cage, air-conditioning, sandwiches for her, cabbages 
for him and -- as precaution -- Mace, a box of tranquilized Reese's 
Peanut-Butter Cups and air freshener. Her philosophy, worked out in 
hallucinatory bits along the way, goes as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 "Woman" is the template for the human species; men are hybrids. They are 
half-woman and half-ape, but not a noble ape like the gorilla. Their 
demi-progenitor is the murderous, chattering, neurotic chimpanzee. Women fall 
for the human (i.e., feminine) half, as well as for the sheer sex; only to find 
themselves torn up by the animal half's chatter and murderousness. Stop messing 
with an unsoundly bred hybrid, the conclusion goes: Stick with the gorilla, 
lovable despite his limitations and a dangerousness that isn't mean, at least. 
</P>
<P>
 Now this is far-fetched but so, in terms of simply getting from one side of a 
circus tent to the other, is a high wire strung 40 feet above ground. In fact, 
it sets up a fine philosophical rigging for Lerman's acrobatics. At the start, 
for example, she hoists us some way up in the air by dedicating her novel to 
eight women who own or train gorillas. We are displaced; the ground sways 
below. Can she be serious? 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty with "Animal Acts" is not the high wire. It is that the feats 
performed on it are awkward; not up to those of "God's Ear," for example. They 
start off very well indeed; midway they run out of steam, and by the end the 
extravagant action declines, as in many chase movies, into dutifulness; and the 
acrobatic philosophy settles into sedentary talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda's wavering, fitful voice pitches us right into her seasick life with 
Steven, one of those modern investors who own nothing but only parts of things: 
discount stores, one-third interest in a yacht, a half-interest in an airplane, 
and time-shares at half a dozen glamorous sites. Their life on Long Island is 
lavish and mild; he is actively indulgent and passively possessive. He frets 
when she goes for walks at night; he is picky about small items such as her 
failure to put the can opener away where it belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Each fall she leaves him to go to Ireland, ostensibly to paint. In fact, she 
joins her lover, John: handsome, sexually adroit and with a playful British 
charm. He is also a professional killer attached to naval intelligence. And he 
shares Steven's domestic obsession. "Where is my can opener?" he demands; it is 
the male territorial howl and it freezes a woman's spirit. Linda's life is 
apportioned between two cages on opposite sides of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 When Steven tells her he has invested in a Coney Island gorilla act, she takes 
their third-best car and runs away to check it out. As she watches, the 
gorilla, named Moses, kills his inexperienced keeper when he makes a sudden 
wrong move. Linda persuades Moses back into his cage -- a precarious empathy 
has set in -- and takes him to the animal agency that rented him out. The 
proprietor, an Isaac Bashevis Singer character, half-sage, half-crook, 
persuades her to drive Moses to Florida before the authorities catch him. She 
will turn him over to an associate and bring back the money. It will give her a 
week, after all, to think about her marriage. "Listen, maidele ," the old man 
says as he sits drinking milk with Moses. "The gorilla is what he is. Be afraid 
of your husband." 
</P>
<P>
 Up to this point, when Linda's and Moses' wanderings begin, "Animal Acts" 
keeps us at a high pitch. We are trying to figure out a protagonist whose 
unexpectedness and kaleidoscopic glitter in telling about herself offer a 
challenge to our minds, a sense of suspense and considerable delight. The 
journey begins well and then wears down. 
</P>
<P>
 Not for want of action: Linda drives the truck to an offshore Georgia island 
resort. She gets into fights with Moses, who hurts her moderately and frightens 
her to tears. She never feels degraded, though, and they lie together in 
cuddles with vaguely sexual overtones. A gang of locals shoots up the truck. An 
apparently helpful Greek cafe owner warns her that someone is after her; he 
gets her a pilot to fly her off the island with Moses, while a friend hauls the 
truck on a barge to a Florida rendezvous. There is sexual pressure, betrayal, a 
trap and an escape. 
</P>
<P>
 All the men are treacherous except for one who is gay. In a series of wild 
chases, changes and reversals, he helps her and Moses vanish into an uncertain 
future. The faster the pace goes, though, the more Linda bogs down. (Moses is 
an exemplary, brilliantly portrayed gorilla throughout.) Lerman has her engage 
in long, hallucinatory arguments with Steven and John who are, respectively, 
coldly hostile and menacingly solicitous. Needless to say, the two men join 
forces to put her down; at the end they conclude that she has simply lost her 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe she has; Lerman leaves open the possibility that Linda's adventures are 
themselves imaginary. That does not really matter; what does matter is that her 
arguments, soliloquies and anthropomorphic romancing -- at one point she 
imagines dancing with her dog, embarrassingly named Diggety -- seem 
interminable. The comparing of men and gorillas to the former's disadvantage 
recurs and recurs. The more Linda talks, the more indistinct she becomes. After 
a while, it is not elaboration but the kind of watery swelling that trauma 
produces in an articulation.

THE BRAIN AND THE HEART; THE SHADOW OF THE PANTHER: HUEY NEWTON AND THE PRICE 
OF BLACK POWER IN AMERICA, BY HUGH PEARSON (ADDISON-WESLEY: $24; 432 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leon Forrest, Leon Forrest is chair of African-American Studies at 
Northwestern University. His latest works are Divine Days, a novel, and a 
collection of essays entitled Relocations of the Spirit. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An African American man draped out in Black Panther regalia, seated upon a 
wicker chair, with a spear in one hand, and an animal pelt upon the floor: this 
is the classic, flamboyant, self-assured image by which most of us remember 
Black Panther leader Huey Newton. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Hugh Pearson's keenly observed, often brilliant, Panther-busting book, 
"The Shadow of the Panther," the party founder gets stripped bare of his 
accouterments. Pictured here as something of a "nuditas criminalis," Newton is 
revealed as a bestial, pagan-punk, who committed not only crimes against the 
state, but more troubling, crafted miscarriages of the trust his followers had 
invested in a dream of the mercurial Huey, as their spiritual and secular 
savior. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially these true believers might appear before our eyes, in their stark 
political innocence, as thousands of trusting, naked children, in a group shot, 
upon a huge rug, captured for a photographer's gallery of Americana, circa 
1970. Yet according to Pearson's analysis, the rank and file really was "made 
up of a cross section of young African Americans, some who were law abiding and 
sincerely interested in being of value to the black community, others who had 
no qualms about breaking the law if it could be rationalized as a revolutionary 
activity, and still others who were just plain ruthless and criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's not unfair to say that each of the multiple personalities that 
Pearson finds in Huey (so much like the Huey Long that Newton was named for) 
spoke for a kind of character drawn to his movement; it was a movement, in 
other words, led by Huey Newton's divided soul. 
</P>
<P>
 A man without a central inner core, a wayward wunderkind , full of adolescent 
extremes and fascinations, spoiled and cruel, Newton's character prowled within 
the shadow of large demons worthy of a Dostoevskyan character -- a Stavrogin, 
for example. 
</P>
<P>
 His ideas showed that the same Newton who organized clandestine hit squads to 
engage in wanton murder could lay out strategies as considerate and legitimate 
as those of our best political and economic consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 Hellbent on destroying himself, Newton also seemed determined to plunge the 
Panthers into the tumultuous flames of his own self-conjured financial 
destruction. He fed his "severe cocaine and alcohol addictions," Pearson shows, 
by siphoning off "much of the funds earmarked for the very Panther programs 
designed to benefit poor African-Americans -- the free health clinics, the free 
breakfast programs for children, and the free school," in order to support his 
habit. Newton hustled prostitution rings for money, savagely beat a fortune 
teller for dealing in Tarot cards, as she hovered over his future. Apparently 
Newton's rampant chauvinism set the tone for the Panther's treatment of women 
as mere playthings: often brutalized, and never equals, in an organization that 
stood for equality. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson, nevertheless, portrays the Panther's rise as an understandable 
reaction against the white chauvinism that had been embedded in Oakland's power 
structure for nearly half a century. Born and bred in racist Oakland, the 
Panthers also came to awareness during the years immediately following World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during the early years of the war that A. Philip Randolph, president of 
the Brotherhood of the Sleeping Porters, headed up protests against 
discrimination in defense industries that led President Roosevelt to issue 
executive order 8802, outlawing racial discrimination by any wartime industry 
receiving federal contracts. Randolph had cracked Roosevelt's initial 
resistance to opening up jobs for the war effort to blacks by dent of a threat 
to bring hundreds of thousands of blacks to Washington D.C. "for a great march 
designed to embarrass the nation that claimed to be preparing for war to make 
the world safe for democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 After Roosevelt issued his executive order, a flood of about 50,000 black 
migrants from Louisiana, Arkansas and East Texas, traveling on the trains the 
porters worked on, came to the Bay Area's shipyards to construct Navy 
destroyers and other vessels. Among those migrants would be a man named Walter 
Newton, who would scout for work before sending for his family, including a 
little boy named Huey. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to suppress the dreams of social justice that grew out of this new 
black working class's semblance of economic stability, Oakland's white power 
structure looked south for role models of white supremacy, and police-styled 
vengeance against African Americans. As Pearson shows us, it was at this time 
that "Oakland police recruiters traveled to the American south and recruited 
whites to join the police force to keep the Negroes 'in line.' " The hatred of 
the blacks uprising only grew during Newton's maturing years. One searing 
example of white cop corruption reveals the specter of their loathing for 
blacks, and the conditions that helped fire Huey and others into would-be 
revolutionaries: 
</P>
<P>
 One evening a dramatic spectacle occurred on an Oakland freeway when a black 
police officer from San Francisco was chased by two white Oakland police 
officers. One of them pulled a gun and started firing at him. The reason? The 
two Oakland police officers thought the officer from San Francisco was trying 
to interfere with the prostitutes they were running (this was an activity the 
individual officers allegedly ran, not the Oakland police department itself). 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, once Newton and the ego-maniacal Eldridge Soul on Ice Cleaver, 
were no longer in the Panther's local power loop, the remnant of the Panthers 
bent on solid routes to progress developed important voter registration 
campaigns. Lionel Wilson's election as Oakland's first African American mayor 
can be attributed in large measure to the hard-driving voter recruitment 
efforts energized by the more solid branch members of the Panthers, in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 At the opposite end of the black uplift spectrum, the Nation of Islam offered 
real programs devoted to retraining the lost and dishonored within the African 
American community that nobody in the black nor white Bourgeois cared about. 
The Panthers may have claimed a love for people, "all power to the people," 
Stokley Carmichael of SNCC may have coined the phrase concerning his "undying 
love for black people," but it was the Muslims who attempted to match racial 
devotion with action, in a set of far reaching elevation programs, designed 
for, ironically enough, "the least of these." Indeed, the Panthers one 
successful program was a kind of Muslim-style version of mom-and-pop self-help 
variety -- the breakfast program for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 And for all of their failures, and male chauvinism, the Nation of Islam at 
least attempted to retrain the large criminal element within their 
proselytizing sphere or fishing expeditions for lost/found souls. The Panthers 
played up to the criminal element within the community, as the vanguard of 
revolution, saw no need to redeem them, but (like the White Weathermen) 
celebrated their outlawry as the underpinnings for the consciousness raising 
necessary to the revolution; thereby unleashing and legitimizing a renegade, 
undisciplined criminal element within the black community, as the way to go in 
order to express one's manhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle cry from the young, fiercely courageous freedom fighters had been 
"Have you been to jail?" in peaceful protest confronting a racist legal system, 
putting your body on the line, and using soul-force, the Panthers saw their 
main-line of criminal recruits as wearing a red badge of courage for being 
prisoners, no matter the charge . . . for blacks were prisoners within an evil 
state the argument ran. Pearson offers a penetrating overview in terms of the 
lawless license the Party and Newton, as architect, operated from: 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning of the party, Newton was working out a deal with the black 
criminal elements of Oakland, couching the deal in revolutionary rhetoric -- 
quid pro quo, the Panthers were saying. We'll undermine the police, making it 
easier for you to engage in your criminal activities, in exchange for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Philosophically Newton saw exploitation as fundamental to the constitution of 
contemporary black consciousness, and that a collusion with the criminal 
element was incremental to his design for fostering the Panthers and creating 
the overthrow of an evil system. Of the Party's genesis Newton wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "Black consciousness had generally reached the point where a man felt guilty 
about exploiting the black community. However, if his daily activities for 
survival could be integrated with actions that undermined the established 
order, he felt good about it. In order to survive, they still had to sell their 
hot goods. But at the same time they would pass some of their cash on to us. 
That way, ripping off became more than just an individual thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson estimates that there were 30 black militant groups involved in the 
Black Power effort and that Carmichael made the Bay Area one of his main stops, 
"before militant groups, as he pursued SNCC's policy of seeding new 
organizations to cry on the work SNCC had started." Because they saw themselves 
as the most courageous and militant of the Civil Rights groups, and closer to 
the spirit of the younger, more militant African Americans, Carmichael and 
other SNCC members attempted to forge allegiances with the true fire-brand 
brothers within the Panther party; but soon enough, according to Pearson and 
his informants, the SNCC members in New York City realized that these Panthers 
were a new breed of cat. Mae Jackson remembers: 
</P>
<P>
 "SNCC people could go up against an entire town of Ku Klux Klanners, but they 
didn't have that 'nigga I'm gonna kick yo ass' about them, the way the Panthers 
did. In the beginning I think SNCC thought: We'll be the brain and they'll be 
the heart. And maybe the Panthers thought we'll be the heart and they'll be the 
brain except when you deal with a lot of street people they always have another 
agenda. It's like not only will I be the heart, but one day I'll take over the 
brain." 
</P>
<P>
 According to his afterword, Pearson himself was instructed by his research 
into the Panther movement. His discovery of the duplicity and brutality within 
the group was something of a revelation for the younger author. He has achieved 
a fine degree of detachment and analysis over his materials. Pearson provides 
us with something of a cautionary tale about leadership and radical movements.

 Overture! Curtain! Lights!  
</P>
<P>
 This is it, the night of nights . 
</P>
<P>
 No more rehearsing or nursing a part . 
</P>
<P>
 We know every part by heart . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If you know every part by heart of this signature song from "The Bugs Bunny 
Show," you're not alone. Fans of "Looney Tunes" characters tune in not only 
every day, but nearly all day long to Bugs & Co. in some form or other. One 
early-morning a local news reporter recently confessed on the air that he gets 
dressed to "Looney Tunes" at 4:30 a.m. before hopping down to the newsroom for 
his daily on-air duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looney Tunes" lovers pour more than a billion dollars annually into retail 
products bearing the likenesses of that cwazy wabbit and his wascally pals. The 
"Merrie Melodies" makers may not have blanketed popular culture quite as much 
as Mickey and Donald, but the Looney legion of small-screen fans continues to 
expand. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though there've been few new "Looney Tunes" in the last quarter-century, 
the classic Warner Bros. animated cartoon shorts have been on television 
nonstop since 1955. And their smart-alecky antics, propelled by the late Mel 
Blanc's ingenious voice characterizations, consistently rate high -- usually 
No. 1 on Saturdays or as the top-faring kid show -- for the stations or 
networks that air them.

 The "Looney Tunes" have appeared on every network, in syndication and on 
cable, and are available on video and laser disc. And they've spawned a new 
generation called "Tiny Toon Adventures" from a new generation of animators 
who've come up with younger counterparts to Bugs, Elmer, Porky, Tweety, 
Sylvester et al. 
</P>
<P>
 Their enduring popularity seems assured among the 32.5 million youngsters who 
reportedly tune in weekly to shows that charmed their parents and grandparents 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now into the fourth generation of people becoming familiar with the 
characters," observes David Stewart, a professor of marketing and specialist in 
consumer psychology at USC. "Parents encourage their child to become familiar 
and watch." All of this means that "every five years or so you have a new 
generation of children who discover the shows, which have this universal 
appeal," Stewart adds. "There's always this new and developing audience." 
</P>
<P>
 "Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies" -- the titles have been virtually 
interchangeable -- were originally produced as theatrical shorts in the 1930s, 
when cartoons were staples between double bills. Creators made sure the humor 
worked on two levels, so that older and younger viewers would enjoy them, notes 
Kathleen Helppie, vice president of production and administration of Warner 
Bros. animation. And that helps keep them popular today. 
</P>
<P>
 The five primary, and legendary, "Looney Tunes" directors -- Friz Freleng, 
Chuck Jones, Tex Avery, Bob Clampett and Bob McKimson -- each helped develop 
the classic toons various defining characteristics during their 38 years of 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Warner's cartoons began playing in theaters in 1930, the first 
"Looney" star didn't emerge until 1935, when the self-conscious stuttering 
Porky Pig popped up on screen. He was followed by con man Daffy Duck in 1937; 
"wabbit" hunter Elmer J. Fudd and the unflappable Bugs Bunny in 1940; cute 
little Tweety Bird in 1942; that unscrupulous cat Sylvester, egomaniacal 
rooster Foghorn Leghorn and suave skunk Pepe Le Pew in 1945; the Road (Beep, 
Beep) Runner and Wile E. Coyote in 1949, and clever mouse Speedy Gonzales in 
1953. 
</P>
<P>
 After first appearing in 1954 and in only six of the more than 1,000 classic 
cartoons, that hungry whirling dervish Tazmanian Devil -- Taz to those in the 
know -- now looks like Mr. Popularity. "He's really taken off and his 
merchandise is equally popular with the other characters'," says Warner 
spokeswoman Cynthia Lieberman. The new "Taz-Mania" airs Saturday mornings on 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Bugs is still the most beloved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the characters, Bugs Bunny is clearly No. 1," concurs Peter Starrett, 
president of the Warner Bros. Studio stores. "I think he's viewed as the leader 
of the 'Looney Tunes.' He's the icon. He's the character everybody would like 
to be. He's smart, he's savvy, he manages to get out of every problem situation 
he's in and, above all, he's really funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Bugs' appeal and that of his cronies keeps audiences watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all have true human foibles," Warner's Helppie notes. "And they react in 
ways that you yourself wish you could in similar situations." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Looney Tunes" populace are not just a lump of characters: Each has his 
own personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all very well defined and it's easy for kids to figure out who's 
who," Stewart points out. "That breeds familiarity." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a comfort level, he adds. "That familiarity with personalities is simple 
to deal with. You sort of know the plot -- that Elmer will try to get Bugs and 
Bugs will get away. But there's always something different than the last time. 
There's a plot for them to think up enough variations to make the next cartoon 
interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Kids readily confirm those observations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day I try to get home in time to watch," says Jason Climaco, 7, of 
Carson. "Bugs is best. He does funny things to Elmer who tries to catch him. 
Bugs is smart and makes me laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Lucero, 5, of Mar Vista, is drawn to the toons daily, too. "I love it 
when Sylvester tries to catch Tweety and then he does dumb things. It's funny 
when Bugs and Daffy are chased by Elmer. They get away funny." 
</P>
<P>
 That chase is appealing, as morning and afternoon viewer Shelby Gonzales, 4, 
of Moreno Valley attests: "The Road Runner makes me laugh when the Coyote goes 
after him and he gets away and things go 'Boom! Boom!' " 
</P>
<P>
 And no matter how many times they get away, the chase will begin again, and 
again, with the next cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The beginnings of television's phenomenal "Looney Tunes" audience -- Warner 
researchers estimate that 37.7 million people see a classic toon weekly -- 
began with the characters' first small-screen appearance in 1955, when Warner, 
which didn't anticipate video, sold a portion of the cartoons to PRM Inc. 
(later owned by United Artists, then MGM/UA and, finally, Turner Entertainment 
Co.). 
</P>
<P>
 Those two sets of cartoons, now referred to as the "Warner Bros. package" and 
the "Turner package," are what keep popping up as you click the remote. The 
680-plus Warner Bros. toons are seen on ABC, Fox and Nickelodeon. Nearly all 
are seen in rotation. In Los Angeles, Turner's 450 or so cartoons, all 
pre-1948, air on TNT, TBS, WGN, KVEA and the Cartoon Network. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, with the cost of animation spiraling, Warner Bros. Animation stopped 
making all but the occasional "Looney Tunes" cartoon special. But when 
necessary now, the studio works with networks regarding "sensitive" cartoons 
that, in light of contemporary sensibilities, are sometimes edited for 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every network has to deal with individual programming departments, and while 
broadcast standards are consistent among the three networks (which air the 
Warner package), they let us know what they feel is a little over the line," 
Helppie says. That includes scenes deemed to be stereotyping, racist or 
exhibiting excessive gunplay or violence. 
</P>
<P>
 But if audiences have grown up, they haven't grown out of their affection for 
"Looney Tunes." Starrett says 80% of items purchased at the Warner Bros. Studio 
Stores -- the first opened at the Beverly Center in September 1991 -- are adult 
apparel. The 78 Warner Bros. Studio Stores pepper the U.S. and the U.K. (there 
are nine in Southern California alone). By the end of the year, 30 more stores 
are scheduled to open. Those numbers may not yet approach Disney's 271, but 
they definitely indicate there are some popular guys here. The stores, with 
human-sized plastic cartoon characters dominating the decor, offer everything 
from pewter figurines to snow shakers and leather jackets along with the 
ubiquitous T-shirts and sweatshirts. Cartoon cels from the early shorts, 
ranging from $450 up into the thousands of dollars, are among the most popular 
nostalgia items. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nostalgia thing," Starrett notes. "They like what they saw in their 
youth, but I'd say there are some who still watch the shows with their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 "Creatures like Donald Duck and Mickey give (kids) comfort, but they're not 
funny like Bugs and Daffy," comedian Robert Klein revealed in a guest spot on 
"David Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
 And, funny thing is, he's got plenty of company. WHAT'S ON, DOC?

NORMAL PEOPLE ACTING ABNORMALLY; SMOKE, BY JOHN ED BRADLEY (HENRY HOLT: $23; 
400 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Horn, John Horn is the entertainment writer for the Associated Press. 
His kinfolks come mainly from Tennessee and Mississippi. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The setting for John Ed Bradley's fourth novel is the eponymous small town, 
Smoke. Whatever metaphorical fires once burned in this South Louisiana podunk 
were extinguished years ago. Ernie Mason's bakery shop still serves the 
occasional sweet roll and Dunbar's Camera & Books might welcome a handful of 
customers on a particularly good day. For downtown action, that's about it. The 
guitar shop, five-and-dime and Delta Theater have folded. The busiest cash 
register key at the struggling Hometown Family Goods store reads "No Sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything from news to sexually transmitted diseases comes to Smoke late or 
not at all. There's a dingy cathouse down the road named Babylon, but some of 
the patrons sidestep its B-girls to spend the night dancing alone or just 
watching old movies on TV with their female companions. Even the Smoke High 
marching band can't march without tripping over itself, let alone play in 
unison. Excitement? It's good barbecue or a lively Cajun chank-a-chank tune on 
the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing much is happening, in short, when narrator Pace Burnette comes back to 
his hometown. Nothing much happens after he arrives, either. Even a little 
kidnaping fails to jolt Smoke out of its Sominex slumber. Defined more by place 
than plot, "Smoke" is a literary quilt whose panels range from lassitude to 
listlessness. The book's characters are Deep South slackers, equally interested 
in early-bird Bloody Marys -- or afternoon gin and tonics -- and in bemoaning 
their city's plight. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnette is a 28-year-old first-time novelist bearing a slight resemblance to 
Bradley himself. Bradley's debut novel "Tupelo Nights" also was a vaguely 
autobiographical account of former college football star John Girlie, running 
through his 20s with neither purpose nor plan. Like Girlie, Burnette is less 
participant than interloper: He may act, yet he's likelier to be acted upon. 
Smoke promptly sucks up Burnette's erudition and ambition like a backwater 
black hole. He aspires to become the new voice in Southern Gothic literature, 
but it looks like Burnette will settle for getting continually drunk and just 
fading away. "In a moment of clarity, perhaps the only real one I'd had since 
moving back home, I recognized my life as being over," Burnette says in a 
moment of despair. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smoke that welcomes Burnette back is filled with a wealth of memories and 
a minimum of promise. With a journalist's eye for detail and a poet's ear for 
language, Bradley, an accomplished sportswriter, makes Smoke feel as real as 
Pascagoula or Bogalusa but still slightly otherworldly "The city's people are 
normal people acting a little bit abnormally." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Monster Mart, which feels like a Wal Mart in thin disguise, has pushed 
downtown businesses into collapse or its brink. The Hometown Family Goods 
store, where Burnette passes many of his idle hours, lacks the Monster Mart's 
selection and slick marketing. Its aisles are empty except for the occasional 
motorist seeking directions to go somewhere else. The Zinc Lunch Counter is 
Hometown's only draw. Chef Ruby Dean Clark's griddle sizzles with pancakes and 
fried-egg orders all morning. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hometown's fourth general proprietor, Burnette's boyhood pal Jay Carnihan 
blames Monster Mart for Smoke's misfortunes. More to the point, he blames 
Rayford Holly, Monster Mart's grandfatherly billionaire owner, for killing off 
small-town America, and as punishment, he kidnaps him. Carnihan wants Holly to 
apologize for his alleged capitalistic crimes; until he does, Holly will remain 
Carnihan's captive. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnaped Holly comes across as a cross between Wal Mart founder Sam Walton 
and Colonel Sanders. Holly is prone to bouts of crying one minute, quickly 
followed by homespun marketing tips and folksy aphorisms about romance. "No 
love ever began between two people that wasn't a mistake. Love in the beginning 
is meant to be wrong," Holly says while flipping pancakes at Ruby Dean's lunch 
counter. 
</P>
<P>
 Flipping pancakes? Holly may have been kidnaped, but it's Burnette and 
Carnihan who immediately become hostage to him. Bored by his billions and 
hungry for adventure, Holly is actually eager to be dragged (without so much as 
a fight) into this low-rent caper. It's the biggest thing to hit him and Smoke 
since the Monster Mart first opened its doors. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnaping is also "Smoke's" most interesting section, and not because 
there's much drama about when -- or if -- Holly will apologize. Instead, 
Bradley in this part finally lets his colorful characters interact, rather than 
spinning them solo in their own private orbits. As in "Tupelo Nights," nearly 
every character (except the narrator) is distinct and memorable, yet their 
personalities are not magnified until they start bouncing off one another. 
Bradley also populates "Smoke" with two memorable women, and while they 
inevitably land in some romantic tangle they're real: complicated and 
charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley himself is a weird presence in "Smoke." In one jarring passage, 
Burnette reads from his novel "Strange Weather." Burnette selects a scene 
lifted almost straight from Bradley's "Tupelo Nights." The "Tupelo Nights" 
scene, John Girlie's near-incestuous encounter with his mother, is among that 
novel's most vivid chapters. In "Smoke," however, Bradley does not let the 
reader decide whether it's a good scene: He openly holds it up for ridicule. 
"When I finished reading I looked up to find everyone staring at me with equal 
parts shock and incredulity," Burnette says. That's saying it sweetly: His 
audience really thinks "Strange Weather" is a crock. Bradley may know what this 
is all about, but it's his secret: We haven't a clue. 
</P>
<P>
 The loquacious Holly tells Burnette at one point that the mark of fine writing 
is "the ability to make that which is strange to our experience seem as though 
we ourselves have actually lived it." Bradley accomplishes this admirable goal 
frequently, and yet much of "Smoke" drifts just beyond our grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley tells us a lot of the characters in this novel cry. While their lives 
may strike us as empty and aimless, that doesn't mean they necessarily come 
across as sad. Bradley's predicament here is like that of a comedian who 
follows the occasional flat joke by remarking, "Now, that's funny!" Whatever 
anguish his characters are supposed to feel remains elusive: it doesn't hold 
the page. It's ethereal, like smoke.

SINGING A NEW 'TOON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steven Spielberg thought it was time for Warner Bros. Animation to start 
making cartoons again. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 years had gone by since the studio produced an animated short 
series and Spielberg knew exactly what the new toon should be about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steven had this idea of doing this new generation of characters in the style 
of the classic Warner Bros. animation," recalls Tom Ruegger, "Tiny Toon" senior 
producer. "We came up with the location, Acme Acres, and decided the school 
should be Acme Looniversity, where the 'Looney Tunes' characters would serve as 
professors and teachers to a younger generation." 
</P>
<P>
 For the new toons, he says, "We wanted brand-new characters, with new 
personalities, and yet we wanted to make an appropriate homage to the original 
characters." 
</P>
<P>
 Voila! "Tiny Toon Adventures," which debuted in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The production team came up with characters that included a boy rabbit, Buster 
Bunny, whose mentor is Bugs; Plucky Duck, who's a bit Daffy; Hamton the Pig, 
who overeats like Porky; Dizzy Devil, who whirls in Tazmanian Devil fashion, 
and Elmyra, who like Elmer Fudd, is a human who hunts bunnies, but she smothers 
them with love, instead of hunting them with guns. 
</P>
<P>
 The first "Tiny Toon" to stand out was Babs Bunny (no relation to Buster, or 
Bugs, for that matter). "She was the only one who didn't have a counterpart in 
the old series," Ruegger points out. "She became a strong character, since 
there was no one for her to pay tribute to." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the biggest difference between the two series, Ruegger says, is that the 
new show was designed to be about kids -- or kid toons -- for kids, while 
maintaining a flavor of the old "Looney Tunes." "Bugs and Daffy and that crew 
were faced with sort of a never-ending problem of survival in the face of Elmer 
Fudd and Yosemite Sam," he says. "Buster, Plucky and gang are trying to face 
the trials and tribulations of growing up. Right off the bat, we're trying to 
connect with the kid audience in a very basic way." 
</P>
<P>
 And five seasons later, they're still connecting. Something their counterparts 
have done for six decades-plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toons" airs Monday through Friday on the Fox 
Children's Network, at 2:30 p.m. on XETV, and 3:30 p.m. on KTTV. It also airs 
Saturday at 9 a.m. on Fox. N.F. MENDOZA

ON THE SET; STRANGERS IN MTV PARADISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT COHEN, Robert Cohen is a Berkeley-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a quiet Friday evening on Lombard Street in the bay city's Russian Hill 
district. On a third-floor terrace in a white neo-Italianate townhouse just 
down from the stretch of Lombard billed as the crookedest in the world, seven 
Generation X'ers gather in a circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Voices and gentle laughter drift outside as the group passes around a hat 
containing scraps of paper. Cory, a UC San Diego student who looks like an 
Ivory Soap model, fishes out the first one. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding it up to the lamplight, she reads the scrawl handwritten by one of her 
companions. "Have I changed at all in the past few months?" She pauses, 
blushing. "Gosh, so much. I can't relate to that goodie two-shoes who walked in 
the door. This must be growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the townhouse, on the floor below, Cory's image flickers on a pair of 
color television screens in a control room jammed with monitors, cables and a 
large mixing board. Gazing intently at the video display is George Verschoor, a 
lanky 33-year-old sporting a baseball cap. At Verschoor's side are two 
assistants with crackling walkie-talkies issuing radio instructions to the 
cameramen and crew upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind Verschoor, a woman taps in staccato bursts, logging all the action 
unfolding on the TV monitors into a word processor. A plate of half-finished 
roast-beef sandwiches occupies a plywood table in the middle of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last four months, Verschoor, the director of MTV's reality-based 
docusoap "The Real World," has been chronicling the lives of these seven 20s 
plucked from 30,000 hopefuls vying for a chance to share MTV's plush subsidized 
living lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Their story, which began unfolding a couple of weeks ago, will continue its 
voyeuristic eaveslooking through the summer and fall, for a total of 22 
episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 The house at 949 Lombard provides postcard views of San Francisco landmarks, 
includingTransamerica's pyramid, Coit Tower and the majestic Bay itself. 
Approach the entrance and you pass a "For Sale" sign and an ornamental amphora. 
Climb a flight of stairs and you enter a living room that looks like it just 
stepped out of an Ikea catalogue, with funky thrift shop finds tossed in. A 
large pool table dominates the adjoining room. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera now pans slowly around the terrace, settling on Rachel, a doe-eyed 
brunette nuzzling up to goateed fellow cast member Judd, a budding cartoonist 
from Long Island, N.Y. The hat arrives on Rachel's lap and she shuffles the 
scraps of paper, gamely pulling one out. "What do I most regret doing in 'The 
Real World'?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 A production assistant in the control room gasps: "Oh man, We're going to be 
here all night now." Rachel can't hear him, of course; the surveillance only 
goes one way. 
</P>
<P>
 On screen Rachel grimaces. "The only thing I really regret is kissing Puck." 
Judd chuckles. Puck, a rowdy San Francisco bike messenger isn't around to be 
insulted. Mohammed, a poet/rapper, announces that he's splitting for a party. 
It has nothing to do with Rachel and Puck. He gets up and leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the "Real Worlders" include Pedro, a gay Latino living with AIDS; 
Pam, an Asian-American medical student, and Jo, a transplanted Brit, who will 
replace one of the original seven who will be asked to leave mid-shoot by the 
artificially thrown-together housemates. 
</P>
<P>
 Verschoor turns away from the monitors. With a far-away stare he ponders the 
fact that the shoot will be ending the next week. "There's going to be a lot of 
evaluation, a lot of grieving. The intensity's going to be over and it's going 
to be a letdown. Not only for the cast, but the crew too. They've gotten very 
attached over four months." 
</P>
<P>
 Verschoor speaks from experience. He's directed all three seasons of "The Real 
World," the first in New York, and last year's L.A. chapter in Venice. He 
speaks of the cast as if they're family, which is what they've come to 
represent to him after the many intense months of forced intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This cast was wonderful. They're the best and brightest of what's out there," 
he says. "What's strange is that we know almost everything about them, but they 
know next to nothing about us. But you need to maintain a proper distance; 
otherwise, you contaminate the process." 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls an incident when Rachel and Pedro flew to Rachel's home town of 
Phoenix, Az. "They ended up at the wrong airport -- San Francisco instead of 
Oakland. And Rachel was very upset when she realized they'd completely screwed 
up. She turned to the production crew who'd come along and said, 'You guys knew 
all the time, didn't you?' They smiled like cats who got the canary and didn't 
say a word. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we can't be their parents. They have to be responsible for themselves. We 
do have our rules in 'The Real World.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "The Real World" airs Thursdays at 10 p.m. with repeats Fridays at 7 p.m., 
Saturdays at noon and 6:30 p.m. and Sundays at 1 p.m. on MTV.

'P.O.V.'S' ONE-SIDEDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is in response to Frazier Moore's column titled "A Few Points of View 
Very Well Taken" (TV Times, June 19). Mr. Frazier praises the PBS program 
"P.O.V." because, as he writes, "the hardy 'P.O.V.' persists in challenging 
each viewer to re-examine his or her own P.O.V.

 Oh, really! I noticed that the only example given of criticism of "P.O.V." 
came from conservatives. If "P.O.V." challenges each viewer to rethink his or 
her attitudes, why are there no examples of vehement liberal criticism of 
"P.O.V."?

'ROUNDHOUSE' FOR ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a quick thank you for the story on Nick-at-Nite's "Roundhouse" (TV Times, 
June 19).However, the very last line was wrong. It says "for ages 6 to 16." I'm 
almost 37 and I just don't miss "Roundhouse." The cast is uniformly talented 
and appealing, the music and lyrics to the songs are quite excellent for a 
weekly series, and the writing is outstanding. ... I wish I had "Roundhouse" 
when I was in school.

 Who's new on video? 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott and Lou Costello and Ma and Pa Kettle, that's who! 
</P>
<P>
 MCA/Universal Home Video has dug into their vaults and discovered five Bud 
Abbott and Lou Costello comedies and five corn pone features starring those 
endearing rubes, Ma and Pa Kettle. Each video is priced at $15. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1940s, the comedy team of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello made a series 
of low-budget, but inspired comedies including, "Buck Privates," "Ride 'Em 
Cowboy" and "The Time of Their Lives." As the decade came to a close, though, 
the quality of their films began to wan. Though the movies new to video are not 
among their best, Abbott and Costello's crack comedic timing still manages to 
shine through the weaker material. 
</P>
<P>
 The five Abbott and Costello films currently available are: 
</P>
<P>
 "Abbott and Costello Go To Mars" (1953) A&C parody science fiction films in 
the weakest of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer" (1949) OK murder-mystery send-up finds a 
prominent attorney murdered in the fancy hotel where Abbott works as the house 
detective and Costello, the bellhop. When the murder is pinned on Costello, the 
two play detectives to find the real murderer. The main suspect on their list 
happens to be an evil swami played by Boris Karloff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion" (1950) Abbott and Costello play 
wrestling promoters whose star attraction runs out on them. The duo follow him 
to Algeria where they are tricked into joining the French Foreign Legion. 
Patricia Medina plays a beautiful French spy and veteran movie bad guy Walter 
Slezak co-stars as a traitorous legionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Comin' Round the Mountain" (1951) A search for buried treasure sends the boys 
into the backwoods where they run smack into the middle of a Winfield-McCoy 
feud in this unexceptional entry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone Kops" (1954): Set in the silent era of 
filmmaking, this comedy finds A&C becoming a movie team with the Mack Sennett 
Group. The Keystone Kops in the movie were trained for the film by the real 
Mack Sennett who also appears as himself. Fred Clark, Lynn Bari and former 
boxer Maxie Rosenbloom also star. 
</P>
<P>
 Be warned: Watch Ma and Pa Kettle at your own risk. These comedies are 
strictly a matter of taste. If you loved the TV series "Hee Haw," you'll enjoy 
these down home comedies starring Percy McBride as Pa and Majorie Main as Ma. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kettle movies currently available are: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Egg and I" (1947) Entertaining comedy based on Betty McDonald's 
best-selling novel. Fred MacMurray stars as a broker who takes his new wife 
(Claudette Colbert) and returns to his rural roots to start a chicken farm. 
They are quickly befriended by their neighbors, the Kettles. Pa, who refuses to 
get a job, operates an illegal corn-whiskey still. Ma keeps a sloppy but loving 
house, though, she can't remember the names of all of her 15 children. Main 
received a best supporting Oscar nomination for her delightful comedic turn. 
The Kettles proved so popular that over the next 7 years Universal cranked out 
9 low-budget comedies starring the two. Unfortunately, none of them are the 
quality of "The Egg and I." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle" (1949) When the Kettles' rickety 
old house is condemned, Pa wins an ultra-modern prefab home by dreaming up a 
slogan for a tobacco company. Unfortunately, Pa didn't want a fancy new house. 
He just wanted to win a tobacco pouch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ma and Pa Kettle go to Town "(1949) This time around, Pa wins a trip to New 
York. But who is going to take care of the 15 kids? Well, the two find a baby 
sitter when a mobster (Charles McGraw) on the lam shows up on their doorstep 
and tells the Kettles he is a poet in need of solitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm" (1951) Upon returning from New York, the 
Kettles' oldest son (Richard Long) and his wife (Meg Randall) have a baby. 
After meeting their proper Bostonian in-law counterparts, the Kettles leave the 
"modern" world behind and head back to their farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ma and Pa Kettle at the Fair" (1951) When their eldest daughter (Lori Nelson) 
decides she wants to attend college, Ma and Pa must figure out how to get the 
money for college tuition. Because Pa won't even hear about getting a job, the 
Kettles decide to try make money by entering events at the County Fair.

 HOLLYWOOD'S FIRST CHOICES: Or Why Groucho Marx Never Played Rhett Butler by 
Jeff Burkhart & Bruce Stuart (Crown Publishers: $14, paperback; 230 pp.) Movie 
buffs and even casual films fans should get a kick out of this breezy, 
fast-paced account of how some of the greatest movie casting decisions were 
made. Burkhart and Stuart offer such casting insights as the fact that 
Claudette Colbert was the original choice to play Margo Channing in the 1950 
Academy Award-winning classic, "All About Eve." But when she was sidelined with 
a bad back, Bette Davis, whose career was in the doldrums, stepped in; she 
received an Oscar nomination for her legendary performance. And according to 
the book, Montgomery Clift (pictured here), not William Holden, was all set to 
play Joe in Billy Wilder's "Sunset Boulevard." Clift pulled out just weeks 
before production began due to a suicide threat from the woman with whom he was 
keeping company: Torch singer Libby Holman, nearly 30 years older than Clift, 
thought the script hit too close to their relationship. The book also details 
the trials and tribulations behind such acclaimed movies as "Born Yesterday," 
"Queen Christina," "Lawrence of Arabia," "Apocalypse Now," "Who's Afraid of 
Virginia Woolf?" "Casablanca," "Gone With the Wind" and "The Godfather." 
Unfortunately, the book is marred by inconsistencies and inexcusable factual 
errors. Throughout the chapter on "Sunset Boulevard," Holden's character -- Joe 
Gillis -- is referred to as Joe Guiness. Laurence Olivier's age when he died is 
stated as 88; he was 82.The release year for "Dinner at Eight" is given as both 
1932 and 1933 (the latter is correct). Montgomery Clift is reported to have 
lost the best actor Oscar for "The Search" to Ronald Colman, who won for 1947's 
"A Double Life." Actually, Clift was nominated for best actor of 1948 and lost 
to Laurence Olivier in "Hamlet." Susan King

 A GATHERING OF HEROS: Reflections on Rage and Responsibility, A Memoir of the 
Los Angeles Riots by Gregory Alan-Williams (Academy Chicago Publishers: $18.95; 
205 pp.) What makes a hero? How does a person decide to stand up for what they 
believe is right? "From the first blow the driver had been unable to protect 
himself.He was battered about like a sad puppet, his movements subject solely 
to the direction and momentum of his assailant's rage . . . the man . . . 
slumped forward onto the steering wheel. Immediately, he was driven backward to 
an upright position by several more blows to the head." 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Alan-Williams was one of many people to witness that scene during the 
Los Angeles riots of April 29, 1992. And he was one of the few to do something 
about it. Williams walked though the mob assembled at the corner of Florence 
and Normandie, pulled the anonymous man, an Asian-American, from his vehicle, 
and somehow managed to drag him to safety. This is the kind of guy you want on 
your side. 
</P>
<P>
 In "A Gathering of Heroes," Williams describes the events of that day in 
detail and sets them against the background of his own life. It's not a 
remarkable life, nor does he seem, on the surface, to be a remarkable man. Yet 
clearly the mixture of kindness, sorrow, anger and spirituality that are so 
evident in Williams' writing seems to have propelled him to perform a 
remarkable act. This book doesn't really provide any new information about 
racism, rage or responsibility, nor is the prose anything stronger than 
adequate. Williams' strength lies in making a reader feel that the seed of 
heroism, of true greatness, lives in all of us. We just need to find it.

 Dead Alive (Cinemax Sunday at 9:45 p.m.) Peter Jackson's 1993 gross-out horror 
picture comedy may well be the most hilariously disgusting movie ever made, 
seemingly ingesting the yuckiest sequences of every schlock cheapie of the last 
two decades -- and sending up all of them via wretched excess. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stone Boy (HBO Tuesday at 6:30 p.m.) A splendid, compassionate, clear-eyed 
depiction of how a Montana farm family gradually comes to terms with its 
younger son's accidental killing of his older brother. With Jason Presson in 
the title role, Glenn Close and Robert Duvall as his parents, Wilford Brimley 
as his grandfather and Frederic Forrest in one of his best portrayals.

 K.D.LANG: All You Get Is Me by Victoria Starr (St. Martin's Press: $22.95; 271 
pp.) Conflict is interesting. Everyone has conflict.So it is probably safe to 
say that singer k.d. lang, along with the rest of us, has had her share of 
passionate internal struggles. Why, then, is her biography almost completely 
devoid of any real fear, anger, doubt or even inconvenience? Born in a small 
town in Canada, k.d. lang (aka Kathy Dawn) knew from childhood that she was 
destined to be famous. When k.d. was 12, her father abandoned the family with 
no warning. Victoria Starr writes: "It would be years before Kathy would see 
her father again, and his disappearance would affect her in ways that would be 
profound and long-lasting." This is the sort of information that, used right, 
can give a biography depth and nuance. However, aside from a few other vague 
references, Starr never mentions these "profound and long-lasting effects" 
again. Did lang keep her self esteem intact? How? Did such a loss bleed into 
her adult relationships? 
</P>
<P>
 This emotional stonewalling continues though the rest of the book. There are 
plenty of dramatic sequences, such as lang's frustrating struggle to be 
accepted in country music, her public stand against meat which alienated many 
fans, and her coming out as a lesbian in a potentially hostile environment. In 
spite of such promising material, though,nobody, not lang, not Starr and not 
even the reader, really gets their hands dirty. 
</P>
<P>
 "k.d. lang: All You Get Is Me," is mistitled. In fact, all you get is a quirky 
paper doll, a disappearing act, a song half heard from the apartment down the 
hall.

 NOBODY BELIEVES ME: A Novel of Love and Terror by Molly Katz (Ballantine: $15; 
322 pp.) When Lynn Marchette, an up-and-coming, slightly neurotic Boston 
talk-show host, meets Greg Alter, she feels as if her life has finally 
begun.Not only is Greg smart, handsome and great in bed, but he is unabashedly 
crazy about her. A little too crazy, it seems. In "Nobody Believes Me," Molly 
Katz' first novel, stalking and obsessive acts are raised almost to an art 
form. At first, after she breaks up with him, Greg sends Lynn malevolent 
stuffed animals, forges her handwriting to create threatening notes and 
arranges for fake blood to cover the back of her dress during a live TV show. 
Then he pulls out the heavy artillery. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz is excellent at depicting the slow, relentless erosion of a person's 
psyche as their entire life is subjected to a hostile takeover. Lynn's 
character is perhaps the strongest aspect of "Nobody Believes Me," not because 
she is so unusual, but just the opposite -- it is extremely easy to imagine 
knowing this person. Lynn is a little strident, a little shallow, and a lot 
real, and it is those human flaws that help make her character much more 
believable, and as a result more sympathetic, than the people you often meet in 
thrillers. Unfortunately, many of the other characters don't fare as well. In 
particular the male hero, someone we are clearly supposed to like, is such a 
controlling bully that it almost seems laughable to put him in a novel 
concerned with stalking, a behavior inexorably tied to the idea of control.

 THERAPY by Steven Schwartz (Harcourt Brace: $22.95; 338 pp.) Every so often 
there is a novel that can be summed up in a single word -- not the plot, but 
the overwhelming emotion one may feel while reading it.The word for "Therapy," 
by the much underrated Steven Schwartz, is pleasure. This is the type of book 
that makes you hope your bus ride is extra long so you can sit there and read 
it, laughing and sad at the same time, your life temporarily given over to 
these wonderful characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Cap is a therapist in Pierre, Colo. He has incredibly Jewish parents and an 
incredibly WASPy wife. Among his clients are Julian, who is 20, epileptic and 
desperately in love with another of Cap's clients, the hungry, hostile Maureen. 
Maureen fights her own therapy and tries to hurt Cap: "It took her a year to 
get him. Her sensor had worked overtime. Finally, she found it. . . 'You're a 
plodder, aren't you?' Held frozen, stunned. He could see in her eyes, the soft, 
almost tender and solicitous way that she'd said it, that she knew she'd found 
the key . . .It was what his father had once told him: 'You're a plodder.' One 
step above being a schlump." 
</P>
<P>
 The only flaw in "Therapy," and it's a small one at that, is in Julian. Large 
portions of the book are told from his point of view, and it seems sometimes as 
if Schwartz doesn't fully inhabit the character. There is a subtle case-study 
feel, a neat labeling of Julian's darkness that creates a small seam in 
otherwise seamless writing. A problem like this only stands out because the 
rest of the book is so strong, funny, painful and wise.

 SLEEPLESS NIGHTS by Andrew Bergman (Donald I Fine: $19.95; 218 pp.) It's 
interesting the way the world portrayed in a novel can be as large as the 
galaxy or as small as a pencil point, yet exactly how that world-size is 
determined seems to have nothing to do with the number of characters, plot, or 
even the age and background of the protagonist.The size of a fictional world 
is, perhaps, decided by attitude. In "Sleepless Nights," by Andrew Bergman, the 
world is about the size of a coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaping randomly through four different decades, this novel chronicles the 
life of Robby Weisglass, the youngest child of German Jewish refugees. Robby is 
being sexually molested by both his mother and older sister while his father 
remains oblivious. Bergman, a well known screenwriter, is at his best during 
sections describing Robby's mother -- some-how rendering her sympathetic and 
horrible at the same time. "Her warm hard breast brushes past my lips. It lacks 
my sister's full rosy newness. This is a European breast, older, more worn. But 
it has a kind of bristly, no-nonsense sensuality." This from a boy who hasn't 
even had his bar mitzvah. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sleepless Nights" is a humid, mossy type of a book. At times reading it feels 
like being locked in a stranger's closet with all the private, alien smells and 
claustrophobia. Although Bergman's writing is uniformly good, one may long for 
an less obstructed view, a kind of verbal spaciousness which ultimately has 
nothing to do with subject matter.

 LOSING ABSALOM by Alexs D. Pate (Coffee House Press: $19.95; 256 pp.) Absalom 
is dying. His body lies in a hospital bed while his spirit roams restlessly 
through time and space spending time with his wife, Gwen, and kids.Sonny, the 
oldest, left the North Philadelphia ghetto where he was raised, to make his 
fortune in white-bread Minneapolis, while Absalom's daughter, Rainy, has stayed 
behind living with a drug dealer and, "searching through the rubble of her 
reality for some magic that would save her." 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing Absalom" is a novel about struggle. On an individual level each 
character is fighting to find out exactly who they are and how they fit in the 
world, while on a deeper level they symbolize all African-American people 
fighting to find the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexs Pate is clearly a talented writer with plenty of energy and enthusiasm. 
At times, however, "Losing Absalom" lacks subtlety -- especially in the 
dialogue. Everyone always seems to say exactly what they mean, which saps a 
great deal of power and complexity from what might otherwise be effective 
scenes. Another difficult aspect of Pate's writing is a disconcerting sort of 
physical description, such as Rainy's reaction to an unwelcome guest: "Rainy's 
heart exploded, blood stained the inside of her body . . . The man stood in 
front of her. 'Is this where I can find Dancer?' 'Who are you?' Rainy felt her 
knees breaking. The center of her body was dropping." Images like that tend to 
distract instead of enhance. In spite of problems, though, "Losing Absalom" has 
some real strength. It will be interesting to see what Alexs Pate does next.

ALSO STARRING; WALSTON'S CHAMBERS; AFTER YEARS OF LIGHT FARE, THE ACTOR 
WELCOMES THE WEIGHTY DRAMA OF 'PICKET FENCES '

 Ray Walston has come full circle. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 37 years ago, movie director Stanley Donen caught the actor on 
Broadway in his Tony Award-winning turn as the devil Applegate in the musical 
"Damn Yankees." Donen was so impressed with Walston, he brought him out to 
Hollywood to star opposite Cary Grant in the 1957 comedy "Kiss Them for Me." 
</P>
<P>
 "The movie didn't turn out to be a good movie at all," Walston reflects. (The 
next year, though, Walston and Donen teamed up for the far more successful film 
version of "Damn Yankees.") 
</P>
<P>
 "Kiss Them for Me" was made on the 20th-Century Fox lot. Nearly four decade 
later, Walston, is back on the lot filming the Emmy Award-winning CBS series 
"Picket Fences." The 75-year-old Walston fits right into David E. Kelley's 
quirky show as the compassionate, cantankerous and wise Judge Henry Bone, who 
presides over some of the most difficult and challenging issues any 
contemporary jurist has had to face. During the show's first two seasons, Judge 
Bone has cast decisions on cases involving an HIV-positive dentist who lost his 
job because of his illness, a Christian Scientist who sued the town's Catholic 
hospital because he wanted his brain-dead wife taken off life support and a 
pregnant brain-dead woman whose husband wanted her kept alive to give birth to 
their child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it a good part?," Walston asks passionately. "It's a wonderful part. 
One of the best parts I've ever had. You know it's interesting, the evolution 
of the character. I use that word with that character because when we started 
out, it was only a recurring role, coming in now and then." 
</P>
<P>
 And Judge Bone didn't have much patience early in the show. "But as we did 
several segments of it, I managed to get in some compassion, some 
understanding," Walston explains. "Kelley began to write it in that fashion, 
and when he began to write it that way, he began to write some of the most 
beautiful stuff. Some of those summations at the end of those segments are just 
so gorgeous and beautiful, really." 
</P>
<P>
 (Though a critical favorite, "Picket Fences" rarely cracks the Top 40. This 
summer, CBS is giving the series more exposure by airing it, through July 21, 
not only in its regular Friday time slot, but also Thursdays at 10 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 Walston, best known to baby boomers as the wily extraterrestrial Uncle Martin 
on the 1963-66 CBS comedy "My Favorite Martian," is holding court this dreary 
afternoon in Fox's commissary, munching on a rather lackluster fruit salad. "It 
looks like you made the better choice," he says to his luncheon companion, who 
chose the more appetizing chicken burger. "Do you want to trade?" 
</P>
<P>
 The actor pauses and smiles. "I have got to tell you, it is an absolute joy to 
play (Judge Bone)," Walston says. "So many people, friends of mine from out of 
town have called me and written me. People that I meet on the street talk about 
how they love the fact that the man is so understanding. I am beginning to 
think that people want to be filled with compassion about their fellow man. 
They want to be filled with understanding about their fellow man. I really feel 
that as a result of playing this part. I never felt that before. I never cared 
how people felt." 
</P>
<P>
 The best part, Walston adds, is that he gets to sink his teeth into a strong 
dramatic role. "My career is to such a degree been in light roles, comedy roles 
and to be on a series that won the Emmy for being the best drama show of last 
year and to be on a series that is a drama series and to have dramatic stuff to 
do....I love that. I can't tell you how much I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year during a day off from shooting, Walston decided to observe real 
judges in action at the Beverly Hills Municipal Court. "I went in and sat down 
where there were some cases going on, not with a jury. I stayed there about 45 
minutes and watched this judge, a young fellow. Then I got up to leave and got 
out in the hallway and one of the attendants came running after me and said: 
'The judge would like for you to come back. He would like to talk to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Walston went back into the courtroom, the judge invited him to his 
chambers to talk about his film work -- and case work. "He took off his robe 
and started talking about pictures I was in and wanted to know what I was doing 
there. When I told him I was looking for background just to see what was going 
on, he said, 'What did you learn?' I said, 'When a case came before you and the 
two or three attorneys walked up to the bench and handed you some papers, you 
took a pencil and the papers and you went through the papers. It looked as if 
you were a statue. That really impressed me. I can't do that in ('Picket 
Fences'). I have to keep moving.' I would love to do a segment where they 
brought something up to the judge and he just sat there for five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge then gave Walston his card and said, " 'If you ever have anything 
that you want to know that you are unfamiliar about, please come back.' That 
was very nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about (calling him) just in case I got a ticket for speeding," he 
adds with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Picket Fences" airs Thursdays and Fridays at 10 p.m. on CBS.

 THE COMPLETE T. REX by John R. Horner & Don Lessem (Touchstone: $15; 238 pp., 
illustrated). Even before "Jurassic Park," the Tyrannosaurus rex ranked as the 
most popular dinosaur: Huge, deadly and safely extinct, it holds an eerie 
fascination for humans of all ages.Horner and Lessem recount their excavation 
of the most complete Tyrannosaurus skeleton known (only 11 have been found, 
most of them fragmentary) and summarize the ongoing debates over the animal. 
Was T. Rex a scavenger or an active predator? How did it use its tiny 
forelimbs? Was it hot-blooded or cold-blooded? Rather than offer pat answers, 
the authors steer a prudent middle course between the outdated image of a 
sluggish reptile and paleontologist Bob Bakker's hotly debated vision of a 
super-agile Rex .

 CONDUCT UNBECOMING: Gays & Lesbians in the Military by Randy Shilts (Fawcett: 
$16; 811 pp.). Shortly before his death, Shilts updated this acclaimed history, 
taking the story through the Persian Gulf War and President Clinton's 
pusillanimous "don't ask/don't tell policy."In stark prose, he shows that the 
U.S. military has devoted more time and money to hunting homosexuals within its 
ranks than it has to pursuing Nazi war criminals. By persecuting citizens eager 
to serve their country, the Armed Forces often shot themselves in the foot, 
wasting billions of dollars and depriving the nation of vitally needed skills. 
Shilts documents a pattern of abuse that ranges from the harassment of female 
officers by men who resented their presence to flagrant violations of due 
process by the Office of Naval Intelligence, including wire-tapping and the 
harassment of civilians. Comprehensive, impeccably documented and passionate, 
"Conduct Unbecoming" makes it clear that Shilts' death deprived the nation of 
one of its most talented journalists.

 CAMPING OUT IN YELLOWSTONE, 1882 by Mary Bradshaw Richards, edited by William 
W. Slaughter (University of Utah Press: $10.95; 108 pp., paperback original). 
Ten years after it became America's first National Park, Mary Richards 
recounted her impressions of Yellowstone in a series of letters to the Salem 
Observer. Her straightforward narrative, refreshingly free of 19th-Century 
propriety, is as much portrait of the author as the park. Richards clearly 
enjoyed roughing it, traveling by horse, wagon and foot to visit the geysers, 
hot springs, pools and other natural wonders. Slaughter's thorough notes 
clarify many of the references in the original text.

 FAST ONE by Paul Cain (Vintage: $9; 171 pp., paperback original). Long out of 
print, "Fast One" is the only novel by George Carroll Syms, an enigmatic 
author/screen writer who worked under a variety of pseudonyms. He takes the 
reader on a journey down the mean streets of Depression-era Los Angeles as he 
recounts the rise and fall of the amoral, murderous Gerard Kells, a small-time 
operator so crooked he'd double cross an intersection if he got the chance. 
Kells tries to oust the biggest racketeers in the city, but his eagerness to 
play all the ends against the middle leads to his undoing in one of the darkest 
stories in the noir crime genre.

 FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT: West by Thomas A. Heinz (Gibbs-Smith: $12.95; 64 pp., 
illustrated, paperback original). Thomas Heinz's noteworthy survey of Wright's 
work continues with this volume devoted to buildings in Japan, Arizona and 
California, including the local landmarks, Ennis House and Hollyhock House. 
Heinz combines a brief, insightful text with well-chosen color photographs to 
present an educational overview of buildings as diverse as the bizarre, 
Mayan-influenced Ennis House in Los Feliz and the elegantly understated Marin 
County Library.

 COMMON GROUND: A Naturalist's Cape Cod by Robert Finch (Norton: $10.95; 142 
pp.) . Finch joins the distinguished line of writers inspired by the oddly 
curved Cape Cod peninsula. Despite the encroachments of developers, the Cape 
still boasts numerous wild areas. Finch wanders the beaches, marshes and 
second-growth forests, reflecting on untamed nature and its importance in an 
increasingly overcrowded world: "I go to a zoo to observe animals, but I go to 
wilderness to enter a world not mine, where my standards do not apply, where 
imagination runs in the fur and the flesh and calls to me in a language I 
cannot decipher but which is nonetheless nourishing and irresistible."

 A LESSON BEFORE DYING by Ernest J. Gaines (Vintage: $11; 256 pp.) . Gaines won 
the National Book Critic's Circle Award for this compelling novel about race 
relations in the postwar South. College-educated Grant Wiggins has returned to 
his small Cajun hometown to teach in its cruelly segregated school system, but 
he chafes at the restrictions on his considerable abilities. When Jefferson, a 
simple-minded local teen-ager, is sentenced to death for his participation in a 
grocery store robbery, Wiggins' Aunt and Jefferson's godmother bully him into 
visiting the prisoner to teach him how to die with dignity. Gaines' atmospheric 
prose captures the galling constraints of a muggy backwater town dominated by a 
tin-pot elite.

 RIDING THE YELLOW TROLLEY CAR by William Kennedy (Penguin: $12.95; 494 pp.) . 
The most engaging essays in this collection of nonfiction by the 
Pulitzer-winning novelist are the first-person accounts, including the visit to 
Gabriel Garcia Marquez in Barcelona that precipitated a search for an elusive 
trolley. The book reviews seem less interesting than the vivid descriptions of 
working on small-town newspapers and other minor-key adventures; although 
Kennedy adores James Joyce, he offers few insights into the embrangled universe 
of "Ulysses."

OUR PETS, OURSELVES; THE BEAST IN THE BOUDOIR: PETKEEPING IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY 
PARIS, BY KATHLEEN KETE (UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS: $30; 204 PP.)  
</P>

<P>
By Anne Tobias, Along with her four companions, three feline and one human, 
Anne Tobias lives in New York City, where she writes about dance.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seduced by the title, you might pick up Kathleen Kete's "The Beast in the 
Boudoir" and plunge right in, anticipating imperiled heroines and their virile 
swains -- a potential bodice-ripper extraordinaire. Go a few sentences deep, 
and you'll know you've been mistaken. For the detail-laden text earnestly sets 
about explicating (as the subtitle warned, even if you didn't stop to notice) 
pet-keeping practices in 19th-Century Paris and the ways in which domesticated 
dogs and cats allowed the members of the bourgeoisie to imagine themselves. 
Though not the lurid read you'd craved, the book harbors its own temptations, 
and it pays to stick with Kete as she probes the complex relationship between 
man, woman and beast. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Kete's clearest arguments centers on the bourgeois response to 
modernity to a world turned "alienating, and relentlessly unsentimental," over 
the course of the 19th Century. "The pet," Kete explains, "became the 
countericon of the scientific, and dehumanized, age." Dissatisfied with the 
faithlessness of people, daunted by the emptiness of their lives, bourgeois 
pet-keepers turned to their dogs, models of fidelity and affection. Sifting 
through such sources as the annals of the Parisian Animal Protection Society, 
as well as newspaper accounts, Kete bolsters her point with contemporary tales 
of superlative canines: dogs who performed daring rescues, dogs who journeyed 
rough miles to return home, dogs who grieved after the death of their masters, 
sometimes committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one of the joys of "The Beast in the Boudoir" is Kete's able use of 
19th-Century texts. In addition to the publications of the Animal Protection 
Society, Kete culls from records on the dog tax, veterinary literature, 
dog-care books and writings on pet cemeteries. Nineteenth-Century voices, 
musing, enthusing and arguing over the merits of myriad beloved beasts, enliven 
the author's scholarly tone, which remains, at all times, properly 
dispassionate. 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary references to cats were particularly charged, perhaps, as Kete 
suggests, because of the danger that feline symbolism -- fickleness, bohemian 
independence -- posed to the goals of order and security that structured 
class-conscious bourgeois life. The sentiments of the 18th-Century naturalist 
Buffon informed 19th-Century discourse on cats. Kete quotes Buffon's opinion 
that cats "have an innate malice, a falseness of character, a perverse nature.' 
" Worse still, cats, especially female ones, exuded rampant sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 So perhaps we have hit upon some disguised bodice ripping after all. To be 
sure, Kete's discussion of rabies -- a disease characterized, in the 
19th-Century mind, by violence and insatiable sexual impulses -- is one of the 
highlights of the book. "It was the beastly appetites of humanity," the author 
declares, "that were expressed in the symptomatology of rabies and it seems 
striking that in an age typified by repression of appetites, la bete humaine 
attracted fascinated, if horrified, attention." Always striving to maintain the 
primary ideals of self-discipline and control, the bourgeoisie imposed culture 
in place of nature -- and not just human nature. "The paradox of a culture bent 
on banishing nature from the home," Kete notes, "resolved itself into the 
construction of a shadow world of denatured animals." Dogs were treated as 
dolls or children; they were subjected to the latest fads in coiffure and 
couture. Their training, in terms of sexuality and obedience, "marked the 
transformation of beastly behavior into quasi-human conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us still anthropomorphize our domesticated companions, requiring them 
to live on our terms. Indeed we continue to elaborate, on many counts, the 
pet-keeping models of the 19th-Century. Dog remains man's best friend in a 
world that has propelled us toward ever-more-isolating realms of modernity. And 
just like the infantilized pets of the last century, dogs and cats are our 
surrogate children, necessary constructs ranged against today's specter of the 
decaying family. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the 20th-Century is beset with its own anxieties, foremost among them our 
destruction of the environment. Although I don't pretend to be the thorough 
cultural historian Kete has proved herself, I would venture to guess this 
distinguishes us unmistakably from the animal fanciers of the previous century. 
Fearful of precipitating the extinction of the natural world, now we court the 
beast. In her recent bestseller, "The Hidden Life of Dogs," Elizabeth Marshall 
Thomas writes, "I would like to visit a dog's mind, to know what he's thinking 
and feeling, to have another dog look at men and see not something different 
but something the same." In our dogs we see the wolf, in our cats the lion. 
And, more often than not, our deepest urge is to follow them out to the scented 
mountains, to the wild plains and roam beneath a waxing moon.

GAY LITERARY MOVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While I appreciate the courage and accomplishments of the writers of the 
"Violet Quill Club," and Jameson Currier's survey of them in his review in your 
pages (Book Review, May 1), I take gentle exception to his penultimate 
statement, " . . . the Quill was the first really 'gay' literary movement." 
</P>

 From 1961, when Doric Wilson produced his play, "Now She Dances" at the Caffe 
Cino in New York, there was a gay literary movement in full force.Doric's play 
was followed by fully gay works by Lanford Wilson, myself, William M. Hoffman, 
George Birmisa, Robert Heide, Daniel Haben Clark and Jean-Claude Van Itallie, 
first at the Cino then at La Mama, the Old Reliable and at theaters all over 
Manhattan and thence worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 It took years for these plays to be printed, and their audiences for any one 
production were small, but productions and revivals were and are widespread. 
Taking nothing from the achievements of the Violet Quill Club, I do think we 
deserve our place in literary history.

WHOSE COLD WAR VICTORY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jonathan Kwitny is certainly entitled to his opinion of my book ("How Our Guys 
Won the Cold War," Book Review, June 12). But the review, by failing to check 
my quotes against the finished book, failed to catch important revisions.For 
instance, Kwitny writes about the death of Leonid Brezhnev: "Was Soviet Premier 
Leonid Brezhnev murdered by agents of his successor, Yuri Andropov? That's how 
Schweizer writes it, with a footnote to a vaguely identified publication and 
one former KGB official." Had Kwitny looked at the final version of the book, 
he might have noticed that one source for the story are two well-known Soviet 
journalists, Vladimir Solovyov and Elena Klepikova. 
</P>
<P>
 What most disappoints me about Kwitny's review is that he never deals with the 
substance of the book, showing a greater interest in a few trees that catch his 
eye, never looking at the entire forest. He is more concerned about Central 
America and Iran-Contra and why Al Haig left the administration than the 
fundamental questions raised by the book: Did the Reagan Administration conduct 
a secret economic war against the Kremlin? Did the cumulative effect of Reagan 
policies act as a catalyst for the collapse of the Soviet Union, as several 
former Soviet officials quoted in the book believe? Caspar Weinberger, Bill 
Clark, John Poindexter and others go on the record on dozens of points and make 
a very convincing case. But Kwitny never mentions any of this. 
</P>
<P>
 As I stated in the introduction of "Victory," it is not intended to be a 
diplomatic history. Rather, it is an attempt to piece together the policies 
that hastened the collapse of the Soviet Union. Kwitny doesn't seem to have 
much interest in these policies.

THE GOOD OLD DAYS, AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his laudatory review of Dan Quayle's "Standing Firm" (May 15), Hugh Hewitt 
endorses Quayle's claim that ". . . this nation's media elite has abandoned the 
old virtues of journalism; including objectivity, fairness, balance, context . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 Just when was that mythically Golden Age of objective journalism in American 
that conservative media critics always invoke? The turn of the century, when 
yellow journalism reigned and William Randolph Hearst used his newspaper empire 
to incite jingoistic support for the Spanish American War? The '30s, when the 
L.A. Times sabotaged socialist Upton Sinclair's run for governor of California? 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that Hewitt, Quayle and other conservatives simply equate objectivity 
and fairness with conservative biases, and that they define bias as any 
viewpoint that contradicts their own. To be sure, liberals are not immune from 
the equal but opposite bias, although it is more a liberal than a conservative 
principle to be skeptical of self-righteous claims to objectivity by any 
political camp including one's own.

STAGE WATCH: GLENDALE BANKS ON TWO SMALL THEATER TROUPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Glendale Redevelopment Agency's decision to allocate $2.5 million to each 
of two small theater companies could help transform a city that was virtually 
devoid of professional theater a few years ago into one of the liveliest 
theater districts in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Both groups want larger quarters than their current 99-seat houses. The older 
is the Colony -- now based on Riverside Drive in Silver Lake -- which has 
focused on 20th-Century work, including some premieres. The other beneficiary 
of the redevelopment largess is A Noise Within, a classical company already 
located in downtown Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The two groups will receive identical amounts, pending approval of their 
detailed proposals. They'll join the recently restored and reopened Alex 
Theatre, a 1,460-seat hall operated by Theatre Corp. of America, which serves 
as the beachhead for the budding theater district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other cities have revitalized their downtowns around cinemas," said Jeanne 
Armstrong, executive director of the Glendale Redevelopment Agency. But judging 
from the 14,000 subscriptions that were sold for the first season at the Alex, 
she added, "we think live theater has an audience." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a different kind of audience from the cinema-drawn crowds who flock to 
such places as Santa Monica's 3rd Street Promenade or Pasadena's Old Town, 
neither of which Glendale is emulating, Armstrong said. Glendale draws "an 
older audience that eats out more." In Glendale, traditionally known as a 
"family town, unexciting," continued Armstrong, "people don't have to put up 
with throngs of the younger element." Not that Armstrong wants to discourage 
movie theaters from moving in too -- "we'd like more," she said -- but live 
theater is the top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-year-old Colony -- a recent recipient of the Los Angeles Drama Critics 
Circle's Margaret Harford Award for continuing achievement -- is examining two 
sites on Maryland Avenue, one block east of busy Brand Boulevard. One of them 
would occupy what is now a parking lot adjacent to the Alex Theatre and would 
be connected to the Alex by plazas. The other is on the east side of Maryland, 
across from the northern entrance to the upscale Exchange shopping complex. A 
third possible site is south of the Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colony's goal is to open a structure with a 299-seat theater and a 99-seat 
second stage by the fall of 1996. Both spaces would have thrust stages. The 
estimated price tag is $4 million, so the Colony would have to raise at least 
another $1.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Farther south on Brand Boulevard, A Noise Within hopes to stay in the former 
Masonic Temple, where it has presented classical theater in repertory since 
1991. But the group wants to move from the third floor to larger quarters -- a 
hall with 300-500 seats, with a thrust stage -- on the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment money will immediately pay for a sprinkler system in A Noise 
Within's current hall, without which the group wouldn't be able to open its 
next season in the fall. Beyond that, however, the group plans to use the first 
chunk of money to study whether to remain in the old building or to go 
elsewhere in Glendale. Whatever the eventual destination, at least an 
additional $2 million will be pursued in a capital campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 INVENTING THE FUTURE: In the wake of the Glendale developments, the timing 
could hardly be better -- Audrey Skirball-Kenis Theatre is sponsoring a 
conference devoted to encouraging the growth of mid-sized theater, next weekend 
at UCLA. "Inventing the Future: Models and Mandates for Mid-Sized Theater" will 
feature a variety of panels, papers, and speakers including some notable 
out-of-towners as well as mainstays of the local scene. Admission is free. For 
reservations, call (310) 284-9027; for further information, call (310) 
284-8965. 
</P>
<P>
 SANTA BARBARA WATCH: The Lobero Theatre in Santa Barbara is using two 
production companies to fill the gap in its theatrical programming caused by 
the recent departure of the Pasadena Playhouse tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Ed Gaynes is taking his revue of novelty songs, "Crazy Words, Crazy 
Tunes," to the Lobero for 10 performances beginning July 22. The show became 
L.A.'s longest-running musical when it played two small theaters in the San 
Fernando Valley, then briefly played the Westwood Playhouse earlier this year. 
Gaynes is offering a two-for-one deal to anyone who has unredeemed tickets to 
the aborted Pasadena Playhouse season at the Lobero. He hopes to bring in other 
shows later. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Simon fans, take note: The Contemporary Music Theatre of Santa Barbara 
plans to launch a three-play season with what will probably be the area 
premiere of the Simon/Marvin Hamlisch musical "The Goodbye Girl," Nov. 11-27. 
Scheduled for next spring are "Closer Than Ever" and "Falsettos." Unlike 
Gaynes, the Contemporary Music Theatre does not work with an ongoing Equity 
contract, but the group has used the union's Guest Artist contract. 
</P>
<P>
 A bigger production of "The Goodbye Girl" is being discussed as a possibility 
for next spring at the Alex Theatre in Glendale, according to the company that 
licenses the show, which lasted for only 188 performances on Broadway in 1992. 
Ironically, the Alex musicals are produced by Theatre Corp. of America -- the 
same outfit that withdrew its Pasadena Playhouse shows from the Lobero.

ON THE RECORD: PERIOD STYLE, STRETCHING ACROSS THREE CENTURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Word has been beamed from London for the past two years about the wonders of 
the New Queen's Hall Orchestra, a period-instrument orchestra. But the period 
in question is not the Baroque, Classical or mid-Romantic era, the latter 
representing the furthest the antiquarians are likely to venture. 
</P>
<P>
 No, these people attempt to resurrect the sound and spirit of the early 
decades of our own century, when a like-named, similarly constitituted ensemble 
was playing Elgar and Vaughan Williams (as well as "the classics") on gut 
strings, narrow-bore brass, reedy French bassoons and dulcet wooden flutes: the 
instruments of the time, although the flutes had been replaced by metal 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The sounds produced by these skilled players are indeed lovely in their debut 
recording, a Vaughan Williams program (Argo 440 116). 
</P>
<P>
 The full ensemble is heard in "Norfolk Rhapsody" and "In the Fen Country," 
while strings dominate the "Tallis" Fantasia, "The Lark Ascending," the 
Variants on "Dives and Lazarus" and the "Greensleeves" Fantasia. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as The Duke said, "It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing." And 
swing the orchestra most emphatically does not under Barry Wordsworth's limp 
baton. It is less a matter of slow tempos (although some are decidedly that) 
than of lack of rhythmic incisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, period pianism has rarely had it so good as in the Chopin 
recital presented by the inventive Alexei Lubimov, employing an 1837 Erard 
piano of the kind Chopin himself might have used for his four Ballades, 
"Barcarolle," Berceuse and Opus 49 Fantasy -- the program performed here with 
such stunning expressivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The instrument itself has plenty of ping and an unexpectedly powerful bass. 
Above all, however, it has a rich -- not so much strong as multi-colored -- 
mid-range. And it has, on this occasion, an artist capable at once of bringing 
out the piano's capabilities while refreshing some of Chopin's most familiar 
creations (Erato 45990). 
</P>
<P>
 Among the various recent period recordings of Baroque music, three stand out. 
</P>
<P>
 By creating a different continuo background for virtually each of the six 
works presented, Vivaldi's normally ho-hum Cello Sonatas can take on unexpected 
luster. 
</P>
<P>
 The variety may be there in the music, but is effectively hidden in 
performances less searching and accomplished than those presented by the Dutch 
cellist Pieter Wispelwey and a continuo group comprising lutes, guitar, 
harpsichord, organ and a second cello. 
</P>
<P>
 The slow movements in particular abound in otherworldly harmonies, but 
Wispelwey and friends don't slight the rhythmic drive of the Vivaldian fast 
sections, which here find the composer less insistent on the 
rushing-scales-and-striding-arpeggios formula that can make his concertos 
monotonous -- an altogether distinguished release of music that has not 
received its interpretive due in the past (Channel Classics 6294). 
</P>
<P>
 The music by Henry Purcell played at the funeral of the short-lived Queen Mary 
in Westminster Abbey in 1695, as well as a number of his works, mostly vocal, 
written earlier but suitable to the occasion, are presented with splendid pomp 
and gravity by the Winchester Cathedral Choir and instrumentalists -- brass, 
strings and drums -- expertly directed by organist David Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Included among the 17 numbers are such gloriously agonized chromatic laments 
as "Man that is born of woman," "In the midst of life," "My beloved spake" and 
"Rejoice in the Lord alway."  
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty of recorded competition for that ultimate example of J.S. 
Bach's polyphonic genius, his "Musical Offering." But there's always room for 
an interpretation as vigorous and imaginative as that newly recorded by Carlo 
Chiarappa and his Ravenna-based Accademia Bizantina, instrumentalists as 
comfortable playing Berio on modern instruments as Bach on period 
reproductions. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, happily, one of those groups that permits itself as much 
ornamentation and rhythmic freedom as the music can accommodate, a practice 
which bears particularly rich fruit in a lushly emotional traversal of the 
great Trio Sonata by flutist Eva Katharina Dumig, violinist Chiarappa and 
harpsichordist Ottavio Dantone (Denon 75861).

 This is a curiosity in at least two senses. King, arguably the world's most 
popular blues singer, doesn't deliver a single blues number among the 10 
tracks; he is presented primarily as a ballad singer.His guitar is heard too 
infrequently. As for his partner, she has some creditable moments here, and 
relatively few attacks of the synthetic hysterics to which she is subject. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapport between the pair works well, though there is not much of an 
attempt to harmonize effectively. The backups vary widely from cut to cut, with 
background vocals here and there and capable arrangements by Doug Katsaros. 
Some of the songs are odd choices, however. An example: the Astaire-Rogers 1936 
hit from the Irving Berlin songbook, "I'm Putting All My Eggs in One Basket." 
</P>
<P>
 For a sampling of how this team works best and least pretentiously, listen to 
the first chorus of "At Last," with Schuur and King taking alternate eight bar 
strains. True, after B.B.'s guitar solo there's a duet passage in which Schurr 
goes off the rails briefly, but it's still agreeable listening. Albums are 
rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars (good, 
recommended), four stars (excellent).

SOUND & VISION: POP MUSIC; DELIA'S GONE, BUT MAN IN BLACK'S BACK 
</P>

By CHRIS WILLMAN, Chris Willman's Sound & Vision column appears periodically in 
Calendar.

<P>
 You can bet on it: In our lifetime, there will be but one man who gets his 
music video rejected by MTV because of violence and purported bad taste and can 
lay claim to being a regularly featured speaker at Billy Graham crusades. 
Ladies and gentlemen: Johnny Cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The Man in Black goes really noir with "Delia's Gone," the first video 
promoting his new Rick Rubin-produced acoustic folk-country album. Cover girl 
Kate Moss co-stars as Delia, who gets real, real gone, as in dead, and we all 
know you can't get much more waif-ish than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss starts off the video deceased, and it only gets worse for her from there, 
as we even see Cash shoveling dirt into an open grave, where it lands on her 
fresh, white-clad corpse. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless we're seeing the video on MTV. Its standards and practices department 
had a problem with that dirt-shoveling shot, so the re-edit that was 
subsequently accepted by the network substitutes an actionless shot of the 
dearly departed Moss with some soil already atop her. The fine line of 
luridness between seeing the dirt falling and the dirt having already fallen 
escapes us, but it's no biggie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Delia's Gone" is the top clip assessed in this month's Sound & Vision, where 
currently airing music videos are reviewed and rated on a 0-100 scale. Also on 
view this time is another video starring a super-model, John Mellencamp's "Wild 
Night," which does not require leading lady Cindy Crawford to play dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Cash, "Delia's Gone." So whom did Cash meet on all those trips to 
Folsom Prison? Henry (as in "Portrait of a Serial Killer")? He looks 
uncharacteristically frightening, coming at the camera with a piece of rope, 
re-creating the way his murder ballad's doomed narrator went after his cheatin' 
fiancee, tying her to a chair before unloading two shells into her. Can you say 
gangsta-country ? 
</P>
<P>
 This could have turned out undeniably tacky -- like that recent Tom Petty 
video that had him foolishly messing about with a corpse played by Kim 
Basinger. But there's no cheek here. Director Anton Corbijn has burnished this 
brief (2:18), black-and-white video with the haunting look of a real American 
Gothic, alternating a graveyard windstorm with the sepia stillness of the 
murder scene. 80 
</P>
<P>
 John Mellencamp with Me'Shell Ndege-Ocello, "Wild Night." Who better to track 
the comings and goings of a long "Wild Night" than a taxi driver who sees and 
hears all? And who better to portray the gritty life that would likely be a 
cabbie's than . . . Cindy Crawford? Yet here she is, sexily piloting her own 
Yellow Cab around L.A. after hours, the anti-Bickle, hoping -- we can only 
figure -- that someday a Noxema rain will come and wash the scum off these 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellencamp and NdegeOcello's reasonable (if superfluous) duet of the Van 
Morrison chestnut just can't compete with the sight of America's foremost uber 
model cheerfully chauffeuring scads of fares around the central city, waving 
and laughing and hanging out at that Hollywood Boulevard chicken shack, looking 
fetching as ever in a white T and never getting held up. First Sandra Bullock, 
now Crawford, at the helm of various forms of L.A. public transportation . . . 
What's up? Nice try, you sneaky city planners, but we're still not giving up 
our cars . 55 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Loeb & Nine Stories, "Stay (I Missed You)." What a great way to do a 
music video: One single tracking shot around an apartment, following a 
confessional singer-songwriter who boldly confronts the camera with all the 
verve and vulnerability she can muster for the full length of the song, sans 
camera tricks, edits or interruptions of any sort. Just great, we repeat . . . 
except we don't buy a second of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Loeb's stream of consciousness, directed at an errant lover, is precious 
enough on its own, without the added sight of her wringing her hands and 
emoting directly into the camera lens with a little more familiarity than you'd 
hope for from a freshman artist. Never mind the feminine-yet-hip all-black 
duds, the unfurnished-but-hip New York apartment, the grandma-ish-yet-hip 
eyeglasses that might be freshly ripped off MTV veejay Kennedy's face. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Ethan Hawke -- who pushed Loeb, his still-unsigned NYC neighbor, onto 
the "Reality Bites" soundtrack, from which this surprise Top 10 hit sprang -- 
also directed the video. His first instinct, to have her go for in-your-face 
"honesty," may have been good, but if Hawke ever overacted on screen the way 
he's encouraged his charge to here he might never get another job. Intimacy 
with the camera hasn't seemed quite this scary in a video since Sinead O'Connor 
shed that famous tear a few years back. 55 
</P>
<P>
 Frente, "Bizarre Love Triangle." Egad! It's more of that dreaded intimacy. New 
Order's new-wave standard gets the unplugged treatment from this freshman 
combo, and it's almost to be pulled off, but the song -- strong as it was -- 
begins to sound just the slightest bit, well, silly removed from the 
impassively electro band treatment and treated anew as tender, forthright folk 
ballad. 
</P>
<P>
 And no one with the slightly nasal -- if pretty -- adolescent-sounding voice 
that Angie Hart sings in does herself that many favors by shooting a video that 
consists pretty much entirely of a close-up of her face, at least not with the 
nose ring so very dominating the frame. 53 
</P>
<P>
 Snoop Doggy Dogg, "Doggy Dogg World." We just can't kill the beast -- '70s 
fever, that is: Smiley faces are back. Union 76 is suddenly promoting those 
orange Styrofoam antenna balls again. And Snoop's latest video is populated not 
just with his burgeoning Afro but a retro roomful of extras' follicular wide 
loads. Truly, everything round is new again. 
</P>
<P>
 The funk-generation nostalgia extends here to Tempts-like male vocal groups 
seen backing Dogg's typically laconic rap, and "Super-fly"-style duds for 
wardrobe. Curious that Snoop's glorified vision of a "Doggy Dogg World" would 
hark back so unabashedly to the Scooby Doo epoch. 53 
</P>
<P>
 Meat Loaf, "Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer Than They Are." 
And songs on the latest Meat Loaf album may appear lon ger than they are. Here 
we have another of songwriter Jim Steinman's hyper-nostalgic reveries from "Bat 
Out of Hell II," done up dirge style this time. In successive verses, Mr. Loaf 
recalls the childhood buddy he lost in a crash, and the babe he lost his 
innocence to in a back seat. (No one ever uses a bed in a Steinman song when 
there's a Coupe de Ville around, or dies of natural causes when motorized 
hara-kiri's an alternative.) 
</P>
<P>
 Both these unrelated boomer reminiscences are rendered on film as literally as 
possible: the little friend's small plane nose dive, with Robert Patrick ("T2") 
looking on as dismayed dad; the narrator's small convertible tryst with a 
hilariously anachronistic but bodacious model. Watching this beautiful hooey, 
you, too, might get nostalgic -- for Loaf's first, infinitely superior, 
video-less "Bat Out of Hell" album. But, as Steinman would say, that was long 
ago and it was far away, and it was so much better than it is today. 47

 Singer Vince Gill holds onto the top spot of The Times' Southern California 
country chart, beating out a strong field with his "When Love Finds You" album. 
Look for it to be one of the summer's biggest country hits. All-4-One's ballad 
"I Swear," the pop singles chart leader for the past two months, may have 
already clinched pop's single-of-the-year title. "The Lion King" soundtrack is 
No. 2, but with the film drawing huge crowds, soundtrack sales should climb 
enough this week for it to be crowned king of the pop chart. TOP 10 ALBUMS

POP EYE: FROM 'RUST NEVER SLEEPS' TO 'SLEEPS WITH ANGELS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his suicide note, Kurt Cobain quoted a famous line from a Neil Young song: 
"It's better to burn out than to fade away." 
</P>
<P>
 Young has written an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran singer-songwriter -- rather than one of Cobain's grunge peers -- 
will become the first major rock figure to pay tribute in song to the Nirvana 
leader, whose death in April shook the rock world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sleeps With Angels," the title song of the Young album that will come out on 
Aug. 3, was written shortly after Cobain's death in April. A sonically dark, 
disjointed descendant of Young's "Tonight's the Night" -- his 1974 classic that 
also deals with death and loss -- the song addresses the confusion and 
restlessness often associated with the music and lives of Cobain and his wife, 
Courtney Love. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a teen queen  
</P>
<P>
 She saw the dark side of life  
</P>
<P>
 He made things happen  
</P>
<P>
 But when he did it that night  
</P>
<P>
 He ran up the phone bill  
</P>
<P>
 She moved around town to town  
</P>
<P>
 He sleeps with angels  
</P>
<P>
 He's always on someone's mind  
</P>
<P>
 He sleeps with angels tonight  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The death at 27 of Cobain -- who attended one of Young's Greek Theatre 
concerts in 1992 with Love -- touched Young deeply, says Young's manager, 
Elliot Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's definitely an influence on at least the one song and maybe others (on 
the album)," says Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 There is certainly a sense that in places on the new album Young is speaking 
to a younger audience. The song "Prime of Life" makes a case for youthful 
optimism, while "Driveby," in contrast, raises the specter of random, 
unexplainable tragedy that punctures that very sense of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fitting that Young identify with this troubled, restless generation. 
</P>
<P>
 The mercurial Young, at 48, is old enough to have been Cobain's father, and 
has in fact been a musical father figure for some younger rockers. As a 
consistently independent, vital performer, he's been accorded the status of 
"godfather of alternative rock" and has relished chances to work with some of 
those he has inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 He handpicked Sonic Youth and Pearl Jam as opening acts on recent concert 
tours, and it was the prospect of jamming with Young that lured a reluctant 
Eddie Vedder to the MTV Video Music Awards last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Young had apparently even tried to get in touch with Cobain in the wake of his 
near-fatal overdose in Rome in March, according to Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called me to see if we could get ahold of Kurt," he says. "I spoke with 
(Cobain's manager), tried to get a current phone number for him. But this all 
turned out to be the day before he died and Neil never got in touch with him."

 COMING UP ROSES: The Pink Floyd shows at the Rose Bowl in April brought a lot 
of complaints about parking hassles and jammed aisles and tunnels at the 
stadium -- the loudest complaints coming from Brian Murphy, president of the 
concerts' promoter, Avalon Attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Murphy says that the problems have been dealt with for the scheduled 
October shows by the Eagles and the Rolling Stones.At his insistence, shuttle 
service from outlying parking lots will be increased and parking and usher 
staffs are being boosted for the shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagles manager Irving Azoff adds that there will be some "tailgate party" type 
events planned for before the show to lure fans to the site early in order to 
spread out the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Both point to the relatively smooth handling of traffic and parking at the 
World Cup soccer games currently being held at the Rose Bowl as proof that it's 
possible to make a stadium event fairly trouble-free. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can get 90,000 people in and out for soccer games, there's no reason 
for us to have problems with 65,000," says Murphy. Steve Hochman

RECORD RACK: MINIMALIST HOOTENANNY FROM INDEPENDENT BECK; (***) BECK, "ONE FOOT 
IN THE GRAVE"; K  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warm, folk-blues finger-picking, the strings out of tune and buzzing, the 
voice a droopy-eyed drawl. No, it's not a batch of newly discovered Mississippi 
John Hurt masters -- it's L.A.'s bohemian hip-hop folkie art-monster Beck, with 
another in his string of follow-ups to February's major-label debut "Mellow 
Gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Under his contract with Geffen, Beck still gets to make records for 
independent companies, and in this volley, for the hermit-like Olympia label K 
Records, he holes up for a hootenanny with some Northwest pals who play some 
drums and bass and raise their voices in free, if off-key jubilation. There 
aren't any stop-in-your-tracks anthems a la "Loser" in Beck's playhouse, just 
modestly engaging, minimalist tunes and a couple of experimental squalls. 
</P>
<P>
 It positions Beck as a cross between Woody Guthrie and Syd Barrett -- cogent 
and stubbornly spacey, lethally alert behind the somnolent facade created by 
his sleepy murmur. Beck picks his way through a cultural landscape whose 
structures no longer provide direction in life and love, and his battle to 
maintain his bearings yields funny and touching scenarios, whether he sounds 
like Lightnin' Hopkins, Ray Davies or the guy from Pavement. Rather than 
put-ons, the periodic evocations of the blues' spiritual fundamentals become 
solid steppingstones in treacherous waters. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

 *** Shanice, "21 . . . Ways to Grow," Motown. Many young female singers would 
like to grow up to be Janet Jackson, but few have as good a shot at it as 
Shanice.On this coming-of-age album, the veteran recording artist celebrates 
adulthood with her most mature effort yet, a cohesive collection of playful 
hip-hop, come-hither power ballads and aggressive funk.

 SMALL FACES: Though he'll probably be tied up in appeals for ages after losing 
his London lawsuit to get out of his contract with Sony Music, George Michael 
is getting back to work on his long-delayed "Trojan Souls" project -- writing 
and producing songs to be sung by others, including Elton John, k.d. lang and 
Aretha Franklin. Fans can also look for a concert special drawn from Michael's 
December AIDS benefit at Wembley Arena, featuring guest appearances by lang and 
Simply Red's Mick Hucknall, with David Bowie as emcee. The show premieres on 
the Disney Channel on July 24. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 With Bret Michaels mending from his auto accident last month, Poison is 
gearing up to record its next album -- its first with new guitarist Blues 
Saraceno. Michaels is said to be healing well, considering that he broke his 
nose and thumb, lost four teeth and chipped his collarbone, among other 
injuries. The album is due next spring. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We're surprised it took this long: An L.A. rapper calling himself Steel P has 
written and produced a song about the O.J. Simpson saga. Titled "Illegal 
Procedure" and performed by rapper D-Nurse, the song makes no case for the 
former football star's guilt or innocence. Steel P has previously recorded 
"tributes" to Tonya Harding and Heidi Fleiss. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 AND ONE MORE THING: If we were teaching English literature, we'd have to give 
an F to Stevie Nicks for her book report in the current issue of Rolling Stone, 
where she raves about the book "Vindication" by Frances Sherwood. Nicks gushes 
that it's about "Frankenstein" author Mary Shelley (it's actually about 
Shelley's mother, writer Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin), and talks about Shelley's 
having a wild affair with Lord Byron (she did nothing of the sort; her 
half-sister did) and that Shelley's "mind was wrapped up in a totally crazy guy 
(Byron)" (actually, her mate was the generally sane, admired poet Percy Bysshe 
Shelley). Byron, for the record, isn't even mentioned in the book. Maybe next 
time Nicks should use Cliffs Notes.*

BOWL EATS: DON'T FORGET THE TABLECLOTH 
</P>

 Brahms and Gershwin are great, but some of us are more inclined to use 
Hollywood Bowl as an excuse to have a picnic. A musical feast with good friends 
is a wonderful way to spend a summer evening. For some reason, a baguette and 
some good cheese or even a bag of corn curls tastes fabulous under the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 But you don't have to settle for anything that ordinary. It seems that almost 
every chef in town has added takeout to his or her menu. Unless you are 
unusually ambitious, though, it's best to limit your picnic fare to dishes that 
can be picked up on the way to the Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some suggestions, ranging from some good buys to splurges. Keep in 
mind that most places require 24 hours' notice: 
</P>
<P>
 * You'll have plenty of daily fat grams to spare if your picnic fare hails 
from Gratis, a 12-week-old Brentwood restaurant and takeout place. Everything 
on the menu is fat free, even the triple-layered chocolate cake. Deli cases are 
filled with an array of salads. Entrees include soft tacos with vegetarian 
chili ($6.75); fusilli with ratatouille sauce ($5.95) and a marinated grilled 
vegetable sandwich ($5.95). Gratis, 11658 San Vicente Blvd., (310) 571-2345.  
</P>
<P>
 * Feel like something spicy? The India's Tandoori mini-chain offers a picnic 
basket filled with such entrees as samosa and chicken from the tandoor oven 
($8.50); shrimp tandoori ($9.50), lamb boti and shish kebabs ($10.50), chicken 
tikka ($9.50) and a vegetarian basket ($7.50). Baskets come with linen and 
utensils, returnable with a $25 deposit. India's Tandoori, five locations, 
(800) INDIA - LA . 
</P>
<P>
 * The Tuscan take-away Rosti, an offshoot of nearby Toscana, offers several 
homey Italian baskets to choose from: grilled veggies on focaccia ($9.95), 
grilled chicken breast on greens ($9.95), half-chicken with roasted potatoes 
($14.50), breaded chicken breast with spinach ($12.75) and chef's salad 
($8.95). Rosti, 908 S. Barrington Ave., Brentwood, (310) 447-8695.  
</P>
<P>
 * Even the gold-leaf bento boxes are beautiful at Duet in Glendale. Give at 
least 24 hours' notice and the staff will put together such things as a 
Malaysian chicken satay, shrimp and vegetable spring rolls, crab coleslaw, 
charred sashimi salad or a Thai cucumber, oyster and mushroom salad. The boxes 
can be custom-filled too, and range from $10 to $15. Duet Restaurant and Bar, 
900 N. Central Ave., Glendale, (818) 240-0808.  
</P>
<P>
 * From the friendliest restaurant group in town (Chez Melange, Fino, Depot, 
Descanso, Misto) comes the Bubba box -- a choice of a roast beef, turkey or 
vegetarian sandwich, potato salad, fruit salad, brownie and Diet Coke -- at the 
Bubba price of $10.95. Also available are the Misto, choice of quiche or 
chicken salad ($14.95); the Melange, chicken breast or smoked salmon on a bagel 
($19.95), and Chef Peter's Picnic, poached salmon or grilled tri-tip ($25.95). 
Picnic boxes from any in the group are available through Misto. Misto Caffe, 
24558 Hawthorne Blvd., Torrance , (310) 375-3608.  
</P>
<P>
 * "Our tuna salad ($15.50) is perfect for smuggling small recording devices 
into the Hollywood Bowl," explains the Daily Grill in its take-away brochure. 
For medium recording devices you might consider the poached salmon ($23). Other 
entrees to take away include Caesar salad with charbroiled chicken ($14.50), 
top sirloin in Jamaican sauce ($21.50), barbecued chicken breast ($23.50), 
pan-fried chicken breast ($17.50), ahi tuna with fresh salsa ($22.50) or 
charbroiled swordfish with Szechwan sauce ($25.50). Daily Grill, 100 N. La 
Cienega Blvd., (310) 659-3100, and five other locations.  
</P>
<P>
 * Impress your friends and pick up an elegant picnic basket from Xiomara. The 
French bistro has put together four menus and named them after major Pasadena 
streets. Choose from the Raymond, chicken sandwich ($16.50); the Fair Oaks, 
slices of country duck with foie gras , and wild mushroom terrines ($23); the 
Orange Grove, curried seafood pasta ($26), or the Huntington, poached salmon 
with angel hair pasta ($29). Xiomara, 69 N. Raymond Ave., Pasadena, (818) 
796-2520.  
</P>
<P>
 * At Pinot Bistro, chef-owner Joachim Splichal's picnic fare includes salmon 
with cold grilled fennel and cuke salad ($26.50), peppered beef sandwich ($24) 
and roasted chicken with potato salad ($21). Pinot Bistro, 12969 Ventura Blvd., 
Studio City , (818) 990-0500.  
</P>
<P>
 * Some of the best -- and most expensive -- picnic menus are offered at 
Splichal's other restaurant, Patina, where he has named the selections after 
composers. Choose from the Chopin, broiled medallion of beef with barley and 
lentil salad ($39.50); the Wagner, Chinese shrimp salad with spicy noodles 
($29.50); the Mozart, seared salmon with asparagus and red bell pepper coulis 
($28); the Beethoven, roasted chicken with red bliss potatoes ($25); the Bach, 
chicken sandwich with red bliss potatoes ($18.50), and the Vivaldi, lobster 
salad ($24.50). Patina, 5955 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles (213) 467-1108.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not all: On a more casual level, the crusty whole rotisserie 
chicken from Zankou in Hollywood is terrific -- it comes with a couple of pita 
rounds and a pungent garlic sauce. . . . A vegetarian sandwich from Tarzana 
Armenian Deli or one of those great sub sandwiches from Pietro's in Pasadena 
would do just fine too. . . . Or how about Asian takeout? Maybe cartons of 
spicy chile noodles from Mandarin Deli in Chinatown or cold soba noodles from 
Daisuke in Little Tokyo. . . . Or consider the Vietnamese shrimp spring rolls 
from Hoa's House of Noodles in Reseda. . . . Or why not bring along a goat 
cheese torta from Say Cheese in Silver Lake or one of the chicken tamales or 
overstuffed tortas from El Gallo Giro in Huntington Park? 
</P>
<P>
 The choices really are limitless. Or you could pack that bag of corn curls.*

 Stanley Kubrick's 1968 ultimate vision of the now not-so-distant future became 
a landmark allegory, famed for its stupendous visuals and challenge to the 
intellect, despite becoming abstract to the point of evasiveness at the finish. 
Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood play astronauts bound for Jupiter in search of 
human intelligence when they become locked in mortal combat with Hal, their 
rebellious computer.Kubrick, who wrote the film with Arthur C. Clarke, has 
helpfully explained that upon entering Jupiter's orbit, Dullea enters another 
dimension, dies and is reborn, tracing man's "ascent from ape to angel."

 Whatever might be flawed in Oliver Stone's searing, full-torque 1986 war 
movie, one thing is right: it's alive.It broils, snaps and explodes with 
energy. Condensed from two years of battles and political upheavals in El 
Salvador, the events fly pass at a murderous clip, hurtling you along almost 
demonically. The movie is based on the experiences of combat photojournalist 
Richard Boyles (James Wood) as a paragon of sleazy outlaw journalism. There are 
some brief moments of sentimentality, but "Salvador" may be the rare political 
thriller where the psychology moves you as much as the history. With Jim 
Belushi and John Savage (USA Monday at 10 a.m.). Michael Wilmington

 Allison Anders' low-budget 1992 independent film, about an all-female family 
of three in the desert stop of Laramie, N.M., gives you a sense of the flow and 
flux of towns, their isolation, lassitude and entrapment.There's real 
shrewdness and compassion in its depiction of ordinary lives, but also a 
curious, lyrical sense of romance and mystery. The main characters -- waitress 
Nora (Brooke Adams) and her daughters Trude (Ione Skye) and Shade (Fairuza 
Balk) -- are wonderfully drawn. These women are the focus: the men in their 
lives are both the problem and the potential escape hatch (TMC Thursday at 2:40 
a.m.). Michael Wilmington

CRITICS' PICKS: 'THE FIRM'

 The powers behind this 1993 summer blockbuster have carefully protected the 
core qualities of the John Grisham novel while radically rejiggering its plot 
line. The result is top-drawer melodrama, a polished example of commercial 
movie-making that manages to improve upon the original while retaining its 
best-selling spirit.As the film's hotshot young attorney, Tom Cruise was the 
obvious choice, but the film not only pairs him with Gene Hackman as his legal 
mentor and Jeanne Tripplehorn as his loving wife but also fills in the 
background with the strongest and most varied group of supporting actors in 
memory -- e.g., an Oscar-nominated Holly Hunter. Although Tripplehorn is put 
off by the Stepford quality of some of the corporate wives of the Memphis firm 
wooing Cruise and thinks maybe things are too good to be true, her ambitious 
husband is unworried by such surface perfection. Director Sydney Pollack 
deserves an extra nod for showing how emotional shading and subtlety can be 
worked into big-ticket items (HBO Saturday at 8 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; WHEN 'CLARISSA' (A.K.A. MELISSA) SPEAKS, TEENS LISTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Outfitted in a glamorous, slinky maroon dress, Melissa Joan Hart lounges on 
the carpeted back steps of Los Angeles' famed Pantages Theatre, where she's 
just made an appearance on Nickelodeon's "Kids' Choice Awards." Hart bares 
little resemblance to her alter-ego, the loquacious Clarissa who explains it 
all to 'tweeners throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Hart speaks, the ebullience she gives Clarissa shines through. When 
she proudly holds up her right hand, middle finger sparkling with a 
ruby-and-diamond ring, and proclaims it the only ring she's ever gotten from a 
boy, there's little doubt that she's every bit a teen as Clarissa. 
</P>
<P>
 By next fall, both are moving on, up and out. Nick's popular "Clarissa 
Explains It All," part of the Saturday-night "Snick" block, is heading to CBS, 
possibly as a prime-time midseason replacement. But that doesn't mean she's 
disappearing from Nick. This summer, new episodes shot as part of "Clarissa's" 
original 65 episodes for Nick will air on the cable channel, which will also 
strip in weekday repeats, beginning in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, which creator Mitchell Kriegman calls "a family sitcom from the 
inside out, with Clarissa talking to the camera about her family," will 
continue to run on Nickelodeon indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clarissa's moving out of her parents' house," Hart explains of the revamped 
show, originally set in a small rural town, where the show focused on Clarissa, 
her family and her famed sibling rivalry with brother Ferguson (Jason Zimbler). 
"And into the city. She'll get a job at a big-city newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 Clarissa, Kriegman says, is "one big empowerment fantasy. Both girls and boys 
watch this show, because here's a girl who's got it all together. She may have 
problems, but she's always got a plan. As a role model, that's excellent." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the 18-year-old Hart has a plan of her own. Along with her parents, 
and her own five siblings -- which include a new baby -- she's moving out of 
bustling Manhattan and into a sprawling country home in upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the new baby and everything, we weren't sure what we were going to do," 
Hart says. "We talked about getting a bigger town home in Manhattan, where I 
could live on the bottom floor, with a separate entrance and still go upstairs 
to eat and visit whenever I wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
 After much searching, the family settled on a home in a more rural area, where 
Hart has a separate residence on the same property. She's prepared, though, to 
live part-time in Los Angeles, where the CBS version of "Clarissa" will shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to an album, Hart's made two videos: "Take My Brother, Please!" (a 
look at sibling relationships) and "Dating." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, whose high school education came via a tutor on the Nick "Clarissa" set 
in Florida, tries to live by Clarissa's code: "The big message is to not give 
in to peer pressure and not to let just anyone influence what you do and don't 
let them tell you what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's had significant influence on her own siblings, who all share acting 
aspirations (well, not the new baby -- yet). All have appeared in commercials 
and a younger sister is currently in the Broadway production of "Tommy." Hart 
started acting at the age of 4 and worked in both television and theater before 
landing the role of Clarissa. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart acknowledges that while there's a lot going on right now, she's going to 
take things one at a time. Currently, the recent high school grad is with 
friends on a month-long biking tour of Paris. When fall rolls around, she's 
prepared to don some of Clarissa's trend-setting teen garb and start talking to 
the camera again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clarissa Explains It All" airs 8-8:30 p.m. Saturdays during the "Snick" block 
on Nickelodeon.

JUST CALL HIM TAFKAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As I was listening to some music at the house one evening last week, my 
roommate walked in and declared: "That sounds like Weird Androgynous Sign." 
</P>
<P>
 It took me a few moments to realize he was referring to that purple person 
from Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 I've noticed that your staff has continuously struggled with how to refer to 
this pop musician since he decided he was to be known as . So I suggest that 
instead of "the pop star formerly known as . . . " or "we once knew him as . . 
. ," perhaps the easiest way to handle his logo-identification would be to call 
him Weird Androgynous Sign.

SMOKE SIGNALS

<TEXT>

 In her article "Blame It on Bizet" (Off-Centerpiece, June 19), Juliann Garey 
goes to great lengths to explain how movies and television shows continue to 
encourage young people to smoke by having their role models puff away on 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The article totally ignores the considerable impact the Entertainment 
Industries Council Inc. has made through its distribution of "Spotlight on 
Depiction of Health and Social Issues," a notebook intended to provide 
clear-cut, accurate information to creators of television and film productions 
when they deal with such health or social issues as tobacco, alcohol and other 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 We can point to many productions where the use of tobacco was influenced by 
information contained in the notebook: 
</P>
<P>
 * During the last season of "Cheers," Rebecca (Kirstie Alley) took up smoking 
during a period of intense psychological pressure in her life, as a coping 
device. Several weeks later, one of her cigarettes accidentally burned down the 
bar. She never smoked again. 
</P>
<P>
 * In "Hearts Afire," female lead Georgie Ann (Markie Post) was introduced as 
an abrasive obsessive-compulsive who chain-smoked. With each episode, executive 
producer and writer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason had Georgie Ann slowly quit 
smoking (for her sake and that of those breathing her secondhand smoke). 
</P>
<P>
 * Last season on "Murphy Brown," when Candice Bergen's character, a former 
smoker, entered Phil's Bar & Grill with her newborn baby, she kicked a smoker 
out to protect her infant from secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 * In "Mrs. Doubtfire," an actor (Robin Williams) refuses to do voices for a 
movie cartoon with a smoking gag unless he is allowed to provide an 
anti-tobacco message in his dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The notebook is the result of 10 years of work by the creative community and 
experts in the field of each issue area addressed. Among issues soon to be 
added are violence -- addressing concerns legislators and others have brought 
up recently -- aging, child abuse, inhalant use, environmental protection and 
physical disabilities.

 I have only four questions for the film industry: 
</P>
<P>
 * Have you got so much smoke in your eyes that it is obscuring your view of 
the very real ugliness and pain of the victims and the loved ones who must 
endure watching them die of lung cancer? 
</P>
<P>
 * How do you romanticize my visiting my brother in the oncology unit of Long 
Beach Community Hospital? 
</P>
<P>
 * Is there anything sexy about his being hooked up to a respirator because not 
one but both of his lungs collapsed? 
</P>
<P>
 * Where is the badge of humanity to be pinned as the coffin is lowered into 
the ground and I bid farewell to my all-too-human and vulnerable brother?

 When Divine ate dog droppings in "Pink Flamingos" -- now that was cool. But 
when Winona and Ethan and Bozo and all the little Butt-head mass bohemians bite 
on their ciggies, it's pretty hilarious. Like R. J. Reynolds said, "A sucker 
dies every minute." 
</P>
<P>
 What I want to know is how many bucks the filmmakers get from the ciggie 
corporations to show the stars smoking on the screen.

ARTHUR, ARTHUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "The Arthur Miller Method," by Jan Breslauer (June 19): 
</P>
<P>
 When I saw Miller's "Broken Glass" the theater was not full. And I was less 
than "spellbound."In fact, I found the play boring, unfocused and too long and 
left dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 That is sad because I love the old Arthur Miller, who could keep an audience 
spellbound with plays like "Death of a Salesman," "All My Sons," "A View From 
the Bridge" or "The Crucible." 
</P>
<P>
 And I was amazed that anyone could compare Miller to Ibsen. The only 
resemblance I can think of is that the two playwrights supply very little 
action and lots of talk. 
</P>
<P>
 But what puzzled me is Breslauer's comment that Tony Kushner's "Perestroika" 
was the only other drama on Broadway. Not so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Medea," the 5th-Century BCplay by Euripides, was nearly sold out and was 
booked for its remaining 27 performances; Diana Rigg won the Tony for her 
performance. "An Inspector Calls," by J. B. Priestley, was also sold out and 
received Tonys for best play revival, its incredible staging and featured 
actress.  
</P>
<P>
 The only reason "Broken Glass" lasted as long as it did was because of 
Miller's fame. Such a shame to be so disappointed.

</P>
<P>
 I must say how terribly disappointed I was after reading Breslauer's article 
on Arthur Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you please tell me why there was no mention of Marilyn Monroe except for 
stating that she was married to Miller for four years? 
</P>
<P>
 How can you not dive into the whole Marilyn angle? Need I remind you what a 
gigantic star Marilyn still is? In some circles, she is as big as Elvis.

'MAIDEN' FORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I know I'll be blasted as "politically correct" and a "reverse racist," but 
I'm sorry to see "Death and the Maiden" being brought to the screen with a 
non-Latino cast. This is especially troubling because Chilean author Ariel 
Dorfman's play is specifically set in Latin America and draws upon that 
region's recent history. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure the film's proponents will defend the casting as "color-blind," but 
if Sigourney Weaver were a recognizable Latina, would she have won her 
breakthrough role in "Alien"? More than likely, she would be struggling with 
all the other underemployed Latino actors to play stereotypical bit parts as 
drug dealers and domestic help. After all, Rita Cansino had to change her name 
to Hayworth before she could become a movie star. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, Hollywood should be commended for fostering the careers of Raul 
Julia, Edward James Olmos and Andy Garcia. And I'm glad that the "Death and the 
Maiden" film is giving a non-white actor like Ben Kingsley another chance to 
play a role outside his Indian ethnicity. However, the movie industry could 
still be doing much more to employ the rich but neglected Latino talent all 
around us. 
</P>
<P>
 I could mention that "Like Water for Chocolate" reveled in its Latino origins 
and was a record-breaking hit, while "The House of the Spirits" whitewashed its 
Latin American heritage and died at the box office. But I'm sure the film 
industry would still find a way to rationalize its preferential treatment of 
white actors.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: AUTOPSIES ARE EASY, RED TAPE IS HARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least dead men don't give you the runaround. 
</P>
<P>
 That much Vidal Herrera knows. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera, 42, owns an El Sereno company called Autopsy/Post Services Inc. So 
far, he's found it easier to cut up dead bodies and scoop out lungs and hearts 
than to get information about a job training bill from his elected 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera has become something of a media sensation since his "discovery" a year 
ago by my colleague, "Only in L.A." columnist Steve Harvey. Harvey highlighted 
Herrera's van, which tools the highways and back alleys emblazoned with 
"1-800-AUTOPSY." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera is an autopsy technician. He hires pathologists to perform private 
autopsies, removes organs for research, and takes bodily fluids samples for 
paternity and DNA analyses. He'll swab blood at a murder site or tidy up after 
a rotting corpse. He also coordinates the willed body program for anatomy 
students at UCLA's medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 Since The Times' mention, "El Muerto," as Herrera is also known, has been 
featured in publications far and wide. He's been dubbed a "cut-rate coroner," a 
"rigorous mortician." He has been offered thousands of dollars to relinquish 
the rights to 1-800-AUTOPSY (sorry, not for sale), and he's talking franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, in fact, after Herrera was recently featured on CNN that a staffer in 
Sen. Edward Kennedy's office phoned with information about the jobs program. 
</P>
<P>
 The School-to-Work Opportunities Act will provide up to $300 million in 1995 
(and funding through 1999) for businesses to apprentice high school students. 
Students would eventually receive high school diplomas and certificates of 
competency in their chosen fields. The bill is aimed at training the 75% of all 
American high school students who do not receive four-year college degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera thought it sounded perfect for his company. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, he learned his craft on the job, first as a volunteer, then as an 
investigator in the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office. No college degree was 
necessary. And his business is becoming lucrative, grossing in the "low six 
figures." Some of his assistants are medical-school-bound college students, but 
why not train high schoolers?  
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy empire needs warm bodies too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You have to expect that a column about a guy who slices open chests, then 
snips away at the ribs with garden shears for a living is going to contain at 
least a partially blocked artery's worth of gore. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera and I met recently at a La Crescenta mortuary. He invited me to watch 
him work. I believe his actual words were: "We have an autopsy, and we also 
have a brain procurement. Would you like to see that, too?" 
</P>
<P>
 Three of us stood in the mortuary's embalming room: Herrera, Long Beach 
pathologist Howard Oliver and I. Actually, the men stood. I sat, on the theory 
it would hurt less if I hit the floor from a chair. 
</P>
<P>
 I made it through most of the autopsy unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is more than I can say for the dead woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Her relatives were concerned that medical malpractice had contributed to her 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 As Herrera prepared to slice off the top of the woman's skull to get a look at 
her brain, Oliver held up a lung. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wanna see this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pneumonia, it seemed, had done the lady in. 
</P>
<P>
 As Herrera fired up the surgical saw, I suddenly remembered a dental 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate staffer who had called Herrera about the jobs bill suggested that 
he call his local congressman for more information. 
</P>
<P>
 So Herrera visited the Alhambra field office of Rep. Matthew G. Martinez, but 
no one there had any information. He was referred to Assemblywoman Diane 
Martinez, who told him he ought to contact Assemblyman Richard Polanco. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco was having knee surgery at the time, and his office suggested Herrera 
contact Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre. Alatorre's office 
suggested Herrera call his congressman . . . Matthew Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 He has tried Gov. Pete Wilson's local office and even the Kathleen Brown 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no one has been able to help. 
</P>
<P>
 The apprentice bill is a new piece of legislation, and the programs -- to be 
run by the states -- have yet to be determined. Still, it would have been nice 
if someone had taken Herrera's inquiries to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera sees more blood and guts in a day than most of us will see in a 
lifetime. The stench of an autopsy doesn't even phase the guy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not being able to figure out the bureaucracy runaround that makes him 
want to gag.

GALLERY: HAIR OF THE DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIENNE M. JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Please, no puns about a dogged pursuit or a "ruff" job. In capturing canines 
for her book "Jill's Dogs" (Pomegranate, 1994), photographer Jill Freedman 
defies the cliched images.There are no pictures of pups bedecked in show 
ribbons or frozen in a mid-air Frisbee catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there is a 20-year chronicle of dogginess. One that, as some have 
told Freedman, includes pictures that look as if they were taken by another 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dogginess is a universe," Freedman says. "They are much more evolved than we 
are. I just love the way they live in the minute." 
</P>
<P>
 And the magic is in the minutes she catches. Dogs arguing, wondering, 
contemplating, explaining, demanding. Dogs serving masters and showing masters 
how to serve. Dogs as best friends and as only friends. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of knowing could only come from a person who has loved dogs forever, 
as Freedman has. And yet, an intense travel schedule has made it impossible for 
her to be owned by a dog. Instead, she belongs to two kittens. Still, one is 
named Pooch (the other is Lulu). 
</P>
<P>
 And what kind of dog would Freedman choose to be? Remembering her beloved pal 
Fang, she doesn't hesitate to pick a poodle. "Once you love a poodle, you know 
why. They are every dog in the world and more. They are brilliant, have a great 
sense of humor and they're all dog." ADRIENNE M. JOHNSON

 With Fred (Fredric M.) Roberts, you just want to say, "S-l-o-o-w down!" This 
man doesn't operate at a snail's pace. 
</P>
<P>
 All in one breath, he's joking with his Yale classmate, "Cheers" producer 
Jimmy Burrows; telling you about his herb garden, and about the thrill of in 
the same year being chairman of National Assn. of Securities Dealers, which 
governs NASDAQ (National Assn. of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) -- 
"larger than the New York Stock Exchange with $1.35 trillion in trades in 1993" 
-- and co-chairman with Walter Grauman of the Music Center Spotlight Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Michael's, With Michael: Roberts, presiding over the annual stag dinner of 
the Fraternity of Friends of the Music Center at Michael's restaurant in Santa 
Monica, had only kudos for dinner host Michael McCarty, he of the smoothie F. 
Scott Fitzgerald look. 
</P>
<P>
 (Friends chair Thomas R. Tellefsen also had his hair slicked back '20s style.) 
</P>
<P>
 McCarty donated the dinner and the Cabernet from his Malibu vines, which 
escaped the fires. The men, most in summer white dinner jackets, after 
Tanqueray-and-tonics, enjoyed the wine before champagne and Dunhill cigars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Way to Go: The Friends, started 16 years ago by the late Thornton Bradshaw, 
number 300. At the party, the crowd included Roger A. Kozberg, Arthur 
Greenberg, Stephen D. Moses, Lee Phillips, Jack Sweeney, John Martens, A. J. 
Carothers, Allan Burns, John Heidt, Ed Renwick, Chuck Schneider, Rick Wilson, 
Arnold Seidel and Milan Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 They looked relaxed after their 15-event fiscal year of outings to Alisal, 
Yosemite and Napa, plus openings and screenings. 
</P>
<P>
 They also seemed fit for a new year with plans for a Downtown architectural 
tour, cooking sessions with super chefs, visits to the new library and the new 
Petersen Automotive Museum, all the way slipping in the phrase, "Support the 
Music Center." Roberts was reelected president. Elsewhere on the Social Circuit 
</P>
<P>
 * Roses to the new presidents -- Nancy Hindle-Katel, Junior League of Los 
Angeles; Pamela Hillings Tegtmeyer, Pasadena Junior League; Susie DeWeese, 
Santa Monica Westside Charity League, and Suzanne Dillard, Los Angeles Founder 
Chapter of ARCS (Achievement Rewards for College Scientists). 
</P>
<P>
 * Groups in Los Angeles that reach a centennial are few. The Ebell of Los 
Angeles was reveling in the "Centennial of the Ebell" as about 200 gathered for 
a gala luncheon chaired by Gloria Droguett and Betty Jean Shed. The Ebell, the 
Italian Renaissance building at 4400 Wilshire designed by William Chard, is now 
on the National Register of Historic Places. It's been through a four-year 
refurbishing and still is the repository of major books and paintings. It 
claims the adjacent 1,200-seat Wilshire Ebell Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 And it still has its primary purpose -- "widening the scope of women's 
education." Celebrating were president Ivada Parker, president-elect Betty Jean 
Shea and board members Ruth Gerry, Patricia Langlois, Kay Balue, Mary Johnson 
and Virginia Sunderland. 
</P>
<P>
 * It was a kick -- the Les Dames de Champagne International Hostesses' 
fund-raiser. The two Kathys -- Wills and Offenhauser -- persuaded a big crowd 
to dazzle up and support the Child Guidance Clinic of Los Angeles with the 
opening night of Radio City Music Hall's Rockettes at the Music Center. Raising 
$25,000: Harriet Luckman, Elizabeth Whiting, Jeanne McDonald, Elizabeth Warde, 
Ann-Marie and Sue Villicana, and Jackie Heebner. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plaudits to the golfing do-gooders. Prime Ticket Network, Roger L. Werner 
Jr. says, raised more than $150,000 at its inaugural Prime Ticket Charity Golf 
Classic to benefit the Los Angeles Unified School District's interscholastic 
athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Great oaks from little acorns grow. Chapter II members are the sons, 
daughters and friends of members of the John Wayne Cancer Institute Auxiliary, 
which has raised $3.5 million for cancer research. With its inaugural event in 
1992, Chapter II raised $20,000 and established a membership base of more than 
350. Now, Teresa Wayne says, the recent Las Vegas Casino Night raised $60,000 
for psychosocial support programs of the Institute and the Joyce Eisenberg 
Keefer Breast Center. Also, membership has soared to 500. Among supporters: 
Andy Sands, Jill Grey, Jane Urman and Ami Shilton. 
</P>
<P>
 * Helen Lambros turned her Pasadena Mediterranean garden into a Greek Theatre 
and Supper on the Greene to present "The Contosbury Tale," her own staged 
musical tribute honoring the Very Rev. D. Leonidas C. Contos on his 50th 
anniversary of priesthood. He was brought to Los Angeles by Charles Skouras in 
1952 and was the first dean of St. Sophia Cathedral. Crowding in for the 
merriment were James Galanos (Helen Lambros wears his stunning creations), 
Sophie Mastor, host Bill Lambros, Greek Consul Trifon Paraskevopoulos, Mary and 
Charles Skouras, Dina and Bill Oldknow, Ann and Angelo Pappas, Jean Van Tuyle, 
and Joan and Paul Selwyn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transamerica President David Carpenter hosted a luncheon for 80 to fete the 
Emperor and Empress of Japan with Mayor Richard Riordan, Leila Carpenter, Nancy 
Daly and former Prime Minister of Japan Kiichi Miyazawa in the spotlight too . 
. . At Shutters on the Beach, Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge members dined 
and danced to the Doctors of Swing, honoring Hugh O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert and Jane Wetzel's Pasadena garden became a New Orleans garden for the 
jazz and Creole evening hosted by Mothers' Club Community Center, which 
supports programs for isolated mothers and their preschool children . . . The 
English Speaking Union honored Rafe Esquith with its first Excellence in 
English Award after members watched his Hobart Elementary fifth- and 
sixth-graders present Shakespeare's "The Tempest" . . . At Helen Jones' San 
Marino home, the champagne flowed for the recital played by Daniel Pollack for 
members of the Neighborhood Music School Assn., which provides music 
scholarships for Boyle Heights-area students.

 For those who wouldn't be caught dead arriving at a World Cup match at the 
Rose Bowl in anything less than a limo (besides transportation, a great place 
to nap during low-scoring games), consider purchasing a parking pass before 
game day. 
</P>
<P>
 If bought in advance, limousine parking is a mere $225. But the day of the 
game, the price rises to $350. The cash saved would be about half the Cameroon 
team's budget.

 A Poolside Farewell: It was fitting that a lively party was held recently to 
note the passing of Lance (he preferred the solo ID) of the Hollywood Kids. 
Parties were, if not his whole life, then certainly a major chunk, because he 
was half of the duo, along with John Nichols, that gossiped about celebs from 
coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance died of complications of AIDS. And it was decided that a poolside party 
at Le Mondrian would be the best way to remember him. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 150 friends who attended were Charlene Tilton and Pamela Des Barres. 
Female impersonators strutting their stuff as Tina Turner and Liza Minnelli 
provided entertainment, as did live bands. Memorabilia from Lance's collection 
of signed movie posters were auctioned to benefit AIDS Project Los Angeles.

 Expanding Their Horizons: This week, URB, the monthly magazine with a 
circulation of 50,000 aimed at the hip-hop and dance crowd, takes a big step. 
It goes from being a free local mag to a nationally distributed one that is, 
alas, no longer gratis . The price will be $2.50. 
</P>
<P>
 "Magazines are like sharks," Managing Editor Todd Roberts says. "You either 
move forward or sit in the water and die. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a subtle revolution going on because the texture of music is 
changing. Our magazine is a forum for people to talk about this and their 
feelings toward it. And we're ready to talk on a national level."

SOCIAL CLIMES / UP ALL NIGHT: THE WURST KIND OF MECCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 34 years, the Red Lion Tavern in Silver Lake has been serving up beer and 
bratwurst to a loyal clientele of immigrants, families, dressed-down 
neighborhood hipsters and fraternity boys in search of the ultimate beer 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Lion is a dark, cozy place, with wood paneled walls, burgundy 
carpeting and black vinyl booths. A collection of German beer steins lines the 
rafters, and the walls are hung with yellowed paintings of monks and peasants 
drinking beer. In the movies, this is the kind of place where the villagers 
band together to hide out from vampires. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Evans is one of the regulars. "It's kind of hard to explain the Red 
Lion. It's sort of a mecca. Silver Lake has an artsy thing going on, and this 
is just a nice little neighborhood bar. I spent my youth in Europe, and it's 
great coming back here." 
</P>
<P>
 The barmaids are dressed in lederhosen and many have German accents. For 
years, most orders were placed in German. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started here eight years ago, it was very different," says barmaid 
Sophia Payne, who grew up in Munich. "The girls all worked here for 20 years 
and it was wild. They used to dance on the bar. Now you don't see anyone 
flashing their boobs or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Helmut Gebhard, also from Munich, sings and plays the accordion Wednesday 
through Saturday. "I've been playing here 10 years now. We have an early dinner 
crowd that splits by around 10. Then the younger crowd comes in. I never 
yodeled in Germany. I learned here. In Germany, I was a pop singer." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there are shades of Tony Bennett in Gebhard's polkas, and his 
repertoire includes such lost treasures as "Knock Three Times (on the Ceiling 
if You Want Me)," a number that inexplicably inspires several people to stand 
up between the tables and do the funky chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Many brave and foolhardy souls come here to get the infamous "Boot," which in 
this case has nothing to do with having too many parking tickets but might 
still prevent you from driving home. The Red Lion's boot is a towering two 
liters of ale served in a vessel the shape -- and size -- of a substantial 
piece of footwear. A forest of boots towering over the heads of a gaggle of 
college boys is an awesome and terrible sight. 
</P>
<P>
 More modest drinkers, or those with weaker forearms, can order by the 
half-liter. The brews on tap have such names as Konig Pilsner, Dortmunder 
Ritter Brau and Warsteiner, and the bar staff will happily try to match you up 
with the one that suits your personality and temperament.  
</P>
<P>
 If you're having trouble choosing among the 10 varieties of schnapps, Payne 
might recommend the Jagermeister, an herbal concoction that tastes like 
medicine. Dinners include such German familiars as bratwurst, knackwurst, 
schnitzel and potato salad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where: The Red Lion Tavern, 2366 Glendale Blvd., Silver Lake; (213) 662-5337. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Open daily 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost: Beer on tap is $4.50 for a half liter. The Boot $17. 
</P>
<P>
 Jagermeister $2.75. Dinners $6.95 to $10.95.

VOTE BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS BIGOTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robin Abcarian's June 12 column ("Waking Up With an Election Hangover") 
requires a response. I couldn't believe she would admit in print that she voted 
for Tony Miller because "it's high time we had an openly gay state 
official."It's a knee-jerk response at best to vote for a candidate because of 
that person's sexual orientation, gender, race, et al, without considering 
his/her background and philosophical beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 She also writes that she voted, as usual, for "anything with the word school 
in it . . . and access improvement for the disabled." I'm glad she voted for 
the latter, although it was my understanding the proposition was designed to 
protect business owners who installed ramps and other amenities from higher 
property taxes following mandated changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it will turn out it was I who didn't read it correctly, but it is a 
certain fact that one of us sure didn't know what the heck we were doing in our 
booths, and at least I didn't vote for it because of a buzzword.

 Robin Abcarian should be much more careful. Doesn't she realize that by 
bragging that she voted for Miller just because he is a homosexual and gave 
financial support to Sheila Kuehl just because she is a lesbian, she has denied 
herself the right to criticize those bigots who vote against political 
candidates just because they're gay?

WESTSIDE WATCH: SCHOOL FINDS SAFE HARBOR FOR GRAD NIGHT PARTYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica High School graduates Wednesday night hopped aboard a 
Caribbean-bound ship that never left port. 
</P>
<P>
 But the would-be sailors didn't mind -- it was a ship out of water. 
</P>
<P>
 Students had to pass through the large, wooden mock vessel -- an oddity 
visible all week next to the school's practice field along 4th Street -- to get 
to the "Samohi" gymnasium for a grad night celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 In line with the theme of the party, intended as a safe alternative to wild 
post-graduation bashes, the gym was outfitted with partitions decorated as an 
undersea tableau, a rain forest and a street bazaar. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fourth year the school has held the event, sponsored by the city, 
the school's alumni association and the youths' parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grad night is the most dangerous night of the year for adolescents, and this 
was a way to keep them off the streets and give them a party," said Catherine 
Baxter, the school's activities director. "No one even got seasick." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 SOUNDS OF SILENCE: Forget that first debate between U.S. Rep. Anthony 
Beilenson(D-Woodland Hills) and attorney Richard Sybert, the GOP challenger, 
set for July 7 at the Warner Center Marriott and sponsored by the Valley Jewish 
Business Leaders Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, who is running for reelection in a district that includes Malibu 
and a portion of the Valley, has nixed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson's staff said the congressman did not know that it was a debate he 
was getting into. He thought it was a solo flight, a chance for him to mingle 
with local Jewish business leaders. When it turned into a debate, he did an 
about-face. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a problem with it," said Michael Turner, public relations director for 
the event. "He wasn't going to show up if it was a debate, so we had to 
disinvite Sybert." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Craig Miller, a Beilenson political adviser, Beilenson is more 
than happy to debate Sybert, "but we're not going to allow Sybert to turn every 
appearance the congressman makes in the Valley into a debate." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, James Vaughn, Sybert's campaign manager, said the incident showed 
that Beilenson is "already ducking the debates" he had earlier promised to have 
with his GOP challenger. 
</P>

 HE DELIVERS: Noble acts might be expected of police officers and firefighters. 
But postal workers? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, if it's Lawrence Tilghman of the Beverly Hills Post Office. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Chamber of Commerce's recent annual awards ceremony, the letter carrier 
was recognized along with police officers and firefighters for going beyond the 
call of duty -- in this case to rescue an elderly woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Tilghman had gone to check on the unidentified resident because she had not 
collected her mail from the previous day. Tilghman entered the home through an 
unlocked door and discovered that she had fallen. After moving her onto her 
bed, he found a neighbor to get help. 
</P>
<P>
 The deed occurred in 1991 and just recently came to the attention of the 
postal service.

VENICE 'AGITATOR' IS ARRESTED FOR REFUSING PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KRAMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A self-described agitator in the Oakwood section of Venice who recently handed 
out flyers warning whites they would be targeted by Latino gangs has been 
arrested for refusing to submit to psychological testing as a parole condition, 
a state Department of Corrections official said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Clayton, who outraged local merchants and others with a leafletting 
campaign earlier this month that targeted upscale shopping districts near 
Oakwood, was arrested June 24 after he refused to agree to the tests ordered by 
his parole agent, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Di Maggio, regional parole administrator for the Department of 
Corrections, said the violation was not related to the flyer campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton, 43, an angry critic of political leaders in Oakwood, claimed in a 
recent interview to represent local gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 He and several volunteers distributed thousands of handouts two weeks ago, 
mostly along Abbot Kinney Boulevard and Main Street in Venice and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers, which warned whites that they were in danger of being shot by 
Latino gangs, were widely condemned by community leaders as racist and 
inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton justified the campaign as an attempt to jolt business leaders into 
taking action to stop a gang war in Oakwood that has claimed at least 17 lives, 
many of them bystanders, over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton was paroled last March after serving part of a seven-year prison 
sentence imposed in 1990 for evading police and two years for possessing 
cocaine while incarcerated, according to Department of Corrections records. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton entered the state prison system in 1971 on a robbery conviction and 
returned in 1975 after being arrested for illegal possession of a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, he was sentenced to a total of nine years for burglary and forgery, 
according to the records. 
</P>
<P>
 He is being held in the Los Angeles County Jail and is awaiting a parole 
hearing on the latest allegation.

5 TOP POSTS IN UCLA POLICE DEPARTMENT ELIMINATED; SECURITY: ALL LIEUTENANTS IN 
THE BELEAGUERED 55-MEMBER FORCE HAVE BEEN CUT. THE NEW CHIEFS SAYS THE MOVES 
WERE MADE 'STRICTLY FOR ECONOMIC REASONS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KRAMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to streamline a campus police force that had become a nest of worker 
discontent, UCLA has laid off all five lieutenants in the 55-member department 
and eliminated three other management jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly appointed Police Chief Clarence Chapman, under orders to trim 11% of his 
department's $9.5-million budget as part of university-wide reductions, 
described the layoffs as unavoidable and unrelated to a rash of grievances and 
lawsuits filed by department workers in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization "was strictly for economic reasons," said Chapman, who 
became chief June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts are expected to save at least $499,000 without reducing campus 
patrols or other services, university officials said. More cuts are possible, 
said June Trader, assistant to Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the departing lieutenants, Michael Shain, is named as a co-defendant in 
six lawsuits by former and current police officers, most of them minorities, 
alleging they were subjected to discriminatory treatment by their superiors and 
that university officials failed to take corrective action. UCLA has declined 
to comment on the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, however, strongly denied that the legal skirmishing influenced the 
way the department was reorganized. 
</P>
<P>
 He praised all five lieutenants, stressing that none "were under 
investigation" or "the subject of any negative performance evaluations." The 
problem, he said, was that the department had become top-heavy with 13 
administrators, including the five lieutenants -- half of the lieutenants in 
the entire University of California system. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reach the lieutenants -- Shain, Terry Baker, Jim Kuehn, Dave Peitz 
and Don Boyarski and Shain -- were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Three non-sworn employees were also laid off: Kit Espinoza, director of 
administrative services; Donna Capraro, assistant director of administrative 
services, and Dave Camonero, budget director. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, who won kudos for his work as a Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department captain in West Hollywood, has vowed to focus on improving 
communication within the UCLA Police Department, upgrading equipment and 
assuring that officers have access to up-to-date training, which has lagged in 
past years. 
</P>
<P>
 With the departure of the lieutenants, management duties will be consolidated 
under three captains, one of whom is Karl Ross, who served as acting police 
chief until Chapman's appointment. UCLA officers, bridling under what they 
described as outdated leadership, directed a vote of no confidence against Ross 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote persuaded administrative Vice Chancellor John Curry, who oversees the 
department, to hire an outside consultant to survey the department and 
recommend changes. Curry could not be reached for comment, but in a university 
press release he predicted the reorganization would lead to a more efficiently 
run department that would ultimately provide greater security despite the staff 
cuts. He emphasized that no officers working beats were let go. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization was greeted with guarded optimism by one of the litigants, 
Sgt. Rick Sanchez, who called it an important first step to improving the 
beleaguered force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morale in the department seems to be going up," Sanchez said. "The problem is 
we're still in the baby stage."

IT'S ALL UNDER CONTROL; AIR TRAFFIC: CREWS 'TOP OUT' THE NEW PALM TREE-SHAPED 
TOWER AT LAX. THE $18.3-MILLION PROJECT SHOULD BE COMPLETE BY JUNE, 1995. 
</P>

 Los Angeles International Airport is rising to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction crews recently completed the "topping out" -- assembly of the top 
floor -- of the airport's new air traffic control tower. 
</P>
<P>
 The building's contractors, San Francisco-based Swinerton and Walberg, 
finished erecting the steel frame of the tower's 23rd floor last week, after 
breaking ground in August, 1993. The steel framework of an adjacent, five-story 
Federal Aviation Administration building has also been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 From the new tower, an integral addition to the nation's third busiest 
airport, controllers will guide the nearly 680,000 aircraft takeoffs and 
landings at LAX annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The tall, skinny tower is intended to resemble a palm tree, but is topped with 
such aviation metaphors as biplane struts and a wing-shaped enclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Curved roofs echo the parabolic arches of the nearby landmark Theme 
restaurant, constructed in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (city) wanted a real civic monument that symbolizes one's arrival and 
departure from Los Angeles," said Kate Diamond, one of the project's 
architects. "There was a feeling that L.A. was too important to have just a 
cookie-cutter functional design." 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials say the $18.3-million project is on schedule for completion 
by June, 1995, and should be ready for use by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing 277 feet high, the new tower is expected to improve air safety by 
providing controllers an optimum field of view from a more centralized location 
in the middle of the airport. It has also increased floor space and the latest 
air traffic control technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in 1961, the old tower was built in the middle of the South Complex, 
which was the main facility at the time," said Daniel Olivas, project manager 
with the FAA. "After years of expansion at LAX, the new tower will now be right 
in the middle of the whole airport. It will be higher, with more space and 
increased visibility for the controllers." 
</P>
<P>
 Designed by two architectural firms, Siegel Diamond Architects of West Los 
Angeles and Holmes and Narver of Orange, the tower will be 105 feet taller than 
the existing 172-foot tower, which will be used as a backup facility. The new 
tower will provide workstations for 12 air traffic controllers, four more than 
does the current tower. The new tower has been constructed 500 yards west of 
the old tower and is about 50 yards west of the airport's Theme restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Controllers will have 850 square feet of office floor space to replace the 
existing tower's 300 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The adjoining 29,000-square-foot FAA administrative building will house 
state-of-the art computers, recorders, transmitters, receivers and other 
sophisticated electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next year, workers will finish the building's exterior and complete a 
significant amount of electrical work, including grounding the structure 
against lightning strikes and installing computer networks and sophisticated 
electrical backup systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually steel is the biggest cost for a building project, but the electrical 
work in this is our largest expense," said Fred Case, a project manager for 
Swinerton and Walberg. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to functional demands, such as stringent seismic requirements and 
the technological needs of the FAA, the project's architects had to satisfy the 
sundry requests of other agencies such as the Department of Airports, which 
asked that the tower's design not add to the airport's congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Several initial proposals incorporating a variety of designs were deemed 
lacking in imagination or not emblematic of Los Angeles, according to the 
Cultural Affairs Commission, which had jurisdiction over approving the look of 
the new tower and administration building. 
</P>
<P>
 Other architects involved in the final design say they made an effort to evoke 
the rich aviation history of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Adriana Lovinescu, a lead architect in the project: "We wanted to create 
symbols that could be read, to use design ideas that reflected the resources 
and innovation used in L.A.'s airplane history."

 Tuesday night is sacred for a certain group of doctors. No matter how 
difficult their day, or how many hours they've slept, they head to the Beverly 
Hills High School auditorium, carrying their black bags, beepers clipped to 
their waistbands. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of their cases are rather odd-shaped for doctors. That's because what's 
inside is not the standard physician tools of the trade. Most likely it's a 
violin, flute or oboe. 
</P>
<P>
 They are members of the Los Angeles Doctors' Symphony Orchestra -- considered 
one of the largest groups of its kind in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 From the first tap of Dr. Ivan Shulman's baton, the music that comes from this 
60-member orchestra is all heart. 
</P>
<P>
 For 41 years, the Doctors' Symphony has provided its members fellowship in 
music and medicine, and an opportunity to help raise funds for charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's original charter required that three-quarters of its members be 
doctors, but that requirement has been relaxed.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now, anyone who has ever gone to a doctor is welcome to play in the 
orchestra. We want a viable orchestra. The purpose is to enjoy music and the 
fraternity and fun of being together," said Shulman, whose father, Harry, was 
the principal oboist in the NBC Symphony under Arturo Toscanini. 
</P>
<P>
 With only two hours of rehearsal a week because of demanding work schedules, 
it takes a couple of months to prepare a program. 
</P>
<P>
 They usually perform four free concerts a year. The orchestra has raised money 
for research in cancer, AIDS and heart disease, abused children, and 
sickle-cell anemia. The next concert is scheduled Monday at the Beverly Hills 
Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Alvin Miller, a pediatrician and neonatology expert -- and violinist -- is 
a founder of the orchestra. It has been like therapy to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "After you've taken care of sick babies all day, it's cheaper to play in the 
orchestra than go to a psychiatrist," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has been playing since age 6, and originally wanted to be a musician 
instead of a doctor -- not an easy decision for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Jewish. And what that means (in this context) is that I would either have 
to be a (premier violinist like) Jascha Heifetz or a doctor. My mother said, 
'Go for the music,' but my violin teacher said I'd never make a living (as a 
violinist) so I went in the other direction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But anyone who thinks members of this orchestra treat their participation as 
some sort of hobby need only check the group's repertoire and attend a 
performance to dispel this assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Doctors' Symphony has taken its music seriously, ever since its debut 
concert in 1954, which included the Symphony 11 in D Major by Haydn, to the 
group's most recent concert where it performed Johannes Brahms' Symphony No. 2 
in D Major, Opus 73. 
</P>
<P>
 And they have traveled all over the world, to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller recalled a trip to Greece, where the orchestra played a benefit in the 
Parthenon to raise funds for a local orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a thrill to play in a 2,000-year-old theater. When you play next to a 
Greek you don't have to talk. Music is the international language. All the 
notes are the same," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a tour to Costa Rica in 1979, two new members of the orchestra who traveled 
on separate planes and had never met before, found themselves in San Jose 
making conversation about livers. 
</P>
<P>
 She had a doctorate in anthropology, researching Native Americans and alcohol 
abuse; he was a doctor who specialized in liver treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Weibel-Orlando, a violinist, remembers the moment. "Well, first of all, I 
knew there was a Dr. Robert Orlando traveling alone in the orchestra because I 
examined the list. He was the only single man in the orchestra on the trip. But 
when I saw him, I thought, 'Oh, my God, he's gorgeous. He's so alive, so full 
of energy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 They married two years later, and with their busy lives, they can count on one 
constant: They have a date every Tuesday night when they meet for rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl and Leroy Brown are also married. They joined the orchestra in 1986 as 
a couple. Cheryl is the principal flutist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I majored in music at USC. My husband does emergency medicine in Bakersfield 
and plays the viola. I played a lot of chamber music, worked as professional 
studio musician. But you know how music is, so I went back to school and became 
a computer programmer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown plays for pleasure. She has two small children, and has started them on 
the piano. "When my kids walk down the street they sing a Mahler symphony 
instead of a 'Sesame Street' song," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conductor Shulman says medicine and music have the same appeal for him. "Until 
the day I die, I'll still be learning in medicine, still be learning in music." 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra plays Monday at 2 p.m. at the Boat Court in the Beverly Hills 
Civic Center, Rexford Drive (south of Santa Monica Boulevard). Information: 
(310) 276-3134 or (213) 934-5317.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; A TEAM EFFORT TO FIGHT CANCER 
</P>

<P>
 Traditional block parties mean barbecue and volleyball. The 20th Annual Rodeo 
Drive Block Party, scheduled for July 10 in Beverly Hills, will feature catered 
food, celebrities -- and a soccer theme. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal: to raise $1 million for Concern Foundation for Cancer Research and 
its sister organization, Concern II. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup USA '94 teamed up with Concern Foundation to make the party an 
official kickoff event for the final week of the monthlong World Cup soccer 
playoffs. Four blocks of Rodeo Drive will be closed to traffic for the evening 
party, a celebration of the games and the 24 countries involved in the World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be transforming everyday Rodeo Drive into a glamorous, 
international Rodeo Drive street festival," said Bob Goldman, president of 
Concern Foundation. "It's sort of a soccerfest." 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the World Cup theme, the auction portion of the event will 
include some unique soccer balls. Twenty-seven Southern California artists 
volunteered to apply their artistry to soccer balls, "incorporating their 
feelings about (the) World Cup coming to Rodeo Drive," said Tim Yarger, 
director of Bowles-Sorokko Gallery in Beverly Hills, where the balls are 
displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 One artist, Amanda Watt, used the box that her soccer ball came in to create 
the image of watching soccer on television. Artist Laddie John Dill covered his 
soccer ball with asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the commercial hype World Cup is generating, this is a very nice 
variation, as creative artists raise funds for cancer research," Yarger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money collected during the event will be spent on cancer research around the 
world, said Derek Alpert, president of Concern II, which was started to bolster 
the fund-raising efforts of Concern Foundation. Over the past 26 years, the two 
organizations have raised more than $16 million, funding research in cancer 
immunology and immunotherapy. SUSAN STEINBERG

 * DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- Directed the Los Angeles Housing Department to set 
aside $5 million annually for the development of new shelters for battered 
women, as well as the expansion of three existing shelters. Los Angeles Police 
Cmdr. John White said the goal was to have 18 shelters, one in each police 
division. Alana Bowman of the city attorney's office said the bed shortage at 
the existing shelters is so severe that two-thirds of the women who currently 
seek refuge are turned away for lack of room. She also said that only 3% of 
battered women end up reaching out to a shelter. Hotline number for assistance 
or advice on domestic violence issues is (310) 392-9896. Passed 14-0.

WESTSIDE COVER STORY; FRUITFUL MARKETING; POPULARITY OF FRESH-PICKED GOODS 
CAUSES MANY FARMERS MARKETS TO SPROUT UP LOCALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Westwood on a recent Thursday, a crowd gathered in the shadow of the 
Bullocks department store. But this was no pre-sale positioning for Waterford 
crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion was the grand opening of Westwood's farmers market, and the 
merchandise -- piled high on tables set up in the street -- included 
fresh-picked strawberries and purple basil. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing faster than summer squash, farmers markets have blossomed on the 
Westside. In 1990, there were three local open-air markets. Now there are seven 
-- three in Santa Monica and one each in Hollywood, Venice, West Hollywood and 
Westwood. And more are on the way: Beverly Hills is scheduled to open a farmers 
market in August, Culver City plans to start one in 1995, and Malibu is 
discussing plans for one. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth comes amid a statewide boom in farmers markets. Since 1978, the 
number of certified farmers markets in California has climbed from four to 250, 
according to Southland Farmers Market Assn., a nonprofit group that assists in 
organizing and operating farmers markets in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers markets are not for everyone. Sometimes the prices exceed those of 
supermarkets, and some competing merchants consider them a business threat. But 
such concerns have not stopped the markets from proliferating. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Westside, evidence of their popularity -- and appeal -- abounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and visitors flock to the weekly markets, buying such products as 
seasonal fruits and vegetables, fresh bread, exotic herbs, houseplants, aloe 
vera or even oat grass grown to aid cats' digestion. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 8,000 to 10,000 customers usually turn out for the Wednesday 
farmers market in Santa Monica, the state's biggest certified farmers market. 
That market's 85 growers grossed $3,839,321 in 1992, according to the farmers 
market association. (The other two Santa Monica markets, held Saturdays, 
together brought in $791,016.) 
</P>
<P>
 Westside-wide, farmers markets grossed more than $6 million in 1992, the 
latest year for which annual figures are available. That compares to just under 
$5 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Such results have stirred strong interest in cities looking to boost downtown 
business -- and community spirit. "A lot of cities are picking up on farmers 
markets to return to the concept of the urban gathering place," said Laura 
Avery, farmers market coordinator for Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers markets, which are certified by the counties, require that all items 
grown by the farmers be sold directly to consumers -- no middlemen involved. 
The farmers must also be certified by county agricultural commissioners. 
Farmers who sell in Westside markets typically pay "space fees," amounting to 
4.25% to 5% of their gross sales, to the host city or its redevelopment agency, 
and an additional 1% to 1.5% to the farmers market association. 
</P>
<P>
 Important to the markets' appeal, customers say, is the accessibility and 
helpfulness of the growers. Whether the issue is the cooking time of bok choy 
or the drought resistance of certain shrubs, the growers give the answer -- and 
often seem to enjoy doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "The honeydews need about four days (to ripen)," grower Nina Vedder Ames 
instructed a customer recently at Santa Monica's Wednesday market. "But if you 
need a good melon right now, try the canary melon. They taste a lot alike." 
</P>
<P>
 The buyer sampled the canary melon, then asked Ames to pick out a few of the 
ripest ones. Said another shopper, John Watkins: "I rely on the salespeople, 
and they're always honest. I like the personal aspect: You're talking to the 
person who grows the vegetables. You get to know the farmers, and they know who 
you are." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The appreciation runs deep. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Steve Cancian, assistant manager of Santa Monica's Wednesday 
farmers market, a vegetable grower who was having financial problems in 1991 
told his customers that he would have to raise his prices in order to stay in 
business. His customers rallied, continued to patronize his stand, and the 
grower survived -- his clientele intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the key drawing cards of farmers markets are the quality and variety 
of the produce. In many cases, produce is picked within 24 hours of going to 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames says that on Tuesdays this time of year, she takes to the fields in the 
mornings to pick corn with the farmhands at her family's 2,000-acre Imperial 
Valley spread. The trimming and bagging come next. Then the corn is placed on 
ice to take out the field heat, she said. Other produce, including cantaloupe 
and bright-yellow canary melons, is also harvested and crated in the dizzying 
Imperial Valley heat. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning, Ames is typically in Santa Monica by 7:30 a.m., sipping 
a cappuccino in a 2nd Street coffeehouse as her pickup truck and trailer -- 
loaded with a ton of vegetables and fruit -- sits parked at the curb. At 9:30 
a.m., a blast from an air horn signifies that the market is open. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames has sold in the Santa Monica market for two years, and she hopes to 
remain. She estimates that she makes about $700 every Wednesday -- but the 
allure, she says, goes beyond dollars and cents. Said Ames: "I'd miss it." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, market offerings have become more varied, market aficionados 
say. Whereas one or two types of onions or basil might have sufficed in the 
past, others are now provided as farmers respond to customer demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a grower gets several requests for a special kind of something, he can 
plant a few rows and see how it sells," Cancian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Customer interest in produce grown without pesticides has prompted a surge in 
the number of organic offerings. Santa Monica's Saturday market, in fact, has 
dedicated half of its space to organically grown produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being registered organic growers helps. A lot of people will only buy 
organically grown produce," said DeDe Bazyk, a farmer from Riverside County who 
sells vegetables at the Hollywood and Westwood farmers markets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers markets are also showing greater variety in non-agricultural products. 
Some offer cooked foods, crafts, clothes and more. At the Hollywood Farmers 
Market, teen-agers Jasen and Justin Perri sell lady bugs, praying mantises and 
other insects to keep gardens pest-free, an enterprise intended to raise money 
for the Boys and Girls Club of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Justin: "This is much cooler than selling chocolates." 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers market prices, however, often outstrip those of supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Monica's Wednesday market, for instance, peaches were selling for $1 
to $2.50 a pound; at a Vons supermarket about 10 blocks away, peaches could be 
had for 79 cents a pound. Salad fixings -- lettuce, avocado, cucumber, red and 
green bell peppers, green onions, mushrooms, carrots and tomatoes -- cost $7.75 
at the farmers market; the same produce -- in quantity and type -- cost $6.84 
at Vons. 
</P>
<P>
 But such differences don't deter farmers market fans, some of whom say, with 
careful bargain-hunting, they can actually beat supermarket prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "My strategy is to come late," said West Los Angeles resident Mark Baue. "The 
farmers want to get rid of stuff, so (they) will sell it cheap, just so they 
don't have to take it home." 
</P>
<P>
 For farmers, the outdoor markets offer a chance to earn several hundred 
dollars a day by selling directly to the customer, avoiding shipping and -- in 
most cases -- packaging costs. Farmers' income varies from market to market. 
The average farmer at West Hollywood's market made about $266 a day in 1993, 
but at Santa Monica's Wednesday market the average grower earned $964 a day, 
according to the farmers market association.  
</P>
<P>
 Ames said she was on a waiting list for three years before landing a spot in 
Santa Monica's 85-vendor Wednesday market. "Santa Monica is a draw as a grower, 
since it is the largest market with the most customers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For cities, the farmers markets in some cases represent a redevelopment tool. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Farmers Market, begun in 1991 as part of an economic 
revitalization effort, attracts about 4,000 customers every Sunday to what 
would normally be a quiet part of town. The Westside's newest farmers market, 
which opened June 2 in Westwood Village, is intended to attract new customers 
to Westwood's struggling retail area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not here to sell produce; we're here to promote business in Westwood 
Village," said Joe Fahey, the market's manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether farmers markets help boost trade at nearby businesses is an open 
question, however. The economic effects of the markets appear to vary 
dramatically from business to business. A Santa Monica sandwich shop near 2nd 
and Arizona, for example, does tremendous business on Wednesday, but other 
restaurants have complained that their trade is hurt because market customers 
take up a great deal of parking space in the area, Avery said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, stores next to the market area have not experienced improved 
sales, said Pompea Smith, project director of the Hollywood Farmers Market. 
"We've had positive comments from merchants nearby," she said. "But nothing 
like, 'Oh, it has been the greatest for sales.' One problem is people love the 
atmosphere here at the market, but they may not go outside the area to shop." 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, meanwhile, merchants' concerns about competition have complicated 
efforts to organize a market there. The Ventura County Certified Farmers Market 
Assn. is working on a proposal to hold a market every Friday for three hours at 
possible sites such as Malibu Bluffs Park and the Civic Center area. But some 
Malibu merchants say they fear a market would sap local businesses and cause 
traffic tie-ups and parking shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, however, the move toward farmers markets continues apace. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills has scheduled its first open-air market for Sunday morning, Aug. 
7. Canon Drive in the city's business triangle will be blocked off for 25 to 30 
farmers. The proposed Culver City Farmers Market is slated to open in April, 
1995, as part of a downtown revitalization project. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the proliferation of farmers markets on the Westside that some wonder 
whether the markets will begin cutting deeply into each others' business. 
Market boosters, however, remain unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cancian, the Santa Monica farmers market official: "In other parts of the 
world they have an open-air market every day." On the Cover

FOR SENIORS; BUSINESSWOMAN TAKES PHYSICAL FITNESS TO HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Melba Autry is a motivator. But one of the things that separates her from 
people who preach the "right" way to live is that she is her own best client. 
Just look at her: She's lean, spirited, healthy and disciplined. And that's 
what the 63-year-old Santa Monica resident wants to pass on to other senior 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 So two years ago she started Senior Leisure Activities, a business that makes 
fitness videos for seniors that are shown on a local cable TV channel. 
</P>
<P>
 She started the business, she said, because she believes that physical 
well-being goes a long way toward emotional well-being. She keeps her advice 
sound by reading everything she can about fitness and the older person. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry's business card says, "let us bring fun into your life." And her idea of 
fun is walking, biking, bowling, fishing, swimming or any other activity that a 
person, once encouraged, could have fun doing on his or her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone needs encouragement. You have to have a goal, keep your eye on it 
and work toward it," Autry said. 
</P>
<P>
 A licensed vocational nurse, Autry is in training for the 1995 Senior Olympics 
in San Antonio, Tex. She practices sprints every day at 6 a.m. at the Santa 
Monica College track and runs 100 meters in 18 seconds (the record for women in 
Autry's age group is 15.49). 
</P>
<P>
 She swims three times a week and has been lifting weights for 10 years. And in 
addition to these activities, she often gets on her bicycle and rides a few 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry gets encouragement from her sons and her mettle from her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 She grew up in a strict household in Chicago. Her mother, a schoolteacher, 
died when Melba was 12. Her father was an auto mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother would have been called a feminist if she were alive. She was 
strong, always after my sister and me, especially the way we spoke. I had to 
walk like a lady, couldn't wear shorts, went to church three times a week. But 
most of all it was the speech. She thought we were a little better than anyone 
else because we spoke English well," Autry said. 
</P>
<P>
 She admits that she resented her mother for being strict, especially with 
table manners. Autry wanted to be ordinary. "Now I value it. I brought my sons 
up that way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry divorced when she was 50. She raised her boys to believe they could do 
anything. Earl, 42, is an attorney; Morris, 34, owns his own video company and 
teaches part time at UCLA, and David, 33, is a computer technician for UCLA 
Medical Center's liver transplant department. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Morris who encouraged her to extend her business and make the videos, 
through which Autry and guests offer tips in a talk-show format. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry said she has always believed that it's never too late to learn anything 
or to get in shape. She specializes in motivating people.  
</P>
<P>
 "First, a person has to decide that they need help or encouragement. Next, you 
need someone in your life who says, 'Let's do it' -- someone who has your 
interests at heart. Many older people are alone or have family members who 
wouldn't think of calling up to say, 'Let's go bike riding.' That's where I 
come in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry thinks good exercise habits can take the place of bad ones, but it takes 
close to two months for a good habit to become part of your life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a trainer. I just start people off, in moderation, doing something 
which is fun and healthy. Some people need nine months of encouragement. The 
older you get, the more depressed you get sitting around wondering about all 
the things that aren't right in life. Exercising gives you a feeling of 
'all-rightness.' Life isn't doom and gloom unless you say it is," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When an Olympic athlete wins a medal, reporters sometimes ask what they are 
going to do next. Although the Senior Olympics is a year off, Melba Autry has 
her answer: "I want to be the Oprah Winfrey of the senior set." 
</P>
<P>
 She certainly has the right training. 
</P>
<P>
 Melba Autry's "Senior Fitness" video can be seen July 12 on Century Cable 
channel 3. Check local schedule for time. Information: (310) 289-3293.

RIM SHOTS; ARTIST J.D. CROWE'S ZANY GRAND CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN and COLOR, J.D. CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than any other national park, the Grand Canyon occupies a special place 
in the imaginations of Americans. Visitors (30,000 a day in summer) can view 
the canyon from the North and South rims, hike in and out on foot or go by mule 
train, fly over in a helicopter or small plane, or raft in at the bottom, where 
the muddy Colorado River continues making canyon walls.  
</P>
<P>
 In June, we sent artist and illustrator J.D. Crowe, who draws our weekly 
"Travel Insider" cartoons, to the "Great Crevice" to get his unique take on 
this summer's scene at the world's grandest canyon.  
</P>
<P>
 There are three types of people who go to the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The first group is a gob we will call "Goobers." They are your typical 
tourists. They drive to the Great Crevice and then roam around the rim with 
cameras in front of their faces telling their little Goobers to quit running. 
They buy T-shirts and key fobs, use the facilities and go on their way. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to get away from the Goobers, just go down a trail into the 
canyon. You won't have to go far. A few Goobers drift near the edge of the 
trails, but seldom venture further. The rangers spray the trails with Goober 
repellent. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact opposite of the Goobers are the people who take the canyon 
seriously. They don't come to see the canyon, they come to do it. The canyon is 
their cathedral. It is their World Cup soccer match. It is their Grateful Dead 
concert. These people are the "Game Facers." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere between the Goobers and the Game Facers is a group that is going 
through its awkward stage. These people are not as goobery as the Goobers, and 
they don't have as much game as the Game Facers. For phonetic reasons we dub 
them "Goomers." 
</P>
<P>
 I am a Goomer and so is my wife, Goomerella. 
</P>
<P>
 Goomers are the most fun. We are bred for misadventure. A handful of 
curiosity, a peck of pioneerism and a big bucket of naivete will get you a 
Goomer every time. Want to hike to the bottom of the canyon and back up to the 
rim on a nice toasty day in July? Sure! Grab a couple of Power Bars and a 
bottle of Evian and let's go! 
</P>
<P>
 How do you tell a Goober from a Goomer from a Game Facer? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's start down Bright Angel Trail into the canyon. We have already 
eliminated the Goobers. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you tell Goomers from Game Facers? 
</P>
<P>
 The clues are in the shoes. The more spontaneous Goomers wear whatever 
sneakers they own at the time. The Goomers who plan on hiking the Grand Canyon 
want to look the part, so they buy brand-new leather hiking boots. Nothing 
gives a Goomer more dang pride than going down Bright Angel Trail for the first 
time and getting his new boots dirty. Team dirty new boots with the smell of 
mule sweat and manure, and you have a Goomer so full of "Just Do It" that he 
might just try to jump over that Grand Gully. By the time the white-brown dirt 
near the rim of the canyon turns into the red dirt of the hot lower canyon, our 
Goomer's new shoes are putting a big hurt on 10 local toes. 
</P>
<P>
 Game Facers, on the other foot, wear hiking boots that are already worn and 
trustworthy. 
</P>
<P>
 As you get closer to the Colorado River at the canyon's bottom you will be 
more likely to spot Game Facers. A good place to watch the Goomers converge 
with the Game Facers is at the rest houses that dot key destinations along the 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest houses are rock shelters that offer sun-beaten hikers shade, water 
and a place to hold informal meetings about their journeys. Eight to 10 filthy, 
hot hikers can fit uncomfortably under a thick wooden roof as they line up to 
soak their bandannas and fill their canteens and bottles with 
canyon-temperature water piped in from Hades. 
</P>
<P>
 Those coming up from the bottom swap stories of hope and horror with those 
going down. The words of those who have come from the depths are held in 
reverence, more so than those from their descending counterparts, for they have 
seen the river and they know the true heat of the canyon on this day. 
</P>
<P>
 The best time for collecting tales of the day is at night. Goomerella and I 
stayed in a hiker's room at the Bright Angel Lodge on the South Rim. Each night 
after the sun had gone down and darkness chased away the Goobers, we would take 
our places on the rock wall of the rim and wait for shadowy figures to emerge 
from the deep and tell us stories. 
</P>
<P>
 One night after the sun had been asleep for almost two hours and the air was 
cool, two figures burdened with lots of backpacking gear ambled out of the 
black hole. 
</P>
<P>
 They told us their names were Bob and Sandy from St. Louis. They were college 
professors and avid bicyclists who loved the challenge of a good canyon outing. 
(They were Game Facers but quite friendly to us rim sitters. For all they knew 
we were Goobers.) They had hiked to the bottom the day before and camped near 
the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 Today they had gotten up at 4:30 and had breakfast at 7 in 90-degree heat. By 
midday they had reached Indian Gardens, about four miles from their starting 
point, and that is where they lounged in the shade for five hours, waiting out 
the 110 degrees of the afternoon sun. They were respectful of the canyon. They 
were exhausted. And they still had to find a place to spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
 The next night at 11, we thought we were going to have to go to bed without 
our bedtime story. At 11:15 we were blessed with the emergence of four more 
figures from the Black Trail. Jason, Chris, Josh and Matt looked like they had 
just crawled out from a remake of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, dude, our buddy said he had a place for us to stay at Phantom Ranch, so 
we walked all the way down there this afternoon and turns out it was bogus. We 
splashed around in the river for a while 'cause it was really hot, and then we 
came back up here. Man, we could use a beer or somethin'. Seeya later." 
</P>
<P>
 And off they went, those Goomers, with all of that youth. I'll take young 
Goomer energy over aged Game Face wisdom any day. About the Artist

TRAVEL INSIDER: NEW YORK CUTS -- YES, CUTS -- TAXES ON MOST HOTEL ROOMS; 
LODGING: TRIMMING 6% FROM CITY AND STATE TAXES WILL DROP THE BIG APPLE FROM 
FIRST TO EIGHTH ON THE LIST OF TOP BED-TAX CITIES -- BELOW CHICAGO AND L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to a pair of bold votes by city and state officials in recent weeks, 
taxes on most hotel rooms in New York City will soon be coming down 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax cut, a rarity among revenue-hungry cities and a startler in the city 
with the highest bed taxes in the nation, has sparked hope among tourism 
industry optimists that other cities will follow with reductions of their own. 
Those less optimistic say they'll be pleased if the move merely serves to 
discourage further increases around the country. Either way, if there's a trip 
to New York in your future, your bill is likely to be a few dollars less than 
it would have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Bed taxes, which can be levied by local or state governments or both, have 
become a politically expedient tool for raising government revenues in recent 
years: While the levies bring in new money, the people paying the taxes -- 
tourists -- generally aren't around to cast votes in the city or state that 
sets the rates. "Taxation without representation" is the familiar phrase often 
employed by enemies of the bed tax. (Most governments in Europe and around the 
world tax hotel rooms too, but travelers may not notice because hoteliers often 
build the tax rate into the prices they quote to customers. In New York and 
other U.S. cities, conversely, you'll generally find the tax tacked on in 
addition to the nightly rate you were quoted.) 
</P>
<P>
 While cash-strapped state and local governments have been thanking their lucky 
stars for these taxes, hoteliers and others in the tourism trade have argued 
that American cities are sabotaging themselves as tourism destinations. In New 
York City, convention bureau officials claimed that 44 gatherings worth $52 
million in tourist revenues were driven away last year by high bed tax rates. 
Those arguments have been widely ignored, until now. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for travelers, says John Marks, president of the San Francisco 
Convention & Visitors Bureau, "there's no indication that any California cities 
are looking at reducing the hotel tax at this point. I think that you have to 
keep in mind that the New York tax was off the charts . . . beyond reality." 
</P>
<P>
 The average cost of a New York City hotel room last year, according to a 
convention bureau survey of 231 hotels, was $137.81 -- before taxes. Then came 
the one-two punch of city and state hotel tariffs, which added 19.25% plus $2 
to the cost of every hotel room priced at $100 nightly or more. (Rooms under 
$100 were taxed 14.25% plus $2.) 
</P>
<P>
 But on June 8, New York's state legislature, led by Democratic Gov. Mario 
Cuomo, voted to repeal its 5% levy on rooms over $100, effective Sept. 1. Then, 
acting in the earliest hours of June 22 in prolonged budget hearings, New York 
City officials (led by Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani) agreed to shave 1% 
from the city's side of the tax on all hotel rooms. That cut is effective Dec. 
1. The hoteliers, it seems, persuaded elected officials they were being penny 
wise and pound foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: New York City's bed tax on all rooms will fall to 13.25% (of 
which 4.25% goes to state coffers and 9% to the city) plus $2. And New York 
will lose its title as home of the highest bed taxes in the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Altman, manager of communications for the New York Convention & 
Visitors Bureau, immediately set to calling convention planners and predicting 
an upturn for his city's massive tourism industry, which brought in 25 million 
visitors and an estimated $14 billion in spending last year. 
</P>
<P>
 By the reckoning of the Campaign to Keep Travel Competitive, a 
Washington-based lobbying group supported by about 40 travel industry groups, 
the major U.S. city with the highest bed taxes is now Columbus, Ohio, with a 
15.75% bed tax. In the wake of New York's cutback, says the campaign's director 
of tax policy, Rick Webster, Columbus city officials "are gonna be stuck out 
there like a sore thumb." 
</P>
<P>
 California has no state-imposed bed tax, and like most states it exempts hotel 
rooms from state sales taxes. But California's most-visited cities have 
embraced the bed tax as a revenue-generator. Los Angeles charges 14% in bed 
taxes; Anaheim, 11%; Sacramento, 11.5%; San Diego, 9%; San Francisco, 12%; San 
Jose, 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, by the count of the Campaign to Keep Travel Competitive are the U.S. 
destinations with highest bed-tax rates: 
</P>
<P>
 Columbus, 15.75%; Seattle, 15.2%; Houston, 15%; Chicago, 14.86%; Cleveland, 
14.5%; Los Angeles, 14%; St. Louis, 13.85%; New York, 13.25% plus $2 per night; 
Knoxville, 13.25%; Memphis, 13.25%; Atlanta, 13%; Austin, 13%; Dallas, 13%; San 
Antonio, 13%; Nashville, 12.25%; Washington, D.C., 11% plus $1.50 per night; 
New Orleans, 11% plus $1-$3 nightly. (Several more cities charge bed taxes 
between 11% and 12.25%, but don't add on surcharges like those imposed by 
Washington and New Orleans.)

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; LIGHTSHIP BASKETS IN THE LIMELIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At its height in the early 1800s, the whaling fleet that put out from 
Nantucket Island, off the coast of Massachusetts, numbered 88 ships and roamed 
as far as Antarctica. But whaling declined after 1850 and the sudden loss of 
work spurred islanders to transform a traditional craft into a cottage industry 
that still thrives today.While waiting out the long days on watch aboard 
floating lighthouses called "lightships," industrious former sailers wove 
unusual baskets that they later sold in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those first Nantucket "lightship baskets" are on display at the Fair 
Street Museum in a first-of-its-kind exhibition, "150 Years of Nantucket 
Lightship Baskets," sponsored by the Nantucket Historical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Made and sold only on Nantucket, a tiny island 30 miles southeast of Cape Cod, 
lightship baskets have become popular collectibles. Contemporary handmade 
baskets start at just under $400, but antiques have commanded thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional Nantucket lightship baskets are tightly woven of thin reed caning 
and shaped like a tub with a pair of oak handles. The lids are often decorated 
with scrimshaw, shells or maritime motifs. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit runs through Oct. 10 at the Fair Street Museum. Hours are 10 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. daily. For information, contact the historical association, (508) 
228-1894. CHRISTOPHER KENNEALLY

WEEKEND ESCAPE: LAKE MEAD; HOUSEBOAT HAVEN; BRING THE ICE CHEST, GOODIES AND 
GAMES -- THIS IS HEDONISM AFLOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To appease my sister on her 40th birthday, I spent a holiday weekend trapped 
on a houseboat with four insurance agents from Chicago. I had to sacrifice two 
vacation days and drive across the Mojave in 110-degree heat for the privilege. 
I was appalled that I was doing it and shocked to find I enjoyed it. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been pressured into coming along on the Lake Mead birthday trip. Ann, my 
sister, had anted up two years earlier on my landmark date and she felt no 
compunction about putting the screws to me when it came her turn. She wanted me 
along for my bucks, plain and simple. 
</P>
<P>
 So there I was, chauffeuring her across the desert on Labor Day weekend last 
year with over $300 worth of food melting down faster than Chernobyl in the 
trunk and only one measly bottle of tequila to see me through the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 She had arranged a rendezvous with five of her friends in the cheapest hotel 
rooms she could find in Las Vegas on a Thursday night ($25 at Circus Circus). 
Three people were arriving by air; three of us were driving in from Los Angeles 
in two cars and a friend of somebody's lived in Las Vegas and was joining us. 
By midnight everyone had arrived and by dawn's earliest light the seven of us, 
all women, were barreling toward the Echo Bay Marina on Lake Mead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann had made reservations for the 10-person houseboat in April (Lake Mead 
houseboats are often reserved a year in advance, but Rick Clemons, a spokesman 
for Seven Crown Resorts, says houseboats are still available for various weeks 
this summer). In May she sent in the $300 booking deposit. The balance of the 
rental fee had changed hands in July. When we arrived at the marina the only 
thing that stood between us and the water was a $350 security check, and 
rejecting their kind offer of propeller insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 (High season for boat rentals is June 15 to Sept. 15. During off season -- the 
rest of the year -- rentals are about two-thirds the cost of high season.) 
</P>
<P>
 The marina provided wheeled carts for transporting baggage, ice chests and the 
many bags of ice that we needed. We deployed our forces and had the cars 
unloaded, the boat loaded and the ice chests filled in less than 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 A quick checkout-of-the-boat procedure was mandatory (we should have paid more 
attention to the part about relighting the pilot lights). 
</P>
<P>
 Things to know about a houseboat. If you have any sailing experience, as one 
of our crew did, then piloting a houseboat is effortless. Those of us with no 
experience found, when entering a marina, that it was just as easy to push off 
the sides of other boats as it was to master steering. 
</P>
<P>
 Houseboats have a top speed of about six to 12 m.p.h., which makes them fairly 
foolproof. 
</P>
<P>
 Out on the open lake most other boats give houseboats a wide berth. Houseboats 
are slow, need lots of room to turn and are usually piloted by idiots. 
</P>
<P>
 Amenities. Boats come equipped with air conditioning (in August, the outside 
temperature ranges 85-105), microwave oven, refrigerator, stove top, propane 
grill, 38-gallon ice chest, wet bar, indoor/outdoor cassette stereo, deck 
chairs, 45 gallons of fresh water for drinking and cooking, 120-gallon holding 
tank of lake water for toilet flushing and showering, toaster, blender, pots, 
pans, utensils, dishes, glasses and 100 gallons of gasoline. (We put in 50 
gallons mid-weekend and then topped off the tank when we returned.) 
</P>
<P>
 Brings. You have to supply your own sheets, blankets, food, drinks and 
amusements. 
</P>
<P>
 The four women who worked for the insurance company (turns out they weren't 
agents after all) had traveled together on houseboats before. They had a daily 
routine that served us well on this trip. We would cruise during the heat of 
the day, six miles an hour is fast enough to stir up a breeze. Mid-afternoon we 
would begin looking for a quiet cove, which were easy to find even on a holiday 
weekend; there we would tie up for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 We'd swim (float around on air mattresses) or explore (paddle around in a 
kayak) the area until dark, then cook dinner and fall asleep at an 
unfashionably early hour. We'd be up with the dawn for more swimming (floating) 
and be underway again by 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long to adopt a fairly hedonistic style. After a while even 
wearing an entire swimsuit seemed like an awful imposition. Cooking became 
unthinkable -- anyone who was hungry had to forage through the ice chests for 
themselves. Our emphatic lack of activity eventually attracted buzzards. 
</P>
<P>
 We were visited by the local wildlife, icky albino-like rodents (in numbers 
that kept us from making many shore excursions), wild burros and mountain goats 
and a head banger (a guy with many visibly pierced body parts, tattoos and 
headphones) on a jet ski. He wanted our tie-up spot. We needed more ice but 
were too lazy to motor to the marina. We cut a deal, his ice today for our 
beach tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 We had a slight mechanical problem. One motor (fortunately there are two on 
the boat) quit working. We had to limp into the closest marina and call the 
houseboat company. 
</P>
<P>
 Early the next morning a mechanic arrived. He gave the healthy motor new spark 
plugs, then fiddled with the carburetor of the dead motor. The fast, friendly 
service was unlike anything we'd experienced since the advent of self-serve 
gasoline stations. No one knew how to handle the situation. Were we supposed to 
pay for repairs? Tip the mechanic? Hand over all our credit cards? While we 
were dithering, the mechanic left. The fix-it was free. 
</P>
<P>
 The only time sexist, man-about-the-houseboat notions crossed our minds was 
when it came time to anchor the boat each night. We had four anchor stakes that 
had to be driven into the rocky shoreline with a sledgehammer. It seemed a very 
macho sort of chore, but we managed, albeit in a limp-wristed, wet-nail-polish 
kind of style. In the mornings we would give the stakes a kick and they would 
fall over like a house of cards. It didn't seem very secure, but it always 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Our only disappointment was with our fellow boaters. Sometime during our first 
night someone swam up to our boat, cut the line on the kayak and stole it. 
Granted it was only a $99 inflatable job, but the boldness of the act made 
everyone a little jumpy. From then on, anyone who wanted to sleep under the 
stars on the roof of the boat would arm themselves with the now-useless paddle. 
</P>
<P>
 After four days afloat we were ready to return to civilization even if it 
meant unearthing some clothes. The ice supply was almost exhausted. The 
chicken, pancake mix, trail mix, muffins and butter had not been a big hit. The 
chocolate candy, chocolate cookies, beer, tequila and diet sodas were all 
consumed. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way we managed to be cheerful about the end of the journey was to 
plan the next one. We had noticed some other houseboats while we were cruising 
that were much nicer than ours. They were bigger, prettier and had a two-story 
slide off the back deck. We were consumed with houseboat lust. I could never 
justify the expense of the deluxe boat without dragging the whole family along, 
so the Chicago women, lovely people really, and I struck a deal for next 
summer. I would bring my two kids if they would bring along theirs, and we'd 
all go houseboating together. (We will be a party of 10 on Lake Powell this 
Labor Day weekend.) 
</P>
<P>
 After we parallel-parked the boat at the marina, got it checked out and gassed 
up, we were too tired to drive back to Los Angeles (so much activity in such a 
short time!). So we got a hotel room in Las Vegas, one that had room service. 
The next morning, as we waited for the valet parking attendant, my sister fed a 
slot machine and recouped all the money we had spent at the hotel. It seemed a 
sign that it was time go home. 
</P>

DESTINATION: HAWAII; MAUI MATTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DALE PAGET and SUSAN PAGET 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the basics that matter as we open the door of our beachfront cottage in 
Maui after two solid weeks of camping, cold showers and canned food. 
</P>
<P>
 "A kitchen!" 5-year-old Matilda exclaims. "A bedroom," yelps Henri, 7. "Arrgh 
ooooh," gargles 1-year-old Presley, spying herself in a full-length mirror. 
Four walls and a solid roof never looked so good. 
</P>
<P>
 This week we've swum with turtles on the Big Island, flown to Maui, been to 
Gilligan's Island and watched the sun set off Lahaina, on Maui's west coast. 
But they all take a momentary back seat to the marvel of returning to 
civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 Our dusty road to the Nona Lani Cottages in Kihei begins back on the Big 
Island a week ago with a gray gooey mash called poi. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no food more authentically Hawaiian than poi. Made from pounded taro 
root and water, poi is an island staple. Some eat it with sugar, others tell us 
it's a must with pork. Hawaiian moms feed it to their babies with cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Poi is essential for camping, according to Kimo Kahele and his family, who are 
our neighbors at Spencer Campground on the Kohala coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Every meal is "poi-time," says Kimo, who attributes his solid build to the 
power of poi. The unenlightened say it tastes like wallpaper paste. It's a dish 
that most mala'hinis (visitors) pass over at luaus, with some of the resorts 
even doctoring the taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimo wants us to try poi the way he likes it, with sardines, opa'e (dried 
shrimp) and a dip of soy sauce, vinegar and onions. 
</P>
<P>
 He puts the opa'e into the sauce, pops it in his mouth, adds a spoonful of poi 
from a bucket and chews. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only way to eat poi," mumbles Kimo, his mouth churning with 
delight. 
</P>
<P>
 We follow Kimo's instructions, first with opa'e , then sardines. The bland 
mashed root blends with the strong fish and sauce flavors. Dip and chew. Dip 
and chew. In 15 minutes flat, the platter of poi and fish is history. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimo and his family decide that the poi ceremony should end with a shot of 
firey chili pepper water -- chilies, soy sauce, garlic and spices mixed in an 
old Evian water bottle. We sip from the cap and A-L-O-H-A! It's a combustible 
brew that sets our stomachs on fire and makes the Kahele family burst out 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not a mala'hini anymore," Kimo shouts. "You're a kama'aina (a local)." 
</P>
<P>
 We're made to feel like kama'ainas by several families at Spencer Campground. 
The county park has one of the few sandy beaches on the Big Island and is a 
favorite of the locals who come with their snorkels to swim with the green sea 
turtles. The easygoing creatures munch seaweed close to shore, not paying much 
attention to the masked spectators gawking at them. 
</P>
<P>
 Before we leave, a 3-year-old girl with whom Henri and Matilda have made 
friends, presents them both with yellow plumeria leis she has strung onto 
fishing line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give them a hone, hone (kiss)," says the girl's mother. They give each other 
kisses and say aloha. 
</P>
<P>
 With the third plane trip in as many weeks, the kids are becoming junior 
jet-setters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this," Henri says as the island hopper dips down and prepares to land 
at Kahului, on the isthmus that separates Maui's two dormant volcanoes. Our 
20-minute flight ends in a modern airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Piled into a rental car, we head straight for the town's Safeway supermarket 
to stock up on supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing the islands on the cheap with our three kids has taken some serious 
creativity. Excluding air fares, after three weeks we are spending an average 
of $480 per week for the five of us -- which includes everything from car 
rental to new sandals and sun block. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget hotels hover around $50 a night. Knowing how to camp has been a 
definite advantage in cutting costs. The most expensive island campgrounds 
charge $5 per person, but many are free. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeding our brood is what really eats up our cash. Our grocery bills seem to 
be about double what we pay on the mainland. Spotting tourists at the check-out 
is easy -- we're the ones hyperventilating.

 With a couple bags of groceries in the trunk, we head northwest to Camp 
Pecusa, a beachside campground across from a sugar cane field off Hawaii 30. 
The camp sits beneath the foothills of the West Maui mountains, south of 
Lahaina and fronts onto a rich coral bay with views of Kahoolawe and Molokini 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for the dust from the fields you would think you had woken up 
in paradise," says amateur marine biologist, Norman Nelson, who has built the 
camp out of "a mishmash" of odds and ends over the past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 There are benches made out of old doors and pieces of driftwood. Wooden plank 
seats are built into the forks of trees for shady ocean viewing. The tent sites 
are carpeted and there's a washroom fitted with a mirror from an old car. 
</P>
<P>
 All that's missing are Ginger and Mary Ann. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have jokingly called this Gilligan's Island," Nelson says as he 
tosses a coconut for his golden retriever, Jennie, to chase. "This place 
appeals to whimsy." 
</P>
<P>
 Something changed for us during the last few days of camping. The street 
hawkers, who try to sell sailing and skin diving trips to meandering tourists, 
are letting us walk by, unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be the dirt under our fingernails or that our clothes haven't been 
ironed in weeks? Have we crossed that fine line from being island travelers to 
looking like homeless kama'ainas ? 
</P>
<P>
 It's definitely time to find a decent room and get our act together. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nona Lani Cottages on Kihei Road in Kihei are a find at $65 a night. Set 
in a garden of flowers with clear beach views, the cabins give us a hot bath, a 
comfy bed and the chance to make a real home-cooked meal. "Can we stay here 
forever?" Matilda asks.

TAKING THE KIDS: GREAT EXPECTATIONS, GRAND DISAPPOINTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Jill Waterman was counting on magic. She got aggravation. The trip was 
supposed to be a much-needed break with her twin boys. Even better, her parents 
were going along and together they planned to re-create, for Waterman's sons, 
their mother's favorite childhood vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the UCLA child psychologist found that the much-anticipated trip to 
Central California wasn't anything like what she'd remembered from her own 
childhood vacation. The wilderness area was crowded and hot. Her aging parents 
couldn't keep up with their two active 8-year-old grandsons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to give my kids the same wonderful experience I'd had, not taking 
into account that they're different people than I and that the experience has 
changed," Waterman said. "The kids had fun but I didn't have a very good time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Expectations are an adult thing, not a kid thing," said Sharon Berry, a child 
psychologist at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago. "Kids don't set 
themselves up to be disappointed like adults," Berry said. "They don't have 
ideas about vacation that are more global than 'Let's have fun.' I've never 
heard a kid say they've had a disappointing vacation. But I hear that from 
parents all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be because parents' expectations have likely never run higher, as 
they struggle to sandwich family vacations into busy work schedules and tight 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 But as expectations soar, so does the potential for disappointment. No one 
plans for squabbles in the car, the stress of spending so much time together or 
for sickness and crabby moods. Then there's the itinerary. It may be so 
ambitious that there's no time to relax. 
</P>
<P>
 That's no fun. It's always a good idea to have plenty of options for times 
when things don't go as planned. Instead of getting upset, calmly switch gears. 
If the hotel is horrible, look for another. Instead of sightseeing in the heat, 
spend the day in the hotel pool. Forgo the museum for a less-pressured 
afternoon at the park. When too much family togetherness has left everyone on 
edge, call a time-out and work out a strategy to spend a few hours apart. 
Everyone will be a lot happier.

DESTINATION: ARIZONA, BAJA; LOW-FAT DESERT; RANCHO LA PUERTA AND CANYON RANCH, 
TWO OF THE WORLD'S BEST 'RANCH' SPAS, ARE CLOSE BY, BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES. 
FOR STARTERS, ABOUT $1,000 A WEEK.

 If there's anything I know about, it's spas. I've been on the circuit for 
years and have trekked to far-flung corners of the earth for the spa-going 
experience. Closer to home, I've gone for tuneups to a score of American 
fitness camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I've never met a spa I didn't like, I do have my favorites, and 
topping my list are two "ranches" -- Canyon Ranch Health and Fitness Resort in 
Tucson and Rancho La Puerta in Tecate, Mexico. These wellness camps are both 
Southern California-adjacent, and they differ in style and price. But one is 
not better than the other. The choices are personal, and as far as I'm 
concerned, a stay at either place is a really good time. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Americans check into a spa when their body starts resembling a U-Haul 
trailer. Minutes after arrival, they work themselves into a feverish pitch, 
heading to the gym for some body sculpturing and adventurous weightlifting. All 
day long they're booked solid working to shed a few pounds and flatten the 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, when I started going to spas, I was like that too, a kamikaze 
fitness fanatic with a schedule that barely left time for a nap. Today, at 47, 
I have come to terms with my body and know that I cannot overhaul it in one 
week. Finally, I know what spas are for -- they're just another form of 
therapy. I go to either of the ranches when my head is a mess, when I'm jumping 
out of my skin. Once there, I proceed at my own happy pace. If it feels good to 
join the dropouts by the pool hiding behind their paperbacks, that's what I do. 
Unlike some spas, the ranches have great intelligence, allowing guests to do as 
they please, and it's perfectly respectable to do nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the ranches are one-stop co-ed fitness emporiums where the foundation 
for revitalization is vigorous exercise and fresh mountain air. Each day, 
approximately 50 different get-fit options are offered at both: aerobics, 
toning and stretching, walking and tennis clinics, calisthenics, tai chi, 
country line dancing, water classes, and weight and circuit training. All this 
alternates with massages, herbal wraps, yoga, and a host of New Age cures to 
make a slightly better you. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho La Puerta was founded in 1940 by a Britain-based native of Transylvania 
named Edmond Szekely and his American wife, Deborah. (Twenty years later, Mrs. 
Szekely founded the equally health-conscious but ritzier Golden Door in 
Escondido, Calif., which the Szekelys still own and operate.) In an adobe hut 
at the foot of a mountain sacred to the native Kumeyaay, the Szekelys 
established a health camp with a philosophy of fitness, spirituality and 
vegetarianism. Forty miles southeast of San Diego and three miles south of the 
Baja California border at Tecate, RLP is at 1,800 feet at the base of Mt. 
Kuchumaa, and has an idyllic year-round climate -- smogless and fogless, with 
clear days and starry nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Ranch was born in 1978, after local real estate developer Mel Zucherman 
watched his chain-smoking father die of lung cancer, and watched his own health 
deteriorate. "I was a man who had everything," he says, "high blood pressure, 
high cholesterol and ulcers." After visiting several spas, Zucherman 
experienced the miracle of restored health and knew what he wanted to do with 
the rest of his life: launch his own place. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Ranch started, in Zucherman's words, as a "fat farm," but has evolved 
into an elite fitness retreat with full-time doctors, psychologists, nurses, 
dietitians and physiotherapists. Zucherman is a believer in the mind-body 
connection -- that emotional and spiritual health is as important to overall 
well-being as physical fitness -- and everything at the ranch is calculated to 
help guests "open themselves to new personal possibilities," according to 
marketing director Brian Shultz. In 1989, Zucherman took his complete bag of 
Tucson tricks to Lenox, Mass., and opened Canyon Ranch in the Berkshires. Since 
then, executive fitness and renewal has become a big deal, and corporations 
send their burned-out executives to both of his ranches to unwind. 
</P>
<P>
 At Canyon Ranch in Tucson, summer guests fork over a minimum of $2,564.00 
(which includes $2,040 for basic accommodations, plus an 18% service charge and 
tax) to be cosseted for one week in a single-occupancy room with television, 
VCR, telephone and air conditioning. Expensive? You betcha. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch lists among its assets a 62,000-square-foot spa; a sophisticated 
medical facility with an a la carte list of services, including cardiac 
treadmill stress tests, bone density evaluations and metabolic rate testing; 60 
massage therapists, and a 55-member "health and healing staff" that includes 
medical doctors and behavioral and other therapists to deal with "the inner 
child," depression, stress, disabling pain, sexual problems, sleep disorders 
and compulsions. Guests can sign up for 125 different hikes (offered at 
different levels of difficulty), biking in spectacular Sabino Canyon (two miles 
away) and an assortment of gentle walks. Other services include hypnosis, "life 
regressions," smoking cessation and several dozen pampering beauty and body 
therapies. 
</P>
<P>
 In my estimation, Canyon Ranch is worth its considerable price. Few guests 
spend $2,600 just to lose five pounds. Many, probably most, arrive at the ranch 
feeling just as I did during a recent personal crisis -- tired, depressed, 
depleted. I had been on a junk food rampage and had learned how to chain-smoke 
unfiltered cigarettes. One week later, I had kicked the nicotine habit, had 
returned to the proper dietary track and my self-esteem was soaring. I felt 
transformed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the expensive realm of health spas, Rancho La Puerta was made for bargain 
hunters. The summer package (including minimum accommodations) starts at about 
$1,630 for one week, including tax, and the services, as such services go, are 
inexpensive: $30 for a massage, $10 for a manicure, $15 for an herbal wrap. 
Another big difference is that at RLP "rooms come without televisions, 
telephones and VCR's because you can't find solitude when you have noise," 
according to the Szekelys' son Alex, who now runs the spa. RLP guests live in 
rustic but cozy colonial style haciendas with fireplaces, patios, private 
gardens and ceiling fans, but no air conditioning. Facilities are spread over 
300 acres so "the world doesn't seep in, and guests never go near a car or a 
road," Szekely says. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Ranch, located in northeast Tucson, 21 miles from the airport, is much 
more compact and not quite as remote or as close to nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the matter of capacity. Canyon Ranch accommodates 300 guests per 
week (usually 40% men, 60% women), and Rancho La Puerta accepts 150 (men 
account for about 20%). At both places you'll find the Hollywood aristocracy 
and a spiffy clientele of super-achievers seeking respite from the fast lane. 
During one stay at Canyon Ranch, I spotted Robin Williams, Kirk Douglas, 
Courtney Love and George C. Scott. Barbra Streisand and Donna Karan had just 
checked out. RLP guests have included William F. Buckley, Oprah, Madonna, Jody 
Foster and Sophia Loren. 
</P>
<P>
 At RLP, guests arrive on Saturdays for a minimum one-week stay; at Canyon 
Ranch, guests arrive any day of the week for a minimum two-day stay and can 
stay as long as they like. According to Katie Garber, CR public relations 
director, one guest stayed 136 nights. The barriers between people seem to 
crumble more quickly at Rancho La Puerta because everyone arrives and leaves 
together. Maybe it's because you pump and stretch with your new friends seven 
days straight, but the camaraderie is infectious; the experience always takes 
me back to my summer camp days. 
</P>
<P>
 Will RLP ever hire a therapist to help you cope, or a doctor to give you a 
physical? Not a chance. "Therapists take the power away from you," says Alex 
Szekely, reflecting another big difference between the two wellness camps. "If 
you need to see a doctor, there are doctors in San Diego. Our guests learn to 
listen to their "inner voice" . . . . If someone's going through something 
difficult, guests talk to other guests or to a staff member," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 I could forsake almost anything else at RLP, but not the hikes. The internal 
chatter always stops as we struggle up the trail on the eight-mile sunrise 
hike. "Don't forget to breathe deeply," says our guide, who has the stamina of 
a decathlon medalist. Back home, I try to recall the smell of the sage, the 
silence, the silliness, how serene I felt. 
</P>
<P>
 Both ranches provide a slew of lectures that deal with everything from obesity 
to impotence. At a recent trip to Canyon Ranch, I counted 25 complimentary 
lectures during the week. RLP's lecture schedule also covers a dizzying 
spectrum of topics, though none is so remarkable as the "Inner Journey" program 
launched in 1986 by fitness director Phyllis Pilgrim to "help guests be less 
neurotic." 
</P>
<P>
 Pilgrim, who studied yoga in India and has been practicing and teaching yoga 
for 34 years, offers a one-hour session Mondays through Fridays at no extra 
charge. Her lectures deal with spirituality, mind-body awareness, the 
acceptance of change and Eastern religions. But when the candles are lit and 
Tibetan bells signal the start of meditation, it is an affirmation of why I go 
to RLP. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to help guests clear their mind and experience their inner space," 
Pilgrim says. "Most people have never experienced this; in fact, many don't 
know what I'm talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the food, there are lots of clever low-fat, low-cal entrees coming out 
of both ranch kitchens. Guests can eat, really eat, free of guilt. I had bread, 
pizza, caffeinated coffee, desserts -- as much or as little as I wanted. Now 
entering its 54th year, RLP serves vegetarian fare and grows its food without 
pesticides in a six-acre garden on the property. RLP guests get butter with 
their bread and help themselves in the buffet line, while CR guests order from 
a menu, have a pasta bar and a salad bar, and feast on no-fat yogurt with 
no-fat chocolate sauce, waffles, risotto, hamburgers, French fries, lamb and 
beef tenderloin. 
</P>
<P>
 Both ranches generally have a few "prom queens" in residence, but they're 
definitely the exception. Having visited spas such as the Greenhouse in Dallas 
where ladies wear makeup and jewelry to dinner, I prefer both ranches, where 
most everyone walks around looking disorderly. Another wonderful feature of 
both places is that they're ideal for singles. At dinner, I was seated with 
others who had come solo, and the singles tables were always the liveliest. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of my stay at either ranch, I have so much energy I can't stop 
squirming, but I'm so calm I've forgotten my ZIP Code. The last time I left 
Rancho La Puerta, I got off the plane, walked into my house and set off the 
alarm. I couldn't remember the security code. No, my hips don't disappear, but 
my stress sure does. GUIDEBOOK: Ranch Renewals

SPIRIT OF SHERIDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christopher Reynold's splendid article about Sheridan, Wyo., and surrounding 
small towns captured the spirit of the area ("True West," June 19). 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up in Buffalo, Wyo., 30-plus miles south of Sheridan. Legend has it 
that the Occidental Hotel in Buffalo was where the Virginian "got his man." 
Owen Wister, author of "The Virginian," stayed there briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jim Gatchell Memorial Museum in Buffalo has displays and artifacts of 
historical events of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. 16 from Buffalo to Yellowstone will take you past streams, lakes and 
wilderness areas over the Bighorn Mountains and through Tensleep Canyon. The 
scenery is breathtaking. There are campsites and hiking trails for real nature 
lovers.

 I don't want to put too fine an edge on it, but there is no Interstate 16 in 
Wyoming. Interstate 16 runs from Macon to Savannah, Ga. You may have meant U.S. 
Highway 16. However U.S. 16 does not run to or through Sheridan. U.S. 14 does 
run from Sheridan to Yellowstone. Good story though. I just hope Sheridan 
doesn't "get discovered" like Bozeman, Livingston and others. Wyoming is a 
great vacation destination. There's more to it than Yellowstone; the people are 
pretty friendly, too. 
</P>
<P>
 ROB STEVENS, Chino 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I read your article on my hometown, Sheridan, with a sense of dread that the 
very qualities that have preserved the quality of life there will be challenged 
and lost if it becomes the "new" destination for the burnt-out and 
disillusioned denizens of Aspen and Livingston. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Reynolds mentions the fine turn-of-the-century buildings that line 
Main Street, but Sheridan has not been spared the ticky-tacky modernization 
movement of the '50s and '60s that disfigured many of these fine facades. 
Readers should note the tacky "barn and shingle" modernization of King Saddlery 
in the photograph of Main Street. Mr. King should turn his eye for the past to 
the front of his business! 
</P>
<P>
 The Bradford Brinton Memorial is given much too little mention in your 
article. This museum presents the works of Edward Borein, Frederic Remington, 
Charles M. Russell, Joe de Yong, and countless other notable Western artists in 
the intimate setting of Mr. Brinton's ranch home. The self-guided tour is a 
unique experience.

PAGET POSTCARDS

 How wonderful to see the Pagets off once again ("Postcards From Paradise")! 
Two years ago, I turned to each week's installment of their trip across country 
first as I flipped through the Sunday Times. Now, what a treat to visit Hawaii 
through their eyes!

 Having vacationed in Hilo, Hawaii, (I find) the Pagets' travels bring back 
many happy memories, along with some unusual and interesting ones: Craving the 
delicious coffee bean candy and ending up with a good case of "java jitters" 
for two days was an interesting experience not to be repeated. Next time, we'll 
limit ourselves to one handful. And then there are the rains that keep 
everything clean and bright and explain the burst of blossoms everywhere, 
permeating the air with warm sweet fragrances. I'm grateful to the Pagets for 
helping me recall these memories.

BATHED IN MEMORIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 We found many similarities between our experience with Turkish baths and that 
of Patricia Beeson ("Turkish Bathos," May 15). Ours, however, was in Kusadasi, 
Turkey, and apparently was a more pleasant, more sanitary experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The domed room with the center platform and the basin-lined walls were 
similar, and the bathing-massaging routine sounded the same. However, we did 
not have to share the room with 200 Turkish women nor frolicking rodents; we 
had it to ourselves. We each had a male masseur who was appropriately attired 
and who gave a bath-massage of appropriate intensity and thoroughness. We were 
provided a modicum of modesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, we were provided with clean Turkish towels and allowed to dress at 
leisure in changing booths that lacked any Twain-like "rusty old mattresses." 
In short, it was a very unique and pleasant experience.

 SAVED IN SPACE: One small step for Congress, one giant leap for Canoga Park. 
That's one way of looking at the recent House vote to fund the proposed space 
station.Much of the work on the project would be done by about 1,000 employees 
at Rockwell International's Rocketdyne Division in Canoga Park. . . . "Clearly, 
those jobs would be at risk if the space station were to be canceled," said 
corporate spokesman Bill Blanning.

 JUST A SECOND: You never have enough time, do you? Of course not. Well, Friday 
was different. At midnight, Britain's Royal Observatory added one second to the

DUDES GO WESTERN; CITY SLICKERS PAY GOOD MONEY TO EAT DUST ON RENO CATTLE DRIVE 
</P>

 They spend five long days in the saddle, baking in desert heat and choking on 
dust to drive 300 head of stubborn cattle 60 miles over the Sierra to the Reno 
Rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
 And they pay to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reno Rodeo cattle drive has become a tradition with horse lovers and 
Western fans who come from around the country to Doyle, Calif., for the annual 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a way for people who live entirely 20th-Century lives to experience a 
small piece of the vanishing American West," said genial trail boss Steve 
Milstein, a Reno surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in its fifth year, the cattle drive is booked months in advance by city 
folk who ante up some $1,000 to sleep under the stars, rise at dawn and spend 
eight hours in the saddle. 
</P>
<P>
 For the real cowboys, the drive gets the livestock to the rodeo. For the 
non-cowboys, it's a Western experience. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's event, celebrating the rodeo's 75th anniversary, attracted 57 
guest buckaroos, some of whom mounted a horse for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 A few were less than willing participants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really want to come, but it was my husband's fantasy and I thought 
I'd better give it a try," said Candy Lautenschleger of Massillon, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's riding gear reflected their attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Candy Lautenschleger came dressed for comfort in soft boots, loosely cut jeans 
and a straw gardening hat. Rob Lautenschleger, his mustache freshly waxed, was 
outfitted in turn-of-the-century chaps and a 10-gallon hat.

TMJ VICTIMS BLAME TEFLON JAW IMPLANTS FOR MUCH PAIN AND SUFFERING; MEDICINE: 
DEVICE, NOW OFF THE MARKET, WAS INTENDED TO CURE AN EXCRUCIATING AILMENT. 
INVENTOR MOVED TO SWITZERLAND TO ESCAPE LAWSUITS; FIRM IS BANKRUPT.

<P>
 Betty Jean Meyer used to be a top real estate agent who looked forward to 
having children. But now, she would settle for a moment without pain. 
</P>
<P>
 At the mercy of a jaw disorder that has worsened despite four operations, she 
spends many days in a quiet, darkened room. She takes methadone for pain relief 
and says only the support of her husband and love of her adopted daughter have 
saved her from suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last five years have just been a nightmare," said Meyer, a 42-year-old 
Tucson resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer is among thousands who received a promising medical technology that 
failed, a Teflon-coated surgical implant meant to cure an excruciating ailment 
of the jaw joint called temporomandibular joint syndrome or disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems with the implants have left a trail of torment, accusations, 
litigation, tattered reputations, even suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 The company that made the implants, Vitek Inc. of Houston, went out of 
business under a deluge of lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who invented the implants -- and the material from which they're made 
-- has moved to Switzerland, where he is safe from the legal morass. 
</P>
<P>
 And thousands of sufferers from TMJ, as the ailment is known, are trying to 
live with pain, continued jaw degeneration and other problems they blame on the 
implants.  
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Barry Davis says the government failed to require proper testing 
before the implants were put on the market, and oral surgeons rushed to use the 
devices without questioning their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like 18th-Century stuff. They were doing to people what traditionally 
is done on laboratory test animals," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 TMJ ailments affect the complex joints that allow the lower jaw to move up and 
down, side to side, back and forth in chewing, speaking, yawning, swallowing 
and other motions. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex maze of blood vessels, nerves and muscles is subject to 300 pounds 
of pressure, which can wear out the natural, leather-like disc that cushions 
the rounded ends of the jawbone in their sockets. 
</P>
<P>
 A blow can dislocate the disc, and arthritis and such movements as clenching 
or grinding can wear the disc out. 
</P>
<P>
 That can cause searing pain in the face, neck, jaw or ear; headaches; or 
clenching or grinding of the teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no firm figures on the number of TMJ sufferers, according to the 
National Institute of Dental Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) told Congress in 1992 that 500,000 to 1 million new 
patients annually seek treatment for TMJ pain, dizziness and other symptoms. 
Most experts say 80% to 90% of TMJ sufferers are women. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of a 
quarter-sized, doughnut-shaped disc made of a material called Proplast Teflon, 
a porous, sponge-like plastic fused with carbon or aluminum oxide. 
</P>
<P>
 The device was invented by Vitek founder Charles Homsy, a chemical engineer 
who had invented the Proplast material in 1968. About 26,000 of the Proplast 
discs were sold to oral surgeons, and Homsy estimates 10,000 were implanted. 
</P>
<P>
 But it turned out the man-made implants wore out too, crumbling into 
microscopic sand-like grains of Teflon, which the body can't metabolize. That 
created what scientists call a "giant cell" reaction, where the body tries to 
engulf the foreign matter, triggering inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction can continue after implants have been removed and replaced, even 
with a patient's own tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitek started including warnings with the product in 1986. Two years later, 
facing liability problems, Vitek withdrew the implants from the market. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1990, the FDA issued a safety alert. The next month it recalled 
the Vitek implants and later seized the inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the American Assn. of Maxillofacial Surgeons recommended that 
anyone who has the implant should have it removed, said Dr. Daniel Laskin, a 
spokesman for the association. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was too soft a material for the bone to function against," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Homsy, who now lives in Nyon, Switzerland, is adamant that Proplast isn't 
the culprit. He says in many cases TMJ "will not stop even with appropriate 
surgical procedure." He insists poor technique or patient failure to follow a 
conservative post-surgical regimen led to many patients' problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, a $22-million settlement fund set up in the bankruptcy of Vitek 
and its subsidiaries has 2,300 claimants. 
</P>
<P>
 Homsy has been named in scores of lawsuits by patients, as have his chief 
clinical consultant, oral surgeon Dr. John Kent; Du Pont, the supplier of 
Teflon; and hundreds of oral surgeons who performed implants. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Pont, which says it was merely the supplier of the material, says it has 
won 225 cases and is appealing its only loss to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lewis Estabrooks of Portland, Me., who was a defense witness in one Vitek 
case and has reviewed others for Du Pont, said he and his partners implanted 
378 discs in 259 patients from 1981 to 1987. Of those, 143 discs remain in 
place for 126 patients who are doing well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estabrooks is among those surgeons who believe many Proplast implants failed 
because there already was degenerative disease, or because the implants 
followed earlier unsuccessful treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is no dispute about the suffering of those who have failed 
implants. Terrie Cowley, president of the TMJ Assn., a Milwaukee-based support 
group, said several implant-recipient suicides have been documented. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of TMJ sufferers have had implants removed and jaws rebuilt, with no 
lasting success. Some are relegated to liquid diets. Many are extremely thin. 
</P>
<P>
 "They literally look like they've been starved for 10 years," said Tucson oral 
surgeon Dr. Steve Harkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Marks of New Orleans calls Homsy "Dr. Frankenstein." Her TMJ problems 
began after a 1978 car accident; she's had 22 surgeries, and likens her 
constant pain to a red-hot barbecue skewer through her head. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Jean Meyer's left and right Proplast disc implants broke down; so did 
the Proplast total joint implants that followed. They were replaced by rib 
grafts and shoulder muscle -- but her jawbone keeps deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
 She has had to fight morphine dependency, and another medication, Dilaudid, so 
confused her that "I got lost in my own back yard," she said. Demerol and 
methadone now make the anguish bearable, but not better. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain is constant," she said.

STAR OF HITCHCOCK THRILLER KEEPS BLOOD STIRRING IN OWN PRIVATE JUNGLE; TIPPI 
HEDREN: ACTRESS IS YEARS AWAY FROM THE FILM CLASSIC, 'THE BIRDS.' NOW, SHE 
HOLDS COURT WITH ANIMALS HOUSED IN HER SHAMBALA PRESERVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB THOMAS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Tippi Hedren was jolted awake by the Jan. 17 earthquake, her first 
thoughts were like something out of "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 "Are the gates holding? Are the fences holding?" 
</P>
<P>
 She was alarmed because behind the gates and fences of her Shambala Preserve 
here, about 25 miles from the epicenter, reside 76 big cats from the veldts and 
jungles of Africa and Asia. Fortunately, all of the enclosures held firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cats took it all in stride," the actress reported. "Except for Delilah, a 
lioness who was very nervous and paced for a couple of hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bull elephant was furious. Unlike the cats, he was enclosed in a barn, 
and he was angry that something had shaken it. That was his privilege, to shake 
the barn. He was trumpeting and screaming for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Shambala had survived another of its many crises, both physical and fiscal. 
This cottonwood-shaded oasis for animals in rustic Soledad Canyon about 40 
miles north of Los Angeles continues to thrive, thanks in large part to its 
founder. 
</P>
<P>
 Tippi Hedren seems oddly cast as the operator of a refuge for homeless and 
unwanted animals. She made a sensational film debut in 1963 with "The Birds," 
in which she was attacked by flocks of crows and gulls. She followed with 
another Alfred Hitchcock thriller, co-starring with Sean Connery in "Marnie." 
She was hailed as heiress apparent to the line of blond beauty ice queens of 
Hitchcock movies. 
</P>
<P>
 She seems totally at home in Shambala (a Sanskrit word for a refuge of peace 
and harmony for all beings). Nearing 60, she is slim as a ballerina in a 
bright-green shirt, form-fitting jeans and black boots. She strides confidently 
along the gently flowing Santa Clara River, pausing for a little roughhouse 
with a tiger out for a stroll with its trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping at an enclosure, she said: "This little tiger was being offered for 
$10,000 out of a car parked in Fashion Island in Newport Beach. Fortunately, 
some caring person called the Fish and Game Department, and the cubs were 
confiscated. There are a lot of illegal breeders offering animals as pets and 
taking them away from their mothers before they have the nutrients to make them 
immune." 
</P>
<P>
 She continued the tour, pointing out two servals contributed by a Chicago 
couple who could no longer care for them. Other compounds contain black and 
spotted leopards, a snow leopard, cougars, Siberian as well as Bengal tigers. 
All have been born in captivity, she explained, so none could survive in the 
wild. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Mikey," she said, stopping near a majestic lion. "Mikey was found 
abandoned in a mechanic's yard in Yonkers, N.Y. The ASPCA called us. He lives 
with those two lionesses over there in the holding compound. Sometimes if he's 
with them too often he gets very macho and he's very tough on them. So they get 
separated and have a little R & R. Then they join him again, and everything is 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedren explained more about Shambala, sitting in front of her relic-filled 
office-home amid a blizzard of cotton. "This happens to the trees for a month 
every year, and it drives all of us crazy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shambala had its origins in 1969 when Hedren made a couple of films in Africa. 
She was appalled at the decimation of wild animals by hunters, settlers and 
poachers. She and her then-husband, producer Noel Marshall, decided to make a 
film, "Roar," to dramatize the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Movie trainers wouldn't allow their animals to work with others because they 
were afraid of fights," Hedren said. "So we decided to get our own animals." 
</P>
<P>
 They acquired an animal rental spread in Soledad Canyon, and "Roar" was filmed 
there starring Hedren and her daughter, Melanie Griffith. "Roar" was never 
released domestically, but as the years went by, Shambala became known to a 
network of animal lovers. Abandoned and homeless cats, as well as excess 
animals from zoos, came to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no breeding, no buying and no selling," Hedren explained. "When an 
animal comes here, it is here for life." 
</P>
<P>
 She will occasionally rent cats for movie roles, but only if they are in 
"dignified" situations. One of the tigers is currently working in Disney's "The 
Jungle Book" on location in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedren, who is in the process of divorcing retired manufacturer Luis 
Barrenechea, says her animals require her full attention. "I shouldn't be 
married," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping Shambala in business has proved a constant challenge. A 1978 flood 
almost demolished the compound and killed three lions. Annual expenses amount 
to $250,000 -- imagine the meat bills. The money comes from private donors, 
twice-monthly tours, a gift shop, rentals for weddings, company parties and the 
like. Also from Hedren herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really need to work," she said. "People think that I'm no longer interested 
in acting and only interested in working with the animals. Obviously I have 
given that impression, but it is not how I feel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm a good actor. I think I look OK. I don't understand why I'm not 
working all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 She appeared recently in Showtime's "The Birds II: Land's End" and is now cast 
in the HBO series "Dream On." 
</P>
<P>
 Daughter Melanie Griffith, meanwhile, seems to work steadily and Hedren says 
she is proud of her film career. The two enjoy a close relationship and see 
each other often at Griffith's homes in Beverly Hills and Aspen, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Tippi Hedren came to Hollywood in storybook style. A top New York model, she 
appeared in a diet drink commercial that Hitchcock saw on the "Today Show." A 
short time later she was besieged by gulls in her hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty amazing," she contemplated, "how one little incident can 
literally move you in a course that could probably never, ever be attained 
otherwise. It's a wonderful thing to be associated with a film of that caliber. 
People often say, 'Don't you get tired talking about it?' I never do." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedren recalled that she was neither hurt -- "except for a small scratches" -- 
nor scared during the bird attacks. An animal lover all her life, she said: 
"Not too many things scare me. The thing that scares me is getting old. I don't 
want to get old; it scares me. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," she said with a rueful laugh, "it's gonna happen."

COUNTY ECONOMIC REPORT IS ENCOURAGING; CHAPMAN STUDY SEES LOCAL JOBS INCREASE, 
BUT OUTLOOK TEMPERED BY STUBBORN REALITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The power of the recession in Orange County could not be underestimated. How 
else to explain this solidly Republican terrain's flirtations in 1992 with Ross 
Perot and even Bill Clinton? But if we have learned about the soft spots in 
previously fixed national political stereotypes about the area, we continue to 
surprise ourselves as the region tries to climb ever so slowly out of trying 
economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes an encouraging mid-year report from Chapman University, which finds 
that overseas sales in high-technology products and the medical industry are 
expected to add 10,000 jobs this year. The result is a more favorable economic 
outlook for the county than had been forecast at the end of last year. Welcome 
to Orange County, international crossroad and marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 If there has been an uptick in the wind before now, it also has been tempered 
at key turns by stubborn realities. There are threats of more layoffs in the 
aerospace industry, and an impasse continues in Anaheim, where the Walt Disney 
Co. has put plans for a theme park expansion on hold. Orange County, like the 
region, has been battered by the recession, and has been especially hurt by a 
stalled housing market.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Chapman Center for Economic Research finds hopeful stirrings in the 
housing industry with appreciable growth in both housing sales and in retail 
sales. A projected increase in building permit values to $1.9 billion has to be 
favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 However, while the report shares the UCLA Business Forecasting Project's 
assessment that the state's recovery is underway, it also concludes that the 
recovery is being reined in by short-term interest rate increases and the 
continuing layoffs in aerospace. The UCLA study found that higher interest 
rates prompted by the Federal Reserve's efforts to head off inflation have put 
a lid on residential building in the state during the first quarter. The 
Chapman report projects encouragingly that demand for housing in Orange County 
will result in nearly double the construction of housing units through the 
decade. However, it too sees recovery affected by interest rates for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 This new activity reflects consumer growth, but alas, this can be a fragile 
thing. The increase in costs for mortgages and other loans can put the lid on 
California's and specifically Orange County's rebound.  
</P>
<P>
 But it has to be heartening to find evidence of the county's stirring 
international economy, of its economic diversity, and also of the prospect of 
somewhat better times.

CLEANING UP JOBS JUST PART OF SOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I think if Priscilla Mayfield were willing to look at all aspects of 
immigration, she would find that she herself is involved in a great deal of 
self-deception ("Depending on Immigrants -- and Self-Deception," Column, June 
29). 
</P>
<P>
 What is the cause of the dismal conditions of the workers in the fields and 
the 24-hour nannies? At the beginning of the article she states that no one but 
the immigrants (illegal?) are willing to take these jobs.Why? Because most are 
operating outside the law. This makes it possible to pay sub-human wages and to 
treat people in such an inhumane manner. 
</P>
<P>
 American workers have fought for years to obtain and maintain civil working 
conditions and wages. The illegal workers have turned our labor laws into just 
as much trash as they have our immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Mayfield cannot have it both ways. We will control our borders and our 
workplaces or we will have barely paid, cruelly treated workers. Don't ask me 
to ignore illegal immigration and to clean up the workplace. It cannot be done. 
</P>
<P>
 If you demand that the immigration laws are followed, you will find employers 
will clean up the jobs to attract workers. Then and only then will you see the 
workers paid enough to live civilly and be treated humanely on the job. The 
really sad part is the fact that once illegal immigrants move in and work under 
such wages and conditions, the less-trained American-born workers must accept 
those conditions or not work. You then look at the American worker and shake 
your head at their failure to work when you have already said no one should 
accept these conditions.

EXPLORING THEORY OF STRESS, CANCER LINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I would like to offer my theory to Dr. Hoda Anton-Culver why Orange County 
women have a breast cancer rate twice that of the nation.("Hunt Goes On for 
Clues to Higher Rate of Breast Cancer Locally," commentary on health, June 26). 
There is a theory Dr. Anton-Culver didn't talk about, that breast cancer is 
caused by elevated stress levels. 
</P>
<P>
 I have traveled extensively and I have said for years that Orange County women 
are the most "stressed out" women in the nation. By "stressed out," I mean high 
worry levels about material things and status. I think it is a theory worth 
investigating.

THE POND DOES SWIMMINGLY IN ITS 1ST YEAR; THE SUCCESSES HAVE UNDERSCORED 
ANAHEIM'S IDENTITY AS AN ENTERTAINMENT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The massive building at Katella Avenue and Douglass Road was once informally 
known as "the white elephant." Now it is The Pond of Anaheim, successful home 
to a professional hockey team, touring singers and soccer players. What a 
difference a year makes. 
</P>
<P>
 The indoor sports arena was the result of daring, gambling and extraordinary 
good luck. The man who said arena backers rolled the dice and won knew what he 
was talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catch-22 of new sports arenas is that most cities will not build an arena 
until they have a commitment from a professional team that it will play there. 
But most teams will not commit without a built stadium. In the late 1980s, 
Santa Ana and Anaheim were battling to be the first in Orange County with an 
indoor sports arena. It was clear the county could support only one such 
building, and even that was not a certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana waited for a commitment from a team. Anaheim went ahead and signed a 
deal with investors under which they would pay for the building, the city would 
provide the land, and both would share in the revenue. Ground was broken in 
1990, but it was not until 1992 that the Walt Disney Co. calmed the worries of 
arena backers.  
</P>
<P>
 Disney surprised just about everyone with the announcement that it would 
obtain a National Hockey League franchise and install the team it called the 
Mighty Ducks in the building it called The Pond.  
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have been a box office smash, and better than expected on the ice, 
despite having a losing record.  
</P>
<P>
 But in the larger sense, they have underscored Anaheim's identity as an 
entertainment center. Yes, the city does have industry. But Anaheim is best 
known for Disneyland, the Angels baseball team and, for now, the Rams football 
team, and the convention center. And those attractions support the businesses 
all over town. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim took a pretty risky gamble, but all's well that ends well, even with a 
bit of good luck to help out. The trick is learning to manage the risks, which 
in this case Anaheim has done.

MANY QUESTIONS LINGER ABOUT BREA OLINDA HIGH GRADE CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I retired in 1990 after 23 years as a teacher and administrator at Brea 
Olinda High School, and I have watched with sadness and outrage as the 
reputation of a fine school has been attacked with questions about its 
educational integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing false allegation that the practices currently under 
investigation there occurred over a 10-year period implies that this is an 
established part of the school culture, not the recent aberration it is. 
</P>
<P>
 This unfairly damages not only honest and dedicated educators, but also 
students at Brea Olinda who work hard to achieve success and who present 
authentic academic transcripts to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The class of 1990 (with whom I "graduated") left irrefutable evidence of their 
achievements: state test scores in the top 5% statewide; SAT scores higher than 
national, state and county averages; completion of advanced math and science 
well above the norm; and other objective documentation of solid academic 
performance. Among that class were about a dozen National Merit scholars, as 
well as students who brought honor to the school and themselves by championship 
performances in music, dance, drama, speech and athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Student achievements like these and the hard work of a dedicated staff formed 
the basis for the national recognition of Brea Olinda as a distinguished 
National Blue Ribbon School. 
</P>
<P>
 Who speaks now for these students? Who speaks for the honest, hard-working 
staff who served them? The respect for themselves and the pride in their school 
which these students felt are gravely undermined by editorial allegations that 
they cheated and lied, and educators helped them do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happened to the transcripts of the 1991-94 graduates should not be 
allowed to harm the self-respect and confidence of students, nor should those 
responsible for the present problems be allowed to shift blame to others who 
served before them and are innocent of grade changing and other unethical 
manipulation of student transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
 JEAN SULLIVAN 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia 
</P>
<P>
 * The recent revelations reported by The Times regarding illegal grade changes 
and the issuance of duplicate academic credit at Brea Olinda High School are 
highly distressing. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet even more distressing is the rather matter-of-fact response of the 
Brea superintendent and certain school board members. Rather than treating 
these acts as violations of state law and serious examples of unethical 
conduct, the superintendent has been quoted as believing that the grade changes 
and issuance of duplicate credit are merely instances of poor judgment not 
deserving additional attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a stance is yet another example of the lack of importance some educators 
ascribe to ethical conduct and their lack of conviction when it comes to taking 
an unpopular stand based upon ethics. Certainly the involved students and their 
parents would have been outraged if eligibility for graduation had been 
impacted. And certainly it was the expeditious and "easy road" that the Brea 
school board took with its "midnight" decision to temporarily reduce the 1994 
graduation requirements in order to allow seniors who were the "beneficiaries" 
of the duplicate credit to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 But student and parental outrage is not sufficient reason to take the "easy 
road." School officials obviously made egregious errors, but two wrongs don't 
make a right. The school board's decision to allow students to graduate who did 
not fulfill the original graduation requirements was yet another error in the 
handling of this incident.  
</P>
<P>
 This is an important issue and one that goes beyond Brea. It should not be 
considered "closed." A number of questions need to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some that come immediately to mind include: Did the grade changes and issuance 
of non-earned credit give certain Brea students an unfair advantage in college 
admissions and scholarship competition over other students from Brea and from 
other high schools? Did such changes provide athletic eligibility to otherwise 
ineligible students, thus giving Brea athletic teams an unfair advantage over 
other schools? What was the status of the very first student who received this 
preferential treatment? How did this practice affect the class rankings of Brea 
students? Did these changes originate because of parental pressure and/or 
position? 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the fact that the Brea district considers this a closed issue, and 
since "doctored" grade-point averages can adversely affect students in other 
school districts, perhaps the Orange County Department of Education should be 
considered the appropriate agency to conduct a thorough review of the Brea 
situation.

CRACKING DOWN ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE IN COUNTY TO 
IMPROVE RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The double-murder case involving former football star O.J. Simpson has focused 
intensified attention nationally and locally on the problem of spousal abuse. 
But while this attention has resulted in increased calls to hot lines around 
the country, concern about how such cases are handled in Orange County has been 
under scrutiny for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald E. Smallwood was a catalyst for the 
creation of a county task force on domestic violence a year ago, and that panel 
is now at work with the expectation of producing detailed recommendations in 
the months ahead. Echoing complaints in other jurisdictions, Smallwood has said 
that prosecutors and the courts have been overly lenient in Orange County, as 
well as the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The work of the panel is to be commended, but a review of the record in Orange 
County reveals just how much work remains to be done. A Times investigation 
shows that the Orange County district attorney's office has the worst record 
among prosecutors in the state's six most-populous counties for vigorously 
pursuing spousal abuse cases. During the 1990-1992 period, the most recent for 
which state figures are available, the office of Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi 
chose to file the smallest percentage of cases as felonies, had the lowest 
conviction rate in those cases, and put the smallest percentage of serious 
offenders in prison. Capizzi answers that the state's statistical comparisons 
are incomplete, but the assertion that the state statistics are unsuitable for 
comparisons on domestic violence is disputed by criminologists and state 
Justice Department officials. The conclusion seems obvious. The district 
attorney's office needs to do better than it has in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that even though the county may have been slow to recognize 
and do something about spousal abuse and domestic violence, it is making some 
progress and has acknowledged that a more aggressive posture is desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's domestic violence unit now has two prosecutors and one 
investigator for felony spousal abuse cases, and two deputies in each of the 
county's five courthouses handle misdemeanor domestic violence cases. The unit 
is overhauling its system of keeping records so it can track cases, and asserts 
that many felony arrests are properly filed as misdemeanors anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 These intentions and efforts are good. The fact that local jurisdictions 
elsewhere that make these kinds of cases a priority manage to get results 
should further encourage the county in these efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The county well might learn something from San Diego County, for example, 
which has been a leader in aggressive pursuit of spousal abuse cases. As a 
matter of policy, it presses ahead with charges even if a victim doesn't 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 The data in Orange County was compiled only through 1992, a period that ended 
before the new domestic violence unit was set up 15 months ago. And then there 
is the fact that domestic violence calls are on the increase in Orange County, 
even though they have decreased in both Los Angeles County and around the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The new unit is a clear improvement in priority setting on domestic violence. 
But the county figures for the period preceding its operation show how much 
work there really has been to do.

DISASTER'S LESSONS SO SOON FORGOTTEN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Last fall, I watched in horror on TV and out of my window the destruction 
caused by the fire in Laguna. I felt in my heart that there was a greater 
reason for the disaster than a chance occurrence.I figured maybe this is God's 
way of telling us that we have gotten too involved in material possessions and 
need to get back to appreciating the human spirit and the more subtle aspects 
of life. My feeling was substantiated somewhat by the pictures of families 
consoling others who had lost their homes. There were acts of heroism, and 
people from other areas donated what they could to help those who lost 
everything. It became a time for giving, sharing and caring. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I read ("Colliding Points of View Impair Laguna Rebuilding," June 12) that 
Laguna residents are bickering over how large or tall they build their 
replacement homes and whether or not they have a good enough ocean view. What 
in the world is going on? Don't these people realize that there are thousands 
of people who are unemployed, starving or homeless? What happened to that 
spirit we saw after the fires?

ASSESSING THE COUNTY'S AIR TRAFFIC NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your recent editorial ("Far From Ripe for the Ballot," June 27) objecting to 
the El Toro airport initiative qualifying for the November ballot failed to 
mention the greatest motivating factor to those who sought to bring the future 
of the El Toro airport to the voters; the Board of Supervisors created a 
stacked planning agency that guaranteed that one El Toro option would be 
rejected before the agency's first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The only use of El Toro the agency would not consider fairly was that of an 
international airport due to the imbalance of "local" interests on the agency. 
Our entire county of nearly 3 million people may see its best interests 
sacrificed in order to provide an unearned betterment to a few small and very 
wealthy South County communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that (in contrast to the expansion of LAX) the flight paths into and 
out of El Toro are already cleared of residential housing. The impacts of the 
marvelous expansion of businesses associated with an international airport are 
all manageable by the well-established planning procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial aircraft are dramatically quieter than military jets. The benefits 
of convenient East Coast and international air travel to Orange County deserves 
better attention than the county's one-sided planning agency will provide.

 * I frequently read that the John Wayne Airport's takeoff and landing 
restrictions prevent it from serving Orange County properly. The restrictions 
on takeoff and landing have been imposed on us by the residents of Newport 
Beach and surrounding areas. The major proponents of a commercial airport at El 
Toro are from Newport Beach and surrounding areas. Why did the county spend $52 
million to modernize the John Wayne Airport if it can benefit only a minority 
in the county? Wouldn't it be less expensive to expand the John Wayne Airport? 
I understand that the cost to build a new airport at the El Toro base will be 
at least $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * Most everyone agrees Orange County needs additional airport capabilities and 
John Wayne Airport just isn't able to provide them all. That is why allowing El 
Toro Marine base to remain an airport after the base closes makes sense. Past 
studies concluded it is the only viable location in Orange County that can meet 
the escalating needs. 
</P>
<P>
 South County residents continue to object, not wanting any increase of air 
traffic in their area and suggest additional flights and hours at John Wayne 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The small size and realistic safety concerns with that airport's location 
testify John Wayne Airport must not be allowed to escalate any further. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time for other areas in Orange County to share the air traffic so that 
everyone can benefit. Orange County cannot afford to lose its last opportunity 
for an additional airport that is capable of meeting the growing demands of its 
population.

 * Even my Board of Supervisors cannot protect me from voter abuse (Editorial, 
June 27). California's initiative process used to result from grass-roots 
movements working hard to disseminate information. . . . Naively many still 
believe this is how the process works. This time the wealthy few who began and 
funded this "urgent" initiative somehow feel it is now or never. 
</P>
<P>
 Why must all of the El Toro Marine base land be designated "airport-related 
use only" as the initiative proposes? Why not let the current planning 
commission decide if a need is shown for a specialized air transport center, 
allowing the voters to express desires for alternative venues with the 
remaining property? Why isn't San Diego County interested in talking to us? 
They desperately need an international airport. Could not a joint venture on 
the coastline be negotiated with the military and the U.S. government? This 
would allow for air traffic safety as well as train service. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro airport conversion would cost big dollars for all county taxpayers 
north and south who already funded a new John Wayne Airport terminal. It is a 
far cry from being an existing airport ready to roll as the initiative leaders 
want us to believe. I don't like "sign today" sales pressure tactics without 
knowing the cost. I want to read all of the fine print, thank you!

<P>
 * The current Orange County airport is overextended and in my estimation is a 
disaster just waiting to happen. It is a forgone conclusion that the traffic 
(air) is bound to increase shortly due to the proliferation agreement's 
expiration. The idea of attempting to increase the size thereof is patently 
futile and would necessitate the condemnation of much of the surrounding 
property not to mention rerouting highways and (would be) far more expensive 
than utilizing what we already have and which is more adaptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Please bear in mind that the taxpayers have already paid for El Toro and even 
if it were sold the dollars would never find their way back. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro as is could satisfy many crying needs in addition to air facilities 
such as augmentation to prisons (halfway houses, etc.), housing for the needy, 
affordable housing for those who cannot afford Irvine, Newport Beach and reuse 
of existing facilities such as shops, medical and fire stations.

 * It is difficult to believe that a ballot initiative for or against a 
commercial airport at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station could go before Orange 
County voters without first requiring an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a project that promises to be an environmental catastrophe from 
Tustin-Irvine all the way to the Orange County coast between Newport Beach and 
San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine giant airliners going overhead at two- to three-minute intervals 24 
hours a day as they do at LAX. Your home would become untenable, you wouldn't 
be able to carry on a reasonable conversation, listen to television, or even 
think. Property values would be destroyed, and there would be a rash of 
lawsuits, resulting in hundreds, probably thousands, of homes being abandoned, 
relocated or bulldozed. It's all happened before, it could happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, the big beneficiaries would be a small group of out-of-the-area 
promoters and a few unthinking politicians. 
</P>

 Lets hope that people think before they vote this Nov. 8.

 * Mr. Bert Hack's assertion that the conversion of MCAS, El Toro to a 
commercial airport will force a $3-billion tax increase on Orange County 
residents is lacking in facts, logic and reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Hack needs a lesson in infrastructure financing and airport development. 
First, airport construction and development is not financed by general taxes. 
Airports, including runways, terminals, sewers, roads, etc. are financed by 
revenues derived from the operation of an airport. For instance, John Wayne 
Airport's expansion is not financed by the taxpayers of Orange County. It is 
financed by revenue bonds from aircraft landing fees, parking concessions, fuel 
flow fees, and merchant leases. In fact, John Wayne Airport is considered an 
enterprise fund and does not even have general taxes authority under California 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Mr. Hack needs to understand how California redevelopment law might work 
in El Toro's case. El Toro has never been on the tax rolls and therefore has no 
value for taxation purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as El Toro transfers from military to commercial use, its value as a 
taxable parcel increases dramatically. A commonly used financing tool employed 
by most local governments allows us to use this "tax increment" as collateral 
for the sale of tax-free municipal securities. These are known as redevelopment 
bonds and are used for infrastructure improvement. No tax increases occur with 
"tax increment" financing. The roads and sewers get built and paid for by 
future taxes generated by the businesses that add value to the now valueless 
property. Mr. Hack, did you and your Leisure World neighbors pay for the roads 
and sewers at the Irvine Spectrum? 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro airport will provide the economic stimulus that will be required to 
draw the businesses to El Toro that will create the tax revenue to finance 
infrastructure costs. Almost any other use for El Toro will require a tax 
increase.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON HEALTH CARE; CONGRESS AND THE PEOPLE SHOULD 
SEE THE FINAL BILL BEFORE A VOTE; WE DON'T LET DOCTORS OPERATE BLINDFOLDED. 
SUCH SWEEPING LEGISLATION SHOULDN'T BE MADE LAW WITH A RUBBER-STAMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER COX, Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) is a member of the 
House Committee on the Budget and chairman of the Task Force on Budget Process 
Reform. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The stakes in the national health-care debate could hardly be higher: this is, 
quite literally, a matter of life and death for every American. And the 
economic impact of health care reform is equally fundamental to the American 
economy. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this year, medical 
services will total $982 billion -- fully one-seventh of our Gross Domestic 
Product. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, redesigning the entire health-care system is dauntingly 
complex. The Clinton plan, for example, takes 1,364 pages to cover the topic. 
That's longer than the Bible, or "War and Peace," or the Los Angeles telephone 
directory. 
</P>
<P>
 Given both the complexity and the gravity of health-care reform, it should 
follow that the final legislative product, if there is one this year, will be 
the most carefully scrutinized document since the Magna Carta. 
</P>
<P>
 But in fact, the opposite is true. Welcome to the modern Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 As the debate over health care has unfolded, we have begun to see what is 
quickly becoming an iron law of politically important legislation: that there 
is an inverse relationship between the care taken in writing and scrutinizing a 
bill, on the one hand, and its importance, on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton plan, like the handful of other health-care proposals introduced 
earlier this year -- that is, the ones that are going to get radically changed 
-- took a long time to write and was exhaustively studied and criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that the Congress is moving closer and closer to adjournment, the care 
taken in writing and reading each successive proposal is precipitously 
declining. By the end it is entirely possible that Congress will vote on a 
measure that none of its members, or their staffs, or the executive branch, or 
the public has had any opportunity to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 This sorry state of affairs arises in part by accident and in part by design. 
Stealth lawmaking benefits the handful of key legislators and lobbyists who are 
steering negotiations and drafting. And it marginalizes the rest of Congress, 
not to mention the outside world, making it possible for political "leaders" to 
deliver on a promise to get "something" done. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those supposed leaders think the only way to pass a health care bill 
is to keep the American people in the dark. One of President Clinton's chief 
lieutenants in the Congress. Sen . John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), 
recently said: "We're going to push through health care -- regardless of the 
views of the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 But the fundamental problem is that Congress is simply not well organized to 
tackle wide-ranging, interdisciplinary subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 A topic like health care, embracing a seventh of the economy, is of interest 
to any committee that can plausibly claim jurisdiction over any part of it. 
Right now, four committees of the House and Senate are working, basically 
without any coordination, on five comprehensive health-care bills.  
</P>
<P>
 As the clock ticks down toward the October adjournment of Congress, the three 
disjointed House bills ultimately reported out of committee will be utterly 
rewritten into one brand new bill in the closed-door Democratic Caucus.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, staffers for Sens. (Edward M.) Kennedy (D-Mass.) and (Daniel 
Patrick) Moynihan (D-N.Y.) will join assorted lobbyists in a similar frenzy of 
last-minute drafting. The resulting spectacle will more closely resemble Civil 
War battlefield surgery than a rational attempt to make public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 If recent history is any guide, Congress and the public will have minimal time 
to review these legislative Frankensteins. Even if Congress, the press and the 
public can somehow read the final House and Senate bills, it won't much matter. 
The House-Senate conference rules permit throwing out any or all of them, and 
substituting novel provisions that neither house has ever seen or voted on. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing breakneck dash to "pass health care" before adjournment (and the 
November election) will find the conferees (in reality, a select group of 
lobbyists and staffers) frantically drafting an eleventh-hour, immense, 
possibly illegible, often handwritten collection of hundreds of loose-leaf 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
 It is entirely likely, therefore, that members of Congress will never even see 
what they are voting on, and that no one -- not the staffers, the conferees, 
the interest groups, not even Hillary Rodham Clinton -- will have any idea of 
its details until afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 It follows, of course, that no one will have any idea of the bill's costs 
until it is too late. It takes the Congressional Budget Office four to five 
weeks to produce its (often quite inaccurate) cost estimates. CBO has already 
warned Congress that the process of writing health-care legislation should be 
"much, much slower" if we want reliable figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even now, congressional committees are voting on newly-minted proposals 
without any reliable estimates of their costs. By adjournment, it is unlikely 
that there will be even back-of-the-envelope guesses about the costs of the 
final bill. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a remote possibility or worst-case scenario. It has happened 
repeatedly in the last few years. The 776-page savings and loan bailout 
legislation -- a tragically flawed bill which to date has cost taxpayers more 
than $100 billion -- was not even printed until three days after Congress voted 
for it in the wee hours of a Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the recent $151-billion, six-year transportation bill was passed by 
Congress before any copies of the actual bill had been printed or distributed 
for review. (The House voted at 6 a.m., only 65 minutes after the one and only 
typewritten copy of the 1,000-page bill arrived in the House chamber.) No 
senator or representative read it, either. 
</P>
<P>
 We are headed for a similar meltdown of the legislative process with a 
health-care bill. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a disturbing fact that the modern Congress regularly generates 
thousand-page epics whose most important features are neither read nor debated 
by the enacting lawmakers or the public. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither the President, nor the Congress, nor the American people should be 
asked to rubber-stamp such a sweeping act as the redesign of the entire 
American health-care system, immediately after it has been concocted in a 
legislative version of blind man's buff.  
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that this doesn't happen, each of us, whatever our preferred reform, 
should insist that any health-care bill be made publicly available 30 days in 
advance of a final vote, so that we can read and understand it. Anything less 
is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't let doctors operate blindfolded. We should make sure Congress and the 
public aren't blindfolded as we make the key decisions on health-care reform.

IRVINE'S TENUOUS GRASP ON THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city that cannot afford to honor, respect and preserve its past has only the 
most tenuous grasp on its future. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's decision on June 28 not to rescue the historic buildings on 
the Buffalo Ranch from certain relocation, if not ultimate destruction, by the 
Irvine Co. is a public tragedy. For the reasons ably articulated by members of 
the Irvine Historical Society, the Buffalo Ranch should be preserved for future 
generations to admire and ponder. The ranch was the place architect William 
Pereira selected to design the master planned city of Irvine some three decades 
ago. Even before Pereira selected the site for his master plan designing, herds 
of buffalo roamed the ranch, serving as a popular tourist attraction for anyone 
making their way down to the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Some may think it ironic that the birthplace of Irvine's master plan would 
ultimately be destroyed by the current caretakers of the plan. Not true. 
There's no irony here, only the natural consequence of whom Irvine's master 
plan is intended to serve, namely the Irvine Co. The company doesn't want to 
preserve the buildings on site and what the company wants it normally gets. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's decision would be ironic if Irvine's master plan was 
intended to build an authentic community, for in such a community there would 
be a sensible and proactive commitment to preserving the past. For so many 
communities in our new nation, preservation of the past nurtures respect for 
the present and offers purpose to the future. The eminent historian Arthur J. 
Schlesinger Jr. makes the point far better than I in "The Disuniting of 
America" (1992): "History is to the nation rather as memory is to the 
individual. As an individual deprived of memory becomes disoriented and lost, 
not knowing where he has been or where he is going, so a nation denied a 
conception of its past will be disabled in dealing with its present and its 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it's unfortunate that there's little place for history in Irvine's 
"master planned" community, it seems an inevitable exercise of raw power by the 
Irvine Co. -- the inheritor of Pereira's brilliance but certainly not guardians 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday when you're waiting at a longstop light at the corner of Ford and 
MacArthur you can tell your child about the ranch, the buffalo, and maybe even 
William Pereira. Of course, they won't believe you. "If the site was so 
important to the founding of Irvine, why would anyone have destroyed it?" 
</P>
<P>
 As you try to convince them otherwise with an old photograph you'll come to 
envy the children of Gettysburg, Galena, Plymouth, Mt. Vernon, and 
Williamsburg. So may your children!

TEENS ARE A TREASURE TO BE GUARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * On Thursday, June 23, I had the privilege of helping at the Undergrad Party, 
a community event hosted by Saddleback Church. It is estimated that more than 
2,000 high school students were present at the Undergrad Party.There was no 
violence. no wild or crude behavior. There was, however, a group of kids having 
fun, socializing, allowed to be together without being told to "move on." 
</P>
<P>
 As adults, it is up to us to understand how valuable these kids are. It is up 
to us to become committed and involved in providing these young people a safe 
and wholesome passage to adulthood. Work together within your communities to 
provide your teens with activities and places to socialize. Work together to 
make these places safe and fun. Open your hearts and minds to guide these kids 
through the often frustrating adolescent years. Become involved, listen to your 
young people, share yourselves with them. You will find that they have much to 
give back.

A MESSAGE ABOUT LONG-DISTANCE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As someone who's devoted years to the telecommunications industry, I am 
writing to clarify information that accompanied your story on Pacific Bell and 
in-state long-distance service ("Reaching Out," June 19). 
</P>
<P>
 Your article implies that Assembly Bill 3720, which would allow Pacific Bell 
to compete in the long-distance market, is merely being "pitched" as a jobs 
bill. Considering that the Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO, is the 
principal co-sponsor of this bill -- a detail that was omitted from the article 
-- you can be sure that we believe jobs will be protected and created. 
</P>
<P>
 Although you correctly point out that Pacific Bell has proposed long-distance 
rates that will be a minimum of 20% lower than those of its competitors, you 
then dismiss the argument by saying opponents claim that rates will fall only 
temporarily and then rise about 9%. Even if that were true, and there is no 
evidence for that statement, wouldn't that still be a welcome rate decrease of 
11% for consumers? 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, jobs will be created under AB 3720. Opponents again claim that 
jobs will merely shift to Pacific Bell from smaller long-distance carriers who, 
presumably, would be driven out of business by Pacific Bell's low rates. Even 
if that is true, which it's not, the question is rightly: Just who exactly 
should benefit from AB 3720, the phone industry or the California consumer? 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the bill's language was specifically designed to ensure that all 
competitors have fair, non-discriminatory and mutually open access to exchange 
and inter-exchange facilities, through the implementation of strict consumer 
safeguards. It also specifically prohibits anti-competitive behavior involving 
unfair use of subscriber information or customer contact. AB 3720, in other 
words, strives to level the playing field for all competitors, both local and 
long-distance, and that is the true and proper role of this legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is that California's largest employer is attempting to create 
jobs and offer customers more long-distance choices at lower costs. That's why 
CWA co-sponsored AB 3720 and is pleased to be joined by scores of consumer, 
labor and business organizations who also support our efforts.

PROFITING OFF NURSING HOMES UNSCRUPULOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read "Oxnard's LTC Properties Lead Rally in REITs" (June 6) with great 
concern and was astounded that assets returned 39% to shareholders last year -- 
double the industry average -- because of investments in nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not know what nursing home properties are owned by LTC Properties, thus 
my comments are general and not specifically addressed to this real estate 
investment trust.I do know, and it's a published fact, that there is not a 
nursing home in this country that is in total compliance with federal nursing 
home regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 To read about the "hefty profits" being accumulated by real estate investment 
trusts while the licensees of these properties continue to be in violation of 
federal and state nursing home regulations is unscrupulous to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are the leases so high, since the majority of monies paid to the licensees 
of the facilities are from Medicare, MediCal and Medicaid? Should our tax 
dollars that are to be used to care for our mothers and fathers be used for the 
real estate investors to make 39% profit while patients suffer from bad care? 
Do the investors really know to what expense they are making these profits?

CUBA EMBARGO IS PLOY TO TOPPLE CASTRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The headline "Coalition Will Lobby Washington to End Embargo Against Cuba" 
(June 9) was eye-catching.The "sticking point," the story says, is Castro's 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Our concerted efforts are finally beginning to take effect. Unable to trade, 
Cuba is cash-poor. 
</P>
<P>
 If we work things right, we will return Cuba to its pre-Castro days: 
U.S.-owned sugar fields and other foreign-owned big business, maybe even 
casinos, the playground of the rich; side streets lined with brothels; Cubans 
to serve as "labor" and returning them to living in hovels and among the 
hungry, homeless and illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we will have succeeded. They will become like us.

IMPLICATIONS OF U.S. LABOR STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, the Clinton health plan for America is already at work! With 
prescription in hand, Labor Secretary Robert Reich ordered up a study of U.S. 
workers that was clearly designed to discover an illness to support the Clinton 
Administration's diagnosis of what's wrong with America ("Federal Study Paints 
a Grim Picture of the Workplace," June 3). 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's overriding goal, of course -- as with everything they 
prescribe for American business -- is the expansion of government and the 
political class as America's new royalty.They do this by creating studies that 
show this country as unfair, as an engine of poverty, as racist -- or that 
demonstrate ever-widening gaps between rich and poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Defining the problem as between haves and have-nots as Reich does reveals the 
real agenda. The solution is always the same: We need ever-growing government 
and the elites in charge to redistribute income from the so-called rich to the 
poor in America (first raking off their share for these wonderful activities).

YOUR MORTGAGE; BILL WOULD HELP TO FIGHT CREDIT ERRORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home buyers whose mortgage applications are jeopardized -- or torpedoed -- by 
inaccurate information in credit bureau files are on the verge of major new 
protections nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The House of Representatives passed its version of the Consumer Reporting 
Reform Act of 1994 on June 13 and expects to conclude negotiations on a similar 
bill already passed by the Senate. Final legislation should hit President 
Clinton's desk this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should you care? 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of reasons -- beginning with the fact that if you ever intend to 
refinance your mortgage, buy a new house, rent an apartment or apply for a home 
equity loan, computerized credit files you've probably never seen will play a 
crucial role. Lenders will gauge what interest rate to charge you -- or whether 
to loan you a cent in any case -- based in part on what they see in your credit 
files. 
</P>
<P>
 The three largest national credit file "repositories" -- TRW, Equifax and 
TransUnion -- maintain an estimated 450 million files on consumers and receive 
and store billions of bits of information from banks, department stores and 
other creditors every month. 
</P>
<P>
 As the repositories themselves are frank to admit, some of that information is 
wrong. Because of foul-ups at the local level -- department stores getting your 
Social Security number wrong or a mortgage lender misreporting late payments on 
your account -- your credit file may contain substantial errors. 
</P>
<P>
 And since many lenders now use electronic "credit scoring" to allow quick 
thumbs-up or thumbs-down decision making on loan applications, you may be 
turned down for your next home loan for utterly wrong reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfair turndowns -- plus allegations of credit industry laxity in correcting 
errors in files -- have been the single largest source of consumer complaints 
to regulators such as the Federal Trade 1131375981bureaus he licenses than on 
all the other 3,700 financial industry firms he regulates. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bill is intended to change much of this. The two key backers in the 
House, Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.) and Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez 
(D-Texas), call it "the most important piece of consumer legislation that 
Congress considers this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what it will do when finally signed into law: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give you quicker and cheaper access to your credit files. The bill sets a 
limit of $3 for an annual copy of your credit report from any repository and an 
$8 charge for additional copies during the course of the year. If you're turned 
down for a mortgage or other financing because of negative information in your 
file, credit bureaus will be required to provide you one copy of the report 
free of charge within 60 days of the adverse action by the creditor and at the 
conclusion of a re-investigation when incorrect information on you was deleted. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Provides new protection for consumers disputing information in their files. 
Credit repositories will be required to investigate complaints of inaccurate 
data within 30 days -- a standard they say they often meet today. The bill also 
requires bureaus to maintain strict procedures to prevent reinsertion of 
previously deleted, adverse information unless the creditor providing the data 
can certify its accuracy. In addition, the bill requires consumers to be 
notified when previously deleted information is put back into their files. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Clamps new legal liability on credit information providers to maintain high 
standards of accuracy in their own consumer files. For example, if a department 
store or mortgage lender is notified that its information on you is incorrect, 
and still does not delete the bad data, you'll be able to sue the creditor for 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Lewis of the Consumer Federation of America says this provision "should 
cut down on the amount of garbage that's put into people's files in the first 
place and then stays there even after repeated complaints." Under current law, 
creditors aren't routinely penalized for the bad data they pass on. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Provides new restrictions on lenders and other merchants using your credit 
files to fish for pre-qualified borrowers, such as for home equity lines of 
credit. The bill would ban such solicitations unless they include a firm offer 
of credit -- i.e., virtually guarantee you a loan -- and include disclosures on 
how your name was obtained (i.e., from a particular credit repository who sold 
your marketing profile). 
</P>
<P>
 Most significant, the bill prohibits the use of a consumer credit report for 
target marketing without the consumer's express permission and guarantees you 
the right to have your name removed from future marketing lists. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of the credit file game for mortgage borrowers once the bill becomes 
law: No. 1, be aware of your expanded rights under federal law. No. 2: Even if 
you have no hint of trouble in your file, get a copy of your report at least 
once a year. Think of it as your annual check-up -- for your financial health.

HOT PROPERTY: LONI BUYS PLACE TO CALL HER OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actress LONI ANDERSON has purchased a Beverly Hills-area home for $2.3 
million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who made her TV debut in 1977 as the receptionist at Cincinnati 
radio station WKRP, starred in a May rerun of the 1991 TV movie "White Hot: The 
Mysterious Murder of Thelma Todd" and played a hospital administrator in the 
NBC sitcom "Nurses." 
</P>
<P>
 She joined the cast of "Nurses" last summer, shortly after her husband, Burt 
Reynolds, star of the CBS sitcom "Evening Shade," filed for divorce. Both 
series were canceled in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson co-stars with Kenny Rogers in "Gambler V: Playing for Keeps," a 
two-part movie to be aired on CBS Sept. 25 and Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The actress, 43, has been living in a 15,000-square-foot house on two acres in 
Bel-Air that she and Reynolds leased in 1990, two years after they were married 
and adopted their son, Quinton, who will be 6 in August. Reynolds leased a home 
in Encino last July. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's new home has four bedrooms and maid's quarters in 6,500 square 
feet. The Country French-style home, which also has San Fernando Valley views 
and a pool, was built two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Babajian and Judy Cycon of Fred Sands Estates, Beverly Hills, shared the 
listing, and Joan Duffy of Fred Sands' Sherman Oaks office represented 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 ISAAC TIGRETT, who opened his House of Blues on the Sunset Strip in May and 
co-founded the Hard Rock Cafe in 1971, has sold his Bel-Air home of five years 
for close to its $1.25-million asking price, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Tigrett, 45, and Peter Morton founded the Hard Rock Cafe, and Tigrett later 
sold his interest for a reported $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The $9-million music club and restaurant in West Hollywood is Tigrett's third 
House of Blues. His first one opened last year in Cambridge, Mass.; his second 
one opened in January in New Orleans. Backers are comedian Dan Aykroyd and the 
investment arm of Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
 Tigrett and his wife, Maureen, sold their five-bedroom, 4,000-square-foot home 
because it was too small for them. The couple has a daughter who lives with 
them, but Maureen has three older children who live in England from her 
marriage to Ringo Starr, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Tigrett is leasing a larger home in the Beverly Hills area but considers 
London his primary residence when he's not traveling in his private railroad 
car, which is decorated in an Indian motif, with artifacts from a maharajah's 
palace. 
</P>
<P>
 His spiritual adviser is Sai Baba, an Indian swami who persuaded Tigrett to 
take a chance with the House of Blues. Sai Baba also inspired Tigrett to add 
posts and a gate from a dismantled palace in India to the home that was just 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyer of the house, described as a theatrical agent, was represented by 
Gloria Jennings of Nourmand & Associates, Beverly Hills. Tigrett was 
represented in the sale by Connie Gregory of Jon Douglas Co., Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney RICHARD DUNSAY and his wife, Anita, have listed their 18th-floor 
Wilshire penthouse, which is in the same building where O.J. Simpson's close 
friend, model/actress Paula Barbieri, lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm selling it, because I'm really a house kind of guy," Dunsay said of his 
condo. "I like walking out onto a grassy lawn rather than onto a balcony. I 
want a Golden Retriever, but you can't have a Golden Retriever in an 
apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5,600-square-foot condo, where the Theresa Russell movie "Impulse" was 
filmed in 1989, is on the market at $2.25 million with Cecelia Waeschle and 
Marilyn Dunn, both of Rodeo Realty, Beverly Hills.

AT HOME; AFFORDABLE ORANGE COUNTY HOMES WHERE ORANGE GROVES ONCE STOOD; GARDEN 
GROVE: LARGE HOMES AND LOWER PRICES DRAW PEOPLE TO THIS COMMUNITY THAT BOASTS A 
RICH CULTURAL MIX.

 When Louise Penn moved to Garden Grove from North Hollywood in 1960, she 
thought she'd been transplanted to the boondocks. "I felt totally disconnected 
from civilization," said Penn, 54. "There was only one department store and 
market. We even lived next to a dairy farm." 
</P>
<P>
 But Penn soon grew comfortable in Garden Grove. So much so, in fact, that she 
has lived there for the last 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The first home Penn and her late husband bought in 1960 was a three-bedroom, 
two-bath starter that cost $17,100. The Penns and their twin daughters lived 
there until 1970, when Penn, who had become a real estate agent, found the 
"perfect" house in another Garden Grove neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn had fallen in love with a custom-built 2,400-square-foot, three-bedroom, 
two-bath house. "The house was in a pretty, quiet neighborhood on a spacious 
lot, which gave us privacy and space, and that really appealed to me," said 
Penn, who bought the house for $34,000. She still lives in the home and is now 
an executive officer with the West Orange County Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 This middle-class central Orange County city, which is known for its ethnic 
diversity, has a population of 143,000. It is bounded roughly by Katella Avenue 
on the north, Los Alamitos Air Station on the west, Hazard Avenue on the south 
and Lewis Street near the city's landmark Crystal Cathedral on the east. 
Crossing the city's southern end is the Garden Grove (22) Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Garden Grove's large homes and lots have attracted many 
buyers, says Dave Meier, a realtor at ERA Duncan in Garden Grove and 1993 
president of the West Orange County Assn. of Realtors. "In Garden Grove you get 
a lot more home for your dollar than you do in other areas of Orange County," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are Garden Grove homes and lots large, the prices are lower than in 
surrounding areas, which mystifies Meier and others in the real estate 
business. "Prices have always been lower in Garden Grove, and I've never really 
understood why," Meier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average home in Garden Grove costs between $175,000 and $200,000 and is 
1,400 to 2,000 square feet with four bedrooms and 1 3/4 baths, Meier said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lower price range there are 1,000- to 1,400-square-foot homes for 
$145,000 to $165,000, which generally have three bedrooms and one or 1 1/2 
bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 At the upper end, there are a few homes in the $400,000 to $550,000 range, 
which are usually on acre lots, Meier said. "These homes are about 3,000 square 
feet with three to four bedrooms and three or more bathrooms," Meier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel and Josephine Perez found the affordable prices of Garden Grove homes 
especially appealing when they went looking for a house 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house was a good price and it was big enough for my family," said Perez, 
40, a mechanic. "I also liked the fact that the area was clean and quiet, and 
it's still that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez bought his three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath home in 1981 for $93,000. The house 
is on a large lot, which gives his three sons and daughter plenty of room to 
play. He also has a garage where he is able to teach his boys how to fix cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Affordability was also a big consideration when Thomas Bonetati went 
house-hunting last year. He found what he wanted in Garden Grove. His 
1,600-square-foot, three-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath townhouse cost him $138,900. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm now paying less to own than I did to rent in Irvine, and I've been really 
pleased with the savings," said Bonetati, 26, who is a computer systems 
salesperson. "The house has needed some work, including new plumbing in the 
bathrooms and new flooring, but I've been really happy with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonetati has found Garden Grove to be a "really nice town. The area is safe 
and my neighbors are nice," he said. "It is also conveniently located to other 
parts of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dwight and Pamela Apodac hadn't thought much about moving from their 
Santa Ana condo, they soon found themselves relocating to Garden Grove after 
they saw a house and floor plan they liked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pamela saw a house down the street from the house we ended up buying and 
couldn't stop raving about it," said Dwight Apodac, 34, a quality assurance 
director in the aerospace industry. So, on Pamela's birthday, Dwight did some 
number crunching and told her since she liked the house so much, he'd be 
willing to move. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the Apodacs moved from their condo to a three-bedroom, two-bath 
house in Garden Grove with a large yard. They paid $148,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Apodac, 35, who is a secretary in the aerospace industry, said she has 
found her new neighborhood to be "safe and homey. Our first night here we were 
unpacking very late and a member of the Neighborhood Watch came to check up on 
us," she said. "That was a welcome sight." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides large homes and affordable prices, Garden Grove also offers something 
that many residents find attractive -- ethnic diversity. The area has a rich 
cultural mix, as census figures show. Almost 20% of the city's population is 
Asian; 23.5% is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many people mistakenly think that Little Saigon, the well-known 
Vietnamese shopping and residential area, is located in Garden Grove, it is 
actually in Westminster. However, Garden Grove does have its own ethnic area. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as Korea Town, this self-contained shopping area on Garden Grove 
Boulevard has Korean restaurants and a wide variety of stores and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Korea Town is now a bustling shopping area, but in the 1970s the 
four-mile-long area was rundown, said Gina Ruebsamen, who is owner of ERA 
Champion Realty in Korea Town. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the early part of 1978, a few Koreans started businesses on Garden Grove 
Boulevard," she said. "After that shops slowly began to open up. Today there 
are over 500 Korean businesses in Korea Town. It has the second largest 
concentration of Korean businesses in the state, second only to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Chung moved to Garden Grove in 1981 and bought B&J Home Center in Korea 
Town in 1985. One of his favorite aspects of Garden Grove is the large Korean 
population and the bridge he feels it gives him between Korea and America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a first-generation Korean and being able to relate with other Koreans 
has helped me adjust to life here," said Chung, 47. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years ago, Chung and his wife, Misook, 38, bought a house near his 
business for $150,000. The three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath house sits on a 
9,000-square-foot lot, which gives them room for a swimming pool and fruit 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chungs are pleased with the school district that their twin boys attend 
and are happy with the cultural diversity their sons experience. "It is good 
for them to be exposed to many different cultures, because we all have to learn 
to get along better," Chung said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other longtime residents such as Clara and Richard Watson also find Garden 
Grove's cultural opportunities and ethnic diversity very stimulating. More 
stimulating, in fact, than exotic overseas locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just took a trip to Portugal and my husband commented that Garden Grove 
seems to have a greater variety of culture," said Clara Watson, 59, who is a 
real estate agent with Tarbell Realtors in Anaheim. "It was amazing that we 
could travel so far away and actually have a more exciting time right here at 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 The Watsons -- he's a college professor -- bought their first Garden Grove 
home in 1969 for $17,500. In 1978 they needed a bigger home for themselves and 
their two daughters, so they moved to their present home. The five-bedroom, 
three-bath home cost $141,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the early 1970s, Watson says that Garden Grove looked a lot different. 
"When we first moved here, there was a lot more open space, many orange groves 
and less people," she said. "Today the orange groves have disappeared and have 
been replaced with people." 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of many trees, orange and otherwise, can be attributed to the 
city's founding father, a physician named Alonzo Cook, who bought 160 acres in 
the area for $15 an acre in 1874. He suggested calling the town Garden Grove. 
Some residents objected to the name, however, because of the community's empty 
terrain, so he said they could make the name appropriate by beautifying the 
area with a lot of trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove became a quiet farming community, which experienced some growth 
in 1905 when the Pacific Electric railroad came to town and brought in 
settlers. In 1956, Garden Grove became incorporated and slowly began to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garden Grove was much smaller population-wise when the Watsons moved 
in, Clara says that oddly enough she feels the city is a much more cohesive 
unit today. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't a sense of community back then," she says. "The area was much 
more rural. Now I feel a stronger sense of Garden Grove as a city. The local 
government is very much in touch with the citizens and responsive. There is 
also a strong sense of unity; people look out for one another in a neighborly 
way." Garden Grove Home Sale Data

APARTMENT LIFE: USING MOVE-IN CHECKLIST AVOIDS MOVE-OUT WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Postema is the editor of Apartment Age 
magazine, a publication of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an 
apartment owners' service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: After I moved into my apartment, I found out that the bedroom window 
was broken. I called the landlady and asked her to have it fixed as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 It took her two weeks to send a handyman. He tried to fix it twice but failed. 
When I called to let her know that the window broke again, and the carpet 
needed to be cleaned (there were large hidden stains under the furniture), she 
got angry. 
</P>
<P>
 She told me to clean the carpet myself, and she told me that if I didn't like 
it I could leave. I have a one-year lease and I don't want to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 What can I do to have her replace the window? Can she break the lease because 
of my requests? If I do have to move out before the end of the lease, can I 
claim moving expenses from her? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: While broken windows in apartments are habitability violations and 
must be fixed, I can understand your landlady's frustration at fixing the same 
one three times. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't say how or why the window is breaking, but if you are causing it to 
break you may be liable for the costs of repair. Since she's had a handyman out 
to fix the window twice already, I'm sure she'll send him out again. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the carpet, the owner must maintain it in a safe condition. Cleaning it 
is up to you. 
</P>
<P>
 I always recommend to owners and renters alike that they use a checklist, like 
the inventory checklist the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles produces, at 
move-in to determine the condition of apartments and everything inside them. At 
the same time, you should determine what needs to be done and who is to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Move-in is your window of opportunity for using the checklist, which includes 
everything from air conditioning to windows and everything in between. When you 
move in, the "original condition" of items is noted. When you move out, the 
"final condition" is noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when you move out there is no question about who broke what and handling 
security deposit refunds is greatly simplified for both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 You also ask if she can "break the lease because of my (maintenance) 
requests." The answer is no. First, you have a one-year lease. She can 
terminate it only if you break it first. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, even if you were on a month-to-month tenancy, she is specifically 
prohibited by state law from requiring you to move as retaliation for such a 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil Code Section 1942.5 specifically prohibits an owner from trying to evict 
you within six months (if the rent is paid) after you notify an appropriate 
agency (Health, Fire or Building and Safety departments) of a habitability 
problem, like a broken window. 
</P>
<P>
 If I were you, I wouldn't go that far just yet. If she refuses to get the 
window fixed, which doesn't sound like the case, you can always go to them 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, you ask if you can claim moving expenses if you have to move before 
the end of your lease. I think that recovery would depend on circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 If you persuaded a Small Claims Court (where you would likely take such a 
case) judge that things were so bad you had to move, he might find in your 
favor, but it isn't common practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, if you break the lease, you may be liable for the unpaid rent at the 
premises until it is re-rented. Since you seem to like the apartment, I 
recommend that you try to work out your differences. 30-Day Notice Doesn't Have 
to Be Given on 1st 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I lived in an apartment in Playa del Rey on a month-to-month rental 
agreement. I gave a 30-day notice on the 20th of the month, indicating that I 
would be moving out on the 20th of the following month. 
</P>
<P>
 The landlady told me that I was not allowed to give notice on the 20th. 
Rather, she said, since rent was due on the first, a 30-day notice to vacate 
had to be given then. She also said that I would be liable for the rent through 
the 30th of the following month unless she re-rented the unit before then. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it didn't rent until much later than the end of the month. I always 
understood that with a month-to-month tenancy, a notice to vacate could be 
served at any time during the month. Who is right, my prior landlady or me? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You are right. In a month-to-month tenancy, a notice to vacate may be given 
at any time during the month, regardless of when the rent is due. 
</P>
<P>
 If you had been on a lease the owner would have been right, but that's not the 
case here. Assuming you moved out on the 20th, she probably owes you the 10 
days' rent, from the 20th to the 30th, unless you had an unpaid cleaning bill 
or damages that exceeded any security deposit you may have had. 
</P>
<P>
 If she owes you the money, and she won't refund it willingly, you can sue her 
in Small Claims Court to recover.

 Lending institutions are starting fewer foreclosure proceedings on Southern

 Lenders started foreclosure proceedings on 7,259 Southland homeowners in May,

 Do I need to hide the fact that my parents are giving me money for a down 
payment? 
</P>
<P>
 Having generous parents is nothing to hide.An estimated one-third of 
first-time buyers purchase their home with a loan or a money gift from their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders will ask for a gift letter stating that no repayment of the "gift" is 
expected. According to "Realty Bluebook," Edition 29 (Professional Publishing 
Corp., San Rafael, Calif., 1993), a signed gift letter must: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Specify the amount of the gift and the date the funds were transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Indicate the donor's name, address, telephone number and relationship to 
the borrower. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Include the donor's statement that no repayment is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the letter, a lender can ask for two or three months' worth of 
statements for the account where the down payment funds are located. If the 
money was recently placed into that account, the lender may ask where it came 
from and request verification of that source as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders often have stricter restrictions on gifts from friends and relatives. 
Also, if a buyer puts less than 20% down, some lenders may require that a 
portion of the down payment be their own cash. Check with lenders to learn the 
restrictions of specific programs.

WHERE LIFE HAPPENS; A BACK YARD CAN BE A SPACE FOR SELF-EXPRESSION IF YOU'LL 
JUST KICK BACK, IGNORE ANY IDEAS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT BAD TASTE AND CREATE A 
PLACE THAT SUITS YOU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. CORT SINNES, Special To The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether you use the back yard as a place to play, eat a meal or take a nap, 
build a fort or tend a garden, this secluded outdoor space naturally leads to 
homespun diversions. Humble as they may be, these simple pleasures, a little 
peace and the time to enjoy them richly add to the sum of our private lives. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as any room inside the house, and certainly more than your front yard, 
a back yard can be a space for self-expression, any way you care to express it. 
Remember, it's your back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be misled into thinking that the treehouse your kids want so badly is 
going to somehow ruin the English-cottage-garden look you desire. Back yards 
are forgiving places. 
</P>
<P>
 They are places where life happens, not a set piece or a backdrop for an 
advertisement in a magazine. You'll have a lot more fun if you relax a little 
and leave any strict notion of bad taste on the back porch. 
</P>
<P>
 The desire to fix up your back yard may become so strong that you firmly 
resolve to do something about it, immediately. Unfortunately, you halt on the 
next step, because you're not sure what it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, you've already started fixing up your back yard by simply looking 
at it. The best back yards develop from many hours of this seemingly passive 
activity, just sitting and imagining how one idea or another might look. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually everyone remembers an outdoor place that deeply satisfied them as a 
child. It may have been an elderly neighbor's flower garden, with dahlias as 
big as your head, three-foot-tall marigolds and trailing nasturtiums that 
nearly covered the paths. 
</P>
<P>
 Or it may have been farther afield, such as that shady, cool grove of trees at 
summer camp where cookouts were held. Perhaps it was your uncle's vegetable 
garden, where you had your first taste of a warm, sun-ripened tomato right off 
the vine. Or that fort you made from scrap lumber, which seemed like the 
neatest place in the world because it was yours and you helped build it. 
</P>
<P>
 Any back yard holds the potential to satisfy you in the same way as any of 
those early outdoor experiences. The first step, however, is to identify, as 
clearly as you can, what it was that appealed to you. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no need to write down these thoughts and feelings, but it is important 
to bear them in mind throughout each stage of the following process. Trust your 
instincts and be willing to modify your plan, even if the only reason you can 
give for doing so is because "it just doesn't feel right." 
</P>
<P>
 In the pragmatic world of committing plans to paper, the list of instructions 
rarely includes "follow your heart." When it comes to back yards, perhaps it 
should be added, right up there near the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear in mind Thomas Wolfe's caveat, namely, that "you can't go home again." Of 
course, he was right: You can't. The point of digging in the past is not to 
duplicate some childhood memory, but to identify the way those places made you 
feel. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no accident that the most satisfying back yards are born from a childlike 
imagination and devil-may-care vitality. Just beneath the surface of many 
adults who have created great back yards is a kid who couldn't wait to get out 
there and play in the dirt. The Paper Stage 
</P>
<P>
 At this stage in the back yard planning process we move from the past to the 
present. Here are the supplies to assemble: 
</P>
<P>
 A binder, about 200 sheets of binder paper, scissors, several sharp pencils, 
with good erasers, tape, ruler and a few sheets of standard graph paper. With 
the above materials, and an armful of home and garden magazines, the object is 
to create your personal back yard scrapbook. This may sound rather sophomoric, 
but it's the best thing you can do to ensure that your back yard turns out the 
way you want it. 
</P>
<P>
 The scrapbook will be invaluable on trips to the nursery, hardware store or 
lumberyard, and it will help to avoid disappointments when dealing with 
contractors, carpenters, bricklayers, concrete masons and landscapers. 
</P>
<P>
 So do everyone a favor: Assemble a back-yard scrapbook before the first 
shovelful of earth is turned. 
</P>
<P>
 Pick a quiet time to go through the magazines, and look at them slowly. 
Carefully search the corners of each photograph to see if anything catches your 
eye. It might be something as simple as the handle on a gate, a piece of 
outdoor furniture, the shape of a deck or the color of a fence. No detail is 
insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the sense of urgency, the scrapbook can be assembled over a long 
weekend, over a few months or slowly over a period of years. From Two to Three 
Dimensions 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've collected everyone's ideas, it's time to make use of that graph 
paper -- as long as you heed a couple of important warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The most creative people can be rendered robotic when faced with a sheet of 
graph paper. Just because there are little blue squares all over the page in a 
perfect grid pattern doesn't mean you aren't allowed to draw a curve or draw a 
line in between two of the printed lines. 
</P>
<P>
 If you think you may be subject to the tyranny of graph paper, neutralize its 
effect by starting the composition of the plan outdoors. Take your back-yard 
scrapbook to the back yard, along with a few dozen 12-inch wooden stakes, a 
half-dozen 2-inch-by-2-inch-by-6-foot wooden stakes (available at any 
lumberyard), a spool of heavy cotton string (500 feet should do), a couple of 
long garden hoses, two handfuls of clothespins and a few old bed sheets. An odd 
list of equipment, to be sure, but it works. 
</P>
<P>
 Put your equipment aside for a moment and take a good look at your scrapbook. 
What have you got? You may have some ideas for fences, a play area for the 
kids, a deck or patio, perhaps a gazebo or arbor, a really great treehouse, an 
outside eating and cooking area, a lawn laid out with games in mind, or even a 
fountain, swimming pool or spa. Your challenge is to arrange the elements you 
want in the space available. 
</P>
<P>
 To successfully meet this challenge, you should intimately know every corner 
of your back yard. You may think you know it, but you'd be surprised at how 
many people are locked into only one viewing position, usually about six feet 
away from the back door. The Back-Yard Walkabout 
</P>
<P>
 Get acquainted with your yard by walking its perimeter, and I do mean the 
perimeter -- no farther than an arm's length from the lot line, please. While 
you walk, keep looking back at your house. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a spot, somewhere toward the rear or to the side of the yard where 
the view of your house is particularly pleasant? Would this be the best place 
for a small patio? 
</P>
<P>
 And is that the perfect, almost horizontal limb on which to hang a swing? How 
about the area behind the shrubbery and under the tree, in the far corner of 
your lot, did you feel a sense of security and diminished scale that reminds 
you of places you liked to play in as a child? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this is the spot for a little "secret garden" for the kids in your 
house. All that's necessary is a layer of fine bark, perhaps a couple of 
sawed-off logs to use as table and chairs, and a playful adult to lead the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Your back-yard "walkabout" may result in some new ideas about where some of 
the elements you want should go. This is the easiest (not to mention least 
expensive) time to change your mind -- repeatedly, if desired. And even though 
they may not be in your immediate future, it's important to take into 
consideration all the elements of your "dream" back yard. This is the only way 
to make sure there's room for everything. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step is to mock the various elements into position, using the stakes, 
string and sheets. Any rectilinear feature, such as a deck, patio, swimming 
pool or sandbox, can be outlined using the stakes and string. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply pound the stakes a few inches into the ground and tie the string around 
the stakes to show the outline. Curved areas, such as lawns and planting beds 
are easily outlined using a long garden hose. Adjust the curves in the hose 
until the shape is pleasing from all angles. 
</P>
<P>
 To the person with little or no involvement in your design process, this 
mocked-up back yard will appear a motley mess. Where someone else sees only a 
sheet hanging from a line, you see a brick and latticework fence. That garden 
hose, lying in a curve on the dirt, isn't just lying there, it's marking the 
boundaries of a lush green lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The best part of this exercise is the three-dimensional quality it gives your 
emerging plan, something almost impossible to achieve with only pencil and 
paper, which happens to be the next step. Committing the Plan to Paper 
</P>
<P>
 Leave the stakes, strings, sheets and hoses in place for a couple of days or 
weeks if necessary. See how the arrangement looks at different times of the day 
and in different weather conditions. Once you're comfortable with the layout, 
get out the tape measure, pencils and paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Make a rough drawing of the shape of your lot and house. (Please note the term 
rough. Even those who feel that they simply can't draw anything should go ahead 
and "rough in" a drawing; it has to make sense to only one person -- you -- at 
this point.) Use this rough plan to note the actual measurements. 
</P>
<P>
 Start by measuring the outside perimeter of your lot. Next, measure in from 
the lot lines to the outside walls of your house to establish its position on 
the lot. After this, start measuring the outlines of your deck, patio, play 
area, pool and sandbox. To correctly position everything on the plan, you'll 
need to measure in from the lot line, just as you did with your house. 
</P>
<P>
 And now is the time to indicate the location of the water spigots, electrical 
outlets and whatever else you think should be taken into consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you have the measurements on the rough plan, transfer them to the graph 
paper. If a single sheet of graph paper is too confining, tape several sheets 
together to make a bigger drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time you have the finished plan on paper, you should be confident that 
it reflects reality, rather than an abstract, two-dimensional drawing pulled 
together at the kitchen table. This, combined with your back-yard scrapbook, 
will hold you in good stead as you go about making your plan come to life. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when so many are trying to simplify their lives, one more thing to 
take care of may be the last thing we think we need. Oddly, though, a back yard 
is that rare place that gives back far more than it requires.

<P>
 Making It Real 
</P>
<P>
 Now's the time for you to face another kind of back-yard reality -- the fiscal 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Most back-yard construction (with the exception of pools, spas, fountains and 
sophisticated electrical work) is well within the ability of a person with 
average mechanical ability. If you enjoy these kinds of projects, by all means 
have at it. You'll save considerable labor charges and experience a great deal 
of pride once the project is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 You have many choices for outside help. They are presented here in traditional 
order of "professionalism" (that is, from the least to most amount of training 
and licensing required to use the title): Nursery or garden center 
design/construction service, landscape designer, landscape contractor, 
landscape architect. 
</P>
<P>
 On the straight construction side, there are carpenters, building designers, 
construction contractors and architects. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people claim that you're always better off using only the top 
professionals in the field. This is certainly true with large and complex 
projects. But if your project is of small or moderate size, it's possible to 
get excellent results from general handy people, retirees with extra time on 
their hands, and all manner of artists and craftspeople who are looking to 
augment their income.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * Check brown spots in lawns for sodweb worms and grubs. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the foliage is dry and yellowed on spring blooming bulbs, be sure to cut 
if off. Divide and replant any crowded clumps of bulbs for better bloom next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant garden mums now for a blaze of color this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feed tuberous begonias and fuchsias with 0-10-10 fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Divide and transplant bearded iris.

HOMEWISE: HOME IMPROVEMENT / GARDENING; ADVANTAGES OF USING STEEL IN FRAMING 
HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times; Written by David Hales from the Education and 
Information Network of the Washington State Energy Office. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: Because of the price of lumber, I am considering using steel studs 
for framing my new home. Can I get good insulation value with steel studs? Is 
more insulation required? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Steel currently enjoys a 20% to 25% price advantage over lumber. As a 
result, many builders are interested in using steel framing in residential 
construction. Your concern about maintaining insulation value when you use 
steel studs, however, is justified. To maintain the high standards required in 
today's energy efficient homes, you must pay special attention to insulation 
details when you use steel studs. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel is a poor insulator. When it replaces wood framing members in the 
exterior shell of a building, it provides a path for heat loss that bypasses 
the insulation in the walls and other building cavities. This effect is known 
as thermal bridging. Wood studs (a better insulator than steel) produce some 
thermal bridging, but the effect is much more pronounced with steel. 
</P>
<P>
 To compensate for the lower effective level of insulation with steel studs, 
you must add insulation to obtain the same R-value. This can be done by 
building a thicker wall providing room for more insulation or by attaching 
insulated sheathing to either the interior or exterior surface of the exterior 
walls. Insulated sheathing provides a "thermal break" by interrupting the flow 
of heat through the thermal bridge of the stud. In either case, the current 
savings in material costs achieved in switching from wood to steel studs may be 
offset by the additional cost of insulation required to maintain the same 
R-value. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the problems in maintaining insulation levels, some builders have found 
it's most effective to stay with wood framing for the exterior shell of the 
building and use steel studs only for interior partitions where thermal 
bridging is not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Often builders used to wood framing will replace wood with steel on a 
stick-for-stick basis. Better economy of labor and materials is possible if the 
house is pre-engineered for steel construction. Pros and Cons of Steel Framing 
</P>
<P>
 Pros 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steel has a higher strength-to-weight ratio than wood and can span greater 
distances. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steel is dimensionally stable and doesn't have the grading inconsistencies 
of lumber. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steel doesn't burn. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steel isn't attacked by insects. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Using steel reduces the need to harvest lumber. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 66% of U.S. steel comes from recycled material (cars, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
 Cons 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steel framing is less forgiving than wood; foundations and framing must be 
level, plumb and square. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steel rusts; it must be treated or galvanized. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Builders must learn new skills and acquire new tools. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steel production is energy intensive and can cause air and water pollution. 
The National Academy of Science estimates it takes nine times more energy to 
produce a steel stud than a wood stud.

HOME IMPROVEMENT / GARDENING; ASK THE INDOOR GARDENER; PRAYER PLANT IS TURNING 
BROWN AROUND EDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL RAPP, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Rapp is a Los Angeles free-lance writer 
who, as Mr. Mother Earth, has written several best-selling books on indoor 
gardening. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My prayer plant is beginning to turn brown around the edges. No 
matter how hard I pray, every day more of the leaves have turned dry and 
crinkly around the tips and edges. What's the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Not enough humidity. All the prayers in the world won't keep your 
Maranta leuconeura looking fresh from the greenhouse, but regular mistings will 
definitely help. Any time a plant develops brown tips odds are it's due to a 
lack of humidity, so the more you can provide, the better. 
</P>
<P>
 An inexpensive humidifier in the room where you and your plants spend the most 
time is the most healthful solution for both you and your plants, but short of 
that, spray them with a fine mist of water whenever possible, keep your 
houseplants on trays filled with pebbles and water, which should be replenished 
regularly as it evaporates up around the plant, and group them if possible so 
they will gather humidity from each other when they transpire or "breathe." Can 
Half-Dead Plants Hurt Others Nearby? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I was over at my mother's house yesterday and I was appalled to see several 
half-dead plants among her collection of otherwise healthy and thriving 
specimens. She told me she's had those particular plants for years and just 
couldn't bear to throw them out as long as there's any life left. Couldn't this 
be dangerous to her other plants? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not unless the plants are dying from pest infestations which could spread 
to her other, healthy plants. But your mother's "problem" is not uncommon. Lots 
of people, including me, become attached to pet plants and struggle to keep 
them "alive" long after they've ceased to become attractive adjuncts to the 
indoor garden. My advice: Bite the bullet and discard plants that have outlined 
their usefulness. The space they take up is better served populated by a lush, 
healthy specimen. You'll feel badly for a minute or two, but as soon as you put 
a new plant in, the sadness will pass, I promise. How to Care for Hindu Rope 
Plant 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I just bought a Hindu rope plant that has curly green and white vines and 
delicate little pink flowers. How should I take care of it? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Hindu rope plant is a nickname for the succulent Hoya carnosa, also 
known as the wax plant. Like all succulents and cacti, H. carnosa needs bright 
sunlight and water only when the soil is bone dry to the touch. The leaves will 
start to crinkle up if your Hindu rope plant isn't getting enough water. Indoor 
Gardenia Gets Buds But No Flowers 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've had a gardenia plant in my atrium for two years now and it still 
hasn't bloomed. Every year it gets buds, but they always drop off before they 
open up. Is there any way to grow a gardenia indoors? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, but gardenias are very, very temperamental. They require some specific 
care in order to protect the buds and ensure flowering: Bright light and high 
humidity are important, but the key to culture is warmth. Cold drafts cause the 
buds to drop off. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a good idea to give your gardenia plant an outdoor vacation -- in 
the shade -- during the warm summer months of July and August. Don't give up. 
Move your gardenia to a sunnier spot, water it more, give it more humidity and 
feed it more often. Sooner or later, you'll be rewarded by the deliciously 
fragrant, waxy white flowers and you'll feel even better than you did the night 
of your senior prom!

STARTING OVER; DOMESTIC ISSUES: IS LACK OF FOCUS THE PROBLEM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The party-line vote in the House Ways and Means Committee last week, where the 
Democrats prevailed, is not enough to pull President Bill Clinton's version of 
health-care reform out of the deep trouble it is in. Though people say they 
like the plan's goals, one recent poll disclosed that they disapprove, by 53% 
to 42%, of the plan itself. The same poll showed the public trusts Congress 
more to handle health care properly. 
</P>
<P>
 The response of the President and Hilary Rodham Clinton to the bad news, as 
well as to his generally low approval ratings, was to declare last week the 
week of the Great Midterm Shakeup -- in which a President says that now 
everything will be OK because he has just sacked his old chief of staff (or 
communications director, or secretary of state) and gotten himself a new one. 
Clinton has moved his childhood friend, Thomas F. (Mack) McLarty III, out of 
the chief of staff's office and replaced him with former Rep. Leon E. Panetta 
-- a "Washington insider," the reports emphasize -- who moves to the White 
House from his current job as head of the Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The President is said to have chosen Panetta because he has the skills needed 
to deal with Congress on health-care reform and produce a sorely needed win -- 
or to help with White House and congressional midterm campaign efforts if the 
win does not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this shift likely to change the President's fortunes? Not much. In health 
care, as in most of the domestic policy arena, Clinton's troubles lie deeper 
than problems of political or communications skills. His message is not getting 
through because White House ideology has made for policy incoherence, and the 
issue of character has robbed both the President and Mrs. Clinton of authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta has the experience and temperament to cut a health-care deal on the 
Hill. One of his first acts was to talk with Senate Finance Committee Chairman 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), whom he has known for years. This is already 
a big improvement in White House-congressional relations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Panetta may have little control over the most important obstacles to a 
successful deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was quite right, during the 1992 presidential campaign, to identify 
anxiety over health insurance as a worry that dogged many Americans -- and thus 
as an area in which the call for "change" would have concrete appeal to a great 
many. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have also recognized the pervasiveness of the insurance worry. In fact, 
nowadays the policy air hums and buzzs with possible solutions to this 
insurance puzzle. They range from mandatory catastrophic insurance to 
assigned-risk pools and medical savings accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Clintons finally produced their health-reform legislation, it 
turned out not to be clearly focused on the insurance problem. Instead, it 
aimed to do many other things as well: For example, to shepherd people into 
government-run "alliances," speed the shift to health-maintenance 
organizations, control the prices of drugs, rationalize the conduct of 
health-care research, control the number of medical specialists and use 
employer mandates to avoid hitting most Americans with a direct tax bite. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan certainly did not look as if its sights were trained on the pressing 
matter of health insurance. It did not seem focused on the issue of health-care 
quality. Its scope made it look more concerned with power: the power to control 
decision-making in the health-care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton helped foster this impression by talking of the plan in terms 
of a large transfer of power. In launching the health-reform campaign, she 
stressed the need for people to take control of the system from insurance 
companies tending their profit margins and the drug companies price-gouging on 
children's vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
 But this rhetorical strategy and the plan's general approach did not do well. 
Parts of the rhetoric fizzled: It turned out, for example, that drug companies 
did not make big profits on vaccines, and that the rise in vaccination costs 
was due mainly to doctors' fees. Moreover, Mrs. Clinton's ability to make 
persuasive "greed-and-power" arguments declined after revelations of her own 
profit-taking in the commodity futures business. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the plan's voluminous, overreaching character produced -- well, 
lack of focus. The same features raised the suspicion that, in supporting the 
plan, people might be buying into more change than they really wanted. By being 
so inclusive and ambitious, the plan also identified itself with trends, like 
the HMO's, already proceeding but which many people still feel ambivalent 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubts of this sort made people receptive to advertising and other kinds of 
persuasion from those special interests that Mrs. Clinton says are the root of 
all opposition to health reform. In fact, a series of ads sponsored by the 
Health Insurance Assn. of America, featuring "Harry and Louise," is regularly 
cited by the Administration and others as particularly effective in attacking 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main obstacle facing Panetta is considerable: The spirit of the 
Clinton health plan is now seen as at odds with the nature of the problem as 
most Americans see it. That is a hard thing to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 This dilemma is not just in health care. You can see the same "mismatch" in 
other areas of domestic policy. Clintonites often say that, contrary to popular 
impression, the Administration has been immensely successful. They point to 
legislation on the budget, education, family leave, national service and gun 
control. They say their main fault has been in creating a flawed White House 
organization that is unable to "focus" and "get the message out" to the public. 
But critics say some initiatives the White House is so proud of are, in 
reality, not widely seen as likely to produce widespread change -- or might 
only in the not-so-near future. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta says he has been given authority to bring order to the staff, tame the 
various power centers now confusing the White House and bring more "focus" to 
the President's image. As cynical Washington types say, we'll see. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, one issue many Americans do feel strongly about is welfare. The 
President has talked tough on this topic. But we do not yet know how far the 
Administration is willing to go in changing the system. The welfare bill they 
submitted will not be many people's idea of ending welfare as we know it. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans care even more deeply about crime -- along with the social 
disintegration that causes it. But federal legislation can have only a marginal 
effect on crime -- a President influences crime mainly by talking about it. But 
if he is to persuade people that their concerns are his, he must talk about 
social disorganization, families and religion. Clinton has spoken movingly 
about crime. But his recent scandals have put him in a poor position to talk 
about the need for morality in people's lives. Moreover, he is at war with the 
religious right, which is trying to make sure his position does not improve. 
</P>

 These gaps -- between public beliefs and concerns on the one hand and the 
Administration's ideology and leadership capacities on the other -- are the 
source of Clinton's problems on health care and other domestic-policy issues. 
If Panetta can close them, the Midterm Shake-up will prove to have been not 
just an improvement but a revolution.

VIOLENCE IN UTOPIA: WHAT THE VENICE GANG KILLINGS MEAN TO L.A.

 What does London think of us? Paris? Tokyo? Mexico City? Indeed, what do most 
U.S. cities think of us? 
</P>
<P>
 For 20 years or so, Los Angeles has been announcing to one and all its arrival 
on the scene as a leading city. Since Los Angeles correctly believes that it is 
playing in the big leagues, the opinions of its urban peers around the globe 
should be a concern. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is not being asked because of the O. J. Simpson case, which for 
all its horror and theatricality can be understood as yet another L.A. 
mega-media event. No, the question is being prompted by a more significant and 
terrifying series of events: the apparent black vs. Latino gang warfare under 
way in the Oakwood section of Venice, in Culver City, in Mar Vista and in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, 17 people, many of them innocent bystanders, have lost their lives 
in this Armageddon; another 50 have been wounded. Most recently, two Dorsey 
High School students who belonged to no gang were shot and killed near Venice 
High School in Mar Vista, executed in cold blood as they sat in their 
automobile. They were killed, as far as the police could determine, strictly 
because they were Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind this incident lies more than a year and a half of executions, drive-by 
shootings, reprisals and counter-reprisals that have made this section of Los 
Angeles the social and psychological equivalent of a war zone. What began as a 
power struggle over crack-cocaine sales has escalated into something that 
should send a chill down the spine of every Angeleno: The Venice killings 
threaten the identity of Los Angeles as a city. 
</P>
<P>
 The murders threaten to create yet another No Man's Land of abandoned public 
spaces in Los Angeles. Sadly, we have adjusted to and accommodated the 
quarantining of vast sections of eastern and south-central Los Angeles, a 
legacy of racism in our culture. But as bad as this quarantining is, we are now 
faced, in terms of the sociology and psychology of urban space, with a 
brand-new prospect: the transformation of the most intrinsically utopian 
portion of the metropolitan region, the Westside and the beach communities, 
into a war zone. 
</P>
<P>
 For its first 150 years, Los Angeles moved south along its river. In the late 
1920s and 1930s, however, it reversed direction and began to run westward to 
the sea, along the Wilshire corridor. Two turn-of-the-century Angelenos, H. 
Gaylord Wilshire and Abbot Kinney, played key roles in creating this surge 
west. Wilshire laid out the boulevard that bears his name. Kinney created 
Venice as a utopian experience. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1892, Kinney acquired a tract of marshy tidelands 15 miles from Downtown 
Los Angeles, on the site of the old Rancho La Ballona, favored by the city's 
duck hunters. He intended to create the ideal city, a utopia of high thought 
and gracious living. In 1900, Kinney's friend, Henry Huntington, ran a trolley 
line out to the marshlands, and Kinney began the development of Venice as a 
utopian residential community and theme park. Venice was the first themed 
development in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kinney, Venice was a controlling metaphor for the coming of age of Los 
Angeles as a neo-Mediterranean city. He spent $1.4 million improving the harbor 
and waterfront. He constructed a 500-foot-long breakwater to protect the Venice 
piers. He built an elegant hotel, the St. Mark, in the Venetian style, and a 
2,500-seat auditorium near the wharf -- complete with a great pipe organ and 
high glass windows with a breathtaking view of the ocean. There, the citizens 
of Los Angeles might converge for lectures, concerts and other cultural events. 
</P>
<P>
 When this ideal proved too elusive, the ever-resilient Kinney turned Venice 
into Coney Island West. Among other things, he brought to Los Angeles the great 
Ferris wheel that had delighted visitors to the Columbian Exposition in Chicago 
in 1893. He opened a skating rink, a dance pavilion, a bowling alley, a 
shooting gallery, an aquacade and a bathhouse. Venice, in other words, was like 
the Los Angeles it served as an urban resort: a distinctive blend of high and 
popular culture, upper-middle-class dreams and popular realities. 
</P>
<P>
 The canals never worked, and, in 1912, the state board of health declared them 
a public menace. They were paved as ordinary streets in 1927, by which time 
Venice had become incorporated in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the point is that Venice never completely lost its utopian impulses. From 
the 1930s on, it became increasingly the Bohemia of Los Angeles. In contrast to 
most other districts, its population was an amalgam of white, black, yellow and 
brown. During the 1950s, it functioned at near-parity with North Beach in San 
Francisco as a creative matrix of jazz, painting and poetry. Even today, the 72 
Market Street Oyster Bar & Grill carries on this tradition, with a program of 
Saturday afternoon lectures, concerts and poetry readings. Kinney set Venice 
down as a goal for Los Angeles as it proceeded west to the sea, leapfrogging 
from Bullock's Wilshire to Beverly Hills to UCLA to Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Do we now measure ourselves against these previous eras: the sincerity of 
Kinney's Venice, the internationalism of the 1940s, the Beat-bohemia of the 
1950s? Shall we allow these urban landscapes, which yet reverberate in the 
city's collective memory, to have superimposed on them a landscape of social 
nihilism and murderous intent? 
</P>
<P>
 This is not merely a question of culture and identity, or even the opinion of 
other leading cities, as important as these are. 
</P>
<P>
 There is under way a struggle for the soul of Los Angeles itself -- for the 
sealing off of the western shore in fear and terror would do violence to the 
very nature of Los Angeles. Public value in such a scenario would be abrogated. 
Already, there are the beginnings of a boycott and suspicions, perhaps 
justified, that the beach communities are setting up barricades to the 
seashore, however indirect, intended to seal off the region from outsiders. 
Sixty-plus years ago, Los Angeles County adopted a master plan that declared 
these beaches, for all time to come, the public preserve of the region: the one 
great public park, open to all. Shall we allow the killers to keep us from this 
legacy as well? 
</P>
<P>
 What do the great world cities think of us? What do we think of ourselves?

STARTING OVER; FOR BETTER FOREIGN POLICY: TALK TO THE PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles A. Kupchan, Charles A. Kupchan, senior fellow for Europe at the 
Council on Foreign Relations and a professor at Georgetown University, was on 
the staff of the National Security Council for the first year of the Clinton 
Administration.

<P>
 The U.S. political system grants the presidency enormous power in foreign 
affairs. With this power comes the responsibility not only to guide the ship of 
state, but also to educate and inform the American people -- a task the 
President, and only the President, can adequately carry out. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first U.S. leader of the post-Cold War era, Bill Clinton has to recast 
the foundations of U.S. foreign policy. Not since 1945 has a President had such 
weighty responsibility to mold public thinking about the nature of the nation's 
engagement abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has thus far failed to fulfill this responsibility. As a result, he 
must now redouble efforts to exercise presidential leadership in foreign 
affairs. Regardless of the course of action he decides to pursue in Haiti, 
North Korea and whatever comes next, Clinton must embark on an explicit 
campaign to educate the American public about its responsibilities abroad. 
David R. Gergen's move from the White House to the State Department, to focus 
on foreign affairs, should help get the message across.  
</P>
<P>
 But if muddled signals -- or only silence -- continue to emanate from 
Washington, Americans will remain confused about their role in a world without 
a Soviet threat. The potential cost is high: the country's gradual 
disengagement from international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of the 20th Century -- when the United States became a 
great power -- Americans have tended to be ardent internationalists when 
foreign dangers arise, and ardent isolationists in the absence of pressing 
external threats. The country entered World War I to prevent German domination 
of Europe, only to withdraw from the international scene during the 1920s and 
1930s. The United States paid a high price for its disengagement. Left 
unchecked, Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan developed into powerful aggressor 
states. Their defeat cost thousands of American lives. 
</P>
<P>
 From the close of World War II until the end of the Cold War, the Soviet Union 
kept the United States engaged in Europe and Asia. With the collapse of the 
Soviet Union, the scope of American involvement abroad is once again shrinking. 
If history is any guide, we are drifting toward a new isolationism. 
</P>
<P>
 This drift can be reversed -- but only if Clinton persuades Americans that 
they should continue to expend blood and treasure to defend an international 
order no longer threatened by communism. Even if he decides the United States 
should engage only gingerly in pressing matters of the day, the President still 
must explain his decision to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is clearly up to the task: He is articulate and charismatic when 
addressing the nation about domestic policy. He must now apply his talents 
elsewhere and overcome his decided reluctance to use the presidency to forge 
the political and conceptual underpinnings of a new foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs associated with Clinton's unwillingness to play a more prominent 
role in shaping public attitudes are not yet fully apparent. The Congress and 
the people it represents remain internationalist; Americans still appreciate 
the importance of U.S. leadership and of continued U.S. engagement in world 
affairs. But this brand if internationalism is a residue of the Cold War. It 
will not last. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless Clinton increases the visibility of foreign policy and informs the 
American people of the principles that guide that policy, he will ensure that 
the next generation of Americans and the leaders they elect will be of a 
different cast. However politically attractive it may seem to allow foreign 
policy to slip off the radar screen, the country's long-term interests 
necessitate ambitious efforts to educate the public. When he chooses to act -- 
and especially when he chooses not -- Clinton must use prime-time television to 
explain to the American people the interests at stake. Saturday morning radio 
addresses will not do.  
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, the end of the Cold War has increased, not decreased, the need 
for presidential leadership in foreign affairs. From 1949-1989, successive U.S. 
Presidents had only to point to a pervasive Soviet threat to garner public 
support for enlarging the defense budget or sending troops far from U.S. 
borders. Now, Clinton must shape public attitudes with new arguments and 
clearly articulated actions. And because there is no global external threat, 
there is no neat formula or doctrine to guide policy. Like it or not, the 
President must get in the trenches and regularly explain to the nation the 
opportunities and dangers of a world undergoing deep transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Clinton's top priority should be the long-neglected domestic 
agenda. But the Administration must not underestimate the long-term effect of 
downgrading public discourse on foreign policy. Once isolationist myths take 
root, they are hard to dispel. Franklin D. Roosevelt battled tenacious strains 
of isolationism as he tried to prepare the country for World War II. Not until 
Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor could the American people be convinced of 
the need for engagement. By that time, Nazi Germany had already overrun most of 
Europe. To regain a foothold on the Continent, the Allies had no choice but to 
storm the beaches of Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1940s, Harry S. Truman faced similar obstacles in persuading 
Americans to bear the costs of containing the Soviet Union. Despite the Truman 
Administration's repeated efforts to dampen isolationism and fuel 
anti-communism, it took the outbreak of the Korean War to persuade Congress to 
undertake a major military buildup. 
</P>
<P>
 By taking steps now to sustain American internationalism, Clinton will ensure 
the United States plays its role in building a stable post-Cold War order. More 
important, he will be making a low-cost investment to ensure that Americans do 
not again drift into the illusory safety of isolationism. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is at a critical historical juncture. Under Clinton's 
leadership, the country has embarked on an ambitious program of domestic 
renewal. Clinton's legacy already appears impressive: a more fair, competitive 
and prosperous country. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton is also presiding over the remaking of the country's foreign 
policy and is determining whether Americans turn inward or outward as they 
address domestic renewal. The rest of the world watches with anxiety; it is 
desperate for American leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless Clinton makes foreign policy a more prominent element of his 
presidency, his legacy will be a prosperous country -- but one withdrawn from 
the international arena. The last time that happened, the world went to hell. 
It is up to Clinton to ensure that, 50 years from now, Americans again descend 
on Normandy to commemorate, not to repeat, the rescue of the world from that 
hell.

CAN IT BE POSSIBLE? ATTACK VIDEOS PROVE POLITICS CAN INDEED GET DIRTIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Estrich, Susan Estrich, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a law 
professor at USC. She served as campaign manager for Michael S. Dukakis in 
1988.

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Bill Clinton's recent lament that no President in modern history had 
ever been subject to "more violent attacks" is not historically accurate. 
Franklin D. Roosevelt was loathed with as much passion as he was loved. Lyndon 
B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon were both vilified. And the invective unleashed 
on Presidents in the 19th Century -- from Thomas Jefferson through Abraham 
Lincoln and Grover Cleveland -- was worse than any of it. 
</P>
<P>
 What is different about the attack on President and Hillary Rodham Clinton, 
however, is the way it is being conducted. This is a high-tech war being 
targeted to a special community. This is television, not pamphleteering. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of people have spent $40 plus shipping for a videotape of 
"Bill and Hillary's Circle of Power." Many more saw it for four weeks running 
on Jerry Falwell's cable TV shows. The tape ends with an appeal to call a 900 
number and pay $4 more to be part of a Citizens Petition to Sen. George J. 
Mitchell and Speaker Thomas S. Foley. It is the new democracy, based in the new 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The video has a number of segments. The President and his wife are charged 
with murder, insider trading, shredding documents, setting fires, ordering 
people beaten up. A mother complains that her child's death was covered up by 
Clinton appointees. It is the power of video that makes it all seem almost 
plausible. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Parks appears on the video. He says his father, Jerry Parks, was a 
private investigator in Little Rock, Ark., who had been the Clinton 
headquarters security chief. He says his father was murdered in September, 
1993. He blames Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was assassinated," Parks tells us, because he was "the one link" 
who could connect Clinton to wrongdoing. According to his son, the father kept 
a large file on Clinton; his son accompanied him on investigative trips to 
Gennifer Flowers' apartment building -- which we see. "Bill Clinton had my 
father killed to save his political career." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Nichols, the Arkansan who has made a career of attacking Clinton -- 
beginning with a lawsuit filed before the election -- is the star of the video. 
He is introduced by a judge, who tells us that Nichols has been unfairly 
maligned by the Clinton spin doctors; that he is a truth-teller who has proved 
right. Larry then looks into the camera, sympathetic, beaten down but 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what he says: "You may wonder what it's been like fighting Bill 
Clinton. People are dead in Arkansas. There are people that are dead. Yeah. 
When I started this, I knew that I might be one of the unsolved mysteries in 
Arkansas. There were boys on the railroad track. (Cut to a lonely railroad 
track.) There were countless and countless people that mysteriously died that, 
as it turned out, had some connection to Bill Clinton. I believe this is going 
on today." 
</P>
<P>
 There's more. The video specifically accuses Mrs. Clinton of having an affair 
with Vincent W. Foster Jr. Over a picture of the two of them smiling together, 
Nichols charges that Foster's death was not a suicide -- so ignore that the 
independent prosecutor's report said the opposite last week -- and says Mrs. 
Clinton's personal secretary was looking for love letters when she and three 
others searched his office. That search is then re-enacted later in the video 
-- in a segment hosted by Falwell himself. 
</P>
<P>
 And you react. You feel sorry for the mother, even if there's no evidence to 
back up her story. The son seems to be telling the truth; you feel sorry for 
him, too. You like Nichols. To read about Nichols is to imagine a crackpot. But 
to see him on this video is to think you know a sincere, sympathetic, credible 
man. It's not a good video, but it doesn't matter. It sucks you in, and it 
suckers you in. 
</P>
<P>
 Visual images have power. Countless studies have proved it. If an image is 
strong enough, it doesn't matter what the spoken words are. The smiling couple 
look as if they could be lovers; the railroad tracks look desolate enough that 
dead bodies might well be left there. Ronald Reagan's staff used to tell 
reporters that even the most negative stories didn't hurt the President if he 
looked good in the piece -- a blistering report by Lesley Stahl on his 
environmental record won her no enemies at the White House, because the 
pictures were so good. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading a description of White House staffers searching Foster's office is one 
thing; seeing it re-enacted is quite another. The searchers appear in shadows. 
The mood is sinister. You barely notice the disclaimer that says it is a 
re-enactment. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, Nichols' charges are preposterous. But Nichols is good on 
television. He seems credible. He may be a liar, but he's a good television 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Television makes it easy to sell lies -- even when it's not great television. 
You forget what you're watching; you forget it's a station with no standards 
and practices, no codes of ethics. Mass communication -- especially news and 
public affairs -- is no longer in the hands of the few. The Liberty Alliance 
disclaims responsibility for the views in its own video. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the views are radical, however. It's the mix that, ultimately, may 
make the lies so easy to swallow, and the religious right so politically 
powerful. In between the attacks on the President and Mrs. Clinton, the videos 
from the Liberty Alliance sound themes with wide appeal in America today: 
smaller government, lower taxes, personal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole first program in the tape package, "A Prescription for Disaster," is 
a mostly traditional conservative attack on the President's health-care plan, 
with some AIDs and abortion-bashing, packaged news-magazine style. It's easy to 
start believing what they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the President attacked Falwell and Rush Limbaugh by name. Many 
Democrats believe that it is in their interest to use the religious right to 
brand the Republican Party. In that effort, the lies of "The Inner Circle" are 
ammunition, proof of how far the GOP has gone.  
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the short-term political gains and losses, this is not a step 
forward for democracy. Television has great power to make issues real, to get 
people involved, to bring democracy into peoples' homes. The "Circle of Power" 
is an unfortunate abuse of that power. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early days of the Clinton health-care plan, there was much talk about 
how communications strategies would be used to aid passage. There was talk of 
grass-roots campaigns in congressional districts. Former Ohio Gov. Richard F. 
Celeste was brought in to manage things. He's long since gone home. "Harry and 
Louise" became household names. The technology is there. The other side is 
using it with no ethical standards. The President can't do that. That means he 
has to use it even better.

U.S. MUST NOT RETREAT FROM A NON-NUCLEAR NORTH KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Henry A. Kissinger, Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger writes 
frequently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most worrisome aspect of the crisis over North Korea's nuclear-weapons 
program is that America's negotiating position has been weakened at each new 
turn of diplomacy. As a result, options have become starker, raising the choice 
of either acquiescence or a major crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has failed to explain -- or perhaps to understand 
-- the nature of its problem. If, after much U.S. huffing and puffing, North 
Korea emerges with a nuclear-weapons capability -- or a capability it can 
rapidly activate -- stability in Asia, the U.S. role in Asia and 
non-proliferation will all be gravely jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, U.S. troops in South Korea, shorn of their tactical nuclear 
shield, will be in a precarious position; South Korea will be tempted to 
develop nuclear weapons of its own; Japan, within range of North Korean 
missiles, will accelerate its nuclear-weapons and military programs; China will 
speed up its preparedness; industrialized nations of Southeast Asia -- and 
perhaps Taiwan -- will start their own nuclear programs; rogue states will be 
encouraged to join the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's response has emphasized a bilateral diplomacy focused on 
abstruse issues of inspection. To be sure, the diplomatic environment has not 
been congenial. China, Japan and South Korea would seem to have more to lose 
from a nuclear North Korea than the United States. But, in practice, they seem 
not to perceive their risks, though reports last week suggested that China may 
have played a role in persuading North Korea to freeze its nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, the Administration has oscillated among its options. In 1993, 
the U.S. position was that North Korea had to reverse its withdrawal from the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty and accept the full inspection system of the 
International Atomic Agency, including suspect sites. Since then, the U.S. 
position has been watered down to asking that North Korea only suspend its 
withdrawal and only to discuss inspections of seven declared sites. The demand 
for inspections of two suspect sites has been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 The most significant retreat has been from the President's statement of "North 
Korea cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb" to a policy that says the 
North need only stop developing its capability. In other words, North Korea 
could keep the two nuclear bombs intelligence believes it may have built before 
1992 and maintain its capacity to produce plutonium, which the IAEA estimates 
has doubled since 1992. Acquiescing to what existed would make North Korea a 
nuclear power even if, in any one year, it stopped reprocessing its plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 These retreats may have given Pyongyang the idea that it could stall 
indefinitely. Despite a U.S. offer to cancel permanently its annual military 
exercises with Seoul if the North accepted IAEA inspections, in March, 1994, 
Pyongyang refused any such inspections, and in May it began to remove enough 
plutonium from its reactor in Yongbyon that, if reprocessed, would yield five 
to seven nuclear weapons. Finally, in June, 1994, the Administration hesitantly 
decided to explore -- almost apologetically -- sanctions against North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Even this tentative and essentially meaningless measure was vitiated within 
days by the President's permission to former President Jimmy Carter to visit 
North Korea. Carter was known to be strongly opposed to sanctions; he had said 
that the source of the crisis was not Pyongyang's conduct but a 
"misunderstanding," easily removed by high-level contact. Permitting Carter to 
go was bound to embarrass countries that had agreed to sanctions. And it had to 
be construed in Pyongyang as an indication that the Administration was looking 
for a way out when confronted by Pyongyang's threat that sanctions spelled war. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Kim il-Sung used the Carter visit to induce yet another U.S. 
retreat. The sanction effort was suspended. In return for "good faith" 
negotiations -- and for so long as these negotiations go on -- Pyongyang has 
agreed not to reprocess the plutonium it had illegally removed from its 
reactor. And it agreed to discuss IAEA safeguards, though not for the two 
suspected sites. In return for stopping what should not have been done in the 
first place, Pyongyang has asked for U.S. recognition, a U.S. pledge not to use 
nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula and for what amounts to an economic-aid 
program in the guise of resources for a light-water reactor. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-touted Pyongyang concessions, however, are more compatible with an 
attempt to gain time than with a serious effort to solve the problem. 
Pyongyang's postponement of reprocessing the plutonium would be meaningful only 
if the forthcoming negotiations last more than three months. For when plutonium 
emerges from nuclear reactors, it is too radioactive to reprocess. A "cooling 
down" period of several months is required. Thus, Pyongyang's overture may also 
be designed to prevent a U.S. air strike during the next three months, when the 
plutonium is not yet being processed and there is no danger of fallout. In the 
best of circumstances, the North will retain the essence of its nuclear program 
and the ability to sell nuclear technology, plutonium and ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The beginning of wisdom is for U.S. policy-makers to recognize that no 
compromise is possible between a nuclear and a non-nuclear North Korea. A 
freeze of the North's activities that leaves it in possible possession of 
weapons and a growing plutonium-producing capability would pose a mounting 
threat to vital U.S. interests in Asia, to Asian stability, and, in the longer 
run, to the U.S. role in the region and to non-proliferation in general. A 
rollback is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 When the stakes are so high, unilateral action cannot be excluded. But no 
framework for it has been created. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the forthcoming talks with North Korea make rapid progress toward 
ending the North Korean weapons program, the United States should call a 
conference within the framework of the Non-Proliferation Treaty of nuclear 
states and Japan, because of its vital interests in Northeast Asia. The United 
States must stress its convictions and invite proposals, especially as the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty is coming up for review in 1995. Only after such a 
conference can it be determined whether the United States should proceed 
unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. message should be unambiguous. While the United States would welcome 
normal relations with Pyongyang and is prepared to help find alternative 
sources of energy for it, these measures cannot be extorted by a 
nuclear-weapons program. The precondition for improved relations must be full 
compliance with IAEA inspections of all sites -- whether declared or suspected 
-- an accounting for past production and a return to the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty. If North Korea begins to refuel the reactor or reprocess the plutonium, 
talks with it should be broken off and full sanctions against it sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Before any military action is implemented, another serious diplomatic effort 
is necessary. But it must have a definite time limit; it should remove, not 
entrench, the North Korean weapons program. Meantime, the President should 
prepare himself, his Administration and the American people for the possibility 
that even the most dedicated diplomacy may not succeed.

'TELEFRIENDSHIP' GENERATED SIMPSON'S WIDE APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tom Christie, Tom Christie is a contributing editor to Buzz magazine and 
also writes for Details magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson is, without question, an American sports legend. But that is not 
why 95 million Americans sat glumly before their television sets, why so many 
hurt for this man charged with the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. 
Goldman, why so many felt unsettled, even depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the greatest, most beloved athletes -- Willie Mays, Mickey Mantle, Joe 
DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Hank Aaron, Bill Russell, Bill Shoemaker -- are still 
with us, and yet none of them, had they been accused of a double murder, would 
have elicited the almost immeasurable response Simpson did. Shock, sadness, 
headlines, yes, but not national obsession. No, it wasn't Simpson's athletic 
career but what came after: It was television. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, we no longer judge our sports heroes on their athletic merits 
alone -- but on what they do afterward, how they parlay their first career into 
their second, how they play off the field and in our homes. Thus, through 
television, the hapless Bob Uecker has become a more lasting figure than most 
of the players who outshone him at the ballpark -- which was almost everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Only those athletes with considerable television exposure -- Frank Gifford, 
Arnold Palmer, Chris Evert -- could come close to Simpson for shock appeal. 
It's the alarming synergetic nature of the medium, a medium linking us -- 
individual viewers, a society, a culture -- and whoever is on the box. 
</P>
<P>
 To succeed in television, you must reach us, touch us in some fashion, 
positively or negatively. This is why personalities who exhibit both qualities, 
simultaneously, have recently found remarkable success. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simpson was nothing but positives -- he was made for TV, and it for him. 
First came the near-anonymous armored figure slicing through everything from 
UCLA defenders to the Buffalo snows -- so graceful, elegant, charismatic and 
tough. Then came another sort of beauty and charisma -- the face, style, smile, 
all atop the body of Achilles (Marv Albert this wasn't) and a past right out of 
Horatio Alger. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevermind that he was lousy at announcing at first, out of his league. 
Nevermind the on-air fumbles and slips, the language problems and the 
uncharacteristic looks that said, "Can I just step out of bounds here?" It 
didn't matter to us, because he was O.J. He kept trying, and he appeared to 
have a sense of self that suggested, if not self-effacement, the ability not to 
take himself too seriously. We like that in a person. TV does, too. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was serious, he was always serious. Well, ever since Willie Mays took 
the 13-year-old Simpson aside and said: If you do the right things, you can be 
bigger than I. (Do you suppose Mays mentioned television?) 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson did the right things. He starred at a multicultural high school. He 
starred at USC, winning the Heisman Trophy. He starred in the National Football 
League, breaking the single-season rushing record while playing for a mediocre 
team. This was the guy who said that on game days in the NFL, he felt he was 
the best-conditioned, toughest player on the field -- not the biggest by far, 
but the toughest. This was the attitude he took with him after sports -- when 
he embraced television, and television embraced him. It was, to say the least, 
a winning attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said he wanted to be thought of first as a man, then as a black man. 
People like Simpson and Bill Cosby, who embrace a society at large, must 
realize they risk losing something of themselves, not to mention alienating 
some in their own subcommunity -- but they must see a greater good. 
</P>
<P>
 No, he was no Jackie Robinson, no Jesse Jackson and no Martin Luther King Jr. 
Simpson was just a guy who managed to send his face and voice into our homes on 
Monday nights at a time when black sportscasters were virtually nonexistent, 
when black athletes were rarely able to parlay their records and battered knees 
into anything other than public relations, or worse. He was just a guy who got 
the first black-white buddy commercial gig, opposite Arnold Palmer, the Norman 
Rockwell of American sports. He was as attuned as Cosby to the importance of a 
positive image, and he was as ambitious as Cosby to personify it. 
</P>
<P>
 And he did. But where Cosby played a fictionalized surgeon and family man, 
Simpson played himself -- a football star and family man, Los Angeles-style. "I 
think I've been a good person," he told ESPN. "I've tried to act normal. 
Sometimes, you know, people give you credit just for being normal." Indeed they 
do. If until recent events Simpson seemed so skillful at controlling his image, 
perhaps it was because the image was real, and that warm, caring person on the 
screen really was Simpson. It follows, then, that our affection for him was 
real. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but it's all too easy, television. We are so easily seduced, sitting in 
our living rooms as a Simpson takes a casual, graceful run through it, and it 
does not take much for us to believe that we are extended friends, this 
stranger-who-is-not-a-stranger and us.  
</P>
<P>
 This is what TV people cultivate -- a sort of telefriendship. It works: We 
watch news and sportscasts and talk shows hosted by the men and women we like 
best, those we feel closest to. We invite them in, and they share our space, 
our intimacy. The danger for them, of course, is that we, the public, will 
someday exact a price -- claiming our rights to their space, their intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 When throngs lined the San Diego Freeway parade route, lending far more 
fanatic support to Simpson than he got as an inductee into the Football Hall of 
Fame, TV commentators clucked disapprovingly -- even as their crews were 
turning Simpson's neighborhood into a kind of contempo Day-of-the-Locust theme 
party; even as the officers trying to save his life had trouble communicating 
with him because of the noise of the television helicopters overhead. "It 
sounded like Vietnam," one said. Simpson, with one last, desperate move to 
retain his public dignity, waited for the cover of darkness to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Television, being us, is deeply flawed. It too can suddenly turn on the object 
of its greatest desire with a viciousness unimagined -- cameras that once must 
have seemed so attractive, seductive, must now look like weapons of 
destruction. Image control turns to damage control. But don't count him out: 
The real O.J. Simpson worked before, and it may work now. And too, his 
attorneys know how to win: television. Stay tuned.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; HUGH PRICE; REBUILDING THE URBAN LEAGUE -- AND THE 
INNER CITY, AS WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gayle Pollard Terry, Gayle Pollard Terry is a editorial writer for The Times 
based in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Urban League no longer has the national presence it had when Whitney M. 
Young Jr. and Vernon E. Jordan Jr. championed jobs and civil-rights for black 
Americans moving from the fields of the South to the factories of the North. 
The battlegrounds have now shifted from legally segregated schools, workplaces 
and communities to economically isolated inner cities. The Urban League has 
also lost much of its federal funding as Washington ignored the cities and 
tightened its belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh B. Price, new head of the National Urban League, must raise the profile 
of his organization, along with millions of dollars to improve the lot of poor 
blacks. Fighting poverty is as high on his agenda as fighting prejudice. Rather 
than "go hat in hand" to business and philanthropies, Price prefers to start 
with successful black Americans and then challenge others to give as deeply. 
</P>
<P>
 Price wants the millions of middle-class African Americans to contribute $500 
to $1,000 to a youth-development fund to help poor black children. Only by 
marshaling their significant resources and giving of their time, Price says, 
can affluent black Americans encourage inner-city youths. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows whereof he speaks. He and a group of 24 black men put up $17,000 to 
finance an after-school program that helps poor black boys "circumnavigate the 
potholes in their lives." The men also mentor the boys, who typically end up as 
honor students. Price wants Urban League affiliates to fund similar programs 
that help disadvantaged black youngsters, particularly adolescents, perform 
better, behave better and excel. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many traditional civil-rights leaders, Price, 52, does not come from 
the pulpit or the trenches. He is an outsider at the 84-year-old organization. 
A lawyer by training, he has also been a member of the New York Times editorial 
board and an executive at PBS. Until Friday, he managed the Rockefeller 
Foundation's domestic initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Many can afford to give in the Westchester County community where Price lives 
with his wife, Marilyn, who works for the Manpower Development Research Corp. 
They have three adult daughters. A son of the black middle class, Price is 
polished and accomplished. He will need these talents -- and all the help he 
can get -- to tackle the litany of ills in the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Is race still a barrier in 1994?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Absolutely. Race is very much a factor in American life . . . . The 
pattern of discrimination against African American (job) applicants persists to 
this day. It's true in lending practices. It's true in housing. So, yes, racism 
is still abroad in the land. It is subtler and less pervasive than before, but 
it is still a factor in American life. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other factors adversely effecting African Americans . . . . If you 
lived in the inner city 40 years ago, there was a rather thriving economy 
waiting for African Americans -- if we could break open the barriers of 
discrimination. The assumption when the Brown vs. Board of Education decision 
was handed down (in 1954) was that (the decision) would blast open the barriers 
to the opportunities that existed in the cities. What no one quite anticipated 
was that those opportunities would dry up . . . . Manufacturing work and other 
work . . . would steadily evaporate from the inner city . . . . We've had an 
out-migration of good-paying blue-collar jobs, which has taken with it 
purchasing power, work as a way of life in families, and hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Against those odds, how have African Americans prospered?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Many black Americans are as talented as everybody else. Many black 
Americans grew up in families that provide support. Many black Americans live 
in communities where school systems are quite sound. We have flooded into great 
universities all over the country. We have flooded into, and helped to build, 
the standing of many historically black colleges. Schools like Spelman and 
Morehouse rank with the best colleges in the country because the talent coming 
into those schools is stronger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 We have flooded into previously all-white campuses. When I went to Amherst 
College, in 1959, I was one among five (black) students in my freshmen class. 
Only three of us finished. I don't know how many African Americans are in the 
freshmen class this year, but it's probably 10 times that number. When I was at 
Yale Law School, I was one of seven (African-Americans) in my class. There are 
probably three or four times that now . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 We need to realize the civil-rights movement was hugely successful for a 
significant segment of our population. However, the opening up of access and 
the breaking down of barriers has not worked for people whose skill levels are 
less, or who are living in communities where the schools do not serve them well 
or in areas where the jobs have simply disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How concrete are class divisions among African Americans?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There's a real problem. We need to try to reconnect the many segments of 
our community . . . . Because of the out-migration of middle-class families 
from the inner city, because of the growing economic divisions . . . there's 
been a separation . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We have got to connect. The more you try to distance yourselves from the 
concerns of those for whom this economy does not work, the more we are learning 
you have to look over your shoulders in apprehension and fear. You can't 
separate yourself from the circumstances of those who are in pain economically, 
because the alienation of those who are in pain are trailing us wherever we go 
. . . . Carjackings . . . . crime . . . . We can't escape it. We all have to 
try to re-engage on these issues. 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans have got to re-engage on these issues. All other Americans 
have to re-engage on these issues because, if we don't, the social fabric is 
coming unglued. The quality of life in cities is deteriorating. People are 
apprehensive about walking around the streets of many American cities. Even 
those who are affluent and white are finding they cannot escape the alienation 
of folks who are living in the inner cities. I hope the Urban League will drive 
the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are your priorities?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The African American community has to take the responsibility for nurturing 
and developing our children. In the first instance, it is the responsibility of 
parents. To the extent that parents can't do that either because they are out 
working several low-wage jobs to try to get by financially or because they are 
not functioning properly, I think it is incumbent on the broader African 
American community to assume responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that, at the Urban League, we are going to press our community to take 
that responsibility not just by paying lip service but by digging into our 
pockets and putting serious money on the table to support the programs that our 
young people need . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If we can generate serious money from our community, we would then challenge 
others to match our efforts . . . . It's one thing to go hat in hand and say, 
"Please help us with our problem." It's entirely another to say we are assuming 
responsibility for this problem and not just rhetorical but financial 
responsibility; to say to local philanthropies and business we'd like you to be 
our partner. We challenge you to match us. It's a different dynamic . . . . It 
means you are proceeding whether you get help or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your focus is children?  
</P>
<P>
 A: . . . There's nobody home. Parents are working or dysfunctional. Schools 
are not open. The park department has shut down its program because cities are 
financially strapped. School systems no longer have the money to operate the 
rich array of extracurricular programs in the school buildings after school 
that I certainly knew as a child. The Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs and teams are 
not there. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'll tell you who is home. The gangs are home. The gangs and television 
have become the baby-sitters and peer groups of these young people, because 
adults who are responsible for their development have allowed a void to be 
created in their lives at the end of the school day, and that void is being 
filled by gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . If we don't create an alternative for them, we are going to continue to 
lose our kids to the streets. The African American community has got to step up 
to the plate and assume responsibility for providing that option. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Historically, the focus of the Urban League has been employment and jobs. 
Are you deviating from that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. Millions of us have progressed since the Brown vs. Board of Ed decision 
-- but millions of us have been on the down escalator. We want to focus the 
work of the league on trying to reverse the downward spiral of folks living in 
the inner city. Within that general focus, we want to speak powerfully and 
authoritatively to a broader array of issues that affect our community. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your priorities are?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The education and social development of our children to try to ensure that 
our kids have the competencies and the social graces and social skills to be 
successful in the 21st Century, and to participate in that part of the economy 
that is rising rather than declining . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Economic sufficiency for families in the inner city. The League has been 
deeply involved over the years in job placement and job training. We need to 
continue that work. We also need to devote more attention to the related, and 
the larger question of whether our economy is creating enough jobs and whether 
those jobs pay enough to allow people to live in dignity with a decent standard 
of living. 
</P>
<P>
 This country is in deep denial about whether or not we create enough jobs. The 
labor market in the inner city is broken. The market economy works marvelously 
for the vast majority of Americans, but it is breaking down at the margins. 
It's not creating enough jobs, and those jobs that are being created have 
little future and pay such lousy wages that people, even if they work, live in 
poverty . . . . The evaporation of decent-paying jobs has fueled the decay in 
the physical conditions of the inner city. It's undercut the family, because 
the male providers feel inadequate and they aren't able to work. They don't 
bond with those with whom they have relationships, and they don't stay in the 
household. And it has undercut the young people's abilities to dream and see 
over the horizon of their immediate environment. We have got to focus on 
reconnecting folks who live in the inner city to the world of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We may need to do that through using need-based job set-a-sides, not 
race-based job set-a-sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Affirmative action for poor people?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes . . . if we expect cities to prosper, folks who live in the inner city 
have to participate in the mainstream economy . . . . If the market economy 
doesn't create enough jobs for everyone who is expected to work, what is 
society going to do about this? We don't want them languishing on welfare. 
That's the whole point of the welfare-reform legislation that's been proposed . 
. . . Are we going to create jobs that the public values that poor people can 
perform? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And race?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I have an uncompromising commitment to racial inclusion. We live in a 
robustly multicultural world, and society and cities. That's not going to 
change, so all people who inhabit that space have got to be prepared to work 
together, function together and coexist. I don't know if you have seen the play 
that Anna Deavere Smith did (on the Los Angeles riots) called "Twilight." The 
stunning thing was the absence of a common language, common dreams, common 
tongues across the various people and ethnic groups that were portrayed there. 
There is no common experience, no shared aspirations, no language, even, to 
converse together. 
</P>
<P>
 If we don't watch it, Bosnia awaits us -- to put the worst-case spin on it. If 
we don't watch it, then South-Central awaits more cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does the Fourth of July symbolize to you?  
</P>
<P>
 A: If there is anything July 4th ought to symbolize to me it is a rededication 
to the proposition that we are all in this society together, and we have got to 
make it work as a common American people even as we respect our heritage and 
respect our differences. We have got to learn to work together, coexist 
together, dream together and prosper together, because if we don't, the 
alienation of those of us who are outside will undercut everything that others 
dream of achieving. If there is one story of what is happening to American 
cities, it is the fact that the isolation of the inner city and folks who live 
in poverty is undercutting the quality of life for everybody. We've got to 
include everybody, regardless of race or poverty, in the broader society.

VOTING DOWN BOND ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Peiser suggested that our public finance is in a mess ("California 
Votes No on the Future," Commentary, June 23) and concludes: "It is time to 
call for a state initiative, sponsored at the highest levels of government, to 
reform California's public finance system . . . one empowered to challenge our 
most sacred cows: Proposition 13, the percentage of votes required to pass bond 
issues and the referendum process. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 There is now pending in the California Supreme Court a case in which there is 
a challenge to Section 4 of Prop. 13. (The case will not affect the property 
tax provisions of Prop. 13.) Section 4 requires a two-thirds vote for certain 
kinds of non-property taxes. In that challenge, the Supreme Court is being 
asked to rule that Section 4 is either unconstitutional or should be limited to 
measures which directly or indirectly increase only property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Prop. 13, the voters have defeated several constitutional amendments 
which were intended to require a two-thirds vote on all new taxes. It is clear 
that the electorate would not have voted for Section 4 of Prop. 13 if it had 
been severed from the property tax provisions and considered separately. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge also involves the referendum process of Prop. 62. That 
proposition requires a vote on all new taxes that are not covered by Prop. 13. 
It has been held to be unconstitutional by the Court of Appeal but the Supreme 
Court has never ruled on it. This case asks the Supreme Court to rule it 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was brought by the Santa Clara County Local Transportation Commission 
after a new one-half cent sales tax was challenged by the Howard Jarvis and 
Paul Gann associations and various individuals. If the Supreme Court follows 
the apparent intent of the electorate, we will not need Peiser's proposed 
initiatives.

 * In response to the Peiser article, on the contrary, those California voters 
are concerned about the future of the state. The bonds were voted down 
precisely for one of the reasons Peiser mentioned. There is weakness in the 
state's public finance system. 
</P>
<P>
 Prop. 13 is fundamental to a sound California system. It sets limits and 
guidelines, which are being arbitrarily circumvented by bureaucrats instilling 
creative financing ideas into "gullible' local officials and state legislators. 
Instead of calling Prop. 13 "a sacred cow" needing challenges, what the 
California taxpayers need is a new system. Income, sales, use, and property 
taxes, etc., should be more closely tied to the public service functions -- for 
direct accountability. The voters see their sales taxes (i.e., Prop. 172) not 
going for tangible, quality services as was promised. Education, under the 
mandate of Prop. 98, should not be dependent, nor based upon, local property 
taxes. Local taxes should be for property-related services, first and foremost. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Let us have no more state shell games, or local assessment/fee schemes. Let us 
get our Legislature to redefine the revenue structure of the state and the 
constitutional responsibilities of various levels of government. Then, as taxes 
are collected for the public services, each level of government can be 
responsible and accountable to its constituents for the quality of the service 
deliveries.

tax rate above 9%, sales tax above 8%, and property tax above 1% and the 
Legislature still wants more money to provide what should be basic government 
services. I did not vote against public investment, I voted against what I 
perceive as the Legislature's inability to set priorities. I have not lived any 
other place (including New York City), where the general public has so little 
to show for its tax dollar (except for the best tax-subsidized special-interest 
groups). Sacramento should remember what happened the last time the public 
acted against "taxation without representation."

JAMES JOYCE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "James Joyce, Hibernian and Cybernaut," by Brian Stonehill, Commentary, 
June 16: 
</P>
<P>
 When the great Irish playwright Brendan Behan was asked what he thought of 
James Joyce, he often replied, "What do you think of yourself?" The works of 
Joyce, especially "Ulysses," are about everyman, the imprisoned and the free. 
</P>
<P>
 Each man is imprisoned by physical realities, but is free to create and 
explore by introspection, communication, both spoken and written, and deeds of 
action.As Stonehill reminds us, Joyce communicates in "Ulysses" a myriad of 
information colors that apply to contemporary cybernetics. 
</P>
<P>
 Shackled by the limitations of the physical presence, Joyce attempts to move 
beyond the known and the obvious by probing the brain and manipulating language 
that evokes thought. He is attempting to discover, and in a way communicate, 
the spiritual essence of man. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did Joyce decide to write and embark upon fictional odysseys? He had to, 
because he was an artist and buried deep in his subconscious and at the core of 
his thinking were the merging rivers of transcending Celtic mysticism and 
Irish-Catholic thought. His constructs were great platforms and ships employed 
to sail into the murky waters of the unknown. It is a voyage we will all take. 
But Joyce has given us a glimpse, a view of the transcendental like no other 
writer who has ever lived. We should all celebrate Bloomsday, because we 
celebrate ourselves.

PROMISE KEEPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The goal of Promise Keepers is "to strengthen the family and restore the 
nation by exhorting men to become 'promise keepers instead of promise breakers' 
" ("Teaching Patriarchs to Lead," June 19). If men in America decide to make 
their families their highest priority, according to critics, we now must fear 
that this will lead to political activism.Apparently, political activism is 
acceptable only within the framework of the liberal agenda. If Christian men 
decide to exercise their constitutional right to participate in the local or 
national political arena, something sinister is afoot. 
</P>
<P>
 California just had an embarrassingly low turnout for a primary election. I 
hope more men take the message of Promise Keepers to heart. Perhaps then we can 
slow the moral decline of our nation.

PACIFIC RIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The World Report of June 7 gave readers an excellent review of Pacific Rim 
trade. While it is true that Rome and China were trading via the Silk Road by 
200 BC, seaborne trade also began over segments of the route from Europe to 
Japan.Trade became a regular activity from the Red Sea and Persian Gulf via the 
Indian Ocean to India; then, from India to Southeast Asia, and from Southeast 
Asia north to China and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the volume of seaborne trade grew significantly as navigators 
learnedto make effective use of the monsoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do politicians and traders look on the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean as 
if they were separated by an impregnable land mass? Through the numerous 
straits and seas there is a continuous expanse of water. For the various 
countries and islands these waters represented a superhighway for the exchange 
of commodities, information and cultures, as well as furnishing a unifying 
force.

WORLD CUP GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I take great exception to your article ("Soccer, Schmoccer," June 26) in which 
your reporter pokes fun at Americans who find soccer boring. What's so great 
about a bunch of men in short pants running up and down a field kicking a ball? 
</P>
<P>
 Give me American sports any day. Is there anything more exciting than watching 
a bowling match, with announcers who whisper and spectators whose exuberance 
reaches a murmur? Does your reporter actually think that the sound of 70,000 
soccer fans screaming is more exciting than hearing 10 bowling pins falling 
over? 
</P>
<P>
 And what sport is more thrilling than golf? I would rather spend two hours 
watching someone in knickers chase a tiny ball around a park than waste a 
minute watching the World Cup. As for suspense, my heart almost stops when I 
see a golfer getting ready to putt, especially when he crouches to count the 
blades of grass between his ball and the hole. I get goose bumps just thinking 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, nothing can match the excitement of the greatest game ever 
devised by the human mind: baseball. Where else can one experience the thrill 
of watching eight of nine offensive players sitting in a dugout? Or the 
incredible suspense of pitcher, catcher and manager having a conference on the 
mound? Indeed, the most breathtaking event in all of sports is a pitchers' duel 
because it gives fans the chance to spend three hours watching a center fielder 
scratch himself. Baseball is so exciting it has been adopted by the Japanese, 
Cubans and little boys in Taiwan. Can soccer match that? 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer is also un-American because it is a threat to the free-enterprise 
system. With no timeouts, concessionaires will be forced out of business. If 
soccer becomes a major sport in the United States it will signal the return of 
communism.

COLUMN RIGHT / MICHAEL M. BERGER: PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE RIGHTS, TOO; THE SUPREME 
COURT REAFFIRMS THAT THEIR PUBLIC ENTITIES CANNOT CAVALIERLY TOSS OUT THEIR 
INTERESTS IN FAVOR OF THE COMMUNITY'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL M. BERGER, Michael M. Berger is a land-use lawyer in Santa Monica 
who has argued constitutional cases in the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of 
property owners. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court stuck a sharp pin into land-use regulators. In Dolan 
vs. City of Tigard, the court placed severe restrictions on the ability of 
local government agencies to demand "gifts" of land as conditions for 
permission to develop other land. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the case involved a small town in Oregon, the ruling in late June 
will have far greater impact in California, where this practice of extorting 
(the Supreme Court's word for it) property is rampant. Aggressive government 
agencies and a strident environmental movement have created a vigorous and 
insistent system of land-use regulation in California that is legendary 
throughout the country. California's courts have shown great deference for 
whatever the regulators want to do. Years ago, the dean of governmental 
land-use lawyers suggested that a California property owner, instead of 
challenging a regulation in a state court, should simply slit his throat. It 
would be quicker, cheaper and easier -- and lead to the same result. 
</P>
<P>
 Florence Dolan wanted only to expand her electrical and plumbing supply store. 
Instead of occupying 10,000 square feet of her 70,000-square-foot lot, the 
store would cover 17,000. The city agreed to issue the permit, but only if 
Dolan gave the city 7,000 square feet of land to increase the capacity of a 
creek, install a "greenway" along the creek and build a bike path. The city's 
justifications were that the increased size of the store could increase traffic 
and the need for flood control, which these improvements might alleviate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court concluded that, if a city is going to take someone's land, 
firmer justification than that is needed in order to avoid the constitutional 
command to pay just compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pragmatically, the court affirmed the basic rule that property cannot be taken 
without payment. To permit government to do otherwise, the government must 
satisfy the burden of proving that the project proposed by the property owner 
would actually cause significant problems for the rest of society, which the 
land demanded as a "gift" would actually alleviate. The city had not proved 
that its justifications were genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Audubon Society probably best captured the impact of the 
new decision when he complained that "this is an extraordinary intrusion by the 
court into the authority of local government. It elevates the interests of 
property owners over the interests of the community as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, what the decision does is enforce a protection that has been part of 
our constitutional heritage. The Fifth Amendment has always "elevated" the 
interests of individuals over those of society -- that's what the Bill of 
Rights is all about. The First Amendment, for example, has been used to protect 
the rights of nude dancers, flag burners and political protesters of all 
stripes. What the Supreme Court said expressly in this case is that the Fifth 
Amendment rights of property owners are entitled to no less protection than the 
First Amendment rights of adult theaters, draft protesters and newspapers. If 
that "elevates the interests of property owners over the interests of the 
community as a whole," it is high time. 
</P>
<P>
 Local governments and environmental activists have gotten used to treating 
property owners who need development permits as convenient fish in a barrel. 
The property owners' desire to do more than stare at their land has emboldened 
regulators to extract increasingly punitive "gifts" of property (or cash in 
lieu of property) in exchange for development permits. Often, the price 
demanded as ransom bears little, if any, relationship to the project proposed 
by the property owner. The process has been used widely by local governments to 
obtain substantial parcels of property. Without payment. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this game which the Supreme Court has said must end. The rights to life, 
liberty and property are protected by the same constitutional provision. None 
can cavalierly be tossed aside because it has suddenly become politically or 
environmentally correct to preserve some parcel of swamp, desert or shrub land. 
The issue is ends and means. Most Bill of Rights cases are reduced to that 
common denominator. Our Constitution proclaims that the property of private 
citizens will not be taken from them unless they receive compensation. 
Regardless of the reason for the seizure. The Supreme Court has reaffirmed the 
continuing force of that concept. It is now up to the rest of us to respect it. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city of Tigard wants Dolan's land badly enough, it can buy it. The same 
goes for California communities that have acted in similar fashion.

'BATTERED MEN' SYNDROME IS A MYTH; ABUSE: WHILE THERE ARE HUSBANDS WHO ARE 
VICTIMS, THE CLAIMS OF HUGE NUMBERS ARE BASED ON FAULTY RESEARCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILDRED DALEY PAGELOW, Mildred Daley Pagelow, an adjunct research professor 
of sociology at Cal State University, Fullerton, has studied woman-battering 
and other forms of violence in the family for 18 years. She is the author of 
Woman-Battering: Victims and Their Experiences (Sage Publishers, 1981) and 
Family Violence (Praeger, 1984). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, the myth of the "battered husband syndrome" has generated 
confusion in the minds of the public confronted by the news that a national 
sports hero had battered and terrorized his wife over a span of years. O.J. 
Simpson himself raised the issue when he stated in his "farewell" letter, "At 
times I have felt like a battered husband or boyfriend, but I loved her." 
</P>
<P>
 When the issue of husband-battering was first raised in a 1977 professional 
paper, the media sensationalized it, because the idea of men suffering abuse at 
the hands of "the little woman" is contrary to role expectations. Now, some 
writers have again taken hold of that notion to claim that "domestic violence 
is the responsibility of both men and women," similar to earlier claims that 
rape was the responsibility of the victim as well as the perpetrator. In 
capsule form, here is a summary of what is known and accepted as fact by the 
vast majority of researchers, scholars and professionals in the field: 
</P>
<P>
 * Criminal justice statistics (the latest from 1992) consistently show that 
about 90% of the perpetrators of violent crimes are men. Women convicted of 
violent crimes are frequently those who aided and abetted male partners. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scientific research and public agencies (such as the Department of Justice) 
have concluded that 95% of victims of domestic violence are female. 
</P>
<P>
 * About two-thirds of spousal homicides are committed by husbands, (according 
to sociological studies). Researchers have found "when women kill, they are far 
more likely than men to be responding to, rather than initiating, violence." 
</P>
<P>
 * Extensive analysis of child-abuse studies and statistics for my book "Family 
Violence" shows that men are the primary physical abusers of children; women 
are the primary physical neglectors of children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Analysis of the original claims raised in 1977 revealed that they were based 
on evidence taken out of context; data were added, altered or eliminated, and 
generalizations were introduced as fact. (Among the author's more frivolous 
examples of "battered husbands" were comic strip characters from "Maggie and 
Jiggs" and the "Katzenjammer Kids.") In the 17 years since that claim was made, 
not one study has used a scientific sample of battered husbands as has been 
done in studies of battered wives. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the claims made in 1977 were based in large part on a research 
instrument that was unable to support them because it only counted numbers of 
acts reported by men and women not married to each other, but failed to measure 
the context in which they occurred: There were no data about who struck the 
first blows, whether they were in self-defense, nor the damage inflicted. There 
were other serious defects in the questionnaire that have been soundly 
denounced by many researchers in this country and abroad. All other research 
using this flawed research produces equally misleading conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not meant to be an indictment of all men, but only to set the record 
straight about misleading information being spread in the aftermath of the 
tragic death of Nicole Simpson. Many men are gentle, kind and loving to the 
women in their lives. To these men, loving does not mean possession, domination 
and control. Indeed, some men are victims of their wives' violence. These men 
also deserve to live lives free of pain and abuse. However, there is a 
difference in the amount of terror and intimidation they suffer, and they 
usually know that they can walk out the door without being physically 
restrained. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has not been a single scientific study of a sample of battered 
husbands, there have been a multitude of studies on wives who fight back. 
Almost without exception, researchers found extreme differences in the amount, 
type and severity of violence used by men and women. Not only are wives more 
seriously injured than husbands, wives less frequently use severe violence. Men 
usually initiate the violence and are more likely to engage in multiple 
assaults. Validity checks of self-reports found that women tend to exaggerate 
their own acts of violence while men tend to minimize theirs and blame factors 
other than themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The overwhelming evidence suggests that women who fight back do so for 
purposes of self-defense. It is long past time that the pseudo-issue of the 
"'battered husband syndrome" be laid to rest.

COLUMN LEFT / JONATHAN FREEDMAN: CIVIL RIGHTS -- THE GRAYING OF A '60S DREAM; 
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION HAS FOUNDERED ON RACIAL AND ECONOMIC DIVISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN FREEDMAN, Jonathan Freedman is a writer in San Diego. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty years after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a young black man 
is more likely to be arrested than hired. The thrust of affirmative action, to 
help minorities get jobs, has given way to repressive measures to put them in 
prison. And racism and tribalism, rising among minorities as well as whites, 
have supplanted the ideal of a colorblind society. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere along the road to equality, the underlying faith in law to liberate 
people from oppression was lost in the rancorous conflict over racial quotas. 
Now America has embraced a new-found faith in punitive laws, like California's 
"three strikes," that make it easier for young minorities to spend life in 
prison rather than in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Affirmative action did not cause this backlash, but the hopes it raised -- and 
dashed -- played a part. In the 1960s, idealistic Americans believed that 
whites should pay for the oppression of the past by giving minorities a leg up. 
But by the 1980s, complaints over so-called reverse discrimination spawned a 
Bakke-to-bigotry counter-revolution against affirmative action. In the economic 
decline of the 1990s, blue-collar whites feel like an endangered species and 
sullenly resent concessions for minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a good law that gave entitlements a bad name. 
Title II, barring segregation in public facilities, was enormously successful 
in smashing Jim Crow laws separating the races in the South. Title VII, setting 
hiring goals and timetables, helped integrate many government agencies and 
private corporations. But Title VI, barring discrimination in programs that 
receive federal funding, failed utterly to fulfill its promise.  
</P>
<P>
 The most controversial civil-rights provision, affirmative action, recruits 
minorities for jobs in traditional white bastions, such as fire stations. But 
resistance against it was skillfully manipulated to recruit disgruntled whites 
into a conservative coalition that undermined integration and shoved minorities 
deeper into poverty. As a result, the minority unemployment rate is higher now 
than in 1964, and has stubbornly remained twice as high as white unemployment 
for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Socially, affirmative action provided a vehicle for advancement -- the black 
middle class doubled in size -- but with the hidden stigma of entitlement. 
Economically, it favored those who received higher education and pursued 
professional careers over those who dropped out of school and took menial jobs. 
Affirmative action helped a minority of blacks and Latinos to move up while 
leaving the rest further behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically for working stiffs, affirmative action opened up jobs in smokestack 
industries doomed to extinction by the post-industrial revolution. They entered 
the door only to find the factory was being shut down and the job shipped 
overseas.  
</P>
<P>
 Unskilled black and Latino workers were the hardest hit by the shift from a 
society that made real things -- and paid living wages -- to one geared to 
virtual production. Many gave up looking for jobs and fell into the anti-social 
behaviors characteristic of unemployed people, targeting them for harsh 
punishment by police, courts and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's backlash against civil rights eerily echoes the post-Civil War period. 
The 1860s, like the 1960s, were a time of progressive change when slavery was 
abolished and blacks were given equal protection under the law. But Southern 
whites increasingly disregarded the newly won rights of black Americans, and by 
the 1880s, de jure discrimination had returned. In 1883, the Supreme Court 
forbade Congress from outlawing racial discrimination practiced by individuals; 
in 1896, in Plessy vs. Ferguson, the court permitted "separate but equal" 
accommodations for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 A century later, white America is turning its back on integration, and even 
circumspect blacks are favoring separatism. Our sagging commitment to civil 
rights is embodied by figures in prison denims. For every complaint of 
discrimination filed with the Commission on Civil Rights, a hundred criminal 
charges are filed against minorities. Progress has been arrested literally in 
the persons of youths rounded up because police suspect their color. 
Individuals may be guilty of unlawful acts, but a whole generation is being 
scapegoated for America's failure to live up to the 1960s' hope of affirmative 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 A civil-rights law alone cannot free people from discrimination if the spirit 
of the public is bitter and hate-filled -- or simply indifferent. As lawmakers 
inflated with demagoguery enshrine the ugly mood of fear and resentment into 
repressive laws, the only consolation is that the spirit of civil rights will 
endure and flourish once again -- if today's backlash doesn't totally condemn 
the next generation.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE PALESTINIANS; THE FRUITS OF PEACE COME INTO VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NABIL SHAATH has been the PLO's chief negotiator with the Israelis. He was 
interviewed Thursday in Cairo by Stanley Sheinbaum, publisher of New 
Perspectives Quarterly. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: How does it feel to have Yasser Arafat returning to Palestine in 
this very dramatic way? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Arafat always operates with this sense of drama and surprise. Now the 
moment we have been waiting for so long has arrived. His visit has stirred on 
the ground, in Gaza, a great sense of hope, the sense of a new beginning. After 
such a long struggle, there is finally some happiness, some satisfaction and a 
sense of achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: While the militant Muslim Hamas organization, which rejects the 
Gaza-Jericho accord, has been making threatening noises in Gaza about Arafat's 
leadership, they have also now said they will avoid violence. Is this a sign 
that they are coming around? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. Having just been in Gaza, my sense is that Hamas and all the rest of 
the opposition has decided that the people are so happy about this agreement 
and its potential. Hamas and the other organizations had to acquiesce because 
they themselves enjoy the fruits of the agreement, in particular the freedom 
that was brought on by the entry of the Palestinian police. They are free from 
fear and have the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. 
Gaza is now an open society, almost totally free from any oppressive measures 
by the authorities. Their acquiescence has made it easier for Arafat to enter 
Gaza and start exercising his authority and fulfilling his dream. The price 
they have exacted in the bargain is a guarantee of their freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did Arafat decide to return at this moment? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There were several factors. The meeting I had several days ago with 
(Israeli officials) resulted in the declaration that the Israelis have decided 
to spread the Palestinian role all along the West Bank. That means we will not 
end up with Gaza, but start up with Gaza. That was the first factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor was the declaration by (Prime Minister Yitzhak) Rabin that 
Arafat was welcome in Jerusalem. The third factor was the speedup in the 
process of releasing prisoners and ending the Israeli siege of Jericho, and 
other measures that the Israelis really have been dragging their feet on 
implementing, such as a Palestinian presence at international crossings and 
starting up of safe passage so that Palestinians can go between Gaza and 
Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The Israelis have been afraid that if they engaged Arafat in discussions 
that would expand the powers of the Palestinian authority throughout the West 
Bank, then Arafat might not feel the need to go ahead with elections. 
</P>
<P>
 A: That is wrong. Arafat is fully committed, particularly now, to the election 
process. But, as the Oslo accord states, the elections will take place once the 
Israeli occupation forces withdraw from the West Bank cities and villages and 
other populated areas.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does Rabin look inside Israel as Arafat returns? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Rabin's trump card against his opposition is the success of the application 
and implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. He came out smelling like 
roses! Every one of his generals is so satisfied with the way the security 
issue has moved. They are happy about the significant reduction in violence 
resulting from the agreement and the harmonious relations that have existed all 
along between the Palestinian police and the Israeli security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 All these things I think have vindicated his arguments to his extremists and 
rightists and fundamentalist elements that the agreement with the Palestinians 
would work, that the Palestinians can fulfill what they promised, and that (it) 
can result in direct dividends for the Israelis themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the state of internal PLO and Palestinian politics as Arafat visits 
Gaza? What about those members of the PLO in the negotiating team from the 
earlier Madrid process, like Hanan Ashrawi, who broke away, feeling that Arafat 
had not held out for enough? Is there a unification process going on now, or do 
you hold out hope for that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, this unification is in fact happening. Faisal Husseini and Hanan 
Ashrawi have come around. They either have talked with us in Gaza on the phone 
or came and visited Gaza to celebrate our success and to join hands to really 
produce an immediate resumption of the negotiations in which we will stand 
together. Faisal Husseini and others have accepted cabinet-minister positions 
in the new Palestinian authority. 
</P>
<P>
 I am afraid that the last to follow will be some of our intellectuals in 
America and other comfortable locations of the diaspora. People tend to get a 
more militant attitude when they are farther away from the territories. In the 
end, I am confident that they, too, will come along. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you see yourself giving up life in Cairo to go back? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I have decided to go back home to Palestine. Absolutely, there is for me no 
hesitancy about this whatsoever. I have already taken the decision to abandon 
my private business in Cairo and to become a public official totally dedicated 
to building the Palestine that, for most of my life, was only a distant dream.

WILSON PLAYING POLITICS WITH EARTHQUAKE COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Paul Clarke asks (Valley Commentary, June 19) why the people of California 
voted against the Wilson earthquake bond issue, Proposition 1A. I can't speak 
for the rest of us, but I can tell you why I voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a temporary half-cent sales tax increase in 1990 which Gov. Pete 
Wilson adopted to cover the damage from the San Francisco quake. It certainly 
accomplished its goal with a minimum financial burden on any of us. There was 
no outcry from anyone that I know of calling for the elimination of that tax. 
But then there was a broadly based objection to increasing the debt, and 
cutting deeper into needed services, by raiding our county funds again. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson canceled the tax, which would have more than covered the cost of 
retrofitting all the necessary quake-damaged structures in Southern California. 
When will he learn that playing politics with the issue just won't work, and 
that we're all willing to pay a small fee in order to feel safer in our homes 
and businesses without further damage to our vital needs?

MOBILE HOME PARKS NEED MANUAL GAS SHUT-OFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In spite of the incredible efforts of the Los Angeles Fire Department, on 
the day of the Northridge earthquake 22 beautiful double- and triple-wide 
mobile homes filled with gas exploded into flames and burned to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost 14 hours, broken gas lines all over Los Olivos Mobile Home Park 
spewed gas unchecked into the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Lines were broken as the heaving earth slammed the homes into the gas meters. 
The meter shut-offs and automatic shut-off valves were rendered useless. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager was at the park entrance within minutes to cut off utility lines 
into the park. But no one, including the firefighters and gas company field 
representatives, knew where the main gas line connection was located. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Fire Department was equipped to turn off main city gas lines but not 
to break through asphalt to locate lines. It was evening before the right gas 
company crew got to Los Olivos, located the line, broke through street asphalt 
and cut and capped the gas line. 
</P>
<P>
 In parks where gas is sub-metered into the park and a shut-off is next to the 
meter at the park entrance, main gas lines were manually turned off within 10 
minutes. That's as it should have been at Los Olivos. 
</P>
<P>
 The gas company's concern about installing automatic shut-off valves all over 
the city is, in my opinion, very reasonable. But its refusal to install manual 
shut-off valves at entrances of mobile home parks, like ours whose residents 
are direct customers of the gas company, is an unreasonable refusal. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope the Los Angeles City Council abandons the notion of mandating automatic 
shut-off valves all over the city and mandates, instead, the installation of 
manual gas shut-off valves at the entrance of every mobile home park in the 
city. Mobile home residents should never again have to endure a repeat of that 
painful and preventable gas-fed disaster.

DWP OFFICIAL SEEKS TO CLEAR AIR ON POLLUTION IMPACTS FROM ELECTRIC VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was disturbed by sections of a recent article and cartoon ("State Taking 
Wrong Road in Drive for Electric Vehicles," June 12), which inaccurately said 
that air emissions from power plants will negate the benefits of the commercial 
introduction of zero-emission electric vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, electric vehicles are 97% less polluting than conventional 
gasoline-powered cars, even accounting for air emissions from power plants that 
generate the electricity to recharge the batteries.This number is based on data 
collected by the California Air Resources Board and other air quality agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, it is important to note that the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power's four power plants in the Los Angeles Basin, including one in Sun 
Valley, produce less than one-tenth of 1% of the region's air pollution. From 
the late 1960s through the early 1990s, the DWP reduced emissions of oxides of 
nitrogen (a primary precursor to smog) from these plants by 90%, and another 
90% reduction is planned by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 We must attack the primary air pollution culprits in our region, which are 
mobile sources, including the 9 million motor vehicles driven by some 13 
million people. These sources account for two-thirds of our air pollution. 
Given these facts, it becomes clear that electric vehicles will play a very 
significant role in putting Los Angeles on the road to becoming a cleaner, 
healthier environment in which to live and a viable place to do business in the 
future.

UNCHARITABLE TIMES FOR CHARITIES; NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO REMIND 
RESIDENTS OF THEIR DEEDS, AND NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been all too apparent to charities, and perhaps to the people who 
benefit from them, that times have been extremely hard of late. Blame it on the 
recession and the lethargic recovery. Blame it on a succession of natural 
disasters that have so infringed upon our collective ability to give that 
donations have been much lower across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples abound, such as the plight of the Antelope Valley chapter of the 
American Red Cross. It is attempting to build a state-of-the-art headquarters, 
strong enough to withstand an 8.0 magnitude earthquake. The chapter has run out 
of money for the project and faces many problems in trying to raise enough 
money to finish it. 
</P>
<P>
 Another unfortunate symbol involves the United Way's North Angeles Region. The 
chapter has severely trimmed its grants to dozens of worthwhile regional 
projects, even as it attempts to respond to growing priorities in new areas of 
need. The reason? United Way officials were faced with a fourth consecutive 
year of fewer contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under such circumstances, it makes sense to take note of groups that are 
managing to swim against this tide. A case in point is the Santa Clarita Valley 
Boys & Girls Club. Officials there say that they have raised $150,000 in their 
annual auction, which is the Santa Clarita chapter's primary fund-raising 
event. That is the largest sum they have raised at the auction since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 What gives? Perhaps it is explained, in part, by the fact that people in Santa 
Clarita got to know the Boys & Girls Club there very well in January, when it 
served as an earthquake shelter for the American Red Cross. When it was time to 
consider the club's needs, people remembered its role after the quake, and they 
dug a little deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Judy Belue, director of development for the club, said that "people in 
this community believe we can prevent problems and turn some kids around. We 
had a lot of success stories to share." 
</P>
<P>
 So there may be unique circumstances in this fund-raising success story that 
would be difficult to duplicate. Still, it's important to note that the club 
has done a particularly good job of convincing people that it serves an 
important role. For children and teen-agers -- ages 7 to 17 -- it is a safe 
gathering place on weekdays and evenings. It is a place where the children of 
single parents can get tutoring and attention until those parents are free of 
their employment obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 In business, the time to maintain advertising can be the very time in which 
money seems to be tight. The same is true for groups that depend on charitable 
donations. Perhaps now is the time to remind people of the good works that they 
do.

INDECISION MAY DOOM VALLEY RED LINE PROJECT; OTHER ISSUES WILL COMPETE FOR MTA 
ATTENTION AND FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of the folks who travel to our nation's capital, Washington, D.C., are 
greatly impressed with its state-of-the-art Metrorail system, which combines 
both aboveground and underground segments. Just one part of that line is still 
incomplete and jeopardized by funding limitations. Therein lies a lesson for 
Valley residents, elected officials, and local transit authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of Washington's Green Line. When completed, it was supposed 
to run north from Prince George's County, Md., through some of Washington's 
poorest neighborhoods, and back into Maryland again. Over the course of 
construction, however, the Green Line was the one segment that was shackled 
with major disputes over where the track would be laid. The most rancorous of 
these involved where the line's southern terminus would be located. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the disputes turned to grinding legal battles. The result was that 
the Green Line still showed up on subway maps under "future construction," 
while the system's other legs were completed, or nearly so. Today, the Green 
Line still is not finished, and the rest of the system is already showing signs 
of age. It means that more transit dollars now have to be devoted to repairs 
and less to new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Now consider the Valley. There still has been no decision on where the Red 
Line extension into the west San Fernando Valley will be built, nor on what 
form that construction will take. Will it be an aboveground monorail along the 
Ventura Freeway, a subway under Chandler and Burbank boulevards, or some 
combination of aboveground and underground transportation? The proponents of 
the first two options are as firmly entrenched in their positions as ever and 
show no willingness to compromise. The debate has dragged on for years. Cost 
projections are due in August. 
</P>
<P>
 We have supported the latter idea: an extension of the subway to the San Diego 
Freeway, with consideration of an aboveground option for the remainder of the 
route. But what we also support is a decision, period -- one that comes sooner 
than anticipated, and one that is allowed to be the final word on the issue. 
Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, don't forget about the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's looming 
$126-million budget deficit. Don't forget the problem of an overly generous 
labor contract that must be scaled back to fit these difficult financial times, 
and the related threat of a strike. Don't forget the lingering effects of the 
long recession on sales tax and fare-box revenues. Don't forget that transit 
officials might feel tempted to use, for operating expenses, some of the funds 
that were earmarked for new rail projects. Don't forget cost overruns, 
misaligned subway tunnels and the need for re-excavations. Don't forget 
construction timetables that are already months out of whack because of delays. 
Don't forget the question of whether the bus routes will be shifted from the 
current grid system to a more efficient hub-and-spoke system that will take 
riders to and from the most frequently visited destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 We've probably left out an argument or two, but you get the point. The Valley 
East-West Rail Project deserves a place on that long and difficult list of 
things to do, but it won't get a proper level of attention until some agreement 
can at least be reached over where it will be built, and what form it will 
take. These days, we're having turf battles over who will inherit the 
leadership of the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 What we need is the spirit of compromise and concession, not only on the part 
of MTA officials who will choose one of the Valley East-West rail options, but 
also on the part of prospective neighbors who could further delay matters even 
after a decision has been reached. As long as there is no clear and undisputed 
decision on the East-West Rail Project, it will be easy to put the whole thing 
on a back burner.

LIES AND HALF-TRUTHS ABOUT GUNS AND CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In the Valley Perspective editorial "How Many Guns Are Enough?" (June 19) 
you offered anecdotal evidence, citing incidences involving Valley residents, 
that because there are 210 million guns in circulation, many of these guns are 
used to take innocent lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Here you are only telling one part of the whole story.The editorial failed to 
mention that of the 210 million guns in the hands of millions of Americans, 
less than 1% are ever used in crime. Two hundred and ten million guns does not 
equal 210 million deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing to perpetrate "lies by omission," your editorial says nothing of 
the 800,000 to 2 million cases of citizens using guns to defend their lives 
annually. In most cases, potential crime is thwarted with no shots being fired. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also half-truths, such as the statement that 50% of Americans want 
gun control. Yes, some people want some form of gun control, but when asked if 
they favor a total ban on guns, the answer is a resounding no. 
</P>
<P>
 And that leads to the Big Lie -- "reasonable" gun control. There is no 
reasonable gun control. Gun control is really just gun prohibition, only in 
increments. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun control and crime control are mutually exclusive. The last thing this 
nation needs is more of the failed policy of gun laws. What we need most of all 
is a criminal justice system that is no longer dysfunctional.

LOCAL POLITICS: AN UNFORGIVING GAME; PLAYING SIM CITY ON YOUR COMPUTER CAN BE 
AN EXERCISE IN FRUSTRATION. THANK GOODNESS YOU CAN TURN IT OFF, UNLIKE THE 
PLAYERS AT OUR OWN URBAN CHESSBOARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAPHAEL GARCIA, Raphael Garcia of North Hollywood is an 11th-grader at 
Oakwood School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I recently learned all about city politics by playing a computer game called 
Sim City. Then I got out. 
</P>
<P>
 Sim City is a popular game that simulates a city, with all its problems. It's 
a less painful way to govern a city than actually becoming a politician. Still, 
you learn that politics is nothing but a trap. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of Sim City is to create a prosperous city, attract new residents and 
avoid complaints. And, of course, stay in office. As mayor you make all the 
decisions, though you can ask the City Council for advice. You can play as long 
as you want to. For five months I played the latest version, which among other 
things allows you to create subways. 
</P>
<P>
 As everybody knows, the bigger a city is, the more people it attracts. And 
money comes with them. You start with a population of zero and try to make it 
grow. I got up to more than 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the things that make the city big, such as airports, cost a lot 
of money. So where is that money supposed to come from? 
</P>
<P>
 You start off with a city treasury. But that money quickly disappears as you 
have to build more buildings and roadways, maintain power plants and keep other 
vital utilities working. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for all these expenses you need money. The only way to raise money in 
Sim City is through taxes (you can't sell the airport). But the more you raise 
taxes, the more people hate you and the more they leave. 
</P>
<P>
 So how are you supposed to attract people and make the city prosperous? The 
answer is, you can't. You are on a roller coaster that seems headed permanently 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 As you sit at the console, you make all the decisions: granting permits, 
buying improvements, sweating over money. 
</P>
<P>
 But the minute you create an attractive building zone that is a beautiful area 
for people to live in, they all want to come and live there, and the area 
becomes overpopulated. Then they turn the area into a slum if you don't build 
more buildings than you wanted to, and you lose the balance between industrial 
versus residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of Sim City are never happy. They want more jobs and more hospitals 
and houses and everything, but they also want you to keep pollution low. They 
want open space and growth at the same time. They want you to build, but they 
also want you to tear down parts of the city to make roads and improve 
transportation. They want you to fight crime (everything decays into slums), 
but they don't want to pay for more police officers. There's no real answer for 
problems like that. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you become too unpopular, you're thrown out of office and you lose the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned that politics is an unforgiving game. Once you mess up, it's hard to 
get back on your feet. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recession, you can't borrow money to buy anything that could jump-start 
the economy. You have to wait for a whole year to go by to get tax money to pay 
off your debts. But, during that recession period, the more you spend on the 
city the deeper you get into debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The least painful way to get out of the recession is by raising taxes, but 
there go your popularity and your people. So then you have to raise taxes even 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of all that, there are disasters built into the game. When disaster 
strikes, you are supposed to handle it. The main expense when a disaster hits 
is reorganizing the city's main utilities. If, let's say, a big fire burns up 
one of your power plants plus a sewage treatment plant and a large industrial 
zone, you must decide whether to merely buy new ones or replace them with more 
modernized ones. Modern utilities would be more expensive in the short term but 
would help the city in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 There is such a fine line between glorious prosperity and utter chaos. And the 
way the game is played, you can't be sure what the outcome of any decision will 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 It was too much for me. I switched to a much easier game called Iron Helix. 
All you have to do is stop a robot on a spaceship from burning you to a crisp, 
then save a planet from destruction.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; THE PLACE TO TUNE IN FOR SOME REALLY WEIRD TALK; 'MEN ARE 
ADDICTED TO THE STINKING, DEGENERATE, UGLY, FILTHY LOVE OF WOMEN.' THIS BLANKET 
INDICTMENT IS DELIVERED ALONG WITH THE INFOMERCIALS ON KIEV.

 You can run from the O. J. Simpson story, but escaping from it is next to 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk shows on the Los Angeles airwaves, normally a smorgasbord of discussion 
topics, lately have been more like the International House of O. J.; the 
opinions are pretty much different flavors of the same dish: 
</P>
<P>
 * O. J. can't possibly have done it. He's too nice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Even if he did it, he has a really good explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Of course he did it. He's a man, isn't he? 
</P>
<P>
 * Even if he didn't do it, he's a bum for beating his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 * He'll probably get convicted because of the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 * He'll probably get acquitted because he's famous. 
</P>
<P>
 What can you do if you're tired of the talk, confused by the endless 
contradictory details about the murders, put off by the legal jabber by experts 
who treat the case like the World Cup instead of a search for the truth? 
</P>
<P>
 You can always listen to the Valley's own radio station KIEV in Glendale. But 
you pay a heavy price by having to listen to some really weird talk. 
</P>
<P>
 KIEV mixes its talk shows with cooking shows, repulsive infomercials and a 
smattering of other programming. The hosts that I listened to either hadn't 
heard about O. J. or were nobly refusing to acknowledge the tacky story, 
preferring to address deeper concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The colloquy began in the morning with Roy Masterson. A Christian counselor, 
he specializes in the mysteries of sex and love. "The lustier men are, the more 
of a selfish slime is in there," he explained to a divorced woman seeking 
guidance. He told a man: "You need to be saved from women." 
</P>
<P>
 Other tidbits delivered to a troubled fellow: "The female loves and ruins the 
male." "Men are addicted to the stinking, degenerate, ugly, filthy love of 
women." And "It's eating your soul out -- you glorify in your awakened senses 
and submerge and wallow like a pig!" 
</P>
<P>
 Masterson's listeners call in mostly to second his ideas. Many thank him for 
steering them toward abstinence. Some call for general advice, which he is able 
to dispense without actually hearing more than two sentences about their 
condition. One woman was having bad dreams. "You lack grace," Masterson told 
her instantaneously. He went on to rail against anger that lurks in the soul 
too shamed to face the light of day, before ringing off as she said, "Yeah, 
yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon there is Erroll Smith, who apparently studied elocution with 
Barbara Walters. Smith opened a recent forum with the question, "Who's afwaid 
of the weligious wight?" This was during a week when the Minnesota Republican 
Party passed over its incumbent to nominate a fundamentalist gubernatorial 
candidate and in a year when Pat Robertson's International Family Entertainment 
empire was trying to buy a cable channel for $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The free exchange of ideas comes to a crescendo when George Putnam takes the 
microphone. However, only one idea is being freely exchanged, namely Bill 
Clinton's moral degeneracy. In a stentorian roar that might have suitably 
announced the Ten Commandments, Putnam conducts a two-hour rumor free-for-all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gennifer Flowers," he said in a rumble so deep you almost wanted to believed 
in him. "Now there's a woman who's got her finger on what that Slick Willie's 
all about. A shame she was discredited by selling her story to the tabloids." 
</P>
<P>
 Putnam's listeners call up with charges that mix speculation with third-hand 
accounts of things being rotten in Little Rock. Could our airborne President 
have caught a whiff of KIEV the other night when he complained in the Air Force 
One phone interview about baseless personal attacks and political demagoguery 
on talk shows? Nah. 
</P>
<P>
 KIEV divides much of its remaining programming into 45-minute sales pitches. 
The commercial topics cover a spectrum, from how Kenyon's Super Nutrient 
Anti-Oxidant Pills supposedly prevent strokes to the advisability of investing 
in gold bullion to the cars on sale right now at Colonial Honda. 
</P>
<P>
 These "shows" don't include on-air discussion, of course. But they don't last 
forever. Pretty soon you get away from the marketplace and back to the 
marketplace of ideas. The problem is, it isn't clear which is more honest. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody want to talk about O. J. Simpson?

CALIFORNIA DREAMIN'; NEW PARKS, NEW IDEAS AND NEW OWNERSHIP HAVE TRANSFORMED 
THE CAL LEAGUE INTO ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IN ALL OF BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 1989 film, "Field of Dreams," main character Ray Kinsella hears a voice 
in his Iowa cornfield: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you build it, he will come." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a baseball diamond. He was Kinsella's father. The voice was right. 
Kinsella built it, and his father's ghost did show up. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny thing is, the city fathers of Adelanto, Rancho Cucamonga and Lake 
Elsinore heard that same voice a couple of years later. Only they heard it this 
way: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you build it, they will come." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the voice was right.  
</P>
<P>
 They are people, record-breaking numbers of people who are storming the gates 
of three new ballparks on the edges of Southern California's urban sprawl. All 
three cities are California League baseball towns.  
</P>
<P>
 For decades, it seemed, the California League was played out in a collection 
of old, tired parks in places like Stockton, Salinas and Modesto.  
</P>
<P>
 The league's Northern Division still has old, traditional minor league parks, 
but not the Cal League's jazzed-up Southern Division. Maverick Stadium at 
Adelanto, home of the High Desert Mavericks; the Epicenter at Rancho Cucamonga 
and the Diamond at Lake Elsinore are the crown jewels of a renaissance league. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider:  
</P>
<P>
 -- In their first season in the 6,100-seat Epicenter last season, the Rancho 
Cucamonga Quakes set a Cal League attendance record of 331,005 with a last - 
place club. This year, the team is a contender and is on pace to draw 380,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last season, the Quakes outdrew all but two Class A teams in North America 
and all but one AA team. Most triple-A teams would love to draw like the 
Quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Lake Elsinore, in its first season, the Lake Elsinore Storm is drawing 
just under 5,000 a game in its brand new Diamond.  
</P>
<P>
 -- At Adelanto, in the oldest of the new Cal League parks, Maverick Stadium is 
in its fourth year and the Mavericks are drawing more than 2,500 fans a game.  
</P>
<P>
 The little parks are clean, spacious and comfortable. And they aren't cheap. 
Lake Elsinore's cost roughly $19 million, and the Epicenter, which is the main 
facility in a softball-baseball-soccer complex, cost $20 million.  
</P>
<P>
 The Diamond, with its 6,800 seats, features a sunken diamond, and its roofed 
concourse, in the style of Camden Yards Stadium in Baltimore, evokes a 
turn-of-the century railroad station theme.  
</P>
<P>
 Maverick Stadium seats 5,800, has bright red and blue seats and an 
architectural style -- an above-the-seats concourse -- similar to Elsinore's 
Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 And take note, Al Davis, all three of these minor league parks also have a 
feature the Coliseum doesn't -- suites. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this season, a recent check showed Rancho Cucamonga averaging 5,700 a 
game, Elsinore 4,811 and High Desert 2,591. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Cucamonga, population: 113,200, is in an area where 1.5 million live 
within 15 miles. Lake Elsinore, population 18,285, draws fans from southwestern 
Riverside, northern San Diego and eastern Orange counties. Adelanto, a hamlet 
of 8,517 in San Bernardino County, markets its team in the nearby desert 
communities of Victorville, Lancaster and Palmdale.  
</P>
<P>
 And what marketing these teams do. Says Cal League President Joe Gagliardi, "I 
saw a stat that indicated 50% of the people who live in Elsinore have been to 
at least one Storm game, and that's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds at all three parks show the teams and parks are attracting every 
component of their communities, from Little Leaguers to dating teens to parents 
and grandparents.  
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, a stadium building boom is underway in minor league baseball, 
similar to that of the major leagues, where new parks have appeared in 
Arlington, Tex.; Baltimore, Chicago and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1985, 55 new minor league parks have been built," said Larry 
Wiederecht, information director for the National Assn. of Professional 
Baseball Leagues.  
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening with attendance in those three Cal League cities is typical. 
A new Class A league park went up in Hickory, N.C., in 1992 and attendance went 
up 577%. The lowest attendance increase we show for a team with a new park is 
19%." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Stickney bought the San Bernardino Spirit in 1986 for $250,000, and moved 
the team to Rancho Cucamonga last year. Today, he says, you couldn't buy his 
team for $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Cucamonga made only one mistake with its new park -- it didn't build it 
big enough. The original design was for 3,500 seats, but that was quickly 
raised to 6,100 when season-ticket requests started pouring in before the park 
was completed. Now, playing regularly before capacity crowds, the Epicenter may 
be enlarged by 2000 seats for next season. All three teams pay about $50,000 a 
season in rent to play in the new stadiums.  
</P>
<P>
 California League baseball is an owner's delight. Principal reason? Low 
overhead.  
</P>
<P>
 Class A baseball is where young, newly signed players are sent to learn how to 
play professional baseball. The Quakes are a San Diego Padre affiliate, and the 
Padres pay Stickney's player salaries, which range from $1,000 to $1,200 a 
month.  
</P>
<P>
 "The beauty of our division is that we have bare minimum travel expenses," he 
said. "Our longest road trip is an hour by bus, so we commute to all our away 
games. Our only true road trips are when we go to Northern Division cities." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal League Southern Division: Riverside, Rancho Cucamonga, San Bernardino, 
High Desert, Lake Elsinore. Northern Division: Modesto, San Jose, Bakersfield, 
Stockton, Central Valley (Visalia). 
</P>
<P>
 Stickney brags that a family can go to one of his games and spend less money 
than it would at the movies. Tickets are $3 to $6, parking $2. The team sold 
3,000 season tickets, at $225 to $350 each. 
</P>
<P>
 And the fans keep coming, win or lose.  
</P>
<P>
 "At the Class A level, winning and losing doesn't seem to have much to do with 
attendance," said Stickney, who also owns the Las Vegas Stars of the triple-A 
Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
 "It matters at triple-A, but not here," he said. "Fans here understand these 
are very young kids, just learning how to play. They see the kids playing hard, 
and they're forgiving. But at triple-A, it's different. Players there are 
expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal with the Quakes this season is 380,000. We'll be lucky to do 380,000 
at Las Vegas, which is what we did last year and only Albuquerque (in the PCL) 
outdrew us." 
</P>
<P>
 Stickney said that besides player and staff salaries, the Padres pay for the 
Quakes' uniforms, bats and balls. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the formula for success in owning a minor league franchise is to find 
a city roughly an hour's drive from the nearest major league stadium and one 
that's eager to build a modern facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It works because you're providing an alternative to a guy who doesn't want to 
drive his family 50 miles on the freeway near rush-hour time when he can see 
baseball in a place like this that's closer and much cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, I've always felt Thousand Oaks would be an ideal Cal League 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 Another plus: Class A fans spend proportionately more money on souvenirs than 
do major league spectators, according to Stickney.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our fans are spending money on souvenirs (caps, shirts, jackets) 25% to 50% 
above their ticket costs, which is above the major league average," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Cal League President Gagliardi said other communities have seen the crowds at 
Rancho Cucamonga, Adelanto and Lake Elsinore, and have also heard the voice: 
"If you build it, they will come."  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hearing from about a dozen groups now who are interested in obtaining 
franchises," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "A Camarillo-Oxnard group has money ready to build a park. So does 
Oceanside-Carlsbad." 
</P>
<P>
 The league's squeaky clean, new parks have suddenly endangered old, 
traditional parks.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've told some of our cities that if stadium improvements aren't made, we'll 
have to move some teams," Gagliardi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stockton's locker rooms are atrocious. Modesto's park is very old. San 
Bernardino has the same problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Cucamonga's wildly successful romance with minor league baseball may 
spark ventures into other sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Cucamonga city officials are looking at a plan to build a 6,000-seat 
indoor arena near the Epicenter for recreational ice skating but it would also 
serve as a venue for minor league basketball and hockey teams.  
</P>
<P>
 The Epicenter's horizons, too, are expanding. Crowds of 10,000 can be 
accommodated for music concerts, and a plan is afoot to hold pro boxing shows 
there, too.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this is really getting away from our plot line. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the voice in the cornfield didn't say anything about hockey.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; FUNDAMENTALS REMAIN SOLID, DESPITE PLUNGING TV RATINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I love this game (anyway): This is the last week of this column, if not 
professional basketball as we know it, so we have a lot to cover. 
</P>
<P>
 State of the league -- Despite the mud-wrestling finals, TV ratings falling to 
pre-Michael Jordan levels and the threat of a strike, the fundamentals remain 
solid. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance is near 90% of capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Franchise prices are skyrocketing. Toronto and Vancouver are coming in for 
$125 million. Someone just offered $152 million for the Minnesota Timberwolves. 
Magic Johnson bought into the Lakers, assuming the value of the franchise at 
about $225 million -- $57 million more than Financial World magazine estimated 
two months ago and $40 million more than any sports team has ever been sold for 
($185 million for the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles). 
</P>
<P>
 The league gets a tremendous marketing push from the NCAA tournament, which 
turns incoming rookies into stars before they arrive; from athletic shoe 
companies, whose commercials turn withdrawn young men like Alonzo Mourning into 
TV personalities; from the Olympics, which give its players two weeks of 
star-spangled exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 But problems are mounting, some of them inevitable by-products of prosperity, 
all of them demanding attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The game is slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 The once-gregarious superstars are being replaced by a new crop of punks. 
Free-spirited powers like the '80s Lakers and Celtics are being replaced by 
walled-off programs run by control-freak coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The league that has never had a work stoppage is advancing on one at flank 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, if you'd have asked how the league was doing, the answer would 
have been: "Never been better." 
</P>
<P>
 This spring it would be: "It's been better." 
</P>
<P>
 Labor relations -- Never been worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The collective bargaining agreement has expired and thePlayers Assn. is 
showing its teeth at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The union just out-flanked the league, getting a temporaryrestraining order 
that bars teams from signing players until July 8,when a judge may A) continue 
the freeze until a new labor contractis signed, B) throw out the salary cap and 
all the rules until anew contract is signed, or C) extend the current rules 
until a newcontract is signed. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's A or B, it's a big victory for the players. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the owners may be so upset, they may refuse to opennext season 
without a contract and lock the players out. 
</P>
<P>
 State of the Mike -- There are growing indications that Jordan wantsto return 
. . . but may have nothing to come back to. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Reinsdorf runs the Bulls as a hobby but the White Sox ashis real 
passion. He is a pariah in the NBA after suing the league to televise games on 
a superstation -- he once joked that all league votes are 26-1 -- but a power 
in baseball, where he's sometimes called the "shadow commissioner," the real 
power behind Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinsdorf has gone from renting at Chicago Stadium to co-ownership of the new 
United Center, has a waiting list for season tickets, has leased his luxury 
boxes for five years and is reportedly unconcerned about the Bulls' plight. 
They are expected to lose free agent Horace Grant and last week agreed to trade 
Scottie Pippen for Shawn Kemp until Seattle owner Barry Ackerley got spooked by 
Sonic fans' angry reaction and pulled the plug. 
</P>
<P>
 At the draft, General Manager Jerry Krause told Bulls' fans the only Chicago 
uniform they would ever see Jordan in would have "White Sox" on it. Reinsdorf 
is suspected of putting the fix in for Jordan to come up, regardless of how 
badly he's doing -- last week he was batting .198 in double-A -- to hype 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's just say the situation is fluid but Reinsdorf isn't among the leaders 
for executive of the year in either baseball or basketball. THEY MADE OUT IN 
THE DRAFT . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee Bucks -- At worst, Glenn Robinson will be good, at best the next 
Larry Bird. Eric Mobley, an athletic 6-foot-10, 260-pound center dropped to No. 
18 when the Nets took their flyer on Yinka Dare and Don Nelson took on the 
Cliff Rozier headache. With 6-11 Vin Baker, Mike Dunleavy has a front line to 
build his franchise on. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Mavericks -- Jason Kidd and Tony Dumas join Jim Jackson and Jamal 
Mashburn to form a great young nucleus. The Mavericks still need big men but 
their Deon Thomas pick to start the second round was a surprise; the Illinois 
center measured only 6-7 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit Pistons -- This shows how important it is to lose enough at the right 
time. Their No. 3 pick lands the multi-talented, coachable, personable, 
could-be-awesome Grant Hill. With Lindsey Hunter, Allan Houston and Terry 
Mills, it's suddenly a nice-looking rebuilding program. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota Timberwolves -- Donyell Marshall is a big-time prospect. 
Second-round pick Howard Eisley is a point guard who can shoot. They join "the 
Brat Pack," Christian (Get Away From Me) Laettner and Isaiah (Can I Be 
Excused?) Rider. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 76ers -- Sharone Wright, 6-10 and 279, fits nicely with the 7-7 
Shawn Bradley and 6-6, 240-pound Clarence Weatherspoon. B.J. Tyler is talented 
and second-rounder Derrick Alston, a 6-9 small forward, has a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana Pacers -- They turned the 15th pick into Mark Jackson, who was a fine 
player two seasons ago before last season's Clipper depression, plus swing 
prospect Greg Minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah Jazz -- They turned Jeff Malone and the 20th pick into Jeff Hornacek, a 
Brink's job. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State Warriors -- They aren't smurfs anymore. Nelson gets the 6-10 
Rozier and 6-10 Carlos Rogers to go with 6-10 Chris Webber without having to 
trade anyone who played significant minutes last season. Rozier is a gamble but 
for years people have been carping at Nelson to relax his good-guy requirement. 
THEY HAD A GOOD DAY . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Washington Bullets -- Juwan Howard isn't quite center size but can play there 
sometimes and won't give you that I-don't-want-to-do-this-or-that song and 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Clippers -- Lamond Murray and Eric Piatkowski are nice additions at small 
forward and big guard. Of course, the Clippers have free agents Dominique 
Wilkins and Ron Harper at those positions, suggesting that the old guys may be 
history and the team has begun rebuilding without telling anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento Kings -- Good-looking power forward Brian Grant is joined by 
second-round picks Michael Smith and Lawrence Funderburke, who could have gone 
in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami Heat -- They aren't sure what to do about free agent Brian Shaw and 
they're down on Harold Miner. Point guard Steve Smith needs a good ballhandler 
with him in the backcourt and that's Khalid Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Knicks -- If Monty Williams is healthy, he's a fine pick at 24. 
Charlie Ward, supposedly a bad shooter, worked on it all spring and improved 
dramatically by the Chicago camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix Suns -- Sharpshooting Wesley Person, considered as high as the Celtics 
at No. 9, is a nice pick at 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland Cavaliers -- They traded their No. 1 pick for Tyrone Hill, who gave 
them the nasty-type guy they'd been looking for and averaged nine rebounds in 
25 minutes a game. THEY WEREN'T QUITE AS LUCKY 
</P>
<P>
 Lakers -- Jerry West keeps trying to break out of the corner he's in but he 
couldn't get a top pick for James Worthy in 1991 or 1992, nor for Vlade Divac 
this season. As baseball players say, swing hard in case you hit it. Eddie 
Jones is nice but West is looking for Magic Johnson's successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Celtics -- One day, they may look back on their Eric Montross pick and 
say this is where it all started. For the moment, they wanted someone more 
spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver Nuggets -- They were dying for Jalen (I'm about winning) Rose to get to 
them and got their wish. Rose is a take-charge guy with a lot of ability but 
doesn't have a jump shot and, though engaging, is headstrong. We'll see what 
he's about now. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland Trail Blazers -- Aaron McKie, considered by some a better prospect 
than Jones, is a nice pick at 17 but has to wait his turn behind Clyde Drexler. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando Magic -- They were ripped last spring when they traded Webber for 
Anfernee Hardaway and three No. 1 picks but it turned out to be the slickest 
move of the day. This season, though, they wasted one of those No. 1 picks on 
Anthony Avent, hoped for Ward to reach them at 27, then settled for a 
prospective backup point guard, Brooks Thompson of Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio Spurs -- They haven't been able to find one good young player to 
go with David Robinson. This spring's bet is hard-working, less-than-gifted 
Boston College center Bill Curley. They might better have rolled the dice on 
Monty Williams or taken the point guard they still don't have in Ward or 
Eisley. THEY SHOULDA STAYED HOME 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle SuperSonics -- They passed on Pippen and traded Rogers for Sarunas 
Marciulionis, preserving their four-guard rotation in which everyone complains 
he doesn't play enough. Their remaining draftpicks are a teen-ager, Dontonio 
Wingfield, and a Serb, Zeljko Rebraca. Departed general manager Bob Whitsitt is 
looking better all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulls -- They almost got Kemp and the No. 11 pick. They settled for power 
forward prospect Dickey Simpkins. Krause insisted that the SuperSonics called 
them but it didn't cut any ice with Pippen, who reportedly called Krause up and 
screamed at him. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey Nets -- They passed up Piatkowski, a shooting guard they could have 
used, for Dare who has a big up side but will require careful nurturing, if not 
outright prayer. Some organizations lack the stability for long-range projects 
and they're high on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta Hawks -- Their first-round pick went to the Clippers in the Danny 
Manning deal. Manning gives every indication he'll sign elsewhere and the Hawks 
are so scared, they took on Kenny Norman's five-year $14-million contract, even 
after that nightmare season Norman turned in at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Hornets -- Their top pick went to Seattle in that Eddie 
Johnson-and-Dana Barros-for-Kendall Gill deal that was already one-sided. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston Rockets -- Their first-rounder went in a deal four years ago. They 
didn't select until the 53rd pick and almost literally stayed home.

TENNIS / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; POSTER BOYS NOT WANTED HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Security arrangements have become a major priority at Wimbledon. Tennis 
stalkers . . . obsessive fathers . . . the possibility of terrorism -- they all 
have contributed to the increased presence of police officers and contingency 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 So skittish are officials about the arrival of so-called "problem fans," that 
photographs of the best-known offenders have been posted within the Wimbledon 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Included on the list is Jim Pierce, the father of Mary Pierce. Pierce, known 
for his abusive behavior toward his daughter, is presently banned from 
attending tour events by the Women's Tennis Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 For reasons still not entirely clear, Mary Pierce, seeded seventh at 
Wimbledon, withdrew before the tournament. Billie Jean King, former Wimbledon 
champion and now an HBO broadcaster, suggested that Pierce's departure had more 
to do with her fear of playing on grass, than the possibility of Jim Pierce 
making an uninvited appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but posters of Jim Pierce were distributed to Wimbledon security 
guards that read: "This man is banned from the grounds. Stop him from entering 
if possible. However, if sighted he must not be challenged but control must be 
informed." 
</P>
<P>
 As for King's theory that Mary Pierce ducked Wimbledon, not everyone agreed 
with the assessment. Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker, seeded seventh at 
this year's tournament, recently had dinner with Pierce. The two discussed the 
situation, specifically, Jim Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I strongly think that she had a bit of a problem with her father, and you 
know, she is a very good tennis player obviously," Becker said. "She doesn't 
have to fear nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce defeated Steffi Graf at the French Open and has been hailed as the 
newest star on a tour in need of marquee names. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite a new life for her, and you know, with having a father like that, 
what could she do really?" Becker said. "You know, everything has been so fast 
now. In about four weeks, you know, she is supposed to save the women's game 
and I think she needs time to think about the whole picture, what she wants to 
do in tennis and then she is going to be back strong." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In a mostly uneventful first-round 6-4, 6-3, loss to Larisa Neiland, American 
Katrina Adams was summoned to a post-match press conference by curious British 
tabloid reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 After an obligatory question about Adams' play, the reporters zeroed in on the 
controversy that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: "Your colorful clothing caused a little bit of a stir, I understand, 
on Court Five -- particularly your underwear. Can you tell us about that?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, an underwear expose. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' multi-colored tennis undies, called Fancy Pants, were seen early and 
often because of the blustery conditions. If they were noticeable, it was only 
because of the All England Lawn Tennis Club's strict rule regarding 
predominantly white playing wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' tennis pants were pink, green, black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's any consolation to you," the British reporter said, "we all thought 
they were very attractive anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Adams, who was making her seventh appearance at Wimbledon: "Thanks a lot. 
You saw my bottom a lot today, huh? No peeping Toms or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the fashion police found time to criticize the ultra-baggy (by 
tennis standards) shorts worn by Americans Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras in 
their respective matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi has said the shorts were designed at his request, though a Nike 
spokesman reportedly disputed the claim. Instead, Nike said Sampras first 
wanted a looser-fitting pair of shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the case, the baggies weren't much of a hit with the upper Wimbledon 
crust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Agassi looked an absolute mess," Alan Little, librarian at the Wimbledon 
museum, told the London Times. "I have never seen anyone look so scruffy on a 
Wimbledon court. I hope this doesn't start yet another fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Little has seen every male Wimbledon champion since 1950. He remains no fan of 
Agassi's court-wear tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this rate he could be in longjohns next year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The three top stories here: 
</P>
<P>
 -- World Cup 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wimbledon 
</P>
<P>
 -- O.J. Simpson 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone has an opinion, including Martina Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand her living so close to him after he beat her up so much," 
she said. "They get a divorce and she lives three blocks down. But it's a 
bizarre case, that's for sure. It's a shame that it happened, but let alone 
somebody who had a good image. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I remember when he got convicted in '89 and it was like hush hush. You 
know, it was no big deal. Like imagine if I had done that to another human 
being. It wouldn't be hush hush -- Oh, it's no big deal. People don't even 
remember that it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I think the press is to blame, not to blame for what happened, but in 
protecting a lot of the male athletes. You know, they do a lot -- not a lot of 
them, but when they do things wrong it's like they get convicted for drunk 
driving or hitting somebody, it's like no big deal because it happens all the 
time. Then something like this happens and then the whole thing goes off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shouldn't say the press is to blame, but it seems they do protect the male 
athletes a lot more than the women athletes. I can speak from personal 
experience. I don't know that one reporter asks a male (athlete), 'Are you 
gay?' I don't know one. Do you? It doesn't happen. They protect them, at least 
when it comes to that. And I've certainly had more than one ask me, 'Are you 
gay?' And I know there are gay male athletes, but they've never been asked that 
question." 
</P>

<P>
 In an effort to make ATP Tour matches more interesting to Joe Tennis Fan -- 
and maybe negate the growing number of criticisms concerning the men's game -- 
the respective Player and Tournament Councils recently announced four changes 
in policy: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Spectators, who usually are expected to keep their mouths shut, now will be 
allowed "to spontaneously react during a point as long as it is not intended to 
distract players." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The time between points will be reduced from 25 seconds to 20. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fans with seats in the upper reaches of tennis stadiums will be allowed to 
move in and out during points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Microphones will be positioned so conversations between players and 
officials can be heard by the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the changes go into effect as early as July 18, but according to Bud 
Collins, the Tennis Hall of Fame inductee who writes for the Boston Globe and 
does analysis for NBC, said the ATP Tour could have -- and should have -- done 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins wanted the ATP Tour to open the men's locker room to reporters. With 
the exception of the U.S. Open, no other tournament allows locker room access 
to journalists -- a given in almost all other major sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The better the access, Collins said, the better chance the average tennis fan 
would learn more about the players on the Tour. That might translate into more 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins also suggested that the ATP Tour put a clock on the court (a la the 
NBA's 24-second shot) for the latest time rule change. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The trickle-down effect from Jennifer Capriati's arrest could soon be seen on 
the WTA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of a Women's Tennis Council select panel have completed their research 
on age minimums for players and new rules could be instituted by next year. The 
panel's results will be released during the U.S. Open, which begins Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, players 14 and older are allowed to compete on the tour. But there 
is a movement to increase the limit to 16, maybe even as high as 17 -- partly 
because of reaction from Capriati's April arrest on marijuana possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the current minimum age standard contend that Capriati's situation 
could have been the partial result of her early entrance on the WTA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Billie Jean King, who contributed to the select panel's 
research, are less sure about the effects of raising the age limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been many 13 and 14 year olds, like Steffi Graf and Gabriela 
Sabatini, who have made the adjustment to pro life, but the media deals with 
just the exceptions," King said.

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- Directed the Los Angeles Housing Department to set 
aside $5 million annually for the development of new shelters for battered 
women, as well as the expansion of three existing shelters. Los Angeles Police 
Cmdr. John White said the goal is to have 18 shelters, one in each police 
division. Alana Bowman of the city attorney's office said the bed shortage at 
existing shelters is so severe that two-thirds of the women who seek refuge at 
them are turned away. She also said that only 3% of battered women reach out to 
a shelter. The hot line number for assistance or advice on domestic violence 
issues is (310) 392-9896. 
</P>
<P>
 * PARKING RATES -- Approved raising the daily parking rate at the downtown 
Convention Center from $5 to $6. The increase will generate an estimated 
$500,000 for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * RESTAURATEUR HONORED -- Approved a motion allowing the installation of a 
star on the sidewalk in front of Lucy's El Adobe restaurant at 5536 Melrose 
Ave. in honor of Frank Casado, who opened the eatery with his wife, Lucy, in 
1964. Casado died in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * REWARD OFFERED -- Approved offering a $25,000 reward for information leading 
to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the 
strangulations of Veronica Ultreras, 23, and her 3-year-old daughter, Cynthia, 
on Jan. 2, 1993. Their home at 848 N. Avenue 50 in Highland Park was set on 
fire after they were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 * STREET CLOSURE -- Approved the closure of Hill Street between Washington 
Boulevard and 21st Street on July 23 and 24 from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. for the 
Gift and Decorative Accessories Show sponsored by Los Angeles Mart. HOW THEY 
VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 * SOCCERFEST SHUTTLE -- Authorized the Department of Transportation to 
negotiate a contract wih ATE Management and Service Co. to provide free shuttle 
bus service to the SoccerFest event at the Convention Center starting Friday 
and running through July 17. The shuttle will run from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
between the Convention Center and the major downtown hotels. Councilwoman Rita 
Walters objected to the proposal because the estimated $12,000 to fund it is 
being transferred from Proposition A transportation projects, such as the DASH 
shuttle. Referring to World Cup USA '94, a profit-making organization, she 
said, "This is not about kids and soccer, this is about business." Passed 13-1. 
Voting yes: Richard Alatorre, Jackie Goldberg, Mike Hernandez, Nate Holden, 
Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rudy Svorinich Jr. Voting No: Walters. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

VOICES: PASSION STATEMENT; A 14-YEAR-OLD JUNIOR HIGH STUDENT DEFENDS HER 
DECISION TO EXPRESS HER STRONG OPINIONS ABOUT SAFE SEX. SHE WORE HER HEARTFELT 
BELIEFS ON HER SLEEVES IN THE FORM OF CONDOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By ASTRIANNA JOHNSON, Last September, 14-year-old Astrianna Johnson began 
wearing condoms to Mary McCleod Bethune Junior High School in South-Central to 
make a point. The eighth-grader pinned the condoms onto her shoes and clothing, 
protesting the school's sex education program as inadequate. After the school 
forbade her to wear the condoms, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a 
civil rights lawsuit against the Los Angeles Unified School District. In his 
May 16 decision in favor of the school district, U.S. District Judge Terry 
Hatter Jr. said principals must be given great latitude to govern schools 
attended by children. The ACLU will not appeal the ruling. Principal Edith 
Morris says the school complies with state law requiring that abstinence be 
taught as the only 100% effective way to prevent pregnancy, sexually 
transmitted disease and AIDS. The school teaches sex education in the seventh 
grade. Astrianna, who did not attend seventh grade at the school and did not 
receive sex education, says the instruction should be continuous. Astrianna was 
interviewed by Joy B. Davis.

<P>
 I was thinking about HIV and sexually transmitted diseases because a couple of 
my friends told me: "I think I have herpes or the clap." I tried to stress to 
them that they should wear a condom, but it really seemed not to be getting 
through their minds. They're not educated on the condom. They feel they're 
responsible enough to go out and have sex. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd tell them to talk with their mothers. I would just be a friend, not try to 
be a counselor or anything. If they come to me, I'm going to try and be there 
for them and tell them what I believe in. I had a lot of friends come to me, 
telling me they think they're pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt very strongly that it was my right to wear the condoms. I didn't tell 
my mother I was going to pin them on my clothes, but when she saw them she 
said, "Oh, nice idea," like that. 
</P>
<P>
 The condoms usually were on my shoes. I pinned them on my knee, on my clothes. 
They were in packages, not opened, in colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students didn't say anything when I wore them to school. Some said, "Hey, 
she's got condoms on, that's a good idea." They'd congratulate me. They asked 
me where did I get them, where did I buy them, how much did they cost. 
</P>
<P>
 At first the vice principal told me just to take them off; she said the 
school's policy was to teach students abstinence. She stopped me and pulled me 
into her office and asked, "What are they? Why are you wearing them? What's the 
purpose?" I explained it to her. 
</P>
<P>
 I was surprised, I thought the administrators and teachers were a little more 
up-to-date. It was like I had to teach them. I thought, by their expression and 
look, they didn't know what a condom was. They just asked me where did I get 
them, where did I buy them. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel the judge's ruling is saying students are just in school to get an 
education and to do whatever school officials say. Children have no rights at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 I see myself being a lawyer. More and more since this incident, I see other 
things that have happened to other kids, other people, things I don't agree 
with. Like the Rodney King beating, I felt the cops should have been in jail 
for a long time. I feel everyone has rights. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't think my wearing condoms would blow up this big. I strongly wanted to 
appeal the case. Going to court wasn't frightening at all. My friends were very 
supportive; people I didn't know were supportive. 
</P>
<P>
 People were saying, "Sorry you lost," and "I hope you still wear the condoms." 
Teachers are being a little more open with it. Now they say, "I really did 
agree with you." Back then they wouldn't comment because they thought their job 
was on the line.  
</P>
<P>
 It's good that they're trying to show the kids about safe sex and all, but 
they shouldn't just make it one year. It should be a constant thing. What about 
the eighth-graders, what about the ninth-graders? What are we getting? We're 
still not getting anything. It's never too late to get educated. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer I'm going to have a good time: get a job, go swimming, maybe take 
up karate again. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year I'm going to Crenshaw High School. As far as wearing condoms to high 
school, I was thinking about it; I haven't made a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if I'd do it again. It kind of tears you down a little bit after 
you try to stand up and you know your rights. You know, it puts you in a daze, 
like, wow.

VOICES: LOFTY PLANS; DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES HAS A RICH HISTORY, BUT AN ARCHITECT 
SAYS PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE APPRECIATING IT. HIS BLUEPRINT FOR CHANGE: A MUSEUM OF 
URBAN LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL DAVIS, Architect Carl Davis, 49, is a graduate of Yale University and 
the University of London who has lived in the Downtown loft district for 15 
years. He and his wife, architect Virginia Tanzmann, are partners in the 
Tanzmann Associates firm. They were involved in designing the Los Angeles 
Mission and rehabilitating the Los Angeles Convention Center and are currently 
working on the design of the North Hollywood subway station for the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority. He was interviewed by Karen E. Klein. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I really love Downtown, the whole Downtown area. But I think most people don't 
know much about Downtown Los Angeles and the history of the city. They do not 
know how it developed. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, in the area where I live, the loft district, there are all these 
remnants of the railroad culture. East of Alameda, from the Hollywood Freeway 
to the Santa Monica Freeway, there are still railroad tracks running down a lot 
of the streets and behind the buildings. The area is full of old warehouses 
that served the railroads. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, I lived in one that was originally a furniture and luggage 
warehouse. It was where everybody would come to collect their furniture when it 
was shipped out here after they had moved to Southern California from the East. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the railroad that carried everybody here, the railroad that really 
developed Los Angeles -- not the automobile, like everyone thinks. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to re-educate ourselves about Los Angeles and its history. Most inner 
cities in the East are developing themselves as an attraction zone for people 
to come for entertainment and education. We're failing to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, I think we're afraid of our old city. But we should not be. The 
city needs to be saved and preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 My idea is to create a Museum of Urban Los Angeles. I was on a panel that did 
a study of the old Herald Examiner building, one of the premier pieces of 
architecture in Los Angeles that now sits vacant. We studied converting it into 
artist housing, into low-income housing. My idea was to turn it into a museum 
-- the Museum of Urban Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 We would have MoCA (the Museum of Contemporary Art) on one end of town and 
MOULA on the other. The acronym is intentional -- making it in Los Angeles 
culture has always been about making money, about "moola." 
</P>
<P>
 I think it would be a marvelous attraction for that area. The museum would 
focus on a highly interactive theme. Touring it would be almost like playing a 
game. You would learn when the city started to grow and how it grew. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be a section focusing on Los Angeles and the detectives -- the 
Raymond Chandler stories and so many other detective stories and shows are set 
in Los Angeles. There are so many other things that Los Angeles is famous for, 
there would be a lot of displays you could do. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Herald building up to the Grand Central Market is one of my favorite 
parts of L.A. From the Million Dollar Theater to the Bradbury Building, almost 
everything is original. It hasn't all been blown up for parking lots. I'd like 
to see it preserved as an intact piece of early 20th-Century street-scape. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum I envision would celebrate some of the great, unsung things about 
Los Angeles, like the bridges over the Los Angeles River. They are wonderful. 
There are at least eight different bridges, built from the 1920s on -- each 
distinctive and each with wonderful details on it. 
</P>
<P>
 One even has an under-section with rooms now occupied by the homeless. Some 
are Art Deco, some are classical, some Italian Renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
 There are marvelous little bungalows all over the city. Some are Spanish 
style, some look like medieval castles, with turrets and towers. Back when they 
were built, the developers were selling a whole Southern California lifestyle. 
It was like you could have your own smaller and cheaper version of a Beverly 
Hills mansion or a Highland Park-area home. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are great old cafeterias, with loads of history behind them, that 
should be remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the signage. I think Los Angeles is great for its exuberant and 
wildly different signage all over the place. In Koreatown, there's some very 
strange signage that I love. One building has an elk on top of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Herald building is a perfect location for the museum. It is one of the 
premier buildings of architect Julia Morgan and the man who built it, William 
Randolph Hearst, was one of the earliest people to hype Los Angeles and 
encourage its development. 
</P>
<P>
 The area around the building is under-utilized and could definitely be 
revitalized. There is a job corps center near there that could train people in 
computers and in the running of a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 I've also thought about a computerized library of Los Angeles being in this 
museum. You could come in there and -- for a fee -- get all the files you would 
want on your house, your block, your neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of having to go to City Hall and wait in thousands of different lines, 
you could come to MOULA and get all the information you would need. 
</P>
<P>
 There is so much history in that older Downtown area that people really don't 
know about. This could be a way to bring some of it to life and bring people 
back to the inner city.

AREA LAWSUIT FILINGS FALL 20% SINCE '91; LITIGATION: THE DROP CONTRADICTS THE 
WIDESPREAD VIEW THAT COURTS ARE OVERWHELMED BY CASES AND PARALLELS A SIMILAR 
DECLINE ACROSS THE STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of new lawsuits filed in Ventura County has dropped steadily over 
the past four years -- a decline some court officials link to a new system of 
handling civil cases that may be discouraging lawyers from going to court 
unless they have a solid case. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop in lawsuits -- contradicting a widespread view that the courts are 
overwhelmed by a litigation explosion -- parallels a similar decline across the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1991 to last year, according to statistics reported to the state Judicial 
Council, lawsuits for personal injury and general complaints filed in Ventura 
County fell 20% -- from 4,466 to 3,547. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in the number of lawsuits -- from personal injury cases to medical 
malpractice -- continued through the first five months of 1994, local court 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, lawsuits for general complaints and personal injury have fallen 10% 
since 1991, state figures show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Court officials, who have complained in the past that the system is flooded 
with cases, credited the downturn to a new state program aimed at speeding up 
the time it takes to resolve lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, called fast track, has forced many lawyers to think twice before 
filing lawsuits, said Melinda A. Johnson, the Ventura County Superior Court 
presiding judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's given you a whole different way of looking at civil litigation," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers said they hope to use the information about the drop in lawsuits to 
convince the public that the liability system is working well and only needs 
minor repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating to sit back and see the civil-justice system getting 
hammered with untruths. There's not a litigation explosion," declared John H. 
Howard, a past president of the county Trial Lawyers Assn. and winner of the 
largest local jury award ever. 
</P>
<P>
 But Michael Carpenter, spokesman for the Assn. of California Tort Reform, 
which was unsuccessful in an attempt earlier this year to place a reform 
initiative on the ballot, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Focusing on the number of lawsuits is simply an effort to deflect attention 
from the need of civil-liability reform," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Howard and others say lawsuits in the county are down because lawyers 
are accepting fewer marginal cases. They also say the threat of lawsuits has 
led manufacturers to produce better products, reducing the need for a lot of 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The court officials, however, attribute the decrease to a much more obvious 
factor: the fast-track program. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast track was created nearly four years ago and requires court officials to 
handle most lawsuits -- 90% of them -- within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the most complex cases, those involving tough legal issues or multiple 
litigants, are exempt from the fast-track system. And even those have to be 
handled within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Before, many lawsuits languished in the system for up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, many lawyers are refusing to file lawsuits unless they are sure their 
evidence will come together in time to go to trial within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have people who know from the minute they file that they have one year to 
get that done," Judge Johnson said. "And they know the court is going to push 
them like crazy to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said before the program was implemented in June two years ago, "We had 
a bunch of (lawyers) who came, wanting to file things to get in before fast 
track." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson speculated that as a result of fast track some lawyers are possibly 
"weeding out marginal cases," resulting in the decline in filings. She also 
said it would not surprise her if the number of lawsuits increases to its 
original level in the next year or so, now that lawyers are more accustomed to 
the new system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be surprised to see them start inching back up," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of liability system reform say any reduction in lawsuits is not 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important issue is . . . the cost to Californians of (the) 
civil-litigation system," added Carpenter, whose group represents manufacturers 
and the insurance industry, among others. "Except for the lawyers and the 
civil-litigation industry, no one believes not enough lawsuits are being 
filed." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter's group contends the economic toll of lawsuit abuse is staggering 
and that unwarranted litigation is driving up the cost of goods, services and 
insurance premiums for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he said, California lawyers filed one lawsuit for every 37 residents 
of the state. That, he argued, stifled the development of new products such as 
AIDS vaccines, destroyed jobs and opportunity, reduced competitiveness and 
harmed the state's economic climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Gore, spokesman for the Assn. of California Insurance Companies, 
another reform-minded group, also said any decline in lawsuits so far has been 
insignificant. He, too, said what is important is the total cost of those 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gore also said every 100 claims of bodily injury in California result in 56 
lawsuits, contrasted with 11 suits for the same number of claims in New York, 
which has no-fault insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 No-fault refers to an auto insurance system under which one's own insurance 
company reimburses for the cost of treating injuries and other losses, 
regardless of who is at blame in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial lawyers have opposed no-fault, saying the current system works fine for 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, attorney Howard argued that no-fault insurance would make big 
business less accountable to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 And he said other reforms would lessen the average resident's chance at 
justice during disputes -- especially one that would cap contingency fees at 
25% of the first $100,000 in an award, 15% for the next $100,000 and 10% of any 
amount beyond $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, Howard referred to a case he handled that stemmed from an event 
at the Oxnard Target Store in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 He represented four former auto mechanics who claimed they were falsely 
accused of theft and wrongfully terminated by the store chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses testified during the eight-week trial that the Target employees were 
dismissed by a company detective whose quota was to apprehend one thieving 
worker every 18 hours. A Ventura County jury in 1990 awarded the plaintiffs $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said he would not have accepted the case if there were limitations on 
the contingency fees he could charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to work nine years on the case. I had to risk over $100,000 of my own 
money," he said. "And, if the best I could hope to get was 10% of what a jury 
gives us, I couldn't take it."

RESCUE VOLUNTEERS READY FOR NEW BUSINESS; RECREATION: DOZENS OF TEAM MEMBERS 
ARE ON CALL AS HORDES OF HIKERS ARE HITTING THE TRAILS THIS LONG HOLIDAY 
WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every summer, when hikers and campers take advantage of the nice weather to 
commune with nature, the Ventura County Search and Rescue Team prepares for 
more business. 
</P>
<P>
 Campers get lost. Hikers get hurt. Rock climbers get stranded. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which means the 150 volunteers are scrambling nearly every weekend to 
find or rescue people, mostly in Los Padres National Forest. This long weekend, 
with hordes of hikers expected to hit the trails, the rescue team has at least 
two helicopters available throughout the weekend and dozens of volunteers on 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County seems to be a popular place for people to come to and get 
lost," said Bob Riggs, a sheriff's official who is responsible for billing the 
home counties of people who get stranded or need rescuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Earl Matthews, who heads the rescue team, said 
his team is one of the busiest in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're probably in the top 5% to 10% in the state, activity-wise," Matthews 
said. "We have nice backcountry here." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the accidents occur because hikers are not properly prepared when they 
bumble into the wilderness. Authorities said people often forget to leave maps 
or other information behind for their families in case they become lost. In 
some cases, people who become lost contribute to their own problems by using 
alcohol and drugs while climbing or hiking. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a combination of old-fashioned tracking techniques and modern 
technology, teams ford streams, cut through brush and scale cliffs to get to 
stranded hikers. Depending on the situation, a truck, helicopter or a horse 
could be used by the trained, civilian volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The team goes out on an average of about 185 rescue or search missions a year, 
mostly searching for missing hikers and backpackers. Not all of the volunteers 
can make every mission, but they are required to participate in at least 80% of 
the missions. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers, who are on call day or night, range in age from early 20s to 
their 70s, and come from all walks of life. The team's roster includes 
physicians, carpenters, engineers and ranchers. Many are self-employed and have 
flexible schedules so they can get away for hours at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're Joe Citizen," said Matthews, who is the only full-time person 
assigned to the team. "They're good, down-to-earth people. It shows a desire of 
citizens to help citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Hofmeister, at 73 the oldest team member, says he stays with it because 
he enjoys the excitement and helping people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets in your blood and you can't get it out," said the Ojai rancher, who 
is entering his fifth decade on the team. "I've never been able to pass up 
someone and not help them." 
</P>
<P>
 The rescue team is divided into seven teams with varying specialties. Three 
concentrate on mountain searches, one is on a dive team, another does canine 
searches, another is a mounted posse member, plus one medical team of doctors 
and nurses. Depending on the type of emergency, Matthews decides which teams he 
wants to use, and what kind of equipment is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, if a person is reported missing, the watch commander will page 
Matthews, who interviews relatives and friends to get information on the 
missing person. He says age and experience level are the most crucial 
information he needs to decide whether to send out a search party. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's an adult male and he's well-equipped and he's only a few hours 
overdue, we don't commit a lot of resources," said Matthews, who has headed the 
team for about 20 years. "If it's a child, that's a high priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews then pages team members and leaves a message on a machine so they can 
call in to get information. Volunteers meet him at the search site, where they 
are briefed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the team doesn't respond quickly enough to some emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 James L. Kinninger, a friend of a windsurfer who drowned off the Ventura 
County coast four years ago, said his friend Michael Kelley might have been 
saved if county sheriff's deputies and firefighters had responded quickly to 
calls for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses reported to the County Fire Department that Kelley disappeared in 
rough seas at Mussel Shoals while surfing during Memorial Day weekend in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the Coast Guard responded quickly, Kinninger said in an interview after 
his friend was found dead. The Fire Department did not dispatch a rescue team, 
and the Sheriff's Department sent a single one-deputy cruiser to see if it 
could spot Kelley or take witness statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews' search and rescue team was not called until after Kelley's body 
washed up on rocks the next day. Sheriff's officials said the search and rescue 
team is not dispatched unless a body is seen in the water or a vessel is 
spotted. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews said he can only respond after the watch commander decides to page 
him. He said that with swimmers, his rescue team typically is useless because a 
person can be brain-damaged in six minutes under water. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone doesn't pull him out of the water before we get there, he doesn't 
have a chance," Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the situation is an emergency, Matthews sends a helicopter, which can 
travel 100 m.p.h. The quickest they could reach Mussel Shoals would be 10 
minutes, Matthews said. Sometimes heavy fog and other weather conditions will 
also slow response time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few decades ago, helicopters were not even available to the team, Matthews 
said. The team, which began with a few people in the 1940s, has evolved into a 
more sophisticated and efficient group today, Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good old boy thing," Matthews said. "The sheriff would call his 
rancher friends and they would do searches. We do searches in the Sespe now 
that take two or three hours that had to take seven or nine days in the '50s." 
</P>
<P>
 Hofmeister, who has been on the team since the '40s, remembers that it began 
with horses and over time graduated to helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to use houses, then we went to an old pickup, then we went to a Jeep, 
then we got an old Army truck, and now we have the helicopters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the people who require the team's help are Ventura County residents, 
but a few each year come from other counties, Matthews said. Those counties are 
then billed for helicopter time and Matthews' time. Los Angeles County receives 
the most bills, up to $12,000 in some years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pay, but they pay somewhat reluctantly," Riggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county of Ventura spends about $86,000 a year on the team, which includes 
Matthews' salary as well as supplies for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthews said the volunteers save the county about $446,000 a year in training 
and search hours. They provide their own gear and food on the missions, and the 
county supplies the rescue equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To get on the team, residents send applications to Matthews, who does the 
initial screening. Applicants are then interviewed by team members, and must 
pass a background check and endure up to eight months of training. About six 
openings a year come up, and Matthews said he talks to about 15 people a week 
who are interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue training includes rock-climbing, rappelling, first aid, helicopter 
tactics and map-reading skills. Depending on which team a volunteer decides to 
join, skills will vary. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Smitley, a 36-year-old Fillmore contractor, said the down side of being 
on the team are the long hours and broken engagements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to do a search on Father's Day, and all the guys had to go out," said 
Smitley, who has been a volunteer since 1983. "You have to get up in the middle 
of the night and leave your family. Guys miss work, and they lose money. There 
are times they go 24 to 48 hours without sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Smitley said he isn't quitting anytime soon. He and other volunteers 
say they stay with it because they like helping people in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something to do for the community," Smitley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people who are rescued or get lost are unprepared hikers, Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
 He recommends that backpackers leave maps and information on their 
destinations with family members, and to bring a bright colored T-shirt to wave 
in case of emergencies. Packing extra food and water is a wise precaution, as 
well as some kind of lighter to make a campfire in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcohol and drugs should be avoided because they sometimes cause people to try 
stunts they otherwise would not do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the rescue team had to pluck a 27-year-old Taft man from a cliff 
where he was stranded. His brother, who was also trying to climb the Sespe 
Wall, fell about 250 feet and died. Neither had extensive climbing experience, 
and both were trying to scale the 250-foot precipice without any climbing 
equipment, Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used drugs the night before and they had been drinking all day," 
Matthews said. "If you take alcohol or drugs, you'll attempt things you 
wouldn't normally attempt, and most of the time you'll pay dearly for it." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Matthews said the biggest and most publicized search the team 
has done involved looking for Kellie O'Sullivan, the missing Westlake Village 
nurse who was found shot to death last September in a brushy area of the Santa 
Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his own search teams, about 200 civilian volunteers were also 
under Matthews' direction during that search, which lasted nearly two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin White, O'Sullivan's boyfriend, said he was so impressed by the team's 
effort that he plans to begin a nonprofit fund to help it. He will solicit 
donations after O'Sullivan's alleged killer, Mark Scott Thornton, is tried in 
her slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a good group of people," White said, referring to the volunteers. 
"It's hard to believe in this day and age that people give up that kind of 
time. They're unsung heroes."

BUSINESS IS BOOMING IN FIREWORKS ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 He was like a wide-eyed child in a candy store. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are these here? What do they do?" the middle-aged man asked, pointing to 
a row of red rockets and cone-shaped fireworks. "Give me one of those Solar 
Capsules -- and one of these turtles." 
</P>
<P>
 Handing the cashier a crisp $100 bill, the man -- who refused to give his name 
-- grabbed his change and his sack full of fireworks before darting out to his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 With only a few days left to legally purchase non-explosive fireworks, 
pyrotechnic fans cluttered the roadside stands along California 126 in Fillmore 
Saturday to stock up before the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore is the only city in Ventura County that allows the sale and 
detonation of fireworks. Igniting fountains, pinwheels or other sparkling 
gadgets is illegal everywhere else in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire and law-enforcement officials warn that it is a misdemeanor under state 
law to possess fireworks in an area where their sale is prohibited. Penalties 
can be as stiff as a $1,000 fine or six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many customers milling about at Fillmore's colorful fireworks stands, 
the law was a distant thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how illegal they are, we have to have them," said Northridge 
resident Nina Bainer, who walked away from a church group's stand with nearly 
$200 worth of fireworks, including two large assortment boxes. "It's a Fourth 
of July experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Some buyers had less ambitious shopping lists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to get some little stuff," said Wally Folkes of Camarillo, 
who was browsing with a friend. "We're not going to get any skyrockets." 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 nonprofit groups obtained permits to operate the wooden booths that 
stretch along the highway for nearly two miles. The annual fireworks sales, 
which are a longstanding tradition in Fillmore, generate tens of thousands of 
dollars for local groups each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a lot of bake sales and carwashes to make what you can in 
one hour here," said Fillmore resident Jim Poe, who started one of the town's 
first booths in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Fireworks sales last only seven days. They started last Tuesday and will end 
at noon on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Poe said sales typically skyrocket as the Fourth of July nears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually on the 3rd we'll have 700 (customers) and about 1,000 on the 4th," he 
said. The booth his church is operating has already sold fireworks to more than 
500 people. 
</P>
<P>
 But fire and law-enforcement officials have issued reminders that thousands of 
people fall victim to fireworks accidents each year. Five injuries and 20 fires 
were attributed to the misuse of fireworks in Ventura County last year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities urged thrill-seekers to attend one of the eight pyrotechnic 
displays planned for Monday around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have beautiful fireworks displays in the county -- go and attend them," 
said Lt. Mike Gullon of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. "Let the 
professionals do it." 
</P>
<P>
 But booth operators say they could not fund their community programs without 
selling to residents from around the county and the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 The weeklong fund-raiser is expected to generate more than $5,000 for the 
Fillmore Boys & Girls Club, past president Max Pina said. 
</P>
<P>
 The club provides recreational programs and tutoring for about 300 youths. "If 
we didn't have this, the Boys & Girls Club might fall on its face," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers -- some spending hundreds of dollars for the so-called "safe and sane" 
fireworks -- carefully selected from the wide variety of wares Saturday. 
Flashing Wheels, Screaming Meemies, Raging Monsters and Mr. Turtles -- 
described as "fire-spurting menaces" -- were just a few of the dozens of 
non-explosive fireworks for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come to this same stand every year," said Simi Valley resident Chris Doria, 
gesturing to the booth for the Marantha Foundation, a local church group. Doria 
said he plans to set off his $60 worth of fireworks in the Mojave Desert 
Monday, where the risk of accidental fires is smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're beautiful," he said. "I love the colors." 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore resident Paul Poe, Jim Poe's son, enjoys the kaboom of the fireworks 
as much as the cha-ching of the cash register in his church group's booth, 
which takes Visa and MasterCard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've sold maybe 10 of these, and they're 200 bucks apiece," Poe said, 
slapping a giant assortment box called the Big One. "You might as well light 
your wallet on fire." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore is the only city in Ventura County that allows non-explosive 
fireworks to be sold around July 4. Twenty-one organizations are selling 
fireworks between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. daily in booths along California 126. 
Fireworks can be bought and set off until noon on Tuesday, July 5. Purchasers 
must be over 16. It is illegal to set off fireworks outside the city.

VENTURA RESIDENTS DIVIDED OVER LAND SWAP PROPOSAL; CONTROVERSY: GREENBELT WOULD 
BE LOST, NEW PARK GAINED IN DEAL. FLYER PROMOTING PROJECT IS LATEST VOLLEY IN 
BATTLE OVER PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many Ventura residents opened their mailboxes recently to find a quaint beige 
flyer announcing "We're Building a Park in Ventura!" 
</P>
<P>
 On what appeared to be recycled paper, ringed with hand-drawn depictions of 
fishing poles, soccer balls and baseball mitts, the mailer described the golf 
course, tennis courts, swimming pool and ball fields planned for the land at 
Kimball and Telephone roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The pamphlet ends with the exhortation to "Join us at the next meeting of park 
supporters. See you there!" And it appears to bear the endorsements of the 
Ventura City Council and City Planner Mitch Oshinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in fact, the seemingly homespun mailer was paid for by a local developer 
who has offered to help foot the bill for the park if he gets permission to 
build 437 homes on what is now a city-owned lemon orchard. 
</P>
<P>
 Builder Ron Hertel calls his land swap proposal "a fair deal for both sides." 
But many others in town don't see it that way.  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the flyer is the latest volley in the war of words and paper over 
Hertel's offer, which has divided city residents unlike any other development 
plan before the City Council this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some outraged residents accuse Hertel of proposing to violate the sanctity of 
the city's greenbelt, which they say preserves the area's rural tradition and 
prevents endless suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously, he is the hero of east-side soccer coaches, Little League 
managers and basketball referees. These and other local sports team organizers 
find themselves begging every year for a patch of grass where their teams can 
practice and play their games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a call at 6:38 a.m. today on the park from a resident in the area," 
said Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures. "It's even divided his family. The 
husband's for it, the wife's against it."  
</P>
<P>
 The deal itself is complicated and filled with intricacies, but boils down to 
this: 
</P>
<P>
 * Hertel owns 94 acres of land just south of the Santa Paula Freeway, west of 
Kimball Road. He cannot make much money off this property now because the city 
has ordered it preserved as an agricultural greenbelt until 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city owns an 87-acre lemon orchard -- also considered part of the 
greenbelt -- at Telegraph Road and Petit Avenue. The lemon grove is slated to 
become a regional park someday, but the city cannot find the money to get the 
process started. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hertel built a tract of homes next to the city's lemon grove. He now 
proposes to swap his 94 acres for the city's lemon grove, where he wants to 
build 437 more homes. To sweeten the deal, he has offered $2 million to help 
the city build a regional park on his Kimball Road property. 
</P>
<P>
 * To allow the development, the council would have to amend the city's 
Comprehensive Plan, which says both properties must remain farmland until 2010. 
The city would also have to award Hertel 43% of all the housing allocations it 
will dole out through the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Even many of these basic details, however, have been obscured in the rhetoric 
of the community battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight erupted last spring, in the living rooms of the new stucco homes 
across the street from the lemon orchard. Neighbors who want to look out their 
back yards at fruit trees, not another new housing tract, have evolved into 
Save Our Agricultural Resources, or SOAR. 
</P>
<P>
 "He comes in with these proposals to build a park," said Elaina Fletcher, who 
lives on Solano Street in a home built by Hertel. "But in reality, it's all 
just to allow him to build more houses on his property and make more money." 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher insists that Hertel is taking advantage of the city. Once the 
greenbelt is gone, she said, it's gone forever. And she doesn't believe the 
city will ever have the cash to finish the park. 
</P>
<P>
 She and other incensed homeowners are collecting signatures for a ballot 
initiative that would prohibit any housing construction on greenbelt land 
unless approved by a majority of city voters. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the group has gathered about 7,000 signatures -- close, but not the 
8,589 needed to qualify the measure for the ballot. Supporters say they will 
make a big push this weekend to collect about 3,000 more signatures, in case 
some are not currently registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative drive has picked up preservationists along the way, some of 
whom see the Hertel development as the first step toward wall-to-wall housing 
across Ventura's east end. 
</P>
<P>
 "One by one, little bits of orchard get taken over, and soon, the whole 
neighborhood" is developed, warned Allan Sandosham, who lives south of the 
lemon grove, in an older development across Telegraph Road. "Why is the city 
chipping away at (the greenbelt)? We have to take a stand on where we want to 
draw the line."  
</P>
<P>
 But John Correa, a city parks commissioner and leading advocate for the park, 
argues the city ought to take the $2 million and run. He says that much of the 
greenbelt will be developed someday, so why not trade 437 houses for public 
tennis courts, two swimming pools, a golf course and ball fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see why the city wouldn't go ahead with it," Correa said. "I think 
the value to the community is so overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 Correa is so enthusiastic that he has drawn up blueprints of a proposed park 
and attached the sketch to his own petition, which asks residents to sign in 
support of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Correa and other supporters see it, the park would cost about $10 
million. Of that, $2 million would come from Hertel and about $4 million from 
the city, which has set aside a special fund to build a public swimming pool. 
The rest would be raised by a nonprofit association formed specifically to 
administer the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Once built, the park will pay for itself because it will be almost entirely 
activity oriented, advocates said. Each piece of space will be a field, arena 
or green dedicated to a particular sport, and park visitors will pay fees to 
use each area. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every type of community sports enthusiast finds something in the design 
to cheer about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're feeling a tremendous crunch for pool space," said Steve 
Baxter, the coach of the Buenaventura Swim Club, a youth swim league. The 
league now uses pool space at the local high schools, organizing its schedule 
around each school team's practices and competitions. "This park would be a 
tremendous advantage to the aquatics community." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter and other swimmers are gathering figures on the tourist dollars that 
would come with regional swim meets at an Olympic-size pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Softball players and coaches also look on the proposed park as the answer to 
their logistics problem of juggling too many teams and too few fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kniss has been playing adult softball for 20 years. His league used to 
play entirely out of Camino Real Park, but then the league outgrew the limited 
space there. Now, many teams play at West Park Recreational Center on the west 
end of town, but Kniss said some players refuse to travel there because of gang 
problems in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "A game three years ago had to be stopped because of a shooting," he said. 
"Hopefully now, with a park out here (on the east side), we could use that and 
Camino Real as our home base." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Kelley, president of the Ventura Tri-Valley Girls Softball League, has 
been squeezing his teams onto the fields at Ventura College this last year. But 
with more and more girls signing up, space is getting extremely tight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sports complex is intriguing," he said of the proposed park. "A 
once-in-a-lifetime facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members share Kelley's enthusiasm. The council will consider this 
month whether to amend the city's Comprehensive Plan so that Hertel's proposal 
can begin the city's lengthy review process. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous opportunity for the entire community," Councilwoman 
Measures said. "It's there and it's ready to go. Let's negotiate the swap and 
move on with the feasibility study." 
</P>
<P>
 Measures received free rental space from Hertel during her campaign last fall, 
and counts the developer as a personal friend. She said she has known Hertel 
for more than a quarter century and that her sister lives in a townhome he 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she said, Hertel has never put any pressure on her to support his 
land swap proposal. "I hold him and his family in the highest esteem," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said the issue has generated such passion because it 
highlights a broader municipal problem -- the lack of youth centers and 
activities in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is we do need a facility," he said. "Anyway, this really ties 
into a bigger issue, which is how do we continue to find programs and 
facilities (for the city's youth)? How do we keep kids out of juvenile 
delinquency? I really think it's that big." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilmen Gary Tuttle and Steve Bennett say they worry Hertel is using 
local coaches and team players as a front to get himself a sweetheart deal with 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a long way from being anywhere near a fair deal," Tuttle said. Tuttle 
and Bennett both say Hertel has overvalued his land to make it look as 
desirable as the city's property, estimating its worth at $65,000 per acre. 
They say it may be worth as little as $35,000 per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening here is these people are becoming a shill for a developer," 
Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Hertel said the athletic community's enthusiastic support of his 
proposal has been a welcome, if unexpected, bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We encourage that," he said. "I didn't even know John Correa was drawing up 
plans for the park until he called me up six months or so ago." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged having paid for the flyer that went out anonymously in the 
mail the third week in June. He said his staff had prepared the mailer, but he 
had not read it and was not sure of the nature of its contents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sports enthusiasts are really pushing this from our side," he said. "They 
are the initiators and we are just helping them."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hertel's mailer describes the proposed park in some detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The park concept grew because there was funding to make a really nice park 
for whole families, including seniors, to enjoy," it reads in part. "The park 
offers a great opportunity to put golf greens, playing fields, a duck pond and 
a sports complex on property that would otherwise fall to development." 
</P>
<P>
 The flyer urges residents to write or call City Council members and planner 
Oshinsky to show their support for the park. It concludes with the phone 
numbers for Oshinsky and the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Oshinsky said he complained to Correa because he thought the flyer implied he 
had signed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Correa said he did not write the pamphlet, he said he reviewed it 
before it was mailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a dumb mistake," he acknowledged. "It wasn't designed to be 
misleading. We are going to change it." 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Steve Bennett said he, too, found the mailers confusing. "But 
that's the game of politics," he said. "And unfortunately, that's how it's 
played in this city." Proposed Land Swap 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Ron Hertel wants to trade his Kimball Road property for a city-owned 
lemon orchard. He hopes to build 437 houses on the lemon grove and promises $2 
million toward a park on the other property.

ASPHALT HEROES; ENTREPRENEUR PLANS A HOME IN THOUSAND OAKS FOR GROWING LEGIONS 
OF ROLLER HOCKEY ENTHUSIASTS

<P>
 While driving around Thousand Oaks, Jim Davis has recently begun to notice 
more and more street scenes that remind him of the winters he spent growing up 
amid the snows of Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
 In schoolyards and cul-de-sacs, on tennis and basketball courts, Davis has 
been watching the children of Thousand Oaks as they lace up their skates and 
pick up their sticks for a ritual once witnessed only on frozen ponds in far 
more frigid regions. 
</P>
<P>
 They're playing hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit superstar Wayne Gretzky. Credit the invention of in-line roller skates. 
Credit the rapid expansion of the National Hockey League. Give the credit to 
whomever you want, Davis says. "These kids are dying to play hockey, and I'm 
going to bring them a real place to play." 
</P>
<P>
 After a year and a half of wrangling with the city, the businessman recently 
received approval to turn an empty Thousand Oaks warehouse into the county's 
first indoor roller hockey rink. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport, played on in-line skates, is essentially ice hockey without the 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
 When construction of the facility -- slated to include NHL-style boards and 
glass -- is completed in November, Davis expects more than 1,500 children and 
adults to sign up to use it.  
</P>
<P>
 Other roller hockey enthusiasts said that estimate might even be too low.  
</P>
<P>
 "This sport is on fire," said Walt Collins, who founded the Tri-Valley Roller 
Hockey Assn., the Agoura-based league that sponsors weekend games for about 
1,000 kids from an area stretching from the San Fernando Valley to Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is looking for space to play, and it just doesn't exist," Collins 
said. "I have to turn people away because we don't have enough space." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of people playing the sport nationwide has doubled each year for 
the past five years, according to Shawn Jones, executive director of the 
Miami-based National In-Line Hockey Assn. And nowhere is it growing faster than 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just explosive out there," Jones said. "I'd say there are more than 
100,000 adults and kids who are playing it there." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a lifelong ice hockey enthusiast who five years ago became entranced by 
the sport of roller hockey, said he is shocked that local parks and schools are 
not accommodating roller hockey players, despite all the desire and interest. 
</P>
<P>
 In several cities around Southern California, roller blades have been barred 
from public tennis and basketball courts due to damage to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Collins said, few cities have been willing to cooperate with in-line 
skaters, either because they don't want to compromise their facilities or they 
fear the liability involved in a sport in which hard falls are commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It struck me that there were all these kids who were playing out in the 
street or are forced to break into tennis courts to play this sport," Davis 
said. "I thought maybe we ought to go ahead and build something for them." 
</P>
<P>
 He was not alone. For the past several months the city of Moorpark has been 
trying to settle on a location for a roller hockey rink. The city recently 
allocated money in its budget to pay for such a project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And Collins, whose Tri-Valley League games are played on a basketball court at 
Agoura High School, has been searching for someplace to set up shop. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Davis found an empty warehouse in a financially strapped strip mall on 
Avenida de los Arboles, he thought he had found the perfect spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had everything we needed," Davis said. "The playing area was the right 
size, it had room for a retail shop and locker rooms, and it was in a great 
location. And the city said no." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks officials, concerned about added noise and traffic, worked with 
Davis for a year on a plan to turn the proposed rink into a private club to 
ensure adequate supervision of activities there. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the National In-Line Hockey Assn. pitched in to provide insurance and 
training for coaches and officials. And local business leaders came to Davis' 
defense before the city's Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a year, the commission approved the plan for the rink, which 
is expected to cost Davis and his investors about $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis calls the plan a dream come true. He will run league games for children 
and adults, open a shop to sell skates and equipment and probably coach a team 
or officiate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And local players, who have had to settle for the street or the park for their 
impromptu matchups, are also excited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a great thing for the city," said Steve Bogoyevac, a Newbury 
Park High School graduate who plays for the Los Angeles Blades, one of 24 
professional roller hockey teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never anything like that for people interested in the sport, and I 
think the popularity of the sport is finally beginning to convince people that 
this is for real. It's not just a fad," Bogoyevac said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogoyevac, who also plays minor-league ice hockey during the winter, said he 
hopes league play in Thousand Oaks will help create a new generation of roller 
hockey players who haven't crossed over from the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Davis wants to bring wider acceptance to a sport that has 
primarily captured the attention of children, there are a few issues that stand 
in the way. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the sport's expenses, which include pads, sticks and other equipment, 
and Davis' rink will require monthly dues similar to those charged by health 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to counter those costs, Davis said he is putting aside 7% of his 
profits to develop a fund for children who want to play but whose parents can't 
afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at issue, he said, is parents' fear that the sport is too violent or 
rough. 
</P>
<P>
 Such fears are not often realized, said Don Dusablon, who coaches 7- to 
9-year-olds in the Tri-Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When kids play under league supervision, they wear masks, pads and other 
protective gear, Dusablon said. And the league does not allow checking or 
high-stick play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had kids get the wind knocked out of them or get a bruise here or 
there," he said. "But I've been doing this for a few years now, and I've never 
seen a kid have a major injury." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said part of the appeal to kids is that, like hockey, there is constant 
action and everyone's involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a video game for them," he said. "It's not like baseball, where 
they may get a chance to handle the ball once or twice the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
 With construction beginning in August and plans for league play to begin in 
November, Davis said he hopes the new arena will put Thousand Oaks on the 
roller hockey map. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see this sport played in high schools and on the college level," 
Davis said. "And someday, I'd like Thousand Oaks to be a training ground for 
the pros. A place where great roller hockey stars of the future are able to get 
their start."

<TEXT>
<P>
 A computer operator who ran for mayor of Los Angeles in the 1993 election has 
announced his candidacy for the Simi Valley City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph R. Vesalga, 39, who was defeated as a write-in candidate in the Los 
Angeles race, said he is running for the Simi council to help preserve the 
city's peaceful, suburban lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the most part this is a well-run community," Vesalga said. "But the 
streets are starting to look rundown, like the San Fernando Valley, and we need 
to get more police out in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Vesalga serves on the board of Neighborhood Council No. 3 and is an alternate 
to the Ventura County Arts Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council seats held by Sandi Webb and Judy Mikels are up for election 
in November. Webb has said she plans to seek reelection but has not formally 
announced her candidacy. Mikels gave up her seat to run for the Ventura County 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Vesalga is the third Simi Valley resident to announce candidacy for the 
November race. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates are Debi Schultze, 37, a mortgage loan processor and member 
of the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, and Dean F. Kunicki, 49, 
president of a Thousand Oaks-based company that helps businesses establish 
self-insured health plans, and also serves on the Simi Valley Planning 
Commission. SARA CATANIA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CANDIDATES SOUGHT FOR TRAILS COMMITTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks open space advocates are looking for local residents to 
represent bicyclists, horseback riders and hikers on a trails advisory 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Open Space Conservation Agency announced it is accepting 
applications for three open spots on the committee, which helps establish 
policy for the use of the city's 75 miles of trails. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're looking for are people who have a strong interest in our open 
space and who know a lot about any aspect of our trail system," said agency 
board member Rorie Skei. The board will select the three new committee members. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several years, the nine-member Conejo Open Space Trails Advisory 
Committee has undertaken projects including trail patrols, trail workdays, 
outdoor education days and trail appreciation days, Skei said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they've been able to do has been nothing short of amazing," she said. 
"We're hoping to maintain the kind of dedication that has gotten us this far." 
</P>
<P>
 The open space agency that oversees the committee operates through a 
partnership between Thousand Oaks and the Conejo Recreation and Park District. 
It will oversee the selection of candidates at its Sept. 14 meeting, said 
spokesman Mark Towne. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, each of the three candidates selected represents one of the 
three major trail-user groups -- equestrians, cyclists and hikers. Each 
committee member serves a three-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Application forms are available at the city clerk's desk at Thousand Oaks City 
Hall, 2400 Willow Lane, or at the Conejo Recreation and Park District office, 
at 155 E. Wilbur Road. The forms must be turned in to the clerk's office by 
July 21. MATTHEW MOSK

SEVERAL PEOPLE HURT SERIOUSLY IN 2 ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two separate, serious car accidents injured several people and backed up 
traffic for hours Saturday on the Ventura Freeway southbound from Santa Barbara 
and in both directions of California 126 near Piru, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the accident two miles west of Piru, eight people were injured -- at least 
three of them seriously -- in a head-on collision that occurred about 7:15 
p.m., a Ventura County Fire Department spokeswoman said.The accident stopped 
traffic for several miles in both directions as Fire Department personnel 
worked to free two of the victims from the car in which they were trapped, the 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims' identities were not available late Saturday. At least two of the 
victims were small children, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the injured were taken to Ventura County Medical Center by helicopter, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 One witness, Edna Blanco, said the accident was caused by a dark-colored 
Lincoln that was swerving in and out of traffic and sped from the scene. 
Blanco, who lives nearby, said she called 911 to report the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 A CHP spokeswoman confirmed Blanco's account and said authorities were 
searching for a dark-colored Lincoln that may have triggered the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 The multi-vehicle accident on the Ventura Freeway in Santa Barbara County near 
Carpinteria occurred about 5 p.m. and backed up southbound traffic for several 
hours, the CHP said. The victims were taken to St. Francis Hospital in Santa 
Barbara, while CHP personnel cleared the highway, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the number of victims nor their conditions were available late 
Saturday. SCOTT HADLY

FOREST SERVICE FACING MOUNTAINS OF TRASH; PARKS: OFFICIALS SAY WATER QUALITY 
AND SCENIC BEAUTY ARE THREATENED BY EXCESSIVE GARBAGE AND WASTE CREATED BY 
VISITORS TO SAN GABRIEL CANYON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year, Donna Thompson found a dinette set during the annual Operation 
Supersweep in San Gabriel Canyon. The year before that, Marie Lopez stumbled 
upon a bag of hypodermic needles. 
</P>
<P>
 This year the pickup yielded more routine refuse: three tons of bottle caps, 
food wrappers, beer cartons and used diapers, all artifacts of the canyon's 3 
million annual visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 With burgeoning urban areas pushing up against the mountains of the Angeles 
National Forest, as many as 30,000 people visit San Gabriel Canyon each day on 
summer weekends, bringing with them some of the urban ills they seek to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 The scars of recreational use are evident along the stream bed. A paper plate, 
still smeared with food, floats in the water. Graffiti disfigures the rugged 
canyon wall. A box full of plastic soda bottles and picnic debris sits nearby, 
along with several soiled diapers. Squirrels scamper in an overflowing trash 
bin. The bathroom of a nearby picnic area is swamped with used toilet paper and 
puddles of urine. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Los Angeles County Health Department, human waste and other 
pollution in the stream could spread disease among swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is outrageous in terms of the threat you have for public health," said 
Dennis Rose, a cabin owner in the canyon who has made a personal quest of 
wiping out graffiti and clearing trash. "This terrifies families, so you have a 
lot of people that come up here, they see this and they don't come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Canyon plunges south toward Azusa out of the San Gabriel 
Mountains, branching off into east and west forks near the bottom. Altogether, 
about 35 miles of stream are accessible to visitors on foot or in cars. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the most popular of several canyons in the U.S. Forest Service's Mt. 
Baldy District near Azusa, but Tom Spencer, recreation director for the 
district, said the problems there are typical of the district as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people go to a place that's trashed, people think, 'That's the way it's 
supposed to be and someone's going to come in and clean up after me,' " said 
Spencer. "We call it a stadium mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 But the district doesn't have the resources to go picking up after humanity. 
The budget that includes maintenance along undeveloped areas of the streams and 
roadsides is $76,100 this year, down 20% from last year. Last year, three 
Forest Service employees covered those areas; now there's only one. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer said, however, that additional funds from parking fees may allow the 
Forest Service to hire another staffer and provide more toilet and trash 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 There are nine permanent toilet facilities in the canyon and six pairs of 
portables. That's more than there used to be, but the area really needs three 
to four times that number of portables, Spencer said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to 1992 we didn't have portable toilets," he said. "There was a lot 
more human waste scattered around the canyon bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to improve conditions, Rose, the cabin owner, has alerted county 
health officials to the potential environmental dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter he wrote last August to Jack Petralia, director of environmental 
protection for the county's Department of Health Services, prompted the 
department to investigate the health risks of litter next to the stream. 
</P>
<P>
 Petralia, in turn, wrote to Forest Supervisor Michael Rogers in September, 
saying that trash, soiled baby diapers and human feces were found in the stream 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Water from the San Gabriel River is collected and treated by the Covina 
Irrigation District and wholesaled to numerous public water supply systems in 
the San Gabriel Valley," Petralia wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Water quality data from the Los Angeles County Public Works Department was 
inadequate to determine the health risk, he said, but "conditions observed 
along the stream beds indicate that water contamination from human excrement is 
likely." 
</P>
<P>
 Any contaminants would be filtered out at the water treatment facility, 
Petralia said, and would not threaten drinking water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 But they could be a problem for swimmers who get a mouthful, he cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from warning swimmers not to drink the water, there's little his agency 
can do. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems is that this isn't like Puddingstone or Santa Fe Dam, 
where they're easily closed," he said. "This is open, so how do you keep people 
out without sending an army of cops in there?" 
</P>
<P>
 You don't, Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "National forests are open," he said. "They're designed to be used by the 
general public. Individuals take on a lot of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, visitors do accept the responsibility. The Forest Service 
scatters 30 large roll-away trash bins throughout the area, and people use 
them. But the trash overfills the bins, which are emptied once a week -- not 
often enough to keep up with the stacks of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers noticed during a 1989 study that canyon users tried to stack 
garbage as neatly as possible next to full trash bins or trash cans, Spencer 
said. But animals -- raccoons, foxes, squirrels and bears -- would scavenge for 
snacks at night, scattering the refuse up to 50 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Forest Service can't schedule more frequent pickups right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're limping along on one worn-out garbage truck," Spencer said, 
adding that a new one should be on hand by the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 To fill the gap between the resources available and the resources needed to 
maintain the canyon, the Forest Service relies on volunteers as well as court 
referrals -- primarily those convicted of misdemeanors and sentenced to 
community service. Members of numerous private and public groups also chip in 
on weekends, helping with maintenance and education. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most extensive efforts involves Ecoteams, a collaboration among the 
Forest Service, the Los Angeles Conservation Corps and the California 
Environmental Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams provide bilingual safety and environmental information to forest 
users, as well as jobs to young men and women from inner-city areas of Los 
Angeles. Workers hike the forest in pairs, explaining to visitors why garbage 
must be packed out, and how to avoid trampling stream vegetation. They also 
warn about forest hazards such as poison oak or diving into a shallow pool of 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-seven Ecoteam members work in the Angeles National Forest each weekend. 
They are paid $35 to $80 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Environmental Project also coordinates scheduled cleanups by 20 
to 60 volunteers. The groups remove litter in San Gabriel Canyon about twice a 
month, but once again, garbage pickup is a stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have so many volunteers cleaning up trash that the Forest Service can't 
keep up with the bags," said Scott Mathes, executive director of the 
organization. "Sometimes the bags sit there for two or three days, and by then 
sometimes the animals get to it and scatter it into the streams." 
</P>
<P>
 Another partnership is the annual Operation Supersweep, co-sponsored since 
1980 by the county Agriculture Department, the Hughes Ecology Club, the Boy 
Scouts of America and the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in the early morning, hundreds of volunteers ranging from 
grade-school children to grandparents are shuttled to sites in the canyon, 
where they turn the task of trash collecting into a family outing. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the scouring efforts of 383 volunteers left the canyon in as close 
to pristine condition as possible, although they knew it wouldn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be surprised. In a few weeks, it builds back up again," said Marie 
Lopez, one of the event's coordinators. "The next big dump is going to be the 
Fourth of July weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, less than two weeks after the June 4 volunteer cleanup, the stream 
bed already was littered anew with cans, disposable diapers and other trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The canyon's last line of defense is Dennis Rose, who has single-handedly 
vowed to keep the canyon's main road, California 39, graffiti-free. Spencer 
calls Rose "a one-man graffiti-cleaning machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Spencer said, Rose is registered as a volunteer with the Forest Service, 
which pays for the paint he uses to cover graffiti along the highway. Rose 
estimates that previously he spent $1,400 of his own money on the chore. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving along the winding road, Rose pointed out the square gray patches that 
mark his efforts. But he pulled over and sighed in frustration over a new batch 
of blue and black insignias scrawled on rocks along the canyon wall. That would 
take a team of workers with steam-cleaning equipment to remove. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's an area that's in need of just some tender loving care," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose is eager to take on such a project, but he said his hands are tied by 
Forest Service regulations limiting the involvement of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer said the Forest Service is legally responsible for volunteers and 
cannot recruit more people than it has the staff to oversee. Ironically, the 
same staff cuts that hinder the Forest Service's ability to provide basic 
services also keeps it from using volunteers to pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 To Rose, who grew up in the area, witnessing the forest's degradation is like 
watching the slow decline of an old friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to ride up here on a bicycle when I was a kid," he said. "The canyon 
used to be much more pristine. The Forest Service (officials) haven't 
redeployed their resources to adjust to the number of people using this 
canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer said the problem is that funding for national forests is set up on a 
uniform scale, regardless of the rate of recreational use. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to national forests in rural areas, "urban national forests are much 
more highly impacted by use, because we're dealing with urban problems and 
urban issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angeles National Forest currently represents 70% of the open space in Los 
Angeles County, Spencer said. By 2015, it will probably represent 90% of the 
county's undeveloped land. As open space throughout the county shrinks, the 
forest will become more precious -- and more threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a big psychological reassurance there to say I can see the 
mountains and there aren't houses all over them," he said, "to be able to wake 
up after a storm and see the snowcap."

MEMORIES OF THE VIETNAM WAR HAUNT SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFUGEES; IMMIGRANTS: A 
DESPERATE FATHER YEARNS TO PROVIDE FOR HIS FAMILY IN CHINATOWN. HIS PLIGHT IS 
TYPICAL OF MANY ENMESHED IN THE WELFARE 'SAFETY NET.'

<P>
 Taped to the wall of Ho Hoang's Chinatown apartment is a handwritten 
Vietnamese proverb that in English means: "On the outside, things look pretty. 
But on the inside, there's misery." 
</P>
<P>
 But as Hoang and his 12-year-old twin daughters, Tam and Thien, gather on the 
floor of their virtually barren apartment, their eyes can't disguise the 
sadness that comes from years of poverty, misfortune and family separations. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Hoang arrived in the United States with his mother and 
daughters with the hope of settling into a comfortable life and eventually 
sending for the girls' mother in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 But the family still depends on $800 a month in welfare because Hoang's heart 
is failing and he can't find a job. The girls' mother, who is Hoang's second 
wife, can't leave Vietnam. And Hoang -- a slight man with skeletal features and 
sullen eyes -- is haunted by memories of spending three years in a Communist 
re-education camp, where he was tortured, starved and brainwashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Weighed with such burdens, the 57-year-old immigrant now believes his only 
option is to give his daughters away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love my daughters very much, but if some family would take care of them, I 
would sign the papers," Hoang said through an interpreter, as his eyes filled 
with tears. "I don't want to see my daughters grow up in poverty. . . . Life is 
not bright for me. I just want to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Hoang, many recent Southeast Asian refugees arrived in the United States 
with dreams of prosperity, but are now living in despair and poverty. Along 
with speaking little or no English and having limited education and job skills, 
many Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian and other Southeast Asian refugees carry 
horrifying war memories that make it difficult for them to adapt to a new 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 A recently released UCLA report found that a higher percentage of Southeast 
Asians in California receive welfare benefits than any other ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of Southeast Asian adults in California live in households that 
receive Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), according to the 
report, which was issued by UCLA's Asian American Studies Center and the 
nonprofit group Leadership Education for Asian Pacifics. And while Southeast 
Asians are only 13% of the total Asian American population in California, they 
account for up to 87% of Asian Americans on welfare.  
</P>
<P>
 "Given the multitude of problems ranging from the lack of English-language 
ability to pre-immigration trauma, it is inevitable that a large percentage of 
refugees would rely on this 'safety net,' " the report said. And "once within 
the welfare system, many have a difficult time escaping." 
</P>
<P>
 The first large wave of Southeast Asian refugees started coming to the United 
States in 1975, after the end of the Vietnam War. Between 1975 and 1978, 
178,000 refugees arrived, mostly from Vietnam and some from Laos. More than a 
million Southeast Asians now live in the United States, according to the 1990 
U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
 "U.S. citizens opened their arms to the first wave of refugees because they 
felt sorry for what happened in Vietnam," said Loc Nam Nguyen, a 1975 
Vietnamese immigrant and director of Catholic Charities' Immigration and 
Refugee Department in Los Angeles. "The first wave of refugees also were 
well-educated and were able to easily get jobs with the help of their 
sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
 A second large wave of refugees fled Southeast Asia in 1978, including many 
Cambodians, Laotians and ethnic Chinese from Vietnam. Many of the refugees who 
came during the past decade are former political prisoners or families who 
spent long periods in refugee camps and have little or no education. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Vietnam War, Hoang served in the Vietnamese Air Force, which fought 
alongside American troops. After the war, Hoang and others who fought against 
the Communists were sent to re-education camps. 
</P>
<P>
 While Hoang was imprisoned, his first wife left him for another man. After his 
release, he met another woman, and they later had Tam and Thien. But because 
the couple never obtained a marriage license, Hoang's second wife can't legally 
join her family in the United States, Hoang said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I think about is how she can come here," Hoang said. "I'm very lonely, 
and my daughters need their mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoang and his family first lived with his sister in Massachusetts when they 
arrived. But after a few weeks, arguments erupted and the Hoangs were kicked 
out of the home. 
</P>
<P>
 With no job, money or friends, they made their way to Los Angeles, and Tam and 
Thien began attending Castelar Elementary School in Chinatown. Since then, 
Hoang's heart condition has worsened, and the girls have grown increasingly 
despondent over the separation from their mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dream is to bring my mom over here and for my dad to be healthy," Thien 
Hoang said in Vietnamese. "I worry about that a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other former war prisoners, Hoang is depressed and cannot talk about 
his past experiences without getting angry or flustered. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of refugees are suffering from post-traumatic stress and other 
emotional problems, and are not even at the point where they can find a job," 
said Rano Saing, a counselor at the Indochinese Counseling and Treatment Clinic 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come here and they get depressed. They feel numb and their minds are 
blank because they've been suffering for such a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Saing said that after the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh in 1975, one of his 
clients was in a Cambodian hospital when troops stormed in and shot everyone 
but her. Another client who also was about to be killed by the Khmer Rouge on 
another occasion fainted and was buried alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing she remembers was waking up in the dirt with dead bodies 
around her," Saing said. "She had to dig herself out of the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you expect someone who has experienced something like this to come 
here and then go right to work or school?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although the refugees managed to survive and escape the war-torn conditions of 
their native countries, they are still in "survival mode," said Dore Wong, 
principal of Castelar Elementary, where about 20% of the school's 1,100 
students are Southeast Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a bleakness to their lives because they believe they have no 
future," Wong said. "They just live for the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers are quite familiar with the sad plight of recent refugees, 
which can often tear families like the Hoangs apart, but they said it's 
difficult for them to reach out to everyone because many refugees are reluctant 
to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Vietnam, people rely only on their immediate families," said Mimi Ngoc Anh 
Nguyen, program director of the Indochinese Youth Center in Gardena. "Here, if 
you need help, you need to go outside your family. But Vietnamese people 
believe that's very shameful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Services are also somewhat limited for Southeast Asian refugees who speak 
little or no English. 
</P>
<P>
 "The persistence of welfare dependency is due to the lack of realistic 
services to help (Southeast Asian) refugees," said Deborah Ching, executive 
director of the Chinatown Service Center. "Counseling is not readily available 
because resources are limited and language assistance is minimal." 
</P>
<P>
 While Vietnamese in Orange County and Cambodians in Long Beach tend to have 
access to a variety of counseling, parenting and job-training services because 
of their large numbers in those areas, Southeast Asians in Central Los Angeles 
and other parts of Los Angeles County have a more difficult time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Los Angeles County is home to about 114,000 Southeast Asians -- 
compared to 81,000 in Orange County -- only 33,000 Southeast Asians live in the 
city of Los Angeles, according to the 1990 U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. is not like Orange County, where you get services in the same area you 
live in," said Lee Nguyen, a specialist at the Indochinese Youth Center. 
"Everything is spread out here, and people don't know how to access the 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975, which initially 
was enacted for two years, enabled refugees to receive a variety of financial 
assistance from the government. Although the 1977 expiration date was extended, 
the federal government slowly has withdrawn its resources from refugee 
assistance programs and directed refugees to regular public aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came in 1975, the government was prepared to help us," said Tri Le, 
director of the Indochinese Counseling and Treatment Clinic in Los Angeles and 
a native of Vietnam. "Someone came to my house to teach me English. And by 
1977, we were off welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Some 59% of Southeast Asian refugees in California who arrived between 1985 
and 1990 have less than a high school education, compared to only 38% of the 
refugees who came between 1975 and 1979, according to the 1990 U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
 "To them, welfare is free money," Le said. "And they know that if they got a 
job, they probably would only make minimum wage, which wouldn't be enough to 
support their families."

HOW'S THIS FOR JUSTICE?; PUNISHMENT TO FIT THE CRIME MIGHT BE JARRING ENOUGH 
FOR EARTHQUAKE OPPORTUNISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By now, you've heard a lot about the folks who have taken advantage of the 
effects of the Northridge earthquake by occupying or stealing from abandoned 
buildings. But there have been many examples of people-turned-parasites that 
have received much less attention. Some are emerging through the court system; 
and a bill that would protect consumers from other kinds of disaster-related 
abuse is slowly making its way through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Just this week, a federal judge found an appropriate way to deal with a Carson 
woman who claimed to be a resident of the Northridge Meadows Apartments, where 
16 died. Denise Jones now has eight days to produce a cashier's check for 
$2,300 for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the same amount that she 
illegally obtained in aid. 
</P>
<P>
 She should also be assigned to clean up the quake-related rubble that remains 
there -- with something as inadequate to the task as a child's sandbox shovel. 
</P>
<P>
 And if those folks hired by FEMA to conduct earthquake damage inspections -- 
at $39 each -- are found to have truly fabricated several dozen of those 
reports, we have an idea for them. They ought to be assigned to write out the 
next federal budget -- in longhand. In some presidential administrations, that 
document is about equal in size and depth to three very thick copies of the 
Pacific Bell Yellow Pages. Talk about writer's cramp. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a bill by Assemblyman Richard Katz that would outlaw outlandish 
price gouging during natural disasters will be considered by the Senate 
Judiciary Committee this week. Too bad it can't include a provision that would 
allow the gouging victim a free five-minute shopping spree in the offending 
merchant's place of business. That would be a splendid punishment for those who 
tripled the price of plywood, quintupled the price of batteries and demanded a 
tenfold increase in the price of spring water.

5 TOP UCLA POLICE POSTS CUT IN DEPARTMENT REORGANIZATION; SECURITY: ALL 
LIEUTENANTS IN THE BELEAGUERED 55-MEMBER FORCE ARE LAID OFF. THE NEW CHIEF SAYS 
THE MOVES WERE MADE 'STRICTLY FOR ECONOMIC REASONS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to streamline a campus police force that had become a nest of worker 
discontent, UCLA has laid off all five lieutenants in the 55-member department 
and eliminated three other management jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly appointed Police Chief Clarence Chapman, under orders to trim 11% of his 
department's $9.5-million budget as part of university-wide reductions, 
described the layoffs as unavoidable and unrelated to a rash of grievances and 
lawsuits filed by department workers in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization "was strictly for economic reasons," said Chapman, who 
became chief June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts are expected to save at least $499,000 without reducing campus 
patrols or other services, university officials said. More cuts are possible, 
said June Trader, assistant to Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the departing lieutenants, Michael Shain, is named as a co-defendant in 
six lawsuits by former and current police officers, most of them minorities, 
alleging they were subjected to discriminatory treatment by their superiors and 
that university officials failed to take corrective action. UCLA has declined 
to comment on the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, however, strongly denied that the legal skirmishing influenced the 
way the department was reorganized. 
</P>
<P>
 He praised all five lieutenants, stressing that none "were under 
investigation" or "the subject of any negative performance evaluations." The 
problem, he said, was that the department had become top-heavy with 13 
administrators, including the five lieutenants -- half of the lieutenants in 
the entire University of California system. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reach the lieutenants -- Shain, Terry Baker, Jim Kuehn, Dave Peitz 
and Don Boyarski -- were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Three non-sworn employees were also laid off: Kit Espinoza, director of 
administrative services; Donna Capraro, assistant director of administrative 
services, and Dave Camonero, budget director. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, who won kudos for his work as a Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department captain in West Hollywood, has vowed to focus on improving 
communication within the UCLA Police Department, upgrading equipment and 
assuring that officers have access to up-to-date training, which has lagged in 
past years. 
</P>
<P>
 With the departure of the lieutenants, management duties will be consolidated 
under three captains, one of whom is Karl Ross, who served as acting police 
chief until Chapman's appointment. UCLA officers, bridling under what they 
described as outdated leadership, directed a vote of no confidence against Ross 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote persuaded administrative Vice Chancellor John Curry, who oversees the 
department, to hire an outside consultant to survey the department and 
recommend changes. Curry could not be reached for comment, but in a university 
press release he predicted the reorganization would lead to a more efficiently 
run department that would ultimately provide greater security despite the staff 
cuts. He emphasized that no officers working beats were let go. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization was greeted with guarded optimism by one of the litigants, 
Sgt. Rick Sanchez, who called it an important first step to improving the 
beleaguered force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morale in the department seems to be going up," Sanchez said. "The problem is 
we're still in the baby stage."

ART PROCESS A BOOMING SHRINKING BUSINESS; TORRANCE: A STUDIO USES A PAINSTAKING 
PROCEDURE CALLED SERIGRAPH TO REPRODUCE DESIGNS IN SMALLER SIZES. IT CAN TAKE 
UP TO THREE MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Painter Leslie Sayour likes to splash color across big canvases when she 
paints. 
</P>
<P>
 But Japanese consumers, who pay as much as $55,000 for her impressionistic oil 
paintings, want art that fits into their small homes. 
</P>
<P>
 So Sayour, who sells most of her work in Japan, takes her paintings to Kolibri 
Art Studio in Torrance, where Herta Hedrick uses a painstaking printing 
technique called serigraphy to reproduce the designs in smaller sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 The prints, valued between $2,500 and $3,500, look so much like an original 
painting that it can be hard to tell the two apart. Typically, artists request 
200 to 500 copies of each work. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the studio opened at 2908 Oregon Court 3 1/2 years ago, it has 
reproduced about 55 works. Only about five studios in the Los Angeles area do 
fine-art serigraph printing.  
</P>
<P>
 Serigraphers separate and print each color in a painting. For brightly colored 
works such as Sayour's, each print passes through the press more than 100 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 The layers of ink coat the canvas and combine colors to duplicate the effects 
created by an oil painter. Special overlays of web-like black lines imitate the 
artist's brush strokes. Five artists work full time for Hedrick to separate the 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes up to three months to complete a reproduction. Because of the hour it 
takes to set up the machine and the time it takes to dry, only about three 
colors can be put on each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedrick said the hardest part of her business is finding workers patient 
enough to endure the handiwork who also have an artistic sense. It takes 
technical skills and a good eye to do the work well.

WORLD CUP USA '94; COMMENTARY; PLAY OF MEXICO'S CAPED CRUSADERS LEAVES NATION 
BULLISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter how many times you have seen the entrance of the bullfighters, it is 
always a thrilling experience. They come out not in single file, for that would 
denigrate the fellow in last position, but side by side, as if all were equal, 
which is the case as the fight begins.  
</P>
<P>
 -- MEXICO 
</P>
<P>
 James Michener 
</P>
<P>
 So it will be Tuesday, in the late afternoon shadows of an American football 
stadium in New Jersey, when the current matadors of Mexico enter side by side, 
as if they were equal, which will be the case as the fight begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Their names are Luis Garcia and Jorge Campos, and unlike the fictional 
Victoriano Leal and Juan Gomez of Michener's 1960s Mexico, their opponent will 
not be life-threatening nor possessed of razor-sharp horns. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the World Cup soccer game that Garcia and Campos will play against 
Bulgaria, there will be many of the same elements of cultural passion that 
Michener threads through his story of two bullfighters. The people and the plot 
are fiction, the essence of the place, Mexico, is not. 
</P>
<P>
 From well before the start of this monthlong World Cup, to its present point 
in the round of 16, the path of Mexico's soccer team has been an emotional 
roller coaster. That's not just for the team, but for its country, which, as 
much or more than any soccer-mad place, ebbs and flows with its football 
failure and success. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 4, Mexico came to the Rose Bowl to play the U.S. national team in what 
is known in soccer as a friendly. That means the match doesn't matter in any 
sort of official qualifying, but is listed in the win-loss columns of the team 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 But this one mattered greatly, no matter how it was labeled. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 91,123 turned out, and while that was the largest gathering ever to 
see the U.S. team play on U.S. soil, the crowd was clearly there to see the 
team the United States was playing. The Arroyo was a sea of green, orange and 
white; the colors of the Mexican flag, and the flag itself, dominated the scene 
like few things other than the Wisconsin Badgers' avalanche of red six months 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 With two weeks to the World Cup opener, it was a dress rehearsal for Mexico. 
It was the last full-makeup run-through before its return to the international 
soccer scene after an embarrassing eight-year absence caused by a 
disqualification from the 1990 World Cup. The Mexican Soccer Federation had 
sent a team to a junior tournament, and some of the team members weren't all 
that junior. The Mexicans had lied about some of the players' ages, and FIFA, 
the same international sanctioning group that fines coaches thousands of 
dollars for harmless arguments with referees and suspends players from entire 
games for not standing properly in line for free kicks, booted Mexico from the 
1990 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that Mexico was the soccer power of this section of the world. No 
matter that Mexico had hosted the World Cup in Mexico City just four years 
earlier, and had run a generally successful event for FIFA after Colombia had 
backed out. With FIFA, history has made things like that clear: March at high 
noon with them and they will always draw first and step easily over the fallen 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 So it had been a long road back to June 4 in the Rose Bowl, and one of the 
bumps along the way had been the replacement as coach of popular Luis Menotti 
with Miguel Mejia Baron. Baron was a former dentist and a protege of U.S. Coach 
Bora Milutinovic, Mexico's coach in the '86 Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The day was hot, the fans were torrid and the Mexican team was awful in a 1-0 
loss. Losing in soccer is one thing, even in a friendly. But losing to a 
country that has demonstrated success with its feet only on "American 
Bandstand" was reason for shame. The Mexican flags and their carriers slinked 
off into the sunset, unhappy and fearful of the important days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 19, the third day of the tournament, Mexico played Norway in its first 
of three games in the Group E draw that had quickly, upon its creation at the 
World Cup soccer draw in late December in Las Vegas, taken on the nickname 
"Group of Death." Besides Mexico and Norway, the group included soccer power 
Italy and darkhorse Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 When the draw took place, Mexico had expected -- some said been assured -- 
that it would end up in a group headquartered in Dallas. That would put it very 
close to a huge friendly fan base. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Mexicans heard they were in a group with Ireland and Italy, and would 
play their games along an Eastern seaboard much more heavily populated with 
Irish and Italian fans, their soccer contingent marched out of the Las Vegas 
Convention Center, site of the draw, in a huff. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, after their 1-0 embarrassment in the Rose Bowl, they marched 
out again in a huff, exiting the Rose Bowl through a back door with nary a word 
to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was a team in a sulk that played Norway June 19, and lost, 1-0. Aging 
star Hugo Sanchez, one of only two Mexicans playing in Europe in the 
prestigious Spanish League, hadn't played against the United States on June 4, 
but faced Norway. Just weeks short of his 36th birthday, Sanchez looked slow 
and ineffective. The second-guessing of Mejia Baron was in full bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 But the resilient Mexican fans arrived in force in Orlando June 24 for the 
second game in the group, truly a death struggle with Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 On one of the many planes in, a stockbroker from Monterrey who had made his 
connection in Dallas, fretted and tried to think positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not think we will win, but I want us so much to, because soccer means so 
much to my country," said the stockbroker, Mauricio Calderon. "My father 
planned this trip for so long, so we come, even after Norway." 
</P>
<P>
 At the game, there were fewer Mexican flags than in the Rose Bowl on June 4, 
but thousands of shirts and hats that read: "Confia en Mexico." Believe in 
Mexico. Have faith in Mexico, in our team. 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost a plaintive plea. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the 44th minute against Ireland, it happened and it all seemed to 
turn around from that moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, 11 years younger than Sanchez and the other Mexicans playing in the 
big leagues in Spain, was moved to the right side forward position, from his 
normal center striker spot. Sanchez was on the bench. Carlos Hermosillo, who 
hadn't played against Norway at all, shoveled a neat little pass just outside 
the penalty box and dead center to the goal. Garcia struck like a striker 
should, lashing the ball past veteran Irish goalkeeper Pat Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico had gone from June 4 until the waning moments of the first half of the 
Ireland game 20 days later -- probably close to 240 minutes of playing time 
including injury time -- with nary a goal. When they piled on Garcia in 
celebration, you could almost feel an entire country breathe a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia scored again in the second half, Mexico had a 2-1 lead and all the 
healing that a World Cup victory would bring was close at hand. But then Andy 
Townsend, Ireland's sandy-haired captain and midfielder, got an opening just 
outside the box and to the left of goal in the 81st minute. He sent a 
screaming, dipping shot that had a real chance until goalkeeper Campos darted 
left and directed the ball wide of the net. The 2-1 victory was preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, the fans went to Church Street Station in Orlando and celebrated 
well into the morning hours. Suddenly, there were more flags again and fewer of 
the "Confia en Mexico" hats and shirts. They believed again. They had lived 
another day in the Group of Death. Garcia and Campos had taken red capes and 
swords and subdued the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday, the day before Mexico was to play Italy in Washington, D.C. in 
its last game of group play, a youngster headed for the metal detector in the 
Orlando airport. He was perhaps 10 years old, and he wore a sombrero with a 
huge rim. As he stepped through the metal detector, the hat was brushed off. He 
tried once, twice, then a third time. The sombrero was just too wide. 
Undeterred, he tried a fourth time, tilting his head just enough and slipping 
through. His family, laughing as they watched, saluted his final success in 
bullfighting terms: "Ole! Ole! Pedro." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Italy, Garcia and Campos, now clearly the team's matadors, played 
beautifully, but Italy scored first. With Ireland and Norway playing 
simultaneously in Giants Stadium and heading for a 0-0 tie that would leave 
each with four points in the final group standings, a loss by Mexico would 
leave it with three points and Italy with six, meaning Mexico would be out. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Mexican fans were there in full force, believing in Mexico. As their 
team's short passing game got clicking, they greeted each movement with a 
rhythmic "Ole! Ole! Ole!" And suddenly Marcelino Bernal connected with a 
25-yard shot that not only brought the eventual 1-1 tie, but placed Mexico atop 
Group E's final standings. No death there, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Mexico can make history. Never before has a Mexican soccer team 
advanced to the quarterfinals outside of the World Cups held in its country in 
1970 and 1986. The leaders, of course, will be Garcia and Campos, legends now 
from Cancun to Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
 In Michener's book, Victoriano Leal is the Spaniard, the finesse bullfighter 
with grace and careful style and the lighter complexion of his Basque roots; 
Juan Gomez is the Mexican Indian through and through, a rough-skinned rogue 
with strength and power and a thirst for the thrill and danger of living on the 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Garcia mirrors Michener's Leal, Jorge Campos mirrors Michener's Gomez. 
Whether the fight is with bulls or Bulgarians, Mexico worships its warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, in Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands of New Jersey, Garcia and Gomez 
will enter, side by side, as equals, the Spaniard and the Mexican Indian, their 
country's soccer matadors as the fight begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Ole! Mexico.

WORLD CUP USA '94; A SHALLOW POOL; MLS WANTS TO STOCK ROSTERS WITH HOME-GROWN 
PLAYERS, BUT WHO WILL BE AVAILABLE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In attempting to figure out who will play in the fledgling organization known 
as Major League Soccer, perhaps the simplest and quickest way of defining the 
situation is to answer the question with a question. 
</P>
<P>
 Who won't play?  
</P>
<P>
 For starters, we'll take a look at the World Cup roster of the U.S. national 
team and start crossing off players who have been under contract and might be 
returning to teams in Mexico and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 They include goalkeepers Brad Friedel (England) and Juergen Sommer (England), 
defenders Thomas Dooley (Germany) and Cle Kooiman (Mexico), midfielders John 
Harkes (England) and Tab Ramos (Spain), forwards Eric Wynalda (Germany), Frank 
Klopas (Greece), Roy Wegerle (England) and Ernie Stewart (Netherlands). 
Midfielder Hugo Perez seems set to return to Saudi Arabia where he played the 
1992-93 season. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other Americans who could have been on the World Cup team if not for 
injury or other rationales but are also under contract to European clubs -- 
goalkeeper Kasey Keller (England) and defender Brian Bliss (Germany), to name 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 The very success of the Americans in the World Cup is double-edged. It is 
promoting awareness and marketability of the top players, and, at the same 
time, teams from across the pond can't help but notice certain individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely a week into the World Cup, national team general manager Bill Nuttall 
said there was a great deal of interest in at least four Americans. German 
clubs are said to be eyeing defender Marcelo Balboa and fleet 
forward/midfielder Cobi Jones. Injured midfielder Claudio Reyna previously had 
been courted by FC Barcelona. This could bring the number of non-available 
players off the U.S. roster to 14. 
</P>
<P>
 If you needed to identify a prototypical American player for MLS, two 
immediately come to mind -- defender Alexi Lalas and goalkeeper Tony Meola, the 
sort of charismatic, trend-setting players around which leagues attempt to 
build. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our top concern is to have players who are capable of an approach to 
entertaining, attacking soccer," said Sunil Gulati of MLS, who is the chief 
international officer of competition for World Cup '94. "Their first 
responsibility is selling the sport on the field. We do plan to work with the 
community but their primary work has to be on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lalas and Meola are more valuable because they can sell the sport off the 
field, appealing to various cross-sections of the public and crossing over to 
casual fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Meola has expressed interest in playing in MLS but says an offer from Europe 
could change his mind. And there's competition from other sports. Meola, 
drafted by the New York Yankees out of high school, is scheduled to attend the 
Kansas City Chief training camp on July 22, where he'll have a tryout as a 
kicker. 
</P>
<P>
 Lalas is curious about MLS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a point of asking for all the paperwork because, man, this is my 
future," he said. "I want to know what's going on. I'm not sporting the party 
line when I say I'm optimistic and impressed with the amount of research that's 
going into it.  
</P>
<P>
 "They've looked at past leagues that have failed and why they failed and the 
leagues that have succeeded -- like the J-League in Japan. The organization and 
research has been tremendous. It pays for me to be optimistic. It's the future 
of soccer and who knows if I play in it or not? I might get an offer to go 
overseas, but you never know." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the best of circumstances, if Meola and Lalas decide to play in MLS 
and the other remaining members of the U.S. team opt to do the same, that's 
only eight players and not all of them are recognizable. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are the rest of the players for the proposed 12-team league coming from? 
</P>
<P>
 Gulati said that three foreigners a team will be allowed, possibly four for 
the first season of play. That's 48 more players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to build the league around U.S.-based players," Gulati said. That 
would represent the flip side of the late NASL. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it's clear who won't be in MLS, who will? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can give you an answer because they don't know. Because there are no 
players," says Al Mistri, soccer coach at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri and others suggest the players might come from the post-college ranks. 
Of the 33 All-Americans each season, approximately 20 or so are seniors and 
would be eligible for the MLS player pool. 
</P>
<P>
 But there will be competition for those players, just like there is for every 
other player. The American Professional Soccer League has a large pool of 
players under contract. And even its officials are conservative on estimates of 
capable college players available. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are maybe 20 to 25 players who come out of the U.S. college system 
every year who can play top-level pro soccer immediately," said Alan Hinton, 
president and coach of the Seattle Sounders. 
</P>
<P>
 William De La Pena, APSL commissioner and owner of the Los Angeles Salsa, says 
the number is closer to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 For players, there are other concerns besides money. There has to be a high 
level of play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing for me is that it's got to be competitive," Harkes 
said. "To give all that up to come back here, that's going to be a difficult 
decision. They've got to make it worth my while." 
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda, who recently signed with FC Bochum in Germany, said the new league 
could not afford him. And he's right. There's not just the issue of salaries 
but also of transfer fees, the money that must be paid to a player's club for 
the rights to his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also have to realize they have to compete financially," Lalas said. "I'm 
not naive, the money has to be right. I'm as pure as anybody else, but you 
still have to make a living. And athletics are so different. The frame of time 
when you make your money is so short. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they have to realize they have to compete with player salaries and 
they're gonna do that and they're gonna have to pay. But I think they're 
getting a damn good product, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The marketplace is crowded. So many teams, so many leagues, and so few quality 
players to go around.

WORLD CUP USA '94; A MODEL FAILURE; THE NASL'S COLLAPSE SERVES AS A PAINFUL 
REMINDER OF WHAT A NEW LEAGUE SHOULD NOT DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Cosmos did everything in a big way. The franchise's collapse was 
no different. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1975 to the early 1980s, the Cosmos were the flagship franchise of the 
North American Soccer League, America's first and last major outdoor 
professional soccer league. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Cosmos failed, the league failed with them, and with the league went 
all of soccer's credibility as marketable entertainment in the United States, 
the world's largest entertainment market. 
</P>
<P>
 In their heyday, the Cosmos played before crowds of more than 70,000 in the 
Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J. They had international star power -- at 
one time the Cosmos had 14 nationalities represented on their roster. And they 
had Pele. 
</P>
<P>
 They were New York, and they were huge. 
</P>
<P>
 And anyone with links to the team is still blamed for ruining soccer in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Brickley, the president of Sportslink, a New York sports promotional 
firm, was the vice president of broadcasting and public relations for the 
Cosmos, and he still is defensive about the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't consider ourselves to be competing with (NASL franchises in) Tulsa 
and Tampa Bay," Brickley said. "We were competing with the Yankees and the Mets 
and Lincoln Center." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cosmos drew 70,000 to games by signing Pele, Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio 
Chinaglia, former World Cup stars whose skills were diminished when they 
arrived in New York, but whose drawing power had not. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt, if we're going to do it, we have to get the big-time guys," Brickley 
said. "We knew that (the NASL) would not work on a minor league level. Our 
ethnic fan base demanded the big-time names." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cosmos were owned by Warner Communications, which could afford high-priced 
international talent. The rest of the league, largely owned by individuals or 
small-time partnerships struggling to fill modest payrolls, was outclassed. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brickley: "They'd say, 'Well, we can't be the NFL, but since my kid plays 
soccer, we can be the Houston or Memphis NASL team.' Those owners that tried to 
keep up quickly went belly-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think they needed to. No league has ever done badly with a dynasty 
in it. All leagues have to have somebody to hate like the Yankees or Green Bay 
in their heyday." 
</P>
<P>
 With Warner pumping money into the roster, the Cosmos won four championships 
in six years, and the rest of the league, which fluctuated from a peak of 24 
teams to a low of five, had to do something . 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to keep pace, team after team burned itself out. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Wall played briefly with the NASL before becoming the coach of the 
now-defunct California Surf and L.A. Lazers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NASL was one of the reasons I came from England," Wall said. "When the 
Cosmos brought in the stars, it pushed the average salary up. The (Cosmos') 
salaries were used as a comparison just like any other sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the NASL, American fans have seen leagues of all shapes and sizes come 
and go. Mostly go. None have brought soccer to the national consciousness, or 
even network TV, the way the NASL tried to. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made some critical mistakes, chief among them expanding from 12 to 24 
teams without researching and carefully planning the ownership groups," 
Brickley said. "Then (when a franchise failed) you couldn't go back into those 
cities because you've left a bad taste in their mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Major League Soccer, the first attempt at a high-profile pro league 
since the NASL. 
</P>
<P>
 The MLS is already ahead of the NASL in some ways. 
</P>
<P>
 NASL TV advertising was sold locally. The MLS is recruiting national sponsors. 
As the NBA, NFL and Major League baseball have made prospective expansion 
owners jump through endless hoops to come aboard, the MLS is showing 
selectivity; the NASL was destructively cavalier. Only seven of the 12 
franchises have been awarded with no evident rush to get out the last five. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wall now sees a major appeal for the MLS that the NASL never had: 
home-grown talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the NASL, you had only to play two American-born players. I honestly 
believe now that there is more than enough talent in America. And fans 
obviously would rather follow Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more important, Brickley maintains, is the generation of Americans whose 
soccer career is long over. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NASL projected 22-year-olds as their fans," he said. "Really, its closer 
to 35. That's a 12-14 year gap, which is just how long it's been since the NASL 
folded."

WORLD CUP USA '94; SOCCER WAR BREWING; PITCHED BATTLE FOR PLAYERS, FIELDS 
POSSIBLE; APSL: EXISTING LEAGUE TAKEN ABACK BY ROTHENBERG'S MOVES IN ATTEMPTING 
TO BUILD MLS. 
</P>

<P>
 Soccer people are quick to tell you that the World Cup, currently playing to 
packed stadiums in the United States, means big-time U.S. professional soccer 
is in the on-deck circle. 
</P>
<P>
 They're sure of this because Alan Rothenberg, president of the U.S. Soccer 
Federation and chairman of the organization running the World Cup, is also in 
charge of Major League Soccer, the league he says will start next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold it. One problem here. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States already has pro soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called the American Professional Soccer League and it has two key 
elements Rothenberg doesn't -- players and stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The league has been in business since 1990, has eight franchises, and is 
adding four for the 1995 season. Seven players on the U.S. World Cup team are 
APSL veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup hasn't benefited the APSL in the way league officials figured it 
would when the United States began preparing a few years ago for the world's 
most famous sports event. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one time, we thought having the World Cup in the U.S. would be the 
greatest thing that could possibly happen to us," said William De La Pena, APSL 
chairman and owner of the Los Angeles Salsa, which plays at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would be a great shot in the arm for our league and the growth 
of soccer, but the way it's worked out . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The way it has worked out is that for the APSL, the World Cup has become a 
nightmare -- a colossus generating revenue that might be used to bury the APSL. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Alan Rothenberg has taken over U.S. soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he was elected USSF president in 1990, and had himself placed in charge 
of World Cup USA 1994, the organization formed to run the event when FIFA, the 
sport's world governing body, awarded it to the United States in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the USSF designated Rothenberg's proposed league as the only Division I 
soccer league in the United States, infuriating APSL officials, who also sought 
that designation. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Rothenberg set up the U.S. Soccer Foundation, into which World Cup 
profits are being directed. Rothenberg has said 30% of the profits will be seed 
money for his pro league. 
</P>
<P>
 That could be around $6 million, since he has said the tournament could finish 
with a $20-million surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 The APSL, while Rothenberg was building his soccer power base, was quietly 
building its league. "We have the best players in the country under long-term 
contracts," said De La Pena, 40, who operates five ophthalmology clinics in Los 
Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two things are going to happen. There will only be the APSL playing next 
year, or we will have two leagues playing against each other. If that happens, 
we wish Rothenberg well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing personal against Rothenberg -- we just feel the U.S. Soccer 
Federation should negotiate with us, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Says another APSL owner, Martin Nixdorf of the Colorado Foxes: "I think 
Rothenberg would like to put us out of business, but I don't know yet how he 
plans to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg, through a spokesman, said he would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Salsa and Colorado, the APSL has franchises in Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., Houston, Montreal, Seattle, Toronto and Vancouver. Four more 
will be added next year, including Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 APSL players earn salaries from $30,000 to $60,000. This year, each team plays 
a 20-game schedule that began Friday and runs to late September. League venues 
range from 6,000 to 76,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 MLS play, Rothenberg says, begins in April, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa, De La Pena's team, plays in a 10,000-seat Cal State Fullerton 
stadium considered to be the best for soccer in Southern California. The team 
said it averaged 5,367 per home date last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Rothenberg's representatives visited Cal State Fullerton, asking 
to inspect the stadium. De La Pena is still annoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew when they went down there we had a five-year exclusive lease on 
that facility," De La Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said former Cal State Fullerton Athletic Director Bill Shumard: "They pushed 
pretty hard. They promised to enlarge it by 20,000 seats. They wanted the 
school to break the lease, and we told them we weren't about to." 
</P>
<P>
 So, where is all this headed? 
</P>
<P>
 A soccer war, akin to the old NFL-AFL war of the early 1960s? The courtroom? A 
merger? A takeover? 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way Rothenberg can start a league that's comparable to ours in 
quality is if he brings in a lot of foreign players," said Alan Hinton, 
president and coach of the Seattle Sounders. 
</P>
<P>
 The APSL permits only two foreign players on each team's game-day, 18-player 
roster. Rothenberg has said the MLS will allow four foreigners per team. 
</P>
<P>
 "When all the dust settles, this will be all about players," Hinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sincere hope is that we can all sit down around a table and sort all this 
out and do what's right for American soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Said De La Pena: "Until Rothenberg came along, we were the only ones laying 
out money for U.S. pro soccer. Suddenly, here is Rothenberg with his league, 
backed by World Cup money . . . and all under the auspices of the U.S. Soccer 
Federation."

MOVIES; REALITY BITES BACK; IT'S JUST ABOUT ALL MAKE-BELIEVE FOR ROBERT 
ZEMECKIS, ONE OF HOLLYWOOD'S BIGGEST SPECIAL-EFFECTS DIRECTORS. BUT 'FORREST 
GUMP' IS A WHOLE NEW TECHNO-GAME

 Robert Zemeckis didn't set out to become a techno-wonk filmmaker. But once he 
became one, he became one of Hollywood's most accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't love 'em," he says of effects-driven movies. "I got associated with 
them in the first 'Back to the Future.' It's interesting -- people say, 'That 
was a big effects movie.' But there were only 30 shots (employing effects), and 
those were mostly lightning. They weren't that complicated. But the story was 
science fiction, so people assumed it had all these special effects." 
</P>
<P>
 Before "Back to the Future," Zemeckis had directed the nostalgic "I Want to 
Hold Your Hand," the gleefully black comedy "Used Cars" and the charming 
adventure yarn "Romancing the Stone." Since then, his films have been 
ground-breaking entertainments that have redefined the potentials of movie 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "In films that Bob Zemeckis makes, 20% of everything he wants to do is 
impossible up to that point," says Ken Ralston, who at Industrial Light & Magic 
routinely makes the impossible possible. Ralston has served as special effects 
supervisor for six Zemeckis films, including his latest, "Forrest Gump," and 
has won two of his four Oscars for Zemeckis films: "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" 
and "Death Becomes Her." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't enjoy the actual drudgery of working on effects at times; it's like 
watching paint dry," Zemeckis says. "But I do enjoy the spectacle of movie 
illusion. It's always been one and the same for me. I always chuckle when I 
hear actors talk about the reality of a scene -- they're making a movie. How 
can you talk about the reality of a scene when you have 70 technicians standing 
around and lights and cameras? It's all fake. You're using all sorts of 
illusion to create a story. So visual effects are just an extension to that, in 
my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Illusion jumps a light year or two in "Forrest Gump." The movie serves as 
something of a quirky, collective-memory history of the past four decades, as 
seen through the eyes of a simpleton who somehow inadvertently manages to 
influence and profoundly affect history (he teaches Elvis Presley some 
impressive gyrations, subverts racism in Alabama and, moreover, alerts security 
guards at the Watergate Hotel of certain suspect activities). 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Hanks stars as the Gump in question, a young man whose vacuous innocence 
unwittingly propels him to ever greater fates. Forrest manages, through minimal 
intellectual involvement of his own, to become a football hero at the 
University of Alabama, a war hero in Vietnam, a Ping-Pong hero in China and a 
quintessentially dumb-luck American entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
 With deep emotional underpinnings, it's not the sort of frenetic comedy that 
one would expect from Zemeckis. "One of the first conversations we had about 
this movie," Hanks recalls, "was that this movie broke all his rules drilled 
into him to work on basic storytelling levels. There's no jeopardy. There's no 
clock running. Bob is a master at explaining the illogical, as in the 'Back to 
the Future' movies, and having them make sense. But this is the opposite. He 
had to take this emotional story and put it in the trappings of a special 
effects epic in a way that was so natural, it served the human elements of the 
story, instead of how he usually works, where it serves the fantastic elements 
of the story." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a special effects film at all," Ralston says. "It's an interesting 
way to use them, to blend them in, in subtle ways." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, it advances in some profound and potentially controversial 
ways the cause of movie special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are bodies lying everywhere at ILM," Ralston jokes. "I don't know why 
we do it. This came awfully close to impossible but we knew it could be 
solved." 
</P>
<P>
 Surmounting the insurmountable is nothing new for Zemeckis. "On 'Roger 
Rabbit,' we designed a new camera," Ralston recalls. "It was a huge gamble, we 
were building these cameras before the show, and there was no time for testing 
them out. We weren't sure how they would be operating. It was a tremendous leap 
of faith, a frightening time." 
</P>
<P>
 Zemeckis shrugs off the gamble of plunging into a movie unsure of whether 
crucial effects upon which the success of the movie hinge can actually be 
executed. "You're hanging out there, the whole film rests on whether this 
illusion works or not, but the whole film also rests upon whether I make the 
correct casting choice for this actor," he says. "And the whole film also rests 
on the fact of whether the screenplay works. If there's something wrong in the 
screenplay, and I can't see what the flaw is, then the film won't work. You're 
always in this state of second-guessing yourself. You're very nervous making 
movies. Movies are completely finished before you know if it works or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the effects in the movie will easily go unnoticed, as they merely 
augmented existing visuals -- adding helicopters to the sky in Vietnam scenes, 
circling the Reflecting Pool in Washington with thousands of war protesters, 
removing unwanted minutiae from the backgrounds of shots. 
</P>
<P>
 But the effect that will have audiences talking this summer is one in which 
Hanks' character is inserted seamlessly into old newsreel footage, and is seen 
conversing and physically interacting with such luminaries as John Kennedy, 
Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, even Dick Cavett and John Lennon. Primitive 
versions of this effect have been seen in movies like "Zelig" and even last 
summer's "In the Line of Fire," but the work in Gump is genuinely persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always so. "They always had this rough matte-box version, and it 
always looked like hell," Hanks recalls. "Bob was saying, 'It's gonna look 
great, it's gonna be wonderful!' And I saw passes at what they were doing when 
I did some looping, but it was still rough, or 'puppety,' as Bob called it. 
Then, when the piece was redone, and everything was in place, I was amazed. 
Johnson puts the medal around Forrest Gump's head -- I was astonished. I was 
there, and I have no idea how they did that." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how: 
</P>
<P>
 For scenes in which Hanks meets with presidents, researchers pored through 
hundreds of hours of newsreel footage, looking for something that approximated 
what was described in Eric Roth's script. (Winston Groom's novel, upon which 
the film is based, had his hero visit Mars at one point; the filmmakers opted 
for a more earthbound, realistic Gump.) 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Roth originally had Gump meet Kennedy in the Rose Garden. No 
workable clip was located, so the action was moved to the Oval Office, where in 
the original footage, Kennedy was greeting Peace Corps volunteers. Roth rewrote 
the scene to the length specifications of the available footage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at the footage and tried to estimate how high the camera was off 
the ground, and (how) far it was from the subject," Ralston says. "That was all 
guesswork, and then we tried to duplicate the same situation. The problem was a 
lot of this footage was hand-held, and the camera would bob and weave, and 
there was a lot of amateurish zooming in and out -- duplicating that was 
murder. We also had to duplicate the lighting, copying daylight with interior 
lighting."  
</P>
<P>
 "Tom studied the raw footage, and I told him, 'We're putting you right here,' 
" Zemeckis explains. "He has a picture in his mind of what it will look like 
and we have him hit very specific marks, like choreographing a dance number." 
</P>
<P>
 "All the scenes were shot a great many ways," Hanks recalls. For blue screen 
shots, which are taken against a blue background that is later replaced by the 
desired image, he says, "I had to shift my gaze from different pieces of tape 
hanging from wires. There were different angles and a lot of repetition, but it 
wasn't hard, not even particularly boring. We worked at such a whip-crack pace. 
I'd be doing different scenes on one stage, then change costumes and run to the 
blue screen with the ILM guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was Hanks placed into Kennedy's realm, but Kennedy was moved into the 
filmmaker's world. 
</P>
<P>
 "They built sets and cast the parts of the people in the newsreel footage," 
Hanks says. "Then they had a look-alike act out the entire scene with a 
multi-camera setup." Kennedy was digitally placed in the Oval Office set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we took the footage to ILM and scanned it into the computer, frame by 
single, horrible frame," Ralston recalls, almost groaning at the memory. "We 
matched the camera movement and the placement of Tom. We would move him a few 
pixels left or right in the picture, which would make or break the shot -- he 
had to genuinely be in Kennedy's eye-line. We grafted out another person. In 
the original footage, Kennedy was shaking hands with a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 The mouths of the presidents were also digitally altered so that they could 
recite the lines Roth had written for them and that were spoken by imitators. 
"These figures are so familiar -- if you put in a different mouth, of a 
look-alike, they weren't the same characters. It was painstaking work; we'd 
have to take mouths from other shots and other pictures of them, and put them 
in." Kennedy was also digitally reconstructed for the parts of shots in which 
Hanks passes before him. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, another team would go in to make the new footage look as aged and 
scratchy and grainy as the newsreel footage, and add the appropriate shadows. 
One such sequence would take approximately eight or nine months to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 As fancifully as this technology is used in "Forrest Gump," the filmmakers are 
aware that it can be used in devastating and unethical ways in the future. For 
example, a politician running a smear campaign could doctor footage to make his 
opponent espousing unpopular or flat-out crazy viewpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've opened up a whole new can of worms," Ralston admits. "My feeling is 
that this is a gentle nudge, pointing out the possibilities of a potentially 
horrific problem. We got the rights to the footage we used, but what's legal 
and what's moral doesn't necessarily mix." 
</P>
<P>
 Distorting previous works of film art is also something that artists' rights 
groups fear -- with this technology, a movie starring Tom Cruise and Humphrey 
Bogart is not an impossibility. But is it right? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you truly believe that film is art, then you may have problems," Ralston 
says. "I wonder what Martin Scorsese will think when he sees Tom Hanks in 
footage from 'Birth of a Nation' (an ancestor of Forrest's is depicted donning 
the garb of a Klansman). I hope this does open up a discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw James Cagney in the Diet Coke commercial, I thought, 'This is not 
right, I don't want to see it,' " Hanks says. "I don't want to see Cary Grant 
making goo-goo eyes at Paula Abdul. But who in their right mind would have ever 
imagined that this technology would ever exist? That you could create an image 
of a person saying something they had never said before? 
</P>
<P>
 "You can use it in an entertaining way, but politically, as well. People 
believe what they see. What a computer is to a typewriter, this process is to 
celluloid. It's a monster, and the lawyers are gonna have a field day." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Zemeckis: "I think it's like, when Gutenberg invented the printing press, 
there was a lot of discussion: 'You mean we'll be able to mass-produce these 
words, and that everyone will be able to read them? You can also mass-produce 
lies with this thing.' It's one thing to write false statements by hand, 
because it takes forever to do it, and the information won't get out that 
quickly, but now we have this printing press, and when you write something that 
isn't true, that lie can be spread very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "These techniques are gonna be used to do wonderful things, and they'll 
probably be used to do abusive things. I think you just have to be a smart 
enough person to not take everything at face value. We don't take everything in 
the newspaper at face value, and now you can't look at television images and 
think that they're absolutely true, either." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this controversy, Zemeckis' eye is on developing even more 
sophisticated technology in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology's gonna save us," he says. "We'll be able to move faster, once you 
get this digital imaging system built into your post-production. You can move 
quicker, you'll be able to fix images. You won't spend so many hours trying to 
get perfect image. I'll give you a bad example: If, by accident, you didn't 
notice the microphone dipped into the frame -- now, we have to do another take 
and take more time -- soon, you'll say, 'Oh, we'll graft it out later. Let's 
move on.' Or, 'Geez, the sun doesn't look as dramatic as I imagined.' 'That's 
OK, we'll put some clouds in later. Let's move on.'  
</P>
<P>
 "Technology will make movies cheaper. I hope it will. The most expensive thing 
in making movies is manpower -- what it costs for man hours, people standing 
around between shots. In 'Roger Rabbit,' we built new cameras which now 
everyone uses, and motion-control camera systems, and we wrote a lot of digital 
programming for 'Death Becomes Her.' It costs a lot initially, but all 
filmmakers benefit from these films." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralston says of Zemeckis: "He's a director with imagination, and he's also a 
director with clout. He can do things others don't have the money or power to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's going to happen in the very near future is that visual effects will be 
as common as the microphone on a set," Zemeckis declares. "You're not going to 
sit here and ask me about microphone boom technique, but 50 years ago, that's 
what your interview would've been about: 'How did you record those three voices 
at the same time?' Then, it was a big deal; now, you don't even think about it. 
This is new stuff now that will be very commonplace soon."

GREEN CARD LOTTERY STIRS HOPES -- AND CON ARTISTS; IMMIGRATION: SOME 
UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS SEEKING PERMANENT RESIDENCY FALL PREY TO SCAMS RELATED TO 
VISA APPLICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hilda Alegria and Mario Smith can't help but dream of winning the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a flashy new car, expensive home or exotic vacation they envision, 
but something much more valuable -- the chance to work legally in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Alegria and Smith are among thousands of undocumented immigrants who are 
banking they'll hit the jackpot and be granted permanent resident status in the 
latest round of the visa lottery, which ended Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a chance to finally move ahead with my life," said Smith, a 
photographer who left Guatemala in 1985. "With all this anti-immigrant talk, it 
could well be the last chance. And life just seems to be getting harder and 
more dangerous if you don't have papers." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the popularity of the visa lottery -- a blind drawing for green cards 
conducted by the State Department -- has brought with it unscrupulous con 
artists who charge exorbitant rates to help immigrants fill out the 
applications, often with the false promise that the fees bring a guarantee of a 
visa. 
</P>
<P>
 "This lottery has really captured the imagination of people who are chasing 
55,000 visas, but because of the interest in the lottery it has attracted some 
people who do things like scams, and it's really unfortunate," said Gary 
Sheaffer, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Consular 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wary of scams in which immigrants are unnecessarily, and often illegally, 
charged for filling out the lottery applications, Alegria and Smith turned to 
the Central American Resource Center in Pico-Union for help two days before the 
filing deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of scams out there. . . . I know that because I worked at an 
office where they would charge people up to $800 to fill out forms, so I knew 
to be careful," Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to gauge the number of victims who fall prey to scams 
promising quick solutions to immigration problems, but it is a growing problem, 
according to public officials and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this office, the biggest caseload we have to deal with is immigration 
cases that range anywhere from citizenship to (those) where people end up 
having problems because of some agency that charged them money and didn't help 
them," said Yolanda Chavez, district chief of staff for Rep. Lucille 
Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles). The office is currently handling 60 cases 
involving immigration applications, many of which have been incorrectly filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories are similar at CARECEN, where frustrated clients arrive looking 
for help after losing hundreds of dollars to notary public and storefront 
businesses, said Elvin Ortiz, a paralegal with the group's legal department. 
The problem is not limited to the lottery but also to political asylum cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the cases are those involving political asylum and people who have 
been charged $500 for doing an application that is done incorrectly," Ortiz 
said. "What happens is there is no official declaration and in some cases that 
can result in deportation." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those cases involve people who turn over hundreds of dollars and 
crucial documents such as birth certificates to storefront agencies in exchange 
for the promise of resolving residency problems, and the losses can 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent case, the district attorney's office prosecuted a Los Angeles 
woman accused of bilking 16 people out of nearly $40,000 last December, said 
Greg Parham, the deputy district attorney in charge of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, Lo-li V. Gregor, who was later convicted of 43 felony counts 
including grand theft, preyed on newly arrived Chinese immigrants. She promised 
them "gold star cards," which victims purchased for up to $11,000 after being 
told the cards entitled them to legally work and live in the country, Parham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people who fall victim to such scams are reluctant to file complaints, 
fearing questions about their residency status, Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community groups such as One Stop Immigration and Education Center also fault 
the current debate over immigration as one reason a growing number of people, 
including legal residents, are flocking to storefront shops for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a barrage of anti-immigrant sentiment and that is facilitating 
scams," said Juan Jose Gutierrez, executive director of One Stop. "Those 
plastic little green cards become a life ambition for some people. And if 
someone is telling you that you'll have to sacrifice a couple of thousands of 
dollars to do it, well, who wouldn't, because they are desperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez and other immigrant rights activists offer the following advice to 
those looking to resolve their residency problems: Contact community-based 
groups that work with immigrants or an attorney who specializes in immigration 
law.

'THANK YOU' IS NOT ENOUGH; 3-YEAR-OLD BOY'S FAMILY PAYS LAST RESPECTS TO A 
GUARDIAN ANGEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 As the funeral Mass for Sara Quezada began at St. Lucy's Catholic Church on 
Wednesday morning, Clayborn Keith quietly rolled his son, covered in blankets 
in a child's red wagon, into the last row. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith, 31, and his wife, Juana Ramirez, 26, had brought 3-year-old Clayborn 
Jose Keith, or "C.J." as he now insists, to pay last respects to "Teacher 
Sara," the preschool teacher and supervisor who died shielding him from a bus 
that rolled over them after a June 24 field trip to the Los Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 C.J., who wears his brown, wavy hair below his shoulders like his father, 
suffered a fractured hip and will spend most of the summer in a cast from his 
waist to his left ankle and halfway down his right leg. His parents call 
Quezada their son's guardian angel and tearfully thanked the Quezada family for 
their sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, 'Thank you' is not enough," Ramirez said after the Mass. "We want to 
do more but we don't know what we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada, who was buried a day before her 51st birthday, was killed when the 
bus, parked on a slight incline at the zoo parking lot, began to roll. C.J. had 
started to get on board, as had half the children on the field trip that day, 
but fell. Quezada, witnesses said, pulled the boy toward her to shield him with 
her body and was killed instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you could turn the clock backward and my mom could see what would happen, 
I still think she would have done it," said Sara Quezada, 28, the oldest of 
Quezada's three children. "She wouldn't be able to live with herself knowing 
that she didn't do anything to help that child. He's alive because basically my 
mom gave her life. More than anything, it was more like an instinct. The child 
was in danger, so she saved a child." 
</P>
<P>
 Gathered at the family's El Sereno home after the service at Resurrection 
Cemetery in South San Gabriel, her family remembered Quezada as a hard-working 
woman who took pleasure in simple things, like flowers and even new grass that 
had recently been planted at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 25-year-old son, Jose, who has taught sixth grade at Farmdale Elementary 
for two years, said he will keep the lesson of his mother's death with him the 
rest of his life: 
</P>
<P>
 "If my mom was able to sacrifice her life, for me, that's inspiration to go on 
and do anything in this world. I know that she wouldn't want to see any of us 
be defeated by (this). She would want us to go on and try even harder. I feel 
like I owe it to her, for her to be able to look down and say that I was worthy 
of her." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Originally from Mexico City, Sara Quezada came to Los Angeles in 1969 with her 
husband, Armando Quezada, 54, and raised Sara, Jose and Cesar, 22, mostly in 
Bell. They moved to El Sereno in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 With their parents' continuous emphasis on getting an education and 
encouragement to make something of themselves, all three graduated from college 
and are now elementary school teachers in Eastside schools. 
</P>
<P>
 After the children had entered school, Sara Quezada enrolled herself in 
English as a Second Language courses and then classes in child development. She 
worked as a teacher's assistant for a Headstart program, a teacher's aide at an 
elementary school and eventually as a preschool teacher at Jardin de Ninos, a 
private, nonprofit school that enrolls about 50 preschool children, toddlers 
and infants in Lincoln Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Her most recent accomplishments were to become an American citizen in April 
and vote for the first time in the June primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 About a year ago, Quezada, who was described as friendly and sweet, was 
promoted to supervise the preschool. It was her job to greet each child and 
parent in the morning and say goodby when they left in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really cared about the kids. That was her main concern," said Letty 
Robles, an administrative assistant at the Los Angeles Child Care Development 
Council, the preschool's umbrella organization. Robles' 3 1/2-year-old son, 
Isaiah, is enrolled at the school and had attended the field trip with C.J. 
"She called everybody mijo and mija. She was a very caring person."  
</P>
<P>
 The thought was not lost on other parents who attended the funeral that 
Quezada could very well have saved their children in the accident. Many said 
they hope to hold a fund-raiser soon for the Keiths and many have expressed a 
desire to rename the school after Quezada. 
</P>
<P>
 Jardin de Ninos was closed Wednesday to allow staff, parents and children to 
attend the services. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Ramon Marti, who officiated at the rosary and Mass, tried to console 
the family by explaining that the only way a person can meet their creator is 
through death. But he also touched on the sacrifice that Quezada made for the 
life of another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sara, in her death, showed all of us a great example of life," he said.

RETIRING, YES, BUT NOT SHY ABOUT LOVE FOR HER WORK; EDUCATION: NORWOOD'S 
ANGELENE KASZA, 72, LEAVES A LEGACY OF INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS FROM A 52-YEAR 
CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After a distinguished 52-year career in education, Angelene Kasza has retired 
as principal of Norwood Elementary School, leaving a legacy of innovative 
programs, including one that paved the way for Spanish-speaking children to 
become proficient in both English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate Kasza's retirement, several hundred students, parents and 
teachers attended a June 23 party at the school's Oak Street campus, just south 
of Pico-Union. While mariachis played, party-goers feasted on everything from 
tacos to fried chicken. Students also sang and danced to honor the longtime 
principal, whose last day was Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never lost enthusiasm for what I do," said Kasza, 72, who has been at 
Norwood Elementary for 21 years. "I've always loved getting up and going to 
work, and frankly, I think I'm blessed to be able to say that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kasza began her career in 1942 as an elementary teacher in San Bernardino, 
where she taught the children of migrant workers. She moved to Los Angeles four 
years later, and taught at Cienega, Sterry, Broadway and Walgrove Avenue 
elementary schools, before becoming an assistant principal at Kester Avenue 
Elementary in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 After serving as principal at Langdon Avenue and Knollwood elementary schools, 
Kasza became principal at Norwood Elementary in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt as though I was coming back to my roots," said Kasza, who lived in 
South-Central as a child and now has a home in Northridge. "I had worked with 
poverty migrant workers before, and I grew up in the area. I felt I had 
something to contribute." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years after coming to Norwood Elementary, whose 1,300-student population 
is 99% Latino, Kasza created a program to help non-English-speaking students 
make the transition to classes conducted in English. 
</P>
<P>
 About 95% of the students who complete the program are able to make the switch 
to English classes at their grade level, Kasza said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's visionary," said Bruce Aubry, who has taught at the school since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "The transitional bilingual program allows students to do intensive work so 
that they can transition into English classes at their own grade level. Before, 
students who were supposed to be in the fourth grade were being put into a 
second-grade English class." 
</P>
<P>
 To recruit bilingual teachers for the program, Kasza placed an ad on a 
Spanish-language television station in Los Angeles, asking for Spanish-speaking 
applicants with teaching credentials in their native countries. English was not 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had over 100 applicants, and we ended up hiring 16 teaching assistants," 
Kasza said. "They taught Spanish reading so that students could become 
proficient in their native languages before making the transition to English." 
</P>
<P>
 Although budget cuts forced the school to discontinue the program during the 
1992-93 school year, school officials are hoping to reinstate the program this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasza's other accomplishments include helping more than two dozen teachers 
become principals, fostering an educational partnership with USC and opening 
the first Norwood Family Center in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's very encouraging to teachers," said Frances Goldman, who has taught at 
Norwood for 15 years. "She listens and she considers people's feelings and 
needs. She's a warm, gracious person." 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Guzman, a parent who coordinates the school's family center, said 
residents respect Kasza because she always has tried to include them in the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though her Spanish is not perfect, people feel they can talk to her," 
Guzman said. "She always told us that if we learned English, she would learn 
Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 Kasza, who will be replaced by assistant principal Rita Flynn, said she 
probably will spend more time with her son and daughter and her three grandsons 
in Indiana and Brussels. But beyond that, she doesn't have definite retirement 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always allowed my life to unfold, so that's what I'll do."

THEATER; WHEN OPPOSITES ATTRACT; THE WARM AND OPENHEARTED MARIETTE HARTLEY 
PLAYS THE REPRESSED SARA GOODE IN 'SISTERS ROSENSWEIG' AND FINDS HER HARD TO 
DO. 'THERE ARE PARTS OF (SARA) THAT I AM SO AFRAID OF,' SAYS ACTRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For actress Mariette Hartley, playing Sara Goode in "The Sisters Rosensweig" 
is just like "squeezing into a sausage skin." 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley, a nonstop talker, emoter and nurturer, is the author of a revealing 
autobiography about her family. Sara Goode enjoys living in London, where 
feelings are "openly repressed." 
</P>
<P>
 When we meet Sara, she is what Hartley calls "a hard like." Managing director 
of the Hong Kong/Shanghai Bank Europe, Sara has twice been on the cover of 
Fortune magazine. She shares her tasteful home in Queen Anne's Gate with her 
daughter, Tess, named for Tess of the D'Urbervilles. 
</P>
<P>
 But long, long ago, Londoner Sara Goode was Sadie Rosensweig of Brooklyn. And 
that's what people keep reminding her of in Wendy Wasserstein's hit play, due 
to open July 14 at Hollywood's Doolittle Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara, radio therapist Gorgeous (Caroline Aaron) and travel writer Pfeni (Joan 
McMurtrey) gather in Sara's London home to celebrate her 54th birthday with 
their assorted loved ones, memories and neuroses. Moving the enterprise along 
are such revelers as Sara's proper British beau (an MP with a penchant for 
teen-age girls), Pfeni's bisexual lover, Tess' radical boyfriend and the 
mystery guest -- a maker of fake furs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The three Rosensweig sisters bear more than a passing resemblance to 
Wasserstein, author of the 1989 Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Heidi Chronicles," 
and her own two sisters. And the playwright packs in plenty of epiphanies along 
with her one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sisters Rosensweig" is a play about "the warming of Sara," says Hartley. 
"Everywhere she turns, there is someone who reminds her of where she's been and 
where she doesn't want to be. She cannot turn without being reminded of her 
life. Her soul. Her roots. And Sara has no tools for that. She has no way of 
getting to that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Her sisters can help her, explains Hartley, but only to a point. And then, 
from out of nowhere, comes furrier Mervyn Kant (Charles Cioffi), "a man of 
passion and intelligence who is sexy as hell -- and she runs for dear life." 
</P>
<P>
 When Sara connects with Kant, who readily admits he is "both a little too 
lively and a little too Jewish," Hartley calls the connection "a spiritual 
awakening. . . . She's been opened, and not just sexually. I think what Sara 
does is go back to her soul -- she's been running from it for years."  
</P>
<P>
 Neither Hartley, who has been playing Sara on tour since January, nor National 
Endowment for the Arts chair Jane Alexander, who originated the role on 
Broadway last year, are Jewish, but Hartley doesn't think it matters. "It's not 
just a play for Jews," says Hartley. "It's obviously about that. But it's a 
play for anybody who's been trying to get away from his soul and can't." 
</P>
<P>
 That obviously includes Hartley, a woman who spent much of her life hiding 
from herself. In Hartley's best-selling 1990 autobiography, "Breaking the 
Silence," written with her longtime friend, playwright Anne Commire, the 
actress relates again and again the price she paid for denying her feelings.  
</P>
<P>
 Hartley's "no holds barred" book chronicles everything from a drunken meal of 
Purina Cat Chow to beatings by her first husband. Along the way she notes her 
father's suicide, her mother's suicide attempts, her own suicide attempt (at 
15, when she thought she was pregnant). In keeping quiet, she writes, she 
stifled not just the painful parts of her past but her true self. 
</P>
<P>
 So along comes this play, prodding her to climb back into emotional armor. 
"When I (as Sara) first see Gorgeous, my instinct is to hug her, kiss her, roll 
around on the ground with her, give her a full body hug. But I can't. Instead I 
turn it off."  
</P>
<P>
 "Mariette is determined to connect, and Sara is determined not to," observes 
Wasserstein. "They share that determination." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Daniel Sullivan helped her integrate Sara, Hartley explains. "There 
are parts of her that I am so afraid of -- that coldness, going into my 
mother's skin in a sense. It was very threatening to me. Every ounce of 
instinct I have is to touch people. And Sara can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did Hartley's mother. Daughter of John Watson, who founded the 
psychological school of behaviorism, Mary Watson Hartley was taught that 
children were to be trained, not touched or nurtured. It is her mother that 
Hartley plays back in her mind as she introduces us to Sara, hugging her 
sisters "the way mother used to do, hug and pat, hug and pat." 
</P>
<P>
 Cioffi says that in playing Kant he has observed that Hartley "can't wait 
until she gets to the end of the first act, when you see a much warmer side." 
</P>
<P>
 "I found her tough to do, tough to get inside of," says Hartley. "I was like a 
contortionist, because my life is committed to completely the opposite of where 
Sara is. I'm impulsive, spontaneous; I have a joy in my life today that doesn't 
quit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her warm Encino home reflects her upbeat attitude toward life these days. 
There, reciting lines from the play, leaning in to make a point, she is as 
animated in her living room as if she were onstage somewhere. Her household of 
animals is so numerous she refers to them as her "menagerie," and she even 
recently added one more cat -- Mervyn the Fur -- during the "Sisters" tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley is 54 now, playing Wasserstein's 54-year-old Sara Goode much as, at 
14, she played Shakespeare's 14-year-old Juliet at the White Barn Theatre near 
her parents' Weston, Conn., home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mariette is very beautiful and graceful," says Wasserstein. "She's 54, but I 
think a furrier or anyone else would walk into a room and fall in love with 
her. She's an object of desire. And she's fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The fun side is evident to anyone who remembers the many Polaroid commercials 
she did with James Garner in the 1970s and '80s. Hartley became so well known 
for those commercials, which won her three Clio Awards, that the actress even 
started wearing a T-shirt that said she wasn't Mrs. James Garner. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley brought a great sense of timing and humor to the Polaroid ads, recalls 
Garner. "We worked so well together in those things, it was like playing 
Ping-Pong. Back and forth, back and forth. She's really a fine actress -- more 
than people give her credit for." 
</P>
<P>
 She has been doing it long enough. Encouraged by the legendary stage actress, 
teacher and producer Eva La Gallienne when she was just 14, Hartley made her 
film debut in Sam Peckinpah's "Ride the High Country" in 1962.  
</P>
<P>
 She has appeared in other films, but is probably better known for her decades 
of episodic TV, miniseries and movies of the week and, in 1987, a brief stint 
hosting CBS' "Morning Program." She has been nominated for six Emmy Awards over 
the years, and won one in 1979, playing the bride of "The Incredible Hulk." 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley has also done plenty of theater in Los Angeles and elsewhere. In 
recent years, she has performed her "An Evening with Mariette Hartley," 
including at the Pasadena Playhouse and other local venues. When the script for 
"Sisters" came in, she says, it was age-appropriate and "used every ounce of 
experience I'd had." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley's tour contract includes two visits per month for husband Patrick 
Boyriven or another family member, she says. Their son Sean is in college now, 
but daughter Justine, 15, still lives at home in Encino, and Hartley says "it's 
hard to be a long-distance mother. I don't want this kid shut out of any part 
of my life now. It's just too damaging."  
</P>
<P>
 Family matters a great deal to Hartley, increasingly as a result of being in 
this play. The relationships among the Rosensweig sisters prompted her 
realization that siblings are so important, she says, particularly after 
parents die. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley contacted her younger brother Tony, a dream therapist in Seattle. "We 
have so much to give to one another," she says, "and my brother and I had been 
slightly estranged. I called him and said I want to work on this relationship 
if we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Life often imitates art for Hartley. She joined Mothers Against Drunk Drivers 
after playing that organization's founder, Candy Lightner on NBC's "M.A.D.D.: 
Mothers Against Drivers" in 1983. Her research and work as the mother of a 
suicide victim in CBS's "Silence of the Heart" in 1984 was what she calls "the 
galvanizing force" in her decision to speak about her father's suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sisters Rosensweig" is about denial on all levels, says Hartley, and that 
is also something she knows well because of the secrecy that long surrounded 
her father's suicide. "I was sworn to silence by my mother. I kept quiet. I 
almost died with the secret. My first thing with other survivors is to just 
start talking and know you are not alone."  
</P>
<P>
 She encouraged activities at chapters of the American Suicide Foundation in 
two cities where "Sisters" toured, and she's helping organize two related 
fund-raisers when the show plays here. She says she often speaks with other 
people who have lost family or friends to suicide, and she is also a lay 
facilitator for the Institute for Suicide Prevention, which is currently 
setting up workshops around Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother died four years ago of emphysema, and Hartley expects that death to 
figure prominently in either another book or possibly a documentary. She taped 
"the entire passing," she says, on both audio and video, contrasting her 
father's violent unexpected death by suicide two decades ago to her mother's 
"gentle" death. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley's performance is dedicated to her mother who, she says, "is so much in 
this performance. It was the integration of the two sides of me -- who I am 
today -- which is who I am in the final scene. And that is the result of my 
mother." *

COVER STORY; PUZZLING OUT SUMMER AT THE BOWL; SUMMER MAY BE FUN FOR THE 
AUDIENCE, BUT PROGRAMMING THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL SEASON IS SERIOUS BUSINESS. IT 
ONLY WORKS WITH THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF LONG-TERM PLANNING AND LAST-MINUTE 
JUGGLING. OH, AND PLENTY OF TCHAIKOVSKY

 In preparation for an evening at the Hollywood Bowl, a typical audience member 
(yes, you over there in the Dodgers sweat shirt, in-line skates and black 
evening dress) may just be more concerned with parking hassles and packing your 
pre-concert picnic than with how the concert you came to see tonight actually 
makes it to the Bowl's expansive band-shell stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Street parking or the official Bowl lots, where 3,383 "stacked" parking spaces 
are provided for a potential 17,960 audience members? Brie or Cheddar? The mind 
boggles. These are the important issues. These things take time . 
</P>
<P>
 That glossy color Hollywood Bowl concert-schedule brochure that magically 
appeared in your mailbox a month or so ago, listing more than 50 concerts 
ranging from classical to jazz to pop, complete with fireworks or movie clips 
or popular soloists or Bugs Bunny cartoons or laser light shows -- well, that 
just doesn't matter anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 It just shows up every year, like a tax return, only prettier. The Bowl 
officially kicks off its 73rd summer season Tuesday with a gala opening concert 
of Berlioz, Beethoven and Rachmaninoff; audiences have already gotten a taste 
of the Bowl in preview concerts that began a week earlier, including this 
weekend's traditional Independence Day "America the Beautiful" fireworks 
extravaganzas. 
</P>
<P>
 Most likely, you have already picked out the concerts you want to attend and 
in some cases have already bought the tickets. You're over it. Just pour the 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But for the many behind-the-scenes players who determine what you see on the 
stage each summer, programming the Hollywood Bowl is no picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 While you are enjoying the show, this group of music-minded individuals is 
already busily planning what you will enjoy at the Bowl next year, the year 
after -- and for some artists staring even farther into the future in their 
crystal bowl. Er, ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more fun than doing a crossword puzzle, doing these programs," said John 
Mauceri, director of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra and the person responsible 
for selecting the music for the Bowl Orchestra's eclectic menu of orchestral 
pops concerts. Fun was not the first word out of the mouth of Ernest 
Fleischmann, executive vice president and managing director of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic, when he described programming the Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds a simple process; it takes ages ," Fleischmann said. "Especially 
with pop artists -- to get someone like Patti LuPone to commit takes months and 
months and months." 
</P>
<P>
 For the winter Philharmonic season, Fleischmann generally has the luxury of 
booking guest conductors and soloists as much as four or five years in advance. 
But in the summer, last-minute juggling runs rampant -- particularly among pop 
artists trying to work their own concert dates around a busy recording 
schedule. Many will not commit to a Bowl date even six months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, even though summertime artists may commit later, the Bowl 
must enter into discussion with them sometimes earlier than for the winter 
season to have a fighting chance of being chosen among the many options. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday we had a conductor in from San Francisco, and we were talking about 
1997 or 1998," Fleischmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the classical side, he said, the Bowl must compete with prestigious 
European music festivals -- the Big Kahuna being the Salzburg Festival in 
Austria -- when it seeks to host visiting symphony orchestras. (The Phil leaves 
town too: This year its European tour includes the Helsinki Festival in 
Finland, the Proms in London and concert dates elsewhere in England and in 
Germany.) 
</P>
<P>
 "For every acceptance, we get about 10 turndowns," Fleischmann said. Luckily, 
he added, Bowl classical concert-goers for the most part are less concerned 
with the program than with the guest soloist or the conductor. Nor are they 
much concerned with Bowl programming as a whole -- they are attracted to 
individual concerts, not a season subscription, as in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the Bowl, people buy 90% on program, 10% on artist (for classical 
concerts)," Fleischmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we are very interested in using the Bowl to introduce new talent -- 
largely performers but sometimes conductors. It's possible to get a really 
gifted (new) artist to play a Tchaikovsky Concerto or a Rachmaninoff Concerto 
and (the audiences) don't care who plays it as long as it's Tchaikovsky or 
Rachmaninoff." 
</P>
<P>
 (Note: Tchaikovsky is the Bowl's most popular composer. No. 2: Mozart.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some stars help out by making a standing commitment to the Bowl. Beverly Hills 
resident Mel Torme, 68, a popular regular, has visited the Bowl every season 
for 17 years and returns for his 18th with two concerts Aug. 26 and 27 titled 
"Mel, the Movies and More," a tribute to movie music with the Detroit Symphony 
Orchestra and flutist Hubert Laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Torme keeps coming back, he says, because "I can perform in various guises at 
the Bowl. For instance, one year I will go in with the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
and do two nights with them. The next year, I'll do 'Jazz at the Bowl,' which 
is a jazz evening sponsored by the Phil, and then the next year I'll do the 
Playboy Jazz Festival, a separate jazz evening." 
</P>
<P>
 Torme calls the Bowl "an extraordinary venue, and let me tell you why. 
Standing on that stage, looking out over this vast amount of people, it has an 
ambience, and a kind of intimacy. When you say it's got intimacy, people look 
at you and say, 'What, are you crazy? The Hollywood Bowl ? But the truth of the 
matter is, honest to God, I feel like I'm in a small room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally speaking, it is a tremendous thrill to work with symphony 
orchestras. I mean, I write all of the arrangements, so to stand up there and 
hear 80 or 90 people play what you put down on paper -- it's the closest thing 
to being God I can think of." 
</P>
<P>
 OK , Mel. You can come back next year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Bowl, owned by Los Angeles County, has a 99-year leasing 
agreement with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn. Although the Philharmonic, 
directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen, continues to perform often at the Bowl, in 1990 
the Philharmonic Assn. created a separate Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, directed by 
Mauceri, which performs its own series of concerts and frees up the 
Philharmonic for more touring engagements, as well as more rehearsal time 
during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Philharmonic schedule in the summer had become somewhat unbearable -- 
largely because of the success of the Bowl," Fleischmann said during a recent 
interview in his office at the Music Center's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the 
orchestra's winter home. "In the old days, there used to be three concerts 
maximum and six rehearsals for each one; now there is a concert every niight. 
The season used to be 10 weeks; now it's 12 weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 In more recent years, but before the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra came into being, 
Fleischmann said, "we used to finish at the Bowl, and in one week start the 
winter season. The orchestra was totally exhausted; it usually took us a month 
or two to get back up to speed in the winter." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleischmann holds ultimate veto power over the Bowl's summer schedule but 
calls programming the Bowl -- with its eclectic blend of classical, jazz, rock 
and pops concerts -- a collaborative, and complicated, effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the winter season, Esa-Pekka (Salonen) is our music director and has the 
greatest responsibility and veto power," Fleischmann said. "Winter programs are 
usually put together by Esa-Pekka and myself in long sessions. Our way of doing 
things is to outline a set of programs, and then the next time we meet, we 
change them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bowl is simpler, yet more difficult, in a way. First of all, we have a 
greater number of programs to put together. There is a far greater range of 
music, and there are different approaches to different kinds of music." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Salonen and Fleischmann, summer classical music decision are made 
by Bowl Manager Anne Parsons and Mauceri, who is not responsible for overall 
Bowl programming but oversees the choices for the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra's 
own programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside producers are hired by the Philharmonic to handle rock and jazz 
concerts, and the Bowl is also leased out for a handful of available dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the demands of its summer touring schedule, the Philharmonic's 
dates are slotted first -- and the rest of the puzzle pieces follow. In 
general, the Philharmonic occupies the Bowl on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the 
Hollywood Bowl Orchestra on weekend nights. A jazz series occupies occasional 
Wednesday nights, although outside coordinators of those concerts are in 
negotiation to switch to Sundays in upcoming years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how to explain it, Sunday is just more of a jazz night," said 
Darlene Chan, senior vice president of the Los Angeles office of New York-based 
Festival Productions, which produces the jazz series for the Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the Philharmonic will try to gear one or more Bowl concerts to fit 
into a local festival, such as last year's Los Angeles Festival or this year's 
upcoming UK/LA Festival celebrating the arts of Great Britain. For UK/LA, the 
Bowl will present Britain's Halle Orchestra, conducted by its music director, 
Californian Kent Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the Philharmonic Assn. was asked to hold open the week of July 
11-17 for a week of special performances in honor of the 1994 World Cup soccer 
tournament. Those concerts are being produced by partners Bill Silva and Andy 
Hewitt, who also produce the Bowl's rock and pop music concerts for the 
Philharmonic, including this season's Bonnie Raitt concert. The Philharmonic 
and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra will perform during some World Cup concerts as 
musicians for hire. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup will present a glamorous roster of stars including Itzhak Perlman 
with Linda Ronstadt, Garth Brooks, the Gipsy Kings, Jose Luis Rodriguez, Paul 
Rodriguez, Reece Holland and Van Cliburn. The Bowl's annual "JVC Jazz at the 
Bowl" concert, usually held in August, has been moved into the World Cup 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ticket prices will be comparable to usual Bowl prices, ranging from $1 to 
a top price of $88 for a Saturday box seat, but others may cost up to $150. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when people think of Los Angeles, and summertime, and entertainment, 
the Hollywood Bowl comes to mind," said World Cup arts spokeswoman Polly 
Williams Kroeger. "We wanted to develop something during finals week, when an 
awful lot of international visitors will be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Philharmonic Assn. receives fees for leasing the Bowl, 
Fleischmann said, there could be a downside to World Cup series as well: "It'll 
be very interesting to see if the high-priced, high-powered World Cup week will 
take away attendance from the rest of the Bowl. Those are expensive seats; I'm 
a bit worried that people will pay a lot of money for one ticket and then say, 
'That's it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fleischmann is also fretting about "Encore: The Three Tenors," a mega-concert 
featuring the ubiquitous Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti 
to be given at Dodger Stadium the day before this year's World Cup final. 
Tickets range from $15 to $1,000. This event is unrelated to the Bowl, but 
"that is going to take millions of entertainment dollars out of people's 
pockets," Fleischmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is a big issue at the Bowl. Successfully programming the venue, 
Fleischmann acknowledged, is more at issue than artistic satisfaction for the 
parties involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we have to strike an artful balance with what music should be 
played, but financial success at the Bowl is absolutely crucial to the 
Philharmonic," Fleischmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Bowl) is so valuable, because (the Philharmonic) has a very small 
endowment compared to other major orchestras; we are 19th in terms of the size 
of our endowment. And so we need to make up for that by having a successful 
season at the Bowl to help reduce our deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bowl grosses about three times as much as our regular season; about 40% 
of our budget comes from the Bowl. Of course the expenses are humongous, the 
staff is enormous. It's very expensive to operate." 
</P>
<P>
 This financial reality, Fleischmann acknowledges, sometimes causes minor 
fireworks between himself and Mauceri when it comes to selecting music for the 
Hollywood Bowl Orchestra's pops concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "John Mauceri is the driving force in programming, and he has brilliant ideas 
about popular music, in particular the neglected music of Broadway and the 
movies," Fleischmann said. "We have to be a little careful sometimes. Sometimes 
I find myself questioning some of his programs being a little esoteric for the 
weekends. He comes up with some wonderful stuff, but we must sell tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra plays more concert dates than anyone else 
at the Bowl, Mauceri has perhaps more influence over the Bowl season than 
anyone. In a recent conversation, he downplayed disagreements between himself 
and Fleischmann. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ernest and I really don't disagree -- there is no question that the 
Philharmonic depends on the Bowl to keep the Phil going during the winter," 
Mauceri said. "And I certainly don't like to play to small audiences; I think 
our goals are the same, Ernest and I. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he really doesn't give me a hard time on this, because we are being 
successful. If people were getting up and walking out, we probably would have a 
different relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Theme programs are the key to selling tickets, Mauceri said, but they also 
give him a chance to introduce new music to audiences. He stressed that each 
Bowl Orchestra concert has a theme and a structure to it, rather than simply 
being a collection of popular tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always bristle a little at the P-word; I think popular is a better word 
than pops for me, " Mauceri said. "We tend not to repeat ourselves often. In 
the four years I've been doing the 'America the Beautiful' (Fourth of July 
weekend) concerts, we haven't repeated ourselves once." 
</P>
<P>
 Mauceri acknowledged that he sometimes has to play little games to keep 
himself amused when tradition demands that he stick to the tried and true. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ernest really wanted the last concert of the season to end with 'Music for 
the Royal Fireworks' by Handel," Mauceri said. "I have never been a great fan 
of ending a concert with 'Music for the Royal Fireworks,' but it was important 
to the continuity of the Bowl for that concert to end with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I agreed to do it, but on the condition that I could create the program 
that would end with the 'Fireworks' music. I took this as a personal challenge 
-- I had to end up with something I didn't necessarily want to end up with. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I thought the most interesting thing to do was to go 'Around the World in 
80 Minutes' -- beginning and ending in London. I could go around the world in 
150 different ways." Beginning with Victor Young's music from the 1956 film 
"Around the World in 80 Days," Mauceri decided to travel from England 
(Korngold's "March of the Merry Men" from "Robin Hood") to Spain (Bizet's 
"Carmen Fantasy"), on to Northern Africa (Maurice Jarre's "Lawrence of Arabia") 
and then leave that continent by playing John Barry's music from "Out of 
Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, if I have time, I'll stop in the Holy Land (Miklos Rozsa's "Ben-Hur") 
and India (Rozsa's "The Jungle Book"). Then Thailand (Richard Rodgers' "The 
King and I"), go north into Japan ("Sayonara," as arranged by Franz Waxman) and 
then cross the Pacific Ocean to Los Angeles (Mauceri's own arrangement of 
Waxman's "Sunset Boulevard"). I'm not sure if we'll stop in New York. Then, 
we'll use the 'Flying Music' from (John Williams' score for) 'E.T.' to descend 
into London. Every single one of those pieces was written for a Hollywood 
picture. And we end with 'Fireworks.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mauceri said he doesn't mind incorporating a few fireworks into the 
repertoire. "The Bowl is a place that was created for spectacle; it's a big 
space," he said. "Right from the first Easter Sunday sunrise service, it's 
about spectacle. Right now, I'd like to bring back some of that great era of 
the Bowl, where there was spectacle, not just a concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are times when it should simply be a concert, but certain music 
-- for example, cinema music and Broadway -- was meant to be accompanied by 
lights and spectacle. I never shy away from that." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, for example, Mauceri said, laser lights are being considered for 
"The Best of Wagner -- The Valkyries, Act III" on Sept. 13. Why play it 
straight and serious, he asks rhetorically, when "Wagner had every intention of 
having lighting, thunder, fire?" 
</P>
<P>
 Along those lines, going bigger is a must for jazz artists going to the Bowl, 
said Chan of Festival Productions. "(The Bowl) is huge for jazz," she said. 
"It's like selling out Carnegie Hall four times. . . . All our jazz festivals 
have to draw a lot more people than you would for a small hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Some jazz artists love the extra attention; others don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them have turned us down because it's too big a venue; they just 
can't handle it," she said. "A lot of them feel they need more intimacy with an 
audience, and they can't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowl Manager Parsons said that Bowl officials occasionally try to talk 
visiting orchestras out of certain music that requires extreme concentration. 
"We talked about Mahler's Ninth with one guest orchestra for this season but 
decided to pick another piece because of the issue of being able to concentrate 
with the possible distraction of an airplane going overhead, or environmental 
noise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the Bowl's programming puzzle is painstakingly put together, ultimately, 
performers and audiences alike must be willing to expect the unexpected if they 
venture into the Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, there was even a premiere performance of Rachmaninoff's Concerto 
No. 2 for Piano and Coyote. The work (correctly titled Piano Concerto No. 2) 
was a unique fusion of classical piano and improvisational howling, composed 
when a coyote spontaneously joined in with pianist Helene Grimaud. "And you 
know how when one coyote starts howling, others start to join in . . . ," 
Parsons said ruefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimaud will return to the Bowl this year, performing with the San Francisco 
Symphony. There will be no Rachmaninoff on the program.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; SHOW STIRS MEMORIES FOR KING'S DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stepping out of the blazing sun and into the smoky darkness of the 
warehouse-style building, Yolanda King stopped and squinted. As her eyes 
adjusted to the dim lighting, she stepped slowly toward a voice inviting her 
back in time to a segregated Meridian, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 The murky room is the first stop on a tour of a photography exhibit that pays 
tribute to King's father, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 King, the eldest daughter of the slain civil rights leader and an Atlanta 
resident, recently toured the traveling exhibit of 62 rare photographs 
currently housed at the Watts Labor Community Action Committee's headquarters 
at 10950 S. Central Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has brought back a lot of memories," said King, passing photos of her 
father as she walked toward another room where a coffin sat, signifying her 
father's assassination on April 4, 1968. "It's often hard for young people to 
understand the fear and terror so many people felt and how bold they were to 
get involved in the marches. But walking through the first part of the exhibit 
I felt that terror." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit, "Countdown to Eternity," a collection of photographs of King, his 
family, and other activists taken by Benedict J. Fernandez, will be on display 
until July 31. The exhibit also marks the first such project undertaken by the 
committee, a nonprofit organization that has focused on economic projects in 
Watts.  
</P>
<P>
 "What we are trying to do is communicate that leaders sprung up everywhere, 
and to reach kids with that message" said Teryl Watkins, executive director of 
the group her father, Ted Watkins, helped start. "Society has lost touch with 
people, and the 1992 riots were proof that everyone was out of touch. So what 
we want to do is reach out to people with this exhibit." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that goal, the group hired Verna Jones to curate the show and 
expand the exhibit's appeal by providing audio and visual props that evoked the 
struggle of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This exhibit has been traveling throughout the country but no one has heard 
anything about it," said Jones. "I wanted to make it live and to reflect the 
work of Dr. King and that of other civil rights workers. And I wanted the 
exhibit to speak to young people and make them see that this struggle is still 
a living force, and not something you can just kind of archive somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones apparently struck a chord with visitor Alton Butler, 79. "This has made 
me think about a whole lot of things, like where I was when I heard about 
(King's) death, and all the things he did for us," he said, recalling King's 
assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit is drawing praise from community leaders such as Joe Hicks, who 
heads the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. For Hicks, the exhibit 
offers a chance to bridge a gap between older black Americans and their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walk through here, I realized we have a chance to interpret history 
here," said Hicks. "We have to get the young people to understand the crucial 
role young people played in the (civil rights) movement and how there is also 
this possibility for them to get involved now." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is the latest of six cities to host the exhibit funded by the Ford 
Foundation. Additional funding has been provided by local residents and 
corporate sponsors including IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 The free exhibit is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; WOMEN'S SHELTER STRUGGLES TO REBUILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the 22-bed shelter that Bernita Walker-Moss helped start nearly a decade 
ago burned to the ground in January, she shrugged off the accidental blaze, 
confident the shelter would soon reopen. But nearly six months later, she is 
still struggling to rebuild the Jenesse Center Inc.'s shelter for victims of 
domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're anxious to reopen the shelter and help the women of South-Central," 
said Walker-Moss, the center's executive director. "We had replacement 
insurance but we can't go back and build at the site of the fire because the 
location has been disclosed." 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter's officials have routinely requested that its location not be 
disclosed, fearing the women and children housed there could be hurt by an 
abusive mate. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is in negotiations with California Fair Plan, its insurer, to 
recover funds and open a new shelter at another undisclosed site. In the 
meantime, women and children have temporarily been placed in motels until 
another shelter becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really had to work out deals with hotel and motels," said Henry 
Etheredge, who heads the center's board of directors. "And this has meant our 
hot-line workers have had to work around the clock trying to handle calls in 
order to make arrangements for women, rather than simply being able to bring 
the women directly to the shelter." 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance company agreed to allow the shelter to relocate after hearing 
from the city and county that the safety of the women could be jeopardized if 
the center were rebuilt in the same location, Etheredge said.  
</P>
<P>
 The shelter is trying to raise funds, including a luncheon attended by Miss 
America Kimberly Aiken. 
</P>
<P>
 But with summer here, Walker-Moss said the shelter remains unprepared to 
handle what are normally among the busiest months for women's shelters.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a time of transition and the kids are out of school," said Walker-Moss, 
who expects a 25% increase in calls over the Fourth of July weekend from 
battered women. The number of calls to the center has already risen by about 
30%, to 10 or 11 calls a day, following the June 12 slayings of Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 While the slayings have increased public attention on the problem of domestic 
abuse, Walker-Moss said she hopes it will translate into more support for women 
and children and donations to shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 The center and shelter were established in 1980 by Walker-Moss and four other 
women who were victims of domestic violence. Their experience led them to focus 
on women in South-Central, where the lack of resources heightened the 
importance of a women's shelter, Walker-Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, there aren't enough beds for children and women fleeing for their lives 
nationwide, period," said Walker-Moss. "When we first started this shelter 
people thought, 'Well, violence, that's just the way people live in 
South-Central,' but that isn't true. I wasn't raised to live with violence." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, there are approximately 250 beds for battered women and their 
children, according to the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, headquartered at 8803 S. Broadway, operates on an annual budget of 
about $375,000 with a staff of 12, including a part-time counselor works with 
victims.

COVER STORY; FINALLY, A RETURN ENGAGEMENT; PIANIST VAN CLIBURN IS HITTING THE 
CONCERT TRAIL, WITH HIS FIRST STOP AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL IN 18 YEARS. HE'S COME 
A LONG WAY FROM THE CHILD PRODIGY WHO WOWED THE WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRETA BEIGEL, Greta Beigel is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I don't like to practice, never have," Van Cliburn is saying in an interview. 
"But when I do get started at the piano, for the first 10 minutes I play 
scales, slowly. I've done this all my life." 
</P>
<P>
 As if to stress the importance of this regimen, Cliburn, arguably the most 
celebrated American pianist of his time, proceeds to demonstrate how scales 
should be played. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen to the sounds you make," he instructs a visitor. "The sound of each 
tone will generate a response in you. It will give you energy." Then, drawing 
himself to his full 6-foot-4 height, he looks down and admonishes, "We both 
know you'll practice tonight, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Practicing scales, and thirds and sixths and even 10ths, helped Cliburn 
maintain his technical mastery during a self-imposed exile from the concert 
platform that began in 1978 and ended nine years later when he accepted an 
invitation from President Reagan to perform at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't abandon the piano," he says of his much-publicized hiatus. "The 
piano was always there." 
</P>
<P>
 And so he played chamber music and pieces close to his heart, such as the 
Schubert sonatas, and went to the opera and hosted musical soirees for friends. 
It all has given the former child prodigy, who is about to turn 60, a 
much-needed perspective on life and recharged his energies to the point where 
he is ready to hit the road extensively for the first time in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliburn opens a 16-city, six-week concert tour with the Moscow Philharmonic on 
Saturday at San Diego's Summer Pops Bowl and on July 11 visits the Hollywood 
Bowl, where he last appeared in 1976. Under Vassily Sinaisky, he'll perform 
Rachmaninoff's Third Concerto and the Tchaikovsky First, vehicles that 
propelled him to triumph -- and instant stardom -- at the 1958 Tchaikovsky 
International Piano Competition in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been playing concerts since 1987 but not on a large scale or on a 
schedule," Cliburn explains. "Then everything just fell into my lap. The Moscow 
Philharmonic (the orchestra had accompanied Cliburn in the finals of the 
Tchaikovsky) contacted me and said they had this time open. Also, Mr. Sinaisky, 
who was an assistant to (the late) Kiril Kondrashin, is a wonderful conductor 
and a great musical personality. Everything fell into place." 
</P>
<P>
 On a visit to Los Angeles to promote the tour, Cliburn, slender and refined in 
a dark blue suit and red tie, meets with members of the media at a Beverly 
Hills hotel. He is surrounded by all sorts of managers, publicists, friends and 
agents, who graciously depart, one by one, when a private audience is 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfailingly courteous, Cliburn, hands clasped, dutifully answers questions, at 
times almost by rote. But he positively leaps to life when discussing things 
pianistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't playing the piano an interesting vocation," he muses. 
</P>
<P>
 But he fast becomes irritated when asked if his Tchaikovsky Concerto, played 
thousands of times in concert, and captured on an RCA Victor recording that has 
sold more than 3 million units, will reveal new insights in 1994? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, you don't do that," he says. "You carry with you all your experiences 
on stage and you build on that. Each performance is a rehearsal for the next 
one. Whatever I play in public I like, and if I learn something, it's not to 
play for this week or that week, but forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The impatience persists when it's suggested to Cliburn that perhaps the 
adulation that greeted his every move in the 1960s and 1970s, when he performed 
more than 100 concerts a year, had stymied his growth as an artist and led to 
his early withdrawal from the concert stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "That had nothing to do with it," he says. "Adulation is not a problem. It was 
a conscious thing for me to stop. I decided four years ahead. But you have to 
look back to where I came from. I grew up in a town (Kilgore, Tex.) with a 
population of 6,283, or whatever the roadside sign said. Everybody knew 
everybody. At 12, I played with the Houston Symphony and played here and there 
and people would come from all over to hear me. People were always a part of my 
life. I simply was selfish and wanted time for myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are just waking up to the fact that for Van Cliburn being on 
stage was not his raison d'etre. I love being at home and am a contented 
person. I love mundane things. I love family. My only regret is that I wish I 
could have had children and had a lovely wife. But it didn't happen. I feel if 
you have a child it is a tremendous responsibility, but it would have been fun. 
It would have been an important facet of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the biggest influence in Cliburn's life remains his beloved 
97-year-old mother, Rildia Bee Cliburn, who was his teacher until he was 17 and 
who shares his vast home in Ft. Worth. On the day after his Bowl performance, 
Cliburn will fly there to join her in his birthday celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to be anywhere else," he says. "She is so sweet and vivacious 
and I just love her. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it seems impossible that I'm turning 60. I still feel as if I'm in my 
20s, and feel younger than I did then. But then you look in the mirror . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Lavan Cliburn Jr. was born in Shreveport, La., the son of an oil man 
and his pianist wife. At age 3, the precocious child climbed on a piano stool 
and from that day forth completed daily lessons with his mother, herself a 
pupil of Arthur Friedheim. The St. Petersburg-born Friedheim had studied with 
Anton Rubinstein and Franz Liszt before coming to New York in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
 With his mother at his side, the boy learned all the Chopin Etudes, the 
Transcendental Etudes of Liszt, as well as the Bach Inventions and Preludes and 
Fugues, which he played in public at age 4. At the keyboard, he also learned 
arithmetic and how to read. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother used to say, 'Van, remember I'm not your mother, I'm your teacher,' 
" he says. "She was my biological mother, but in the final analysis was really 
a very dear friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a master psychologist and was so spiritual, and gave me strength for 
all of my life. And my father? You cannot imagine what a loving, heartwarming 
man he was. He adored my mother and loved me and I loved him so much. The last 
thing he said to me before he died (in 1974) was 'Sonny Boy' -- he called me 
that, you know -- 'I love you and look after your mother.' That gave me a lot 
of strength. They made me. I would have been nothing without them." 
</P>
<P>
 Cliburn's mother, wanting her teen-age son to be versed in the Russian way of 
playing, with its technical brilliance and emphasis on Romantic expression, 
determined that he should study with famed pedagogue Rosina Lhevinne at the 
Juilliard School.  
</P>
<P>
 "She (Lhevinne) was great friends with mother and told her that I had the 
foundation already," Cliburn says. "Mother would call her if ever she had a 
good student and she would take them without audition." 
</P>
<P>
 Juilliard faculty member Martin Canin, a fellow student who become Lhevinne's 
assistant for 18 years prior to her death in 1976, says Cliburn clearly stood 
out in the class of 1954, along with talented John Browning. Although somewhat 
eclipsed by Cliburn's subsequent success, Browning, now 61, is enjoying a 
resurgence in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a certain poetry and a romantic something or other," Canin recalls. 
"Van was hugely gifted. He had a beautiful sound and phenomenal technique and 
charisma." 
</P>
<P>
 Lhevinne was instrumental along with then-Juilliard dean Mark Schubart in 
persuading a skeptical Cliburn, 23, to enter the quadrennial Tchaikovsky 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cliburn was initially reluctant because he was under management (Columbia 
Artists) and had had some modest success," says Schubart, who now directs the 
Lincoln Center Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember the political climate at the time. We were in the middle 
of the Cold War and the feeling was that in every musical competition the 
Russians always won. They were represented by professionals who had been 
carefully trained, whereas those from the States were always students with 
little professional experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought Van had a good chance of winning because he was 
extraordinary, but nobody could have foreseen the international impact of his 
winning, the publicity and all that happened as a result." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about those heady days in Moscow, when he created a furor among 
hysterical, flower-throwing throngs, and in New York, where an unprecedented 
ticker-tape parade greeted his return, Cliburn simply responds, "I was 
unconscious throughout." 
</P>
<P>
 He seems more concerned, even anxious, that his earlier successes be noted: 
How at age 18 he won the G. B. Dealey Memorial Award, a national competition in 
Dallas, followed a few months later by the Kosciusko Foundation's Chopin 
Scholarship Award and then the Olga Samaroff Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1954, he received the important Leventritt Award, and a few months later 
made his debut with the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall under the late 
Dimitri Mitropoulos. The conductor went on to help Cliburn prepare for the 
Moscow contest, persuading him to play a Taneyev Prelude and Fugue as opposed 
to selections by Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taneyev was a very revered composition teacher of the Moscow Conservatory," 
Cliburn explains. "The piece is terribly difficult, but is very treasured piece 
among academicians. Metropolis knew this, and he even got the music for me. I 
was only one of three people who did it and was very glad I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Also of considerable joy to Cliburn was his association with the late Bruno 
Walter, a spiritual man with whom he not only collaborated as soloist -- 
Cliburn was at the keyboard at Walter's final appearance on Dec. 4, 1960, at 
the Hollywood Bowl -- but with whom he also studied conducting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so inspiring to be around him," Cliburn says. "I did 27 concerts as a 
conductor. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, my record company (RCA) 
bought some films and one is of conducting and I played and conducted the 
Prokofiev Third (in Moscow). But I gave it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Following his return from Russia in 1958, Cliburn received a hero's welcome in 
his home state of Texas, where a piano competition was inaugurated in his honor 
in Ft. Worth in 1962. The Van Cliburn International today ranks as one of the 
most prestigious and controversial battlegrounds in the pianistic world, with a 
top prize exceeding $200,000 in cash, plus concert engagements and management 
services. Although he has no voting rights, Cliburn remains a strong presence 
at the quadrennial event. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition has served yet another purpose over the years: keeping 
Cliburn's name alive and before the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Also fostering the Cliburn myth are numerous press accounts of his 
iconoclastic lifestyle that supposedly involves midnight suppers, all-night 
musical happenings at his three-story home, 5 a.m. breakfasts, 4 p.m. wake-up 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the stories true? Does Cliburn stay up all night and sleep all day? 
</P>
<P>
 "Naah, we do that occasionally," he replies. "We watch films, and play opera, 
and listen to recordings of Tebaldi and Price and, oh, that wonderful soprano, 
Cecelia Bartoli. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can work and operate well in the daytime, but I love the night when I have 
to work. The daytime is OK to practice fundamentals, but when having to 
seriously study something, between the hours of 11 and 2 a.m. are absolutely 
fabulous. I get clarity and there are no calls and no distractions." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1987, Cliburn emerged from his sabbatical to perform at a White 
House dinner honoring Mikhail Gorbachev and later at the opening of the Bob 
Hope Cultural Center in Palm Springs. Limited engagements followed with the 
Dallas Symphony and Philadelphia Orchestra before Cliburn returned in 1989 to 
the scene of his original triumph: the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, 
where he performed the Liszt Concerto No. 1 -- and the Tchaikovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Cliburn and associates began planning his cross-country 
comeback tour. As a warm-up, Cliburn in recent months has played the 
Tchaikovsky with the Houston Symphony and then the Grant Park Symphony, under 
Leonard Slatkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his June 18 performance at Grant Park Music Festival, the Chicago Tribune's 
John von Rhein notes, "The lanky Texas pianist proved that whatever problems 
had forced his withdrawal from the concert stage two decades into his career, 
he was well-prepared to compete with the Van Cliburn who once so captured the 
American imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 While lauding Cliburn's "colossal technique" and characteristic 
"devil-may-care panache," Von Rhein speculated that the enormous pressure 
inherent in Cliburn's comeback may have "accounted for some self-conscious 
touches, as well as moments of uncertain coordination" with Slatkin and the 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour is budgeted at $4 million. Cliburn receives $125,000 per concert; the 
115-member orchestral contingent $75,000, plus expenses. To attract as large an 
audience as possible, outdoor venues have been booked, save for indoor dates in 
St. Louis, Detroit, Salt Lake City and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliburn admits being nervous about his upcoming appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been nervous ever since I first played in public before I was 4," he 
says. "It's the same sensation. You want to play well, wish to serve and are 
always concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 To cash in on Cliburn's return to the concert arena, RCA Victor has reissued 
on its "Living Stereo" line a CD of Cliburn performing Beethoven's Fifth 
Concerto and the Rachmaninoff Second, with the Chicago Symphony under Fritz 
Reiner. Similar plans are in place for his Schumann Concerto and the Prokofiev 
Third. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent promotional blitz to plug the CD, Cliburn, to his amazement, was 
mobbed by young fans at record stores seeking his autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't get over it," Cliburn says. "Newspapers and a police report said 
2,000 people showed up at a mall in Minnesota. It was the same thing in Boston 
and San Francisco. It's happening everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Cliburn revel in being a superstar? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, because when I'm in my little room at home and I feel all alone, I think, 
I wonder if anyone remembers me." 
</P>
<P>
 To reserve his place in the pantheon of pianistic history, Cliburn often toys 
with writing his memoirs, but fears he'd grow bored writing what would be his 
third biography. His life has been examined in print by Abram Chasins in "The 
Van Cliburn Legend" (1959), and in exhaustive, almost-Pollyannaish detail by 
Chicago Tribune arts critic Howard Reich in the 1993 "Van Cliburn" (Thomas 
Nelson). 
</P>
<P>
 Cliburn, a strong advocate for the study of music in schools, would prefer to 
document his ideas on education, and "write about the interesting ideas and 
feelings" he has about music and life in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been around this earth long enough to have seen something. And maybe 
by having seen something, there is something I can say," Cliburn reminds. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life is bigger than the keyboard, and my world is bigger than the stage. 
When I was 18 I told someone that I had a feeling that the first part of my 
life I would work very hard and then have time for myself and a long vacation. 
It turned out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy." 
</P>
<P>
 * Van Cliburn performs Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at San Diego's Summer Pops Bowl 
at Embarcadero Marina Park South; $23.50-$150; (619) 699-4205. On July 11, he 
appears at 8:30 p.m. at the Hollywood Bowl; $10-$250; (213) 850-2000.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; EX-TEACHER CONVICTED OF GUN POSSESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A former kindergarten teacher at Montara Street Elementary School was 
convicted last week of possession of a handgun on campus and making terrorist 
threats to teachers who turned him in.  
</P>
<P>
 After a four-day trial in Norwalk Superior Court, the jury took just 80 
minutes Monday to reach guilty verdicts on four felony counts against Raymond 
Jett Jr., 36, who was arrested Feb. 24 for having a handgun under the driver's 
seat of his car in the school's faculty parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 He posted bail and was rearrested a day later for allegedly threatening to 
"end the careers" of several teachers at the school who he suspected of turning 
him in. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a bizarre case," said Marc Merrick, the deputy district attorney who 
argued the case. "And a serious crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Merrick said that Jett "admitted having the gun on campus and admitted being 
on bail while he made the phone (threat)." 
</P>
<P>
 Jett testified that he routinely carried a loaded gun when he was going to the 
bank, Merrick said, and that the 18 other weapons seized at his house after the 
February arrest were simply evidence of his hobby as a gun collector and a 
Civil War buff. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrick said that Jett has a permit for the gun found in his car and 
authorities are trying to locate permits for the weapons found at his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett's attorney, Robert McDaniel, said he will decide whether to appeal the 
case after a sentencing hearing July 18. Jett faces up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am really unhappy with the jury verdict in this case," McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel argued during the trial that the faculty parking lot is next to the 
school, not on campus, where it is illegal to have a firearm. He also said Jett 
denied making serious threats to teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett was a kindergarten teacher at the school since last summer and for seven 
years before that he was a substitute teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrests, a group of parents stuck by him, saying he was a fine 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District on June 20 officially terminated Jett, 
who had been on unpaid leave since his arrests, said Walt Green, director of 
employee relations at the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for both sides said Jett will undergo diagnostic testing at the 
state prison facility in Chino to evaluate whether he is fit to be imprisoned 
among the general prison population. BOB ELSTON

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL GARDENS; COUNCIL BLASTED OVER CONSULTANT HIRING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To the cries of cronyism, the City Council voted last week to award a 
lucrative consulting contract to a woman who has worked on the election 
campaigns of three City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemarie Vasquez, a commentator on KABC-TV Channel 7 news who owned a jewelry 
business in Montebello, will be paid $4,000 per month to "improve the quality 
of life in Bell Gardens" as an independent consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 She started her job Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 90-minute public debate Monday night about Vasquez's credentials as an 
educational and political activist, two views emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens attested to her influence as a founder of the Hispanic Coalition, a 
group that has raised $93,000 in scholarship money for the youths of Bell 
Gardens and Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a known achiever," wrote Ramiro Morales, the City Council member who 
recommended her for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 But a number of residents also complained that Vasquez isn't the right person 
for the job because she worked on the campaigns of Maria S. Chacon, Morales and 
George T. Deitch this year. Also, she lives in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez won the consulting contract without entering a competitive bid or 
competing against other applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the City Council) did not want anybody else to get this job," Deitch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Frank Duran and Rodolfo (Rudy) Garcia joined Chacon and Morales in 
voting to hire Vasquez; Deitch abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez will focus on community outreach and public relations. Her duties will 
include promoting social services in the city and making recommendations for 
improving the city's monthly cable-TV show and the annual Community Health 
Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez could not be reached for comment. BOB ELSTON

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; CITY BATTENS DOWN FOR MEXICO MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twice in the past two weeks, merchants along Pacific Boulevard have had to 
close their businesses to protect their inventories from crowds celebrating the 
achievements of the Mexican soccer team in the World Cup.  
</P>
<P>
 While the Mexican team prepares to take the field Tuesday in New Jersey, 
businesses, city officials and police in Huntington Park are preparing to 
prevent trouble by putting most of the city's 68 officers on the streets on 
game day, closing down the main drag and imposing a 10 p.m. curfew for the 
entire city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city has become more aware of (what can happen) through the 
excitement of Mexico winning," said Gilda Gonzalez, a member of the Huntington 
Park Chamber of Commerce, which has an office on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's volatile situation "started out with celebration and people 
exerting their happiness . . . but it was amazing how fast it turned into a 
total disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are preparing to implement crowd control plans and to barricade 
streets, but many merchants are worried about losing money and another day of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Many noted that they will lose money even if celebrations are peaceful because 
revelers would be on the boulevard solely to show support for the soccer team, 
not to shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be reasonable to close down the boulevard," said Larry Noble, store 
manager at the J. C. Penney branch on Pacific Boulevard near Gage Avenue. "But 
I am concerned that this will be costly to us. . . . Our business was pretty 
much at a standstill" Tuesday, even before the boulevard was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Tuesday, thousands celebrated the Mexican national team's 1-1 tie with 
Italy, which allowed Mexico to advance to the round of 16, by pouring onto the 
boulevard to wave the red, white and green flag of Mexico and honk their car 
horns.  
</P>
<P>
 Some unruly members of the crowd tossed bus stop benches into the street, 
hurled fireworks at passing vehicles, and threw rocks and bottles at police 
officers in riot gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Police responded by using "stingballs" -- non-lethal, softball-sized grenades 
that release rubber pellets -- and by forming a "skirmish line" to methodically 
force the crowds to clear Pacific Boulevard from Florence to Slauson avenues 
throughout the day Tuesday and into early Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Most merchants evacuated customers and employees from stores and locked the 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities reported 17 arrests and one injury but little damage to 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 One business -- a collapsible fireworks stand at Pacific Boulevard and 
Belgrave Avenue -- was looted of $10,000 worth of fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous week, crowds celebrated Mexico's 2-1 win over Ireland by 
congregating on Pacific Boulevard. That day's celebration was interrupted when 
some in the crowd started hurling various projectiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Police exercised similar crowd control measures by pushing revelers off the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 If Mexico continues to win World Cup matches, the celebrations will only 
intensify, said many of those who took to the city's streets last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is party time and this has just begun," said Eric Morales, who watched the 
Mexico-Italy game at his Alhambra home, then drove to Huntington Park to join 
in the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next (win) will be even bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Next time, though, police and city officials plan to have the boulevard closed 
before Mexico's second-round match is decided.  
</P>
<P>
 "We need to be prepared," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to know that you are allowed to celebrate but not to destroy 
things." BOB ELSTON

HIV-POSITIVIST; MICHAEL KEARNS HAS MADE A STAGE CAREER OF HIS ACTIVISM, AND A 
SUCCESSFUL LIFE IN HOLLYWOOD -- SAYING THE HECK WITH HOMOPHOBIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, Jan Breslauer is a frequent contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than 20 years, Michael Kearns has divided his time between the highly 
visible world of mainstream TV and film and the less-seen arena of gay theater. 
It hasn't been a cakewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 But what Kearns is best known for is the fact that he has insisted on working 
without camouflaging who he is -- an outspoken, openly gay and, later, openly 
HIV-positive actor. 
</P>
<P>
 He has, after all, been "out" for two decades in an entertainment industry 
infamous for its homophobia. And while he's found himself turned away often for 
reasons that he feels may be connected to his sexuality, he's also gotten a lot 
of work, perhaps as much as anything by virtue of what he calls his 
"unwillingness to take 'no' for an answer." For example, he's managed to find 
directors and others to cast him in such shows as "The Waltons" -- as John 
Boy's older brother -- as well as for guest appearances in "Murder, She Wrote" 
and "Cheers." He also had a part in the TV movie "And the Band Played On." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all the Hollywood barriers Kearns has helped to dent, he is most often 
hailed as one of the outspoken pioneers of the emerging genre known as AIDS 
theater. Especially in the past decade, as it's become clear that there -- and 
not on the sitcoms -- is where Kearns' true life's work lies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a contradiction, but to me it makes perfect sense," says Kearns of his 
Jekyll-and-Hyde creative life. "There's the assumption that L.A. is this 
nirvana for gay people, but Los Angeles is more homophobic at its core than Des 
Moines, because it's a factory town ruled by television and motion pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 As a writer, actor, director and teacher -- and co-founder, with playwright 
James Carroll Pickett, of Artists Confronting AIDS (ACA) -- Kearns has been 
making AIDS-related theater in L.A. for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been dubbed both "the only openly gay actor in Hollywood" and, later, 
the "only openly gay, openly HIV-positive actor in Hollywood," and he hasn't 
shied away from either label. He has appeared on network television news and 
talk shows, speaking out against entertainment industry homophobia and on AIDS 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as visible as Kearns has been as an advocate for gay concerns, he has also 
reached many people through his performances in theaters across the country. 
His multi-character monologues featuring men and women whose lives have been 
touched by AIDS have played to gay and straight audiences alike, in both big 
cities and small. And the many other projects Kearns has produced, directed, 
written or conceived have given the theater-going public important new 
perspectives on the complexity of the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 Kearns will perform his newest solo, "Heart Copy," Wednesday at Highways. The 
following night, also at Highways, he will open "Robert's Memorial," an 
interactive environmental theater piece in the style of "Tony & Tina's Wedding" 
and "Grandma Sylvia's Funeral," where the audience is situated in the midst of 
the event. His play "Mijo" reopens at the Whitefire Theatre in two weeks, and 
Kearns is also producing several other upcoming ACA shows. 
</P>
<P>
 This nonstop productivity, in part, has made Kearns a role model for many gay 
actors. But the fact that he has managed to be successful in both the 
entertainment industry and the theater without compromising his identity as an 
HIV-positive gay man has been even more of an inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, his unwillingness to compromise has earned Kearns respect from some 
lofty quarters. "As a performance artist, Michael Kearns has my admiration," 
says Sir Ian McKellen, the acclaimed, openly gay British classical stage and 
film actor, who was in New York recently to perform his "A Knight Out." "And as 
an openly gay man working in Hollywood, he has earned a place in the history 
books." 
</P>
<P>
 Kearns, 44, was raised in St. Louis and came of age at the cultural moment -- 
25 years ago last week -- when the gay civil rights movement first came busting 
out of the Stonewall bar in New York's Greenwich Village. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1968, the then-teen-age Kearns had gone to New York to study 
at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, but he ended up doing most of his 
"studying" at the Stonewall bar. One year later that downtown hangout became 
the site of the riots now cited as the first defiant act of the modern gay 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Kearns went on to get training at Chicago's Goodman Theatre. Then he followed 
his ambition -- and a lover -- to Los Angeles. Armed with leading-man 
cheekbones and the vicarious aspirations of Midwestern relatives, Kearns came 
to Hollywood with the hope of becoming a movie star, but found himself instead 
cast in Tom Eyen's "The Dirtiest Show in Town," a flamboyant revue featuring 
nudity that was about sexual freedom and other 1970s hot issues, such as war 
and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "During that show it dawned on me that I was much more comfortable on the live 
stage, playing gay characters," says Kearns. "That didn't stop my pursuit of 
the other, but the invigorating work was in small theater playing gay roles." 
</P>
<P>
 Kearns continued to do theater while beginning to work as a screen actor 
during the 1970s. He had some success landing a number of other "straight" 
roles, yet it was his exploits as the fictitious "Happy Hustler" making the 
rounds on the talk-show circuit that brought Kearns the most attention, and 
probably also the most unhappiness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Happy Hustler began when Kearns sold a photograph of himself to Warner 
Paperback Library for use on the cover of "The Happy Hustler," by Grant Tracy 
Saxon. Saxon was Kearns' lover at the time, and his work was a takeoff on 
Xaviera Hollander's best-selling "The Happy Hooker." 
</P>
<P>
 When a New York talk show wanted an interview with Saxon, the publishers 
suggested that Kearns could instead pose as the character in the book, passing 
the novel off as his autobiography. He went along with the ruse for two years, 
twice appearing on "Donahue" because he thought it would help his career, but 
found himself increasingly miserable in the role, feeling he was "only playing 
an untrue fraction and a distorted version" of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of the 1970s, Kearns began to wend his way out of a period of 
what he describes as "self-loathing." He acted in a couple of productions now 
seen as landmarks in local gay theater: Robert Patrick's "T-Shirts" and Harvey 
Fierstein's "International Stud." The productions were staged in tiny houses -- 
including the now-defunct Smitty's Deja Vu Coffee-house, a pioneering gay 
theater venue -- but they became word-of-mouth cult hits that are still 
recalled today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly there was this audience for gay theater," says Kearns. "Meanwhile, 
the community had bloomed in that decade. We were even being reflected in 
television and film to some extent. That was the honeymoon period." Kearns 
hosted a KNBC documentary called "Gay" and network TV began to include gays in 
mainstream shows, such as Billy Crystal's character on "Soap," played, not 
insignificantly, by a straight actor. Other advances came in such films as 
William Friedkin's "Cruising," which, while much-criticized for its depiction 
of gay life, nonetheless made gays less invisible. 
</P>
<P>
 But these semi-halcyon days weren't to last. "Then comes AIDS," says Kearns. 
"People started dying." And as the deaths started to accumulate during the 
early 1980s, Kearns continued in both gay theater and TV and film roles, 
although he began to feel more urgency about his role as an activist and 
spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 He also wrote his first autobiographical solo, "The Truth Is Bad Enough," 
formed a professional partnership with playwright Pickett, directed several 
theater pieces that were the first widely seen works of AIDS theater in Los 
Angeles and did a stint as artistic director of the gay-oriented Celebration 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, Kearns found a new lease on creative life in the midst of all 
the dying. "Somewhere in that time, I became an artist," recalls Kearns. 
"Whatever that pain, that loss, that tragedy was, I managed to spin it like an 
alchemist into something passionate. And it's been increasingly so since." 
</P>
<P>
 During the pivotal mid-1980s, he continued to expand his theater efforts. He 
also hooked up with such fellow-traveler activists as performance artist Tim 
Miller, who co-founded both New York's PS 122 and, later, Santa Monica's 
Highways. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Kearns and Pickett founded ACA, an organization of artists and others 
who were intent on finding ways to nurture their own works, as well as those of 
other artists, about AIDS. "We realized that art and AIDS were inextricably 
linked and that somehow we wanted to address this -- whether it was by raising 
money or consciousness or both," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 A docudrama series titled "AIDS/US" quickly became ACA's calling card. The 
works consisted of various men and women whose lives had been affected by AIDS, 
telling their stories to the audience in a collage-style format of 
direct-address speeches, with only minimal staging. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'AIDS/US' pieces have always been the backbone of our organization," says 
Kearns. "We're taking real-life stories and telling them in first-person 
docudrama form -- which, for my money, is somehow more artistically meritorious 
than most AIDS plays, just because it's so raw and edgy." 
</P>
<P>
 "AIDS/US/TEENS," which will tour to various locations throughout L.A. 
beginning in September, will be the fourth piece in the series that began with 
"AIDS/US." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim (Pickett) and I conceived of that (docudrama) format together because we 
felt that no matter how close to the bone the plays were that were coming out 
around 1984-85 -- and there were only a handful of them -- they weren't really 
giving the entire picture of AIDS," Kearns says. "They certainly weren't, and 
still aren't for that matter, dealing with issues of class, race, sexism and 
all those myriad issues which seem to rear their ugly heads in relationship to 
AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 The students in one of the small group acting classes that Kearns teaches out 
of the back-yard studio of his Glendale home take 10 before heading back for 
more of the intensive coaching that is Kearns' specialty. When they reconvene, 
it's time for scene work. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there's some fine-tuning to do on a section from "Waiting for Godot." 
Then, next up is an excerpt from Edward Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia 
Woolf." This is not standard casting, though: Two guys play the leads, so the 
original script's Strindbergian dance of George and Martha becomes a George and 
Martin pas de deux. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly 15 minutes of visceral work -- with Kearns constantly coaxing the 
actors to stretch and experiment -- fatigue begins to set in and humor gets the 
better of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I'm going to lead a workshop called 'Discovering Your Inner 
Martha,' " jests Kearns, who soon has the room in stitches. "We'll do it at the 
retreat. We'll bring costumes, booze, slutty clothes. Well, everybody just 
seems to be so drawn to this material." 
</P>
<P>
 But then, it figures that Kearns should be a master of making fun of this 
stuff. Hollywood and he have had, after all, as tempestuous a relationship as 
George and Martha. And it's only gotten rockier during the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rock Hudson died in 1985, Kearns, who once had a brief affair with 
Hudson, spoke out about industry homophobia and AIDS. "Although I had been out, 
never was I so out as when Hudson died," Kearns says. "I got assigned a middle 
name -- 'Michael (only openly gay actor in Hollywood) Kearns' -- because I was 
the only one who was willing to go on 'Nightline' and scream and yell and stamp 
my feet, which I did. Then I made a habit of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kearns took his own HIV test in 1989, the same week he premiered his 
multi-character show "intimacies." This one-man show, and its sequel, "more 
intimacies," quickly garnered Kearns new recognition as a performer. 
</P>
<P>
 In these works, which remain among the artist's most popular, he portrays a 
gallery of people whose lives have been affected by AIDS. Using just a long red 
scarf, he transfigures into such disparate characters as a deaf boy, a priest, 
a flamenco dancer, a prostitute-mom and an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 " '(I)ntimacies' is where I took flight and thank God haven't landed," says 
Kearns. " '(I)ntimacies' was proof that I had something to say and I took that 
seriously. Then, not only was I an artist, I was an activist. So at 39, I 
accepted myself as an artist-activist. That's really only a short time ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have easily died at age 38," Kearns continues. "Think of all the poor 
people who did. That's why I have a tendency to not take one day for granted 
and to overwork the way that I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who have died is film and TV actor Brad Davis. When Davis died in 
1991, Kearns spoke out again, and went public about his own HIV-positive status 
during an NBC interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rock Hudson dies of AIDS, Brad Davis dies of AIDS -- it's six years later and 
people wore a few red ribbons, but the shocking thing was that nothing had 
changed," Kearns says. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his often-scathing criticisms of industry prejudice and inattention to 
AIDS, Kearns continued to work in the entertainment business, including roles 
on the sitcom "Life Goes On" and in "And the Band Played On." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kearns-the-stage-performer kept writing and performing new shows 
like "Rock." Inspired by his own 1983 "dalliance" with the late actor, Kearns 
again used this production to play multiple roles: himself, Marilyn Monroe, an 
Arkansas teen called Rocky and Reggie, a composite character based on men whose 
job it had been to "butch-up" Hudson's mannerisms. Rock himself never appears. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Rock," Kearns more directly attacked Hollywood's homophobia than he had in 
his previous shows, pointing toward the even higher-profile stance he has 
maintained since Davis' death. 
</P>
<P>
 Progress since then has been no more than incremental. "Since Brad died, there 
has been more movement on some level," says Kearns. "Yet the thing that 
Hollywood would probably break its arm patting itself on the back over is 
'Philadelphia,' which is a dismal, pathetic representation of AIDS and 
gayness." 
</P>
<P>
 Kearns believes that the powers in the entertainment industry are homophobic 
and that they cater to a perceived homophobic audience. "And lots of (these 
decision-makers) are gay. But they, who are gay, have chandeliers that need to 
be cleaned and car phones and Bill Blass suits and blah . . . blah . . . blah. 
At what point is one selling out? How many people do they have to have die of 
AIDS before they wake up? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's internalized homophobia, an unquenchable self-loathing," Kearns says. 
"There's some 'physician heal thyself' which needs to go on here -- and which 
has, a little. There are a few more out writers, producers and even actors. But 
it's still unsafe overall, and that has been created by 'us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kearns doesn't turn the other cheek. "I like to be in the ring fighting with 
these people," he says. "That's what spurs us on: the contradictions, the red 
ribbons and the superciliousness, self-serving qualities of Hollywood that have 
been around AIDS from the beginning. That's what fuels us theater artists." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a warm Sunday afternoon on May 29 when Kearns was feeling pre-show 
butterflies -- and then some. His latest play, "Mijo," was about to open in 
front of critics and he'd spent the day ministering to his longtime colleague, 
the increasingly ill Pickett. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim had spent the day getting markedly more demented," recalls Kearns. 
"Eventually I said to the nurse, 'Is it my imagination or is he going downhill 
fast?' The nurse agreed that he was. So at 2:20, literally 40 minutes before 
'Mijo' is to open at 3, we're getting Jim ready to go. It becomes slapstick: 
'Get him out the door, take him to the hospital. Go to the play.' It's so 
farcical that it's sad." 
</P>
<P>
 But the show must go on. And Kearns continues to create in defiance of the 
devastation that surrounds him. He has, however, noticed some unconscious 
accommodations on his part. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Kearns wrote or performed works that featured characters who died, 
including an elaborate revival of Charles Ludlam's version of "Camille," with 
Kearns in the title role. Yet even though audiences could sometimes be heard 
sniffling as the heroine died in the third act, Kearns feels that some gay 
people may have stayed away because it was just too difficult to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Camille' was not the audience-grabbing play we had anticipated, because no 
matter how it was gift-wrapped, it was about death," says Kearns. "And they 
didn't want to see death, even in a $1,000 dress." 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, Kearns' two 1994 works -- "Mijo" and "Robert's Memorial" -- 
have the deaths occur offstage. In the former, a play about the mother and 
lover of a dying man, the person who has AIDS is unseen. And in the latter, he 
has already died before the play begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that will break down some of the resistance -- although the urge to 
look away is a response that Kearns understands all too well. He's seen too 
much death himself. And that -- along with a longstanding desire to parent -- 
is partly what has driven him to recently become accredited to be a foster 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
 During the period in which he was interviewed for this article, Kearns was 
playing temporary host to a pair of 4-year-old boys, and he looks forward to 
having more young charges in the future. "I want to see somebody go from age 1 
to age 2 to age 3, as opposed to seeing somebody in their final days," he says. 
"I want to see the life process, as opposed to the death process, begin." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster-parenting also marks another battlefield for Kearns. "Just like I 
deserve to work in the entertainment industry as an openly gay, openly 
HIV-positive actor, I also deserve to be a foster parent as an openly gay, 
openly HIV-positive man," says Kearns. "That's another battle I'm fighting 
here, to point out that HIV does not equal immediate death and that people with 
HIV can have productive, busy lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to leave a mark, more than just in terms of 'he was this loud gay 
actor-activist.' I want to leave it on a personal level, with individuals -- 
kids, students, anyone." 
</P>
<P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; CITY IMPOSES STRICT CONDITIONS ON HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After hearing complaints from the community about prostitution and drug sales 
at a Skid Row hotel, city officials have imposed strict conditions at the 
building to curb the public nuisance problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 conditions for Modoc Hotel, which range from installing no-loitering 
signs to hiring a 24-hour security guard, will go into effect July 15 if no 
appeal is filed by the owner, said Jon S. Perica, associate zoning 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel owner Chung Chuan Wang, who did not appear at the hearing, could not be 
reached for comment. If an appeal is filed, a public hearing will be scheduled 
by the Board of Zoning Appeals, Perica said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, school officials and police told Perica during a June 23 public 
hearing that the two-story 76-room brick hotel at 819 S. Towne Ave. -- across 
the street from an elementary school -- has attracted prostitutes and drug 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and school officials testified that drug needles were found near 9th 
Street School, and they submitted pictures showing used condoms on the campus 
playground. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police records, 29 arrests were made for prostitution between 
1990 and April of this year. And in November there was a fatal shooting in the 
hotel's parking lot while school was in session, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police say that this hotel has a real reputation throughout the region," 
Perica said. "What you have is men dressed as women, dressed in outrageous 
costumes . . . so outrageous that it stops traffic sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Male prostitutes solicit customers in front of the hotel and then rent a room 
inside, he said. Sometimes they talk to customers through a window in one of 
the hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prostitution surprisingly goes on between 6 and 8 a.m.," just as school 
begins across the street, Perica said. "What type of example are we showing 
children as far as acceptable behavior? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real bad case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blight in and around Modoc Hotel over the years has also contributed to the 
problem. Wang pleaded no contest to various slum charges in 1989 and again last 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang is in the second week of a 30-day sentence under house arrest at Modoc 
Hotel. A judge issued the sentence earlier this month after finding that Wang 
failed to clear trash from the building, a health violation. Although the judge 
released him from house arrest for one day to attend the June 23 hearing, Wang 
did not show up, Perica said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the conditions take effect July 14, the owner will have three months to 
comply with them or face a second public hearing in which city officials can 
consider pulling the hotel's operating permit, Perica said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other conditions include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Hiring a hotel management company to screen all tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Requiring valid identification of all hotel guests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keeping clean all hotel property as well as the front sidewalk of 9th Street 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paying a $4,052 fine for city costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Perica said he has reviewed other hotel cases before but "this is in a 
category all by itself." TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ECHO PARK; 16-YEAR-OLD CHARGED SERIES OF ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old Echo Park boy has been charged in connection with a 
three-month-long armed-robbery spree that preyed upon drivers in Silver Lake, 
Echo Park and Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, whose name was withheld because of his age, could be tried as an 
adult pending a hearing July 20, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Licker. 
</P>
<P>
 He could face up to five years in jail for each robbery conviction and another 
five if found guilty of using a gun while committing a crime, Licker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although prosecutors filed only seven counts, police believe he was involved 
in at least 30 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some crimes that go as far back as April that we think we can tie him 
to," said Detective Gary Greubel of the Police Department's Northeast Division. 
But the big crime spree happened June 6-24, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the driver of a blue Honda Prelude wielded a handgun and demanded 
money while remaining in his vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 In most of the cases, the victims had just parked their vehicles at home and 
were trying to get out, police said. No one was injured in the holdups. 
</P>
<P>
 One female victim in Silver Lake rammed her vehicle into the Prelude in an 
effort to stop the thief, Greubel said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bandit drove away and she ended up driving back home to call police. 
</P>
<P>
 The most money stolen at one time was $300, but Greubel said he didn't know 
the total from all victims. The boy, who is from Thailand but lives with his 
grandmother, also told police that he was using the money to purchase drugs, 
Greubel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested the suspect June 24 in Echo Park while responding to an 
attempted-robbery call. The driver of a blue Prelude demanded money from a 
resident who was getting out of his vehicle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of handing over money, the victim ran into his house and called 
police, Greubel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bandit drove away and was caught by police at Berkeley and Alvarado 
streets. A .357 Magnum was recovered from the vehicle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the crime spree prompted officers to send out flyers June 20 to 
residents in the Silver Lake, Echo Park and Elysian Valley communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Adams, an Elysian Valley community activist who received one of those 
flyers, said she is worried about future similar crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad that they catch any criminal," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But "when they arrest one, there's usually two or three other ones with them."

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: VERMONT AVENUE AREA; NEW TAX MAY COME WITH THE RED 
LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Metro Rail is coming" proclaims a new brochure distributed by the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority to commercial property owners along the 
Vermont Avenue corridor -- and it's bringing a new tax with it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's obvious that Metro Rail is on the way. Businesses near the planned 
stations, such as the one at Vermont Avenue and Beverly Boulevard, are already 
feeling the pinch as potential customers steer clear of the congested, noisy 
construction areas. But less well known is that a tax, or benefit assessment, 
will be imposed on the businesses to pay for a portion of subway construction 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA plans to assess a one-time fee of 86 cents to $1.06 per square foot on 
commercial property within half a mile of Red Line subway stations, or smaller 
annual payments stretched over longer periods of time. The matter was first 
raised and debated during public meetings in 1989 and 1990, MTA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 572 properties in the Vermont corridor from Beverly Boulevard to Sunset 
Boulevard can be assessed the tax, said David Sikes, the program manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory behind the fee is that subway stations increase the value of nearby 
property and benefit businesses by increasing their accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA wants commercial property owners to share the projected benefits and 
pay for 3% of the construction costs for Phase 2 of the Red Line, which will 
follow Vermont Avenue to North Hollywood and is expected to open in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "The MTA is trying to have its cake and eat it, too," said Bruce E. Newmark, 
general manager of Midway Ford, at a recent meeting of the Vermont Citizens 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway Ford is one of the largest property owners near the intersection of 
Vermont and Beverly and will be assessed at least $129,000, Newmark said. But a 
50% drop in business on weekends, when construction is heaviest, and added 
costs related to construction could also cost the company at least that much, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a car dealership and service center is unlikely to derive any direct 
benefits from a subway, Newmark said. "People don't walk up to a dealership to 
have their car serviced," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Operators of smaller businesses wonder if they can even survive through the 
subway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it will be good when it's finished, but so far it's bad for business," 
said Herman Artica, who has owned a sportswear store in the 3800 block of 
Beverly Boulevard for more than 15 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "There used to be restaurants and stores across the street, and a lot of the 
people who shopped there came to my place too. But they demolished those 
stores. No one comes by now because of the construction." 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of the subway's future benefits does not impress Artica: "I 
don't know if I will be here in three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Some time this summer or fall, the City Council is expected to consider the 
MTA's proposals regarding the boundaries and payment methods for the benefit 
assessment districts, Sikes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The next meeting of the Vermont Citizens Committee is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. 
July 19 at the Metro Rail Information Center, 972 N. Vermont Ave. 
</P>

<P>
 The Hotel Californian, a single-room-occupancy hotel chronically cited for 
dozens of housing and safety code violations, suffered $90,000 in damage last 
weekend after a fire destroyed the building's top floor, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the blaze, contained by 100 firefighters in about 35 
minutes.Deborah Foley, the building's manager, said the fire may have started 
about 11 p.m. June 25 in one of the rooms of the five-story 1920s hotel. About 
60 people live in the 200-room Californian at 1907 W. 6th St. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Humphrey, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire Department, said the 
blaze remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week half of the fifth floor was closed for repairs, Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The building suffers from a score of problems and has been cited with as many 
as 20 safety violations three times since 1989, according to officials in the 
city's Housing Slum Task Force. LUCILLE RENWICK

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A groundbreaking ceremony last week marked the beginning of renovation 
construction at the historic Angeles Mesa library, 2400 W. 52nd St. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1928, the California Renaissance-style facility will undergo 
earthquake reinforcement and be expanded about 20% to 6,000 square feet, said 
Robert Reagan, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Public Library system.The 
original building was deemed seismically unsafe by the city and ordered closed 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Temporary quarters were set up at Angeles Mesa Elementary School, 2611 W. 52nd 
St., which is open 12:30 to 8 p.m. Mondays and Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. 
Tuesdays and Saturdays, and 12:30 to 5:30 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction, scheduled for completion in late 1995, will include a new 
multipurpose room, an automated circulation system and computerized catalogues, 
and several public artworks. Funds for the renovations were made possible by 
passage of the 1989 state library bond issue and through Housing and Community 
Development Block Grant funds.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; CRENSHAW BLVD. GOES ON CRUISE CONTROL

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Chae Gross ventured out to Crenshaw Boulevard recently to join the 
legions of cruisers who regularly parade up and down the thoroughfare, he was 
shocked by what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone were the traffic snarls, rowdiness and bikini-clad girls standing up in 
convertibles who lately have caused a ruckus on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there were "barricades, detours, policemen rerouting everyone," said 
the 22-year-old, incredulity in his voice. "I hung out for a while on the side 
streets, but it wasn't the same. I left after about 15 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 After years of complaints from businesses, residents and police, the city is 
trying to drive home a point that cruising is not welcome on Crenshaw. The City 
Council recently passed an ordinance allowing police to block off a 3 1/2-mile 
stretch of Crenshaw on Sunday nights between 9 p.m. and midnight -- peak 
cruising hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are barricading Crenshaw from Adams Boulevard south to 78th Street, the 
border with Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Only area residents, emergency vehicles and patrons of local businesses are 
allowed through, although traffic on east-west streets intersecting Crenshaw, 
such as Vernon Avenue, is not affected. The area between Adams and Jefferson 
Boulevard will remain open until 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Leslie Wilbanks of the Police Department's South Traffic Division said 
cruising had simply gotten out of hand and needed to be checked with drastic 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just gotten worse every year," he said. "Residents are upset because of 
the noise, the music, the fact they can't get in or out of their driveways. . . 
. The problem is not just on Crenshaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Charles Williams says he favors any solution that works. "It is a 
drastic step, but if this is what it takes, fine," said Williams, who lives 
near Crenshaw and 74th Street, long a favorite cruiser hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are tired of seeing beer cans on their lawns, getting caught in that 
traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 Police representatives have met with Young and other residents and business 
owners since February to discuss the problem and map out a strategy. Most were 
in favor of the blockade.  
</P>
<P>
 Tony Marco, manager of The Boys Market at Crenshaw and Rodeo Road, supports 
the blockade. "Cruising has just killed our night business," he said. 
"Customers are scared by kids hanging out in the parking lot and acting wild." 
</P>
<P>
 But Yum-Yum Donut manager Carlos Palencia expressed concern that business at 
his shop at Crenshaw and Exposition boulevards will be adversely affected by 
the absence of cruisers, who frequently meet there. "We're open 24 hours, and 
we do pretty good business Sunday nights," he said. "I don't know. Maybe we'll 
close during those hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony, a longtime cruiser who asked that his last name not be used, said he 
doubts that the barricade will stop a Crenshaw tradition that dates to the 
early '70s and attracts young people from as far away as Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it'll make a difference," he said. "People will still drive on, 
park in different spots on different streets or in parking lots. I stayed out 
till 2 a.m. last week, and Crenshaw was closed. People find ways around it." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Gross says he and other die-hard cruisers will defy the barricade by 
convening on side streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people out there are just having a good time," he said. "People now got 
new cars for graduation and want to take them out and show them off. They'll be 
there." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EASTSIDE; MTA CLEARS WAY FOR SUBWAY EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans for the Metro Red Line's Eastside extension have passed a major hurdle 
with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's recent approval of the 
project's final environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 The subway line will extend 6.8 miles from Union Station to Atlantic Boulevard 
at a cost of $979.6 million, displacing 200 households and more than 50 
businesses. Appraisals and negotiations for the buyouts are not expected to 
begin until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The first segment, expected to begin construction by late 1996 or early 1997 
and be completed by 2002, will include stations at Little Tokyo, 1st Street and 
Boyle Avenue, Cesar E. Chavez Avenue and Soto Street and 1st and Lorena 
streets.  
</P>
<P>
 Members of a Review Advisory Committee, made up of 27 residents, business 
owners and others, met monthly to work out community concerns, such as station 
construction and the disruption from construction and noise. Recommendations 
included building the stations at street level instead of elevating them and 
placing entrances and exits off busy streets to minimize the effects on 
commercial corridors and residents, said Project Director Diego Cardoso. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction crews try to do their tunneling with as little disruption to the 
community as possible, Cardoso said. "We don't want to take, for example, a 
market or something that is essential. We have identified properties that are 
vacant or run down." 
</P>
<P>
 Another recommendation is to replace demolished housing within one-quarter of 
a mile of the new stations. "For example, at Brooklyn and Soto, properties that 
we use (to make way for construction) might not be needed once construction is 
done, so maybe we will build affordable housing. But we have to work with the 
community on those issues," Cardoso said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the project's funding will come from the federal Department 
of Transportation and an additional 13% from the state. The rest will be paid 
through Proposition A and C sales tax dollars.  
</P>
<P>
 The final report's completion fulfills state and federal environmental 
requirements for the Red Line's Eastside extension, said MTA Chairman and Los 
Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the second segment, which would include stations on Whittier 
Boulevard at Rowan Avenue, Arizona Avenue and Atlantic Boulevard, has not been 
secured, Cardoso said. But officials hope to have funds rounded up by the time 
the first segment is completed in 2002, he said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: HIGHLAND PARK; PARENT VOLUNTEERS HELP PROGRAM GROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This summer, children and parents will change the way they spend their summer 
by initiating a free activities program that solves the lack of child care. 
</P>
<P>
 Created by the parents and staff at the Highland Park Family Resource Center, 
the summer activities project will begin July 18 with adults volunteering to 
supervise the 5- to 16-year-olds at least two days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's smaller staff-supervised program enrolled 12 youths, but this 
year's program is much more ambitious. The cooperative format frees parents to 
take classes, work or run errands while being assured that their children are 
in a safe environment and involved in productive activities, said Patricia 
Bowie, project director. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will allow them as a group to have access to programs that they wouldn't 
if someone were to just watch your child for an afternoon," Bowie said. "This 
has the possibility for real growth. We wanted to test it out to see if it 
works." 
</P>
<P>
 The program will give Dora Guzman, 33, peace of mind when she leaves her 
7-year-old daughter there while she works at Los Angeles International Airport. 
"Many of the children are on vacation, so this will give them something to do. 
All the mothers will be participating. Two days a week we will come and be able 
to leave the children every day and know they are being watched," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the program, many of the children would have no alternative to staying 
at home all day, said Maria Mata, 33, whose teen-age sons and 7-year-old 
daughter will be participating. She had to persuade her older children to 
attend; they thought it would appeal only to young children, she said. But 
given the list of activities and field trips, they said they will give the 
program a try. 
</P>
<P>
 And it will give Mata an opportunity to take care of other things: "I'm 
looking for a job and I'm attending English classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Without the parents' volunteering their time, the center would not have been 
able to staff all the activities and supervise about 50 children, Bowie said. 
The program will offer youths trips to the beach, swimming lessons, art and 
music instruction, and field trips.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because all these women got together and we have this number of kids, we 
could do these programs," Bowie said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highland Park Resource Center, at 840 N. Avenue 66, offers counseling, a 
food and clothing bank, tutoring and child care. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer program will run from July 18 to Aug. 12 and then be assessed to 
see if parents want it continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a learning experience for everyone," Bowie said. "It will 
take some coordination, a lot of energy and true commitment." MARY ANNE PEREZ

CITY TIMES COVER STORY; HOME AWAY FROM HOME; BELIZEANS BRING SIGHTS, SOUNDS, 
SMELLS OF THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY TO SOUTH-CENTRAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is sweltering outside, and as they do on most Saturday afternoons, the 
Belizeans gather at the Caribbean Market with their chairs and stools, their 
lilting accents and their staunch opinions.  
</P>
<P>
 A knot of middle-aged men dressed in patterned silk and cotton shirts 
straddles the entrance to the small store, excitedly debating in their Creole 
dialect and native language of Garifuna the fall of O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 An older gentleman with a thinning gray beard and an old camouflage baseball 
cap to shield his eyes from the sun sits placidly on one side of the entrance. 
His is lured by the pungent smell of a peppery homemade onion sauce that fellow 
Belizean Tina Lewis, a seamstress, keeps in a plastic container to top off the 
tuna-filled panades (fried meat patties) she sells every weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Painted on the store's outside wall behind them is a fading Caribbean scene: 
palm trees, mountains and fishing boats in azure water. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 miles away from Belize, the Caribbean Market sits in the heart 
of a burgeoning Belizean community in South-Central. Though their numbers are 
small compared to other ethnic groups in the city, Belizeans have made their 
presence felt in their neighborhood, infusing it with a diverse culture of 
pulsating African-influenced music, vibrant art and distinctive West Indian and 
Latino foods such as conch, cassava, garanaches, fried plantains and 
johnnycake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason anyone can point to of why we ended up settling in this 
area. You follow somebody in your family and you usually stay in the 
community," said Paul Warren, Belize's first honorary consul in Los Angeles 
from 1984 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty soon you have a whole group of people settled in one place. I guess 
that's what happened with we Belizeans." 
</P>
<P>
 More Belizeans live in Los Angeles -- about 30,000 -- than anywhere outside 
Belize, a tiny Central American country the size of New Hampshire whose 229,000 
citizens are squeezed between the Caribbean Sea, Mexico and Guatemala. Many 
have settled in a 10-square-mile area of South-Central bordered by Adams 
Boulevard to the north, Slauson Avenue to the south, Crenshaw Boulevard to the 
west and Avalon Avenue to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Within this small community there are more than 30 civic organizations, half a 
dozen musical bands, a radio show and a string of more than 50 Belizean-owned 
and -operated restaurants and businesses, many of which maintain close ties to 
their native land. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Walk down Western Avenue from Adams to Vernon and it's as if you have stepped 
into a Little Belize. This short stretch has the city's largest concentration 
of Belizean eateries and businesses and reveals the greatest sense of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts with the Belizean Fish Market near Adams with its assortment of 
conch, king and jack fish, and runs past the Plum Tree nightclub near 39th 
Street, blaring with Belizean punta rock music. In between is a string of 
Belizean-owned and -operated restaurants of simple decor, each competing with 
an assortment of piquant Caribbean dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics and news from and patriotism for Belize pervade almost every store 
and restaurant, whether in casual conversation or on the bumper stickers (I 
Punta Gorda or Corazol or Orange Walk), posters or T-shirts that line the 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Nel and John's Belize-American restaurant near Exposition Boulevard is painted 
in the blue and white colors of the Belizean flag, and of owners Nel and John 
Wells' political party, the People's United Party, or PUP. 
</P>
<P>
 Diners at Mom's Caribbean Restaurant down the street are prompted by a sign to 
buy the latest edition of Amandla, one of Belize's three weekly newspapers that 
are flown in to Los Angeles every Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 At a corner table, three diners huddle in front of a composite photograph of 
Belize's newly elected leaders of the United Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aye, this one is Castillo, there," a man says to no response. "How long he 
been in power? They need to keep on top themselves or else (PUP) can come back 
in power, man," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics wasn't the impetus for the exodus from Belize to the United States. A 
1961 hurricane that nearly leveled Belize City sent the first wave of Belizeans 
to Los Angeles, where they easily settled into African American neighborhoods 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's when we open our mouths that you can tell there's a difference," Warren 
said with his singsong accent. 
</P>
<P>
 Belizeans continue to come to the United States with the same aspirations of 
most immigrants: to make money and have a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond its dazzling coral reefs, historical Mayan ruins and wildlife 
sanctuaries, Belize is a poor country relying on a largely agricultural 
economy. Sugar cane, citrus fruit and bananas make up 73% of its exports.  
</P>
<P>
 "We all grew up hearing that America is the land of milk and honey. So when 
you get the chance to come here, you take it and try to make the best," said 
Patrick Barrow, 47. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrow moved to Los Angeles in 1967 at age 20 to catch a piece of the American 
Dream. Now the owner of a furniture refinishing business, he started a 
recording company and heads a Belizean band, the Babylon Warriors, that will 
play in Soccerfest at the L.A. Convention Center on July 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the proliferation of black Belizeans here, Belize itself is a medley 
of ethnic groups: Creole, Carib, Garifuna, East Indian, Mestizo (a mixture of 
Mayan and Spanish) and Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups don't always harmonize. For decades, there has been a rift between 
northern Belizeans, mainly Creoles, and Garifuna, an ethnic group whose members 
descend from Carib Indians and Africans who mainly live in the southern region 
of Belize. The Creoles looked down on the Garinagu (plural of Garifuna), whose 
language sounds distinctly African. 
</P>
<P>
 The schism between Garinagu and Creoles can be seen in Los Angeles. For the 
most part, the Garinagu have settled east of Western Avenue, while Creoles 
mainly live west of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first when Garinagu came to the country we didn't know many Belizeans who 
were not Garifuna because we were separated," said James Castillo, president of 
the Garifuna Settlement Day Committee, a community organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then someone said: 'We're crazy. Here we are in a foreign country, we 
should act like one (people).' So now we're trying to organize more events 
together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Caribbean Market, which sits on the corner of 48th Street and Hoover 
Avenue, is one of the central gathering places for Belizeans, mainly Garinagu. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the dimly lit store is replete with Caribbean fare: hot sauces; 
pineapple and guava jam; coconut milk and cardboard boxes of plantains, green 
bananas, mangos, yams and cassava lined up near the front counter. On a rickety 
metal cabinet in the back is a primero drum, which sounds the African rhythms 
of southern Belize.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to find a Belizean, especially a Garifuna, you go to 48th and 
Hoover and someone will know where to find your people," said Renick Lambey, a 
termite exterminator who hails from southern Belize and heads a small Belizean 
dance troupe in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambey came to Los Angeles in 1986 and almost immediately sought out the 
Belizeans who hung around the market to hear his native music and learn from 
his more established countrymen how to handle life in his new city. He, in 
turn, has directed several newly arrived Belizeans to the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Belize is such a small country that everyone knows everyone, somehow," said 
Pearl Warren, the first government-appointed consul general in Los Angeles. 
Warren is married to Paul Warren, who volunteered in the post for years. "And 
if they don't know you personally, they know your uncle or your cousin. It 
works the same way here (in Los Angeles)."  
</P>
<P>
 The influx of Belizeans into Los Angeles has been so vast that many have 
rediscovered neighbors and childhood friends from their hometowns at parties, 
in musical circles and at local churches. Belizeans make up a large percentage 
of the congregations of a number of denominations in South Los Angeles, 
including Catholic, Anglican, Methodist and Presbyterian.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a shortage of churches or religions for Belizeans," said Alvin 
Slusher, one of three Belizean ushers at St. John's Episcopal Church on Adams 
Boulevard and Flower Street. About one-third of St. John's congregation is 
Belizean.  
</P>
<P>
 In music and art, the Belizean community is beginning to flourish in its 
adopted home.  
</P>
<P>
 Belizean rapper Pupa Curly said he and most of his counterparts in music and 
art -- singer Andy Palacio, the Babylon Warriors and artists Greg Palacio and 
Rudolph Bent -- who are popular in Belize "really got their start here in the 
States. Then we send our music (or art) back home and our names become real 
popular down there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curly, 32, whose real name is Curlyn Arnold, moved to Los Angeles at age 17 
hoping to become a professional basketball player. Instead, the dreadlocked, 
6-foot-3 Belizean picked up a microphone during his off hours working at 
Pioneer Chicken. He started deejaying and finally rapping and singing punta 
rock, a traditional music derived from the Garifuna and mixed with reggae. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold's sister, Glenda Burns, an actress and dance teacher in Los Angeles, is 
better known as Bella Carib in Belize, the chanteuse of punta soca music, a 
combination of African rhythms and a slower West Indian soca beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music is a part of our culture in Belize and it's almost natural that we 
bring it here and continue to work on it," said Barrow, leader of the Babylon 
Warriors, who play reggae and punta rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Belizean music and art are also channels to keep the culture and history of 
Belize fresh for second-generation Belizeans and younger immigrants, Barrow and 
others say. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems of urban life have cropped up: Some youths have gotten involved with 
Bloods and Crips gangs and been deported to Belize, bringing the gang lifestyle 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want our children to follow in our footsteps and in the culture so it 
doesn't die here in America," said Egzine Bennett, 64, a retired nurse who came 
to the United States in 1966 and has returned to Belize half a dozen times as a 
member of a Belize-American nurses' association to train nurses in her country. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the culture) dies here, then people won't know about it unless they go 
back to Belize. By us keeping up the holidays and celebrations, people will 
remember," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past several years, Belizeans have celebrated their country's major 
holidays -- National Holiday, Independence Day and Garifuna Settlement Day -- 
with celebrations of up to 3,000 people. The annual CayeFest, a gathering of 
Belizean musicians started by Barrow and other musicians in 1987, draws an 
average of 2,000 Belizeans to Rancho Cienega Park each May. 
</P>
<P>
 Although music is an important ingredient at a Belizean fete, it is the food 
that is vital for party-goers. And it is the women, mainly, who have kept this 
tradition of good cooking alive for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all born cooking and dancing, honey. Yes, we all born cooking and 
dancing," said Enid Patton, playfully winding her hips as her sister, Leta 
Flowers, busily kneads dough for powder buns (sweet scones). 
</P>
<P>
 A smell similar to spicy vegetable soup wafts from the hefty pot of cowfoot 
soup (the hoof is not included) simmering on the stove in Flowers' small 
kitchen. Flowers' freezer is jampacked with three dozen aluminum foil-wrapped 
tamales and two dozen tart shells. Cooking is a passion for the 64-year-old 
housekeeper, who arrived in Los Angeles in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 "Belizeans love to eat and congregate. We're industrious and hard-working. And 
Belizean women, they love to cook, and if they have that gift they set up a 
'cook shop,' " said Pearl Warren. 
</P>
<P>
 Flowers has no interest in opening a cook shop, more commonly known as a 
restaurant. Too many restrictions, she says. She's halfway there now, cooking 
enough food for about a dozen people almost every morning in her West 45th 
Street home. Friends and family throng her kitchen, checking out what's cooking 
before settling in at Flowers' cluttered dining room table for the latest 
gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Belizeans, most of Flowers' extended family live nearby, sometimes 
down the street, at most a five-minute drive away. Easy access to the meals, 
admits Flowers' niece-in-law, Mary Barrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the food is eaten and the pots are cleaned, Flowers is still 
cooking. This time it's on the dance floor. Dressed in a flowing aqua pantsuit, 
Flowers shimmies on the dance floor of Ashton's Shatto on Slauson Avenue to 
reggae and soca music, rotating and thrusting her hips. 
</P>
<P>
 On this recent night, the Shatto is the reunion spot for the Skyliters, the 
first Belizean band formed in Los Angeles, during the 1970s. More than 100 
Belizeans, mainly an older crowd, have come to see the old band and wind their 
bodies to the Caribbean music. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Belize music, aye. This is Belize sound, aye," sings the lead woman 
of the Babylon Warriors, which opens the show. As a primero drum thumps out a 
powerful African beat, four members of Lambey's dance troupe, the Belizean 
Exquisite Dancers, file on to the dance floor, donning African-patterned 
outfits and twisting their hips frighteningly fast as they perform traditional 
Garifuna dances. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men tending bar dance to the music, as does a woman overseeing the tamales 
and beans and chicken in the back kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music, the art, the food, the dancing, it's in all Belizeans," said 
artist Greg Palacio. "We all get homesick for the country, but we all can't go 
there. Doing these things here makes sure that we never lose what we've got."

CITIES IN PATH OF 710 EXTENSION OFF ENDANGERED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Saying that recent events have dimmed the chances of extending the Long Beach 
Freeway, the National Trust for Historic Preservation has taken the cities on 
the proposed extension route off its list of 11 Most Endangered Historic 
Places. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena, Pasadena and Los Angeles' El Sereno neighborhood, which had 
spent an unprecedented five years on the national list produced annually by the 
250,000-member preservation group, have been transferred to a "Watch List" of 
less-endangered but still threatened places. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 30-year battle to stop a 6.2-mile extension that would plow through five 
historic districts, (and) force the demolition of more than 1,000 homes . . . 
is not over, but the outlook is brighter," said Richard Moe, president of the 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Trust officials said the change occurred because of a number of events, 
including a Sacramento judge's decision forbidding construction without South 
Pasadena's agreement, a Los Angeles Times editorial encouraging consideration 
of a street-based "low-build" alternative, and the Northridge earthquake 
forcing the county Metropolitan Transportation Authority to put the project on 
the back burner. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Transportation Commission delayed a decision on the route last 
month, which also would need federal funding that has not yet been approved.

PLANS PROCEED FOR HOMELESS CENTER BEFORE FINAL REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD and JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A South-Central organization is going ahead with plans to set up a 
controversial homeless center in San Pedro even though federal officials have 
yet to complete a review of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's Technical Institute Inc. has appointed Samuel Theus as its executive 
public relations director to help establish the center on 27 acres of surplus 
Navy property on Taper Avenue. Theus said the institute plans to start moving 
homeless families into the site's 144 units in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Health and Human Services and Housing and Urban Development 
departments -- which approved Turner's application for the land in January -- 
agreed to review the issue more than two months ago in response to allegations 
that the property is not suitable for a homeless center and that the institute 
lacks the track record to make the project succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is still no definite word from department officials about when the 
review will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do expect that they will have something wrapped up pretty soon," said Jack 
Flynn, a spokesman for Health and Human Services. "I'm hoping in the next week 
or two, but I can't say for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Theus said Health and Human Services is now helping the group 
apply for funding to start the homeless project. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Judy Breitman, a Health and Human Services official who recommended 
that Turner's initial application for the property be approved, has been in 
contact with the institute's executive director, Priscilla Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Breitman has "been giving us the information we need and she's been very 
helpful," Theus said. "They speak regularly, and she's working with us to make 
it happen."  
</P>
<P>
 Breitman could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Theus said the institute is applying for $2.2 million from HHS and HUD to 
start the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy personnel and their families will be moved off the site by the time the 
Long Beach Naval Station closes in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute plans to house up to 880 homeless people, but opposition to the 
proposed homeless center is still strong in the San Pedro community. 
</P>
<P>
 Theus said Turner's officials, who faced more than 1,000 hostile residents at 
meetings in March, will now try a different tack.  
</P>
<P>
 "From now on, what we think we'll do is wait until we actually get the 
property . . . and we have some funding in view, because right now, we've been 
putting the cart before the horse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Theus, who is president of the HELP Public Service Foundation, said his 
organization and Turner's have worked together for 15 years. HELP, at 5460 S. 
Crenshaw Blvd., primarily works with the LAPD, helping the families of prison 
inmates. It also has helped homeless shelters, Theus said.  
</P>
<P>
 His appointment follows the resignation of Turner's former assistant director, 
Johnathon C. Marzet, who was in charge of the shelter plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Marzet resigned amid allegations he forged letters of support and falsified 
his educational qualifications in Turner's application to obtain the Taper 
Avenue site. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) is preparing amendments to the Stewart B. 
McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, the law that gives homeless advocacy groups 
such as Turner's first priority on surplus federal property. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman said Tuesday that the amendments would shift more authority over the 
use of surplus military land into the hands of local officials. She expects to 
have the bill ready to introduce after Congress' July 4 recess. 
</P>
<P>
 "My view is that the community should be able to decide on best use of the 
military property. In theory, the McKinney Act does that; in practice, it does 
not," Harman said. 
</P>
<P>
 She plans to base her bill on recommendations for using surplus government 
property made by a task force appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 She will also include three suggestions made by a local committee that was 
established to look at possibilities for surplus military land in San Pedro.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: TROUBLE ON 'TROUBLE' SET?; 
TAKE YOUR PICK: (A) CO-STARS JULIA ROBERTS AND NICK NOLTE GOT ON EACH OTHER'S 
NERVES; (B) THE FILMMAKERS GOT ON THEIR NERVES; (C) SNOOPY QUESTIONS ARE 
GETTING ON EVERYONE'S NERVES.

<P>
 If the rumors of discontent on the set of Julia Roberts' new film, "I Love 
Trouble," are to be believed, the film couldn't be more aptly named. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Roth's Caravan Pictures film, which also stars Nick Nolte under the 
direction of Charles Shyer, is about two dueling Chicago reporters chasing the 
scoop of a lifetime. Roberts plays Sabrina Peterson, the fresh-faced, 
no-nonsense cub reporter at the Chicago Globe; Nolte plays city columnist Peter 
Brackett for the rival Chicago Chronicle, a legend in his own mind who is much 
more interested in gathering women than front-page news. Peterson's tenacity 
and competitive edge ends up reviving archrival Brackett's burned-out reportage 
as the two go notebook-to-notebook on a train wreck story that turns into much 
more -- murder, mayhem and a little romance along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources on the set say the stars may have taken the mayhem part a little 
too seriously -- and the friction may account for the less-than-sparkling 
chemistry that some reviewers have complained about. 
</P>
<P>
 Those involved in the production say that Nolte and Roberts didn't get along. 
They claim tempers flared early on, peppered with a few Roberts tantrums along 
the way. Roberts reportedly wasn't thrilled with Nolte's machismo, so she would 
deride and insult her co-star. Some on the set claim that he became so annoyed 
with her attitude that he would do things to agitate her even more. The discord 
was so intense, the sources say, the two played more to stand-ins than to each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Other studio sources insist that any differences on the set were actually 
between the co-stars and Shyer and producer Nancy Meyers, with the filmmakers 
making Roberts and Nolte improvise repeatedly on the same line. "It drove them 
(Nolte and Roberts, in particular) nuts," says one source. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources affiliated with the film say that the bad chemistry between the stars 
shows up in the film. They point to Disney's decision to switch gears in 
marketing late in the game -- from romantic comedy to suspense thriller. Quips 
one competitor: "It's gone from a Hepburn-Tracy 'Woman of the Year' to 'Pelican 
Brief' in a very short time span." Kenneth Turan, in his Los Angeles Times 
review of the film last week, said that "the repartee is mostly lackluster" and 
"the romantic comedy aspects . . . are not especially entrancing despite the 
star power." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney said the various rumors of rifts are untrue, saying that all involved 
were "complete pros" on the set. In a "Trouble" press junket, for which Roberts 
did back-to-back interviews for two days, Disney lauded her performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish more stars took a page from (Julia's) notebook. She recognized selling 
this movie was her job. She was unbelievably pleasant to people," said Disney 
spokeswoman Terry Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolte's agent, Jim Wiatt, has said the stars experienced only the typical 
spats between stars on a set.  
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, who is filming "Mary Reilly" in England, wasn't available for 
comment. But Nancy Seltzer, publicist for Roberts, Shyer and Meyers, denied the 
account of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Serious publications only exacerbate the problem by repeating these rumors," 
Seltzer said. "By virtue of this kind of reporting they give permission to the 
lesser serious publications to do the same without conscience. I'm greatly 
saddened by the current trend that journalism seems to be taking . . . that of 
the business of selling copy instead of the search for the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, notes Seltzer, Roberts has already addressed the purported rift 
issue, both in the New York Times, which quoted Roberts as saying she and Nolte 
"sort of gave each other a hard time" from the moment they met. She went on to 
say that while Nolte can be "charming and nice, he's also completely 
disgusting."  
</P>
<P>
 For clarification on what Roberts meant, Seltzer defers to one of the star's 
current crop of magazine cover stories, that in Entertainment Weekly: "We had 
great, um, high-spirited needling of each other, trying to get a rise out of 
each other."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: NATURAL BORN FLAP OVER, 
YES, VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Oliver Stone's upcoming "Natural Born Killers" could easily be dubbed Natural 
Born Jitters, considering Warner Bros.' and the MPAA ratings board's worries 
about the film's violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Quentin Tarantino, who has made his name with such ultraviolent films as 
"Reservoir Dogs" (which he wrote and directed) and "True Romance" (which he 
wrote), and who wrote "Killers' " original screenplay, has taken only a story 
credit and distanced himself from the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "This movie makes 'True Romance' look like 'Bambi,' " says one Warners source. 
"True Romance," the 1993 film that also explored the murder spree of two 
lovers, also had entanglements with the ratings board over violence before 
finally being awarded an R. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stone, never one to shy from tackling violent projects ("Platoon," 
"Scarface," "Midnight Express"), was candid in an interview about his film and 
the talk surrounding it. It is scheduled to be released Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, which stars Woody Harrelson, Juliette Lewis, Robert Downey Jr. and 
Tommy Lee Jones, centers on a serial-killer couple (Harrelson and Lewis) and a 
despicable talk show host (Downey) who spends his time tromping around the 
country interviewing vicious killers for his tabloid show, "American Maniacs." 
Warners and Stone call it a satire on the media's insatiable appetite for 
broadcasting violence, desensitizing its viewing public to horror and making 
heroes out of anti-heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the juxtaposition of the film's being released in the wake of the 
nation's morbid curiosity about the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Goldman, and the subsequent arrest of O.J. Simpson, has given the controversy 
an even more surreal feel, says Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started making this movie I completely envisioned this as satire," 
says Stone. "Then this . . . reality . . . happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Warners spokesman Rob Friedman: "Oliver's movie is like looking through a 
warped mirror. Every frame of this movie is surreal. Its intent is to provoke 
thinking about what's going on with the media today. During sweeps week two 
major networks had interviews with serial killers, Jeffrey Dahmer and Charles 
Manson. Donahue wanted to air an execution. So Oliver's movie is tame by what's 
being aired . . . but it's something he believes we will eventually be seeing 
on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Warners says the studio's concerns were ironed out with Stone before the film 
was submitted to the ratings board, which has awarded it an R. He insists any 
disputes Stone had with executives over the violence were no worse than the 
typical disputes directors have with the studio over other films. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone says his is not so much about violence, but "the forces of chaos." 
Therein lies the rub. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chaos is what the ratings board had concerns about," Stone says. "When 
(the board) saw the prison riot that was filmed with real prisoners, they got a 
little concerned. It (exemplified) an accumulation of madness." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone says he had known about Warners' policy of not releasing NC-17 movies, 
only R-rated ones, before submitting the film to be rated. Studio sources say 
that the director and executives squabbled over cutting certain scenes. Warners 
Chairman Robert Daly, in particular, had voiced concerned about the nonstop 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone met with the ratings board five times and cut several scenes from the 
film before it was finally rated R. One cut was a shot of Downey's being shot 
in the hand, then the camera shot other scenes through the hole in the hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone said the uncut version of the film was "screened for kids in Seattle. 
They laughed at that scene because of the way it is set up. It is violence done 
satirically." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other scenes that some consider questionable, which remain in the 
film. One has Lewis' character's shooting a convenience store clerk in the head 
after having sex with him on the hood of a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Another shows a knife being thrown through a plate glass window and landing in 
a fleeing victim's back. The shot follows the knife as if the camera were 
riding on it.  
</P>
<P>
 "These scenes, again, are shot as satiric violence," says Stone. "That knife 
scene couldn't happen and you don't take it seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 What the viewer will see is a movie very different from what Tarantino 
intended, say those close to the young writer/director. Tarantino's spokesman 
says that Tarantino has no desire to talk about any differences he and Stone 
had and that he hasn't seen the picture. (His latest directorial effort, "Pulp 
Fiction," will be released in October.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, Quentin had written this several years before," says Stone. "And the 
producers, Jane Hamsher and Don Murphy, brought this to me. The structure and 
characters are there, but this is a film that addresses why violence is . . . 
it's not just another film about violence."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: HIGHCHAIR HIGH JINKS; 
SHAKE, RATTLE AND PACIFIER

 Jimmy Wagner works with some of the most difficult actors in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Prone to temper tantrums and even crying fits, they work only when the mood 
hits them and they can't be mollified with money or fame. Their attention spans 
are short, and they insist on sleeping in the middle of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Wagner has ways of controlling these actors, namely bubbles, toy 
whistles and a toy clown named JoJo. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner is a "baby wrangler" -- a children's director on his resume -- and it's 
his job to help film directors work on sets with babies, many of whom are too 
young even to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 His most recent film, "Baby's Day Out," which opened Friday, is about 
9-month-old Baby Bink's adventures in the big city after he escapes from a trio 
of klutzy kidnapers. Bink, played by identical twins Adam Robert Worton and 
Jacob Joseph Worton, is onscreen for much of the film, crawling through a 
department store, a zoo and a construction site. 
</P>
<P>
 But Adam and Jacob had to learn to crawl before they could act. After they 
were selected in a nationwide search for twins, Wagner worked with them for a 
month before filming began in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always get twins because of the time factor," Wagner says during an 
interview at his home in Silver Lake. "Time is money, and the laws dictate how 
long the children can be at the studio and under the lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're working with kids, it's Murphy's Law, but Murphy's Law is called 
Murphy's Baby's Law. If you think it won't work, it won't work and it will 
never work, and just when you think you got 'em, they'll fool you." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner, a single 43-year-old with no children of his own, is one of the only 
baby wranglers on the West Coast. He loves his work, he says, and he seems to 
like bringing it home with him. A small set of drawers on wheels in his living 
room holds his collection of whistles, bells and other tools of the 
baby-calming trade, and there's a Mickey Mouse phone on a table in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in Chicago, Wagner still has a slight Chicago accent and talks 
enthusiastically about "da Bulls" and "da mayor." He moved to Los Angeles in 
1975 to break into the film industry, starting out as a cameraman before 
becoming a prop master a few years later. In 1987, one of his friends, also a 
prop master, asked Wagner to help him handle the props for "Baby Boom" for two 
weeks in Vermont.  
</P>
<P>
 Wagner accepted, partly because he had never been to Vermont. It was a fateful 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They brought the babies (into a scene) with no preparation," he says. "The 
baby looked around (and) become hysterical. The director was ripping his hair 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went up to the baby and said ' Boo ,' which startled the baby . . . I ran 
away and the baby started crying again. I got bubbles (from the prop truck and) 
started blowing bubbles, and she was fascinated. I went around blowing bubbles 
out of camera range." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner started working as a Hollywood baby wrangler that night, and he's 
worked consistently ever since, mostly on commercials and TV movies. He uses 
bubbles so often he named his business Bubbles Inc., and when all else fails, 
he brings in JoJo. 
</P>
<P>
 "JoJo was both our savior and the bane of our existence," says "Baby's Day 
Out" director Patrick Read Johnson, referring to the toy's annoying squeal. But 
"for the babies, he was pure magic. Jimmy has a very good insight into the way 
babies work." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner used that insight to prepare the children for a scene that required 
them to fall asleep on a real-looking fake gorilla. "I said, here's the deal: 
The baby's in discovery mode and he loves everything he sees." Just to be safe 
though, Wagner held the babies while wearing the gorilla costume himself to 
make them comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 And though Wagner's experience and education have prepared him for almost 
every situation, working on "Baby's Day Out" taught him another important 
lesson: Don't shake the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the second day I worked with them," Wagner says, pointing to a photo 
of himself in an album. "The reason I'm crying (in the picture) is I got the 
babies and went, 'Hi, how are ya?' (while lifting one of the twins above his 
head). He went 'Yaaahhh' -- he threw up all over. I never shook them again in 
the morning."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: HEY, MAYBE LESLIE NIELSEN 
COULD STAR IN THE NEXT GORE VIDAL SCRIPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gore Vidal, one of America's leading social commentators, is the ultimate 
hyphenate: novelist-essayist-playwright-screenwriter-politician-actor. Seven of 
his novels, including "Burr" and "1876," hit the top of the bestseller list. 
His "United States: Essays 1952-1992" won last year's National Book Award for 
nonfiction, while his adaptation of his play "The Best Man" walked off with the 
Critics' Prize at Cannes. Two unsuccessful bids at political office provided 
the underpinning for his portrayal of a senator in 1992's "Bob Roberts," which 
was followed by a featured role in the recent "With Honors."  
</P>
<P>
 Having just concluded a deal to adapt Edith Wharton's "The Buccaneers" for 
20th Century Fox, Vidal took time out to ruminate on the film business from his 
home in Ravello, Italy.  
</P>
<P>
 Question: You once said, "I am made for battle." Have you had your share in 
Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Political battle is what I had in mind. That's important. Movies 
aren't. But they can be fun to do and, every now and then, something marvelous 
gets made despite all those extra cooks who crowd the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is that what's plaguing Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It was a pity that movies and live TV left New York for Hollywood. London 
theater, movies, television -- until (Britain's) money ran out -- were always 
better than ours since the city was the political capital of the country, as 
well as the artistic and literary one. In L.A. we've always been slightly 
sealed off from real life. It's no accident that two of our most interesting 
directors, Woody Allen and Bob Altman, are more or less settled in the real 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What has been the major change in the film industry since you arrived? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I was, I am told, the last contract writer at MGM. That was around 1954. 
And I've watched from within the tar pits the old studio system -- a tyrannous 
world and not one to be mournful about -- die. That said, at a big studio with 
everyone under contract, you could make a picture economically right on the 
lot. With 52 pictures a year, there was always room for one Orson Welles. No 
longer.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You're about to write a film version of "The Buccaneers." That's full 
circle for you, having set in motion -- and written the introduction to -- a 
volume containing three Wharton novels in 1978. What's her appeal? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In the preface, I said: "Due to her sex, class (in every sense), and place 
of residence (France), she has been denied her proper place in the near-empty 
pantheon of American literature." Those were fighting words in the days when a 
great writer was white and male and lived no farther from our amber waves of 
grain than Cuba.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The producer half-jokingly describes "The Buccaneers" as a cross between 
"Enchanted April" and "How to Marry a Millionaire." 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's very much about how to marry a million- heiress. At the turn of the 
century, much of the aristocracy in Europe was broke and suddenly there was 
this wave of "dollar princesses." Wharton's main character is based on Consuelo 
Vanderbilt -- a woman I knew late in her life -- who was simply transferred by 
her mother, along with a lot of cash, to the idiot Duke of Marlborough. Their 
conquest of the British ruling class signaled that the American empire was now 
ready to absorb its progenitor -- a shift in power from the old to new world.

<P>
 Q: It's been four years since the deal for you to write "Theodora" for 
Universal and Martin Scorsese has been made. What's holding it up? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Marty says that seven years is about right to get a picture made nowadays. 
It was his idea, but my sort of subject. Theodora, a prostitute, marries the 
emperor Justinian and, between them, they restore the Roman Empire. We're 
waiting on new technology, to show battle scenes without "Ben-Hur" prices. The 
"Jurassic Park" special-effects people are involved, I gather. "We've only done 
animals," they said. "Why not people?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Acting is a marked departure from the solitary life of a writer. Was 
performing in "Bob Roberts" and "With Honors" a stretch? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's amazing how many writers have also acted . . . from Dickens to 
Sinclair Lewis -- and of course, Shakespeare. My stuff's a bit different from 
his, of course -- no rhyming couplets. As for stretching, what is fictional 
prose but inhabiting someone else? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In "Bob Roberts," you played a senator locking horns with a media-savvy 
super-patriot played by the director, Tim Robbins. Why did you do the project? 
Are those critics who saw you as the conscience of that film on the mark? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Much of "Bob Roberts" was improvised -- something I have done with Johnny 
Carson and others over the years. And since my off-and-on political life also 
began in 1960 -- the year of Kennedy's election and that of the (fictional) 
senator -- I found it easy to improvise this burned-out old liberal's 
character. Contrary to some reviewers, however, I was not playing myself. If I 
was, I would have been calling for a grand jury trial of Bob/Tim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you deal with the rigors of movie-making? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I did wonder what a 12-hour day would do to my blood pressure. To my 
surprise, it actually lowered it to normal, without the help of beta blockers. 
Movie acting, I later realized, reminds me of contract bridge. Each requires 
the same concentration, intense short-term memory, and obliviousness to 
everything else until the last trump is called -- or whatever it is they do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And the tedium on the set? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Many women knit -- Joanne Woodward is now in her 14th mile of knitwear. Men 
drink or drug. I found it difficult even to read the Chicago Tribune because 
the character I played occupied too much place in my head. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you like about Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Zucker brothers. They are superb -- the Michelangelos of our culture. 
Watch "Airplane!" or "Naked Gun" -- Leslie Nielsen is the greatest American 
actor ever to come out of Canada. I also worship Mr. (Jim) Abrahams, 
particularly for "Hot Shots!" But, as you can see, I'm a highbrow intellectual, 
so what do I know?

STARS WORTH GAZING AT WILL BE IN VIEW AT SUMMER CAMPS; BASKETBALL: MANY OF 
CITY'S BEST, INCLUDING BAILEY, BREEDLOVE AND BURRIS, WILL HONE THEIR SKILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here is a look at 10 top area players, where they'll be playing and what 
they'll be working on this summer: 
</P>
<P>
 * Moose Bailey of Loyola, 6-1 point guard, Pump Discovery Shootout, West Coast 
All-Stars: Bailey has improved his three-point range and dribble-drive to the 
basket. Needs to work on dribbling with his left hand to keep defenders from 
overplaying him to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clem Breedlove of Jordan, 5-10 guard, Pump Discovery Shootout: The possessor 
of a true "shooter's mentality," Breedlove scored 35 points in a win over Locke 
on 15-of-33 shooting from the floor. Needs to improve shot selection and 
scoring from the left side of the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ivory Burris of Verbum Dei, 6-1 guard, Pump Discovery Shootout: Burris' 
outside shooting will make him a good complement to Deon Williams in the 
backcourt. Needs work on driving to the basket to keep defenders from playing 
him straight up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Darwin Carter of Manual Arts, 6-1 point guard, Pump Discovery Shootout: 
Carter is a strong, quick guard who led the Pathfinders in three-pointers made. 
Needs to improve passing abilities and court vision. 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert Lamar Gordon of Washington, 6-6 forward: Gordon's shooting range and 
rebounding abilities enable him to play the 3 or 4 position. Good one-on-one 
defender but needs to raise offensive aggressiveness and defensive intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Will O'Neal of Dorsey, 6-5 forward, Pump Discovery Shootout: O'Neal's 
powerful physique gives him the potential to be one of the top rebounders in 
the area. Can hit the 15-foot jump shot but needs to work on post moves to 
become an inside-outside threat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raymond Palmer of Crenshaw, 6-7 forward, Pump Discovery Shootout: Palmer is 
a good three-point shooter but needs to improve consistency inside the arc. 
Needs to bulk up or he'll take a beating guarding other small but powerful 
forwards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Donnie Wilcher of Fremont, 5-9 point guard, Pump Discovery Shootout: With 
the departure of Tommie Davis, Wilcher now carries the banner of area's top 
point guard. Has excellent court vision and makes great decisions leading the 
fast break. Good three-point range keeps the defense from doubling down. 
Wilcher's great intensity can sometimes take him out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deon Williams of Verbum Dei, 6-1 point guard, Artesia Tournament: Coach Mike 
Kearney says Williams was better as a sophomore than Andre Miller or Jamal 
Cobbs were at that stage. Good ball-handler and passing ability but needs to 
become more consistent with the jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ronnie Arch of Crenshaw, 6-6 guard, no summer tournament: Arch is cut from 
the same mold as former Crenshaw star Reggie McFerren but with a more muscular 
frame. One of the area's top spot-up shooters but has trouble creating shots 
off the dribble.

CRENSHAW GIRLS' AFRICA TRIP OFF; SUMMER BASKETBALL: THE FRENCH ORGANIZATION 
SPONSORING THE TOURNAMENT CANCELS IT, LEAVING THE STUDENTS DISAPPOINTED AND OUT 
$50 EACH.

<P>
 The Crenshaw High girls' basketball team will not be making a 
once-in-a-lifetime trip to Africa, at least not this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federation Francaise de Basketball, which was sponsoring a monthlong trip 
to four African countries beginning July 27, has notified City Section 
Commissioner Barbara Fiege that the Africa Challenge basketball tournament has 
been canceled.The Crenshaw girls' and Banning boys' basketball teams had been 
selected by the City Section to be the first representatives from the United 
States in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The French federation sent a fax Thursday to Fiege that read in part: "The 
reason is that the federations in Africa are not ready for youth competitions 
in the elementary schools we want to organize (le Challenge des Ecoles). 
</P>
<P>
 "All the members of Africa Challenge would like that project to be done with 
integrity. We want to thank you very much for your confidence and we (will) 
keep you in priority for 1995 Tour in which you'll be contacted before December 
1994." 
</P>
<P>
 The Federation did not say anything about compensating the players for the 
money they have spent -- about $50 each -- for vaccinations or passports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed," said Crenshaw co-Coach Greg Cobbs, who was going to 
escort the seven Cougar girls. "These kids were looking forward to this. We had 
study halls to learn more about Africa. Everyone was buying film and borrowing 
video cameras. This is totally ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids didn't take summer school classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe some group will come forward and sponsor us so the kids can go 
somewhere else. It's a sad thing to do to these kids."

NOTEBOOK; MARTINEZ CAPTURES HEART OF THE CITY 5K RUN BY 6 SECONDS 
</P>

 Danny Martinez will begin his third season as assistant cross-country coach at 
Cal State Los Angeles this fall. However, his days as a competitive runner are 
far from over.  
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old former Salesian High athlete won the Union Bank Heart of the 
City 5K run in 14 minutes 52 seconds Wednesday night, pulling away in the final 
half mile for a six-second victory over Oscar Gonzalez to win the 3.1-mile race 
through Downtown streets for the second year in a row. James Sheremeta was 
third in 15:04. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, the runner-up in the steeplechase at the 1982 State junior college 
track finals for Pasadena College, has turned his emphasis from the track to 
the marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the 1991 San Francisco Marathon in a personal best of 2:15.31 and is 
aiming for the 1996 U.S. Olympic Trials in the 26.2-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Smith, the women's Heart of the City run winner, is also a marathon 
veteran. She finished 30th in the 1992 U.S. Olympic Trials and won last year's 
Las Vegas Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 28, ran to a wire-to-wire victory Wednesday in 17:10. Ruth Wysocki, a 
1984 Olympian in the 800 and 1,500 meters, was second in 17:43 and Lilian 
Mendoza was third in 18:04. 
</P>

<P>
 Hoop Happenings: Travis Reed, the lone freshman on Crenshaw High's two-time 
defending State champion boys' basketball team, is playing on Fontana A.B. 
Miller High's summer league team. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stay in Fontana is only temporary for the 6-6 center, who will be 
returning for his sophomore year at Crenshaw. Reed recently moved with his 
father to Fontana after his parents' separation but plans to move back this 
fall to his mother's home in the Crenshaw attendance district. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Covarrubias of Huntington Park and Beaver Patterson of Fremont will attend 
East Los Angeles and Los Angeles City College, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw's Kimberly Howse and Leon Watson will also continue their careers at 
the junior college level but not locally. Howse will attend College of the 
Sequoias in Northern California and Watson is headed for Dixie College in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Caudillo of Roosevelt, the Central League Player of the Year, has 
narrowed her choices to Cal State Dominguez Hills and Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension of Fremont boys' assistant Keith Young for illegal recruiting 
has been lifted by the City Section after an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Repeat Performer: Michael Granville of Bell Gardens has been selected as the 
State Sophomore of the Year by Cal-Hi Sports magazine. Granville, the 
publication's State Freshman of the Year last year, set a national sophomore 
record of 1:48.98 and also won the event in last month's State meet to become 
the school's first state champion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who's on First? Pete Loza of Bell Gardens has been selected to the Southern 
Section Division I first team. The senior pitcher compiled an 8-3 record and a 
2.03 earned-run average. He also batted .489 in leading the Lancers to the 
Almont League title and its first league title in eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Liz Ballesteros and catcher Michelle Tiger of Roosevelt, who helped 
guide the Roughriders to the City 3-A softball semifinals, have been named to 
All-City 3-A team. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Cal State L.A. players were chosen in the Major League baseball draft. 
Outfielder Johnny Hilo was taken by the Dodgers and third baseman Larry Huff 
and pitcher Allen Hebert were drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies and the 
Florida Marlins.

FOR 'GUMP,' EVERY OLDIE WAS JUST TOO GOODIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 How do you cram three decades of classic pop-rock into a single CD? 
</P>
<P>
 You don't -- as the team behind the soundtrack for the highly touted new Tom 
Hanks movie, "Forrest Gump," discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 With 108 minutes of music in the film and a maximum space of about 80 minutes 
on a CD, director Bob Zemeckis, the film's executive music director Joel Sill 
and Epic Soundtrax vice president Glen Brunman had to make a tough choice: 
Release an incomplete collection, or take the commercial risk of a high-ticket 
two-CD set. 
</P>
<P>
 Even such commercial heavyweights as Bruce Springsteen and Guns N' Roses 
hedged their bets with double albums, each releasing two separate albums rather 
than one expensive two-pack. The "Gump" CD package lists at $24.95 and will be 
selling in most stores for more than $20 -- less than the standard double-CD 
but much more than single discs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This movie spans 30 years of American history and we couldn't figure out how 
to present a complete picture of the movie without putting out two CDs," says 
Brunman. 
</P>
<P>
 The set takes other commercial risks: Being all oldies -- from Elvis Presley's 
"Hound Dog" to Simon & Garfunkel's "Mrs. Robinson" to Bob Seger's "Against the 
Wind" -- it bucks the trend of getting current stars to record versions of 
songs to help sell the soundtrack album.  
</P>
<P>
 "It never made any sense for us to do that," says Zemeckis, explaining that 
the songs are meant to serve as "signposts" for the historical events and 
emotions of the story. "The whole film is a period piece. (A new recording) 
would have a tacked-on feeling. The hope is people will enjoy the movie and 
enjoy the record." 
</P>
<P>
 Two videos from "Forrest Gump" -- for the Doors' "Break on Through" and the 
Byrds' "Turn Turn Turn" -- are being offered to music channels. But will they 
air the oldies? 
</P>
<P>
 VH-1 President John Sykes, who has seen the movie and loves it, is 
noncommittal for the time being. "It really depends on how effectively they've 
put the music to film in the videos and how well it fits within our 
programming," he says. "VH-1 is a very current channel." 
</P>
<P>
 If the "Gump" soundtrack does well, it may signal a summer dominated by 
film-related music. Among the high-profile items lined up for release: the 
rock-fueled "Airheads" and "True Lies," the swing novelties of "The Mask" 
(featuring star Jim Carrey's recording debut), the "Sleepless in Seattle"-like 
romance of "It Could Happen to You" (with a duet by Tony Bennett and Shawn 
Colvin) and the classic-rock tunes of "Pulp Fiction." 
</P>
<P>

COVER STORY; WHAT JOHN WILLIAMS WANTS . . . HE GETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Williams (guest conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic on July 12 and 
Aug. 5-6): A frequent guest conductor at the Bowl, Williams is a close friend 
of Bowl Manager Anne Parsons, a relationship that developed when Parsons was 
working in Boston. She said that early last year, when the Philharmonic was 
locking in its performance dates at the Bowl, she went to Williams and "he 
picked one of them" -- Aug. 5-6. Things weren't as easy for Williams' 
last-minute commitment to conduct a World Cup concert July 12. Unfortunately, 
that was a date of choice not just for Williams but also for several other 
artists, including Van Cliburn and Garth Brooks. After much juggling, Williams 
won out and the date was fixed in March. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ute Lemper (July 20): Vocalist Ute Lemper has a long history of recording with 
John Mauceri, but they have never appeared together onstage. Her manager is a 
good friend of Parsons, so both have wanted her to perform at the Bowl for 
years. Although artists who live and work in Europe can be difficult to 
schedule, this time Lemper's manager was able to schedule several U.S. 
performances for her besides the Bowl, which persuaded her to make a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Brilliantly Brazilian" -- Milton Nascimento (Aug. 3): Nascimento and his 
12-member band were a late addition to an evening of Brazilian music. The 
musician's agent contacted Bowl officials several months ago, saying the band 
would be in the States this summer for a tour. The Bowl's jazz coordinators say 
they could not have afforded to bring Nascimento's band here from Brazil 
without help, but they took advantage of the already-slated tour. And, 
conveniently, one performer scheduled for "Brilliantly Brazilian" dropped out 
at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Nagano and the Halle Orchestra (appearing Aug. 6-10 in conjunction with 
the UK/LA Festival): For several years Nagano has had a standing invitation 
from Bowl officials to be a guest conductor, but scheduling was impossible. For 
this season, however, a European booking agent presented the Bowl with a list 
of available orchestras -- and on it was not only Nagano but his Halle 
Orchestra. (Sometimes, a conductor is available but not the entire orchestra). 
Because the Bowl was looking for a concert to coincide with the upcoming UK/LA 
Festival, the timing was ideal. Discussions began two years ago, and the 
orchestra was officially booked about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Moonlight and the Blues" -- Ray Charles, Etta James and the Roots Band (Aug. 
17): Charles and James have both appeared on the Bowl's jazz programs -- but 
never together. After getting the idea approved by Bowl officials, jazz 
coordinator Darlene Chan began talking with the artists' agents and presented 
them with available Bowl dates. Then, the Bowl checked exclusivity -- making 
sure the artists had no other major summer concerts planned for Los Angeles. 
This summer, booking Charles was more difficult than James because of his 
extensive European bookings (James is also currently on tour in Europe). By the 
first of the year, both artists were signed. "We had to make sure they could 
both do it on the same day," Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Mel, the Movies and More" -- Mel Torme (Aug. 26-27): As perhaps the most 
frequent guest of the Bowl, Torme has a sort of standing invitation. Bowl 
officials tend to rotate the multifaceted Torme between weekend concerts, the 
weekday jazz series and the Playboy Jazz Festival. Although Parsons said that 
someday Torme's busy touring schedule may clash with the Bowl's, so far it 
hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Raitt (Sept. 11): In 1992, Raitt performed at the Bowl with her father, 
John Raitt. Response was so enthusiastic that Bowl officials immediately asked 
her to pick a date when she wanted to return. She picked 1994, and was one of 
the season's earliest commitments.

RIORDAN'S FIRST YEAR AT THE HELM; L.A. MAYOR SEES GLORY, GAFFES AND GOALS STILL 
AHEAD

 One year ago, Richard J. Riordan, a multimillionaire attorney and businessman, 
took the helm at Los Angeles City Hall. His top priorities have been to shake 
up the government of the nation's second-largest city and put more police 
officers on the street. But the new mayor has struggled at times with the 
city's labyrinthine bureaucracy. He spent his freshman year learning the 
customs of the contentious City Council, laying the groundwork for his police 
expansion plan and balancing a debt-prone budget. There have been moments when 
he shined -- such as his quick and compassionate response to the Northridge 
earthquake. And there were stumbles as well. It took many months to get his 
staff in place and Riordan has had difficulties with the city's unions. Sitting 
in his wood-paneled office recently, the 64-year-old Riordan reflected on his 
first year in office with Times staff writers James Rainey and Marc Lacey.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you wish that former Mayor Tom Bradley had told you a year ago? And 
would you have done anything differently? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I wish that he had told me that his real name is Clark Kent. I would have 
realized that's how he got around to all these events when he was mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 I would have moved more quickly to hire and put on board outstanding young 
people to implement my plans. I can come up with ideas, but I need people to 
implement them. And it's taken me a good part of a year to really feel 
satisfied with the breadth of the staff I have. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you miss most about being a private citizen? Has your life changed 
dramatically? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There have been some very significant changes, 90% for the better. One 
thing about the job is that it takes tremendous discipline and a tremendous 
amount of organization and planning. If I want to ride a bicycle I've got to 
plan it a week or two ahead. I can't afford to ever be tired. So I've learned 
how to take catnaps. I can't afford to be late for a lot of reasons. One is 
that's just arrogant to people. It says I'm more important than they are. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you able to do things you like to do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You can't go out drinking beer with the guys for "Monday Night Football." 
Some guy from the L.A. Times may show up with a camera. (But) there are things 
I do all the time, like last weekend going biking out at the beach or going to 
a movie. And I really like to play chess. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm happier and healthier than I've ever been. And I think a lot of it is the 
discipline that the job puts on you. When you're mayor everybody expects a lot 
of you. You're the father image. . . . You're somebody that's expected every 
day to do things right. And to me that's probably the biggest challenge of 
anything and the one I feel the best about. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there anything you thought would be completed by now that isn't? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I can't think of anything that I wish I'd done that hasn't been done. 
Government doesn't work that efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were you prepared for the bureaucracy and working with 15 different council 
members? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think this is why a lot of people from the private sector fail, because 
they don't learn the patience to handle those kind of obstacles. It's another 
challenge that I enjoy. I'm sort of proud that I'm learning it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What have been the saddest moments for you as mayor? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Calling the families of police officers who have died, talking to firemen 
that were badly hurt. But I think the worst is really going into some of the 
inner-city neighborhoods and realizing that they've been cheated for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have an underclass that is poorly educated, doesn't have jobs, doesn't 
have hope, the first step has got to be at least to clean up the environment. 
Along with that is job training and education. 
</P>
<P>
 In (City Councilwoman) Rita Walters' district, we wanted to get rid of a block 
of buildings that had dope dealers, homeless and others in it. We wanted to 
tear 'em down, and it's something that should have been done in a month. It 
took a little over six months to get done. There is frustration that you can't 
simply do things quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When you see problems like that, do you think this is a job that will take 
more than four years? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, I think it'll take a lot more than four years. I mean a lot more than 
eight years. In my second term, we will change the (City) Charter back, so I 
can go for more than two terms. (Laughter). 
</P>
<P>
 If I take my job seriously, if I care, and if I think I can be of value, I 
would go for a second term. Put it another way, if I feel the way I do today, 
I'd probably go for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Could you imagine being Gov. Riordan someday? 
</P>
<P>
 A: My worst nightmare in the world is waking up in the morning, and realizing 
I'm governor of the state of California. I mean, this job is so much better 
than governor. If I get bored at least I can go out and work in a maintenance 
group and fill a pothole or something. (The governor) is just running the most 
convoluted bank there is. He's just a banker, putting strings on everything. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Immediately after the earthquake, you were very visible and active in 
directing the city's emergency response. Some observers said your experience as 
a business executive must have served well. Do you agree? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It was more like what I used to do. I felt very, very good doing it. But if 
there was anything that was exhilarating, it was to see how well the people in 
the city did their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you feel badly that during your campaign that you called city workers . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 A: Brain-dead? (Laughter) One thing I've learned, and I think the earthquake 
proved, it's the system more than the people that stifles. People in government 
are equally as good as the people in the private sector. It's just the 
bureaucratic system of having agendas and not being allowed to embarrass any 
elected official. That trickles down, so you don't want to embarrass the guy 
above you, who doesn't want to embarrass the guy above him. And you know, 
eventually people end up not doing anything. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has it been hard for you that some police, your big political supporters, 
accused you of letting them down during contract negotiations? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the rank-and-file police respected me all along. There's some 
posturing done on their part. But every place I've gone in the city, I've had 
respect from the police I've come across. Even the one night where they were 
organized to picket, I didn't feel any tremendous anger. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Didn't some of their tactics make you angry -- such as threatening to 
expose embarrassing information about you and council members? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah, it did. I publicly chastised them. I think putting up the billboards 
(depicting a carjacking) and other things done by the (union) leadership were 
counterproductive. And certainly that was not going to get me to move, in fact, 
if anything, the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 But my attitude is getting to the goal. We have to get the police contract 
behind us as quickly as possible and get the city moving and healing again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does this settlement with the police, which could amount to as much as 
a 12% raise, and the 9% raise for Department of Water and Power workers jibe 
with your campaign image as a tough negotiator who wouldn't knuckle under to 
unions? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think your question's inaccurate. The base raise (for police) is 7%. 
There's no long-term tremendous cost to the city. And that's great. We gave up 
a little bit in the front end (in bonuses) but not that much. We were way below 
the demands of the police, I mean by leaps and bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Shortly after you gave the DWP a raise, you called it a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 A: The thing is, you make a decision, you have to live by that decision and 
put everything in the future in the context of that decision. Probably my 
biggest mistake was calling that a mistake. (Laughter). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You proposed during your campaign adding 3,000 police officers to the LAPD 
over four years. After taking office you introduced a plan to add slightly 
fewer officers, 2,855, over five years. The Police Department has already 
fallen 130 officers short of that less ambitious goal. Aren't you falling short 
of your campaign pledge? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's still my goal. It will be a little bit tougher, but we will look for 
money from other places during the year to get there. And if I were a betting 
person I would bet that I'll reach the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When do you see the Los Angeles economy rebounding? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, I think we're getting better right now . . . but I think as far as 
significant increases you're not going to see it for a couple of years. And the 
reason is that with the (economic expansion) we're having now we're also going 
to get more hits on aerospace jobs. Things like that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Then why should people stay in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you could sit back in three or five years time and say: 'OK, my income 
is going to be 20% less and the value of my house is going to be 20% or 30% 
less, and I can adjust to that,' then I think the future will look good to you. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the problem is we got spoiled. I mean you had lawyers making a million 
bucks, $500,000 or what have you. God never ordained that. Automotive workers, 
aerospace workers were making 40 bucks an hour, in a sense being subsidized by 
people around the world to build things to kill people. Those were artificial 
(wages). . . . Say you know the real jobs now are going to be $12 to $15 an 
hour, the lawyer's going to make $100,000 to $150,000 a year and houses are 
going to be worth $500,000, rather than a million, and then I think the future 
looks very good. 
</P>
<P>
 When you look back 10 years from now, when you put it in that context, this 
city will have done well. Another reason the city will do well are the various 
ethnic groups and immigrants that have come to this country over the last 10 
years and are starting to come into their own. The African Americans, the 
Latinos, the Iranians, Asians. I think in 10 years you're going to look back 
and you're going to see a lot of the new growth has been in companies started 
by these ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: That doesn't sound like a great advertisement for Los Angeles: "Come to 
L.A. -- lower your expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 A: Compared to the rest of the country -- if you can convince everybody of 
what I said -- the whole rest of the country will move into L.A. because our 
future looks so much better than anyplace else in the country. I mean the 
Northeast has got virtually nothing going for it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you told New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani that? Maybe he should take a 
deputy mayor's post here? 
</P>
<P>
 A: He would be better off, I'll tell you. I mean, New York City has no middle 
class. You have the rich and the poor. And the fear I have here is the flight 
of the middle class. You look at South-Central, it has lost, what, probably 
two-thirds of its middle class over the last 15 years. This is not healthy and 
we're starting to see some flight of the middle class from the (San Fernando) 
Valley and that's not healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What industries are going to be creating jobs in Southern California? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, I think a lot of high-tech, computer jobs, medical devices. 
</P>
<P>
 All of a sudden we've awakened to the fact that because of changes in the 
economy, some public sector employees make more than the private sector. And 
that distorts things, with more people moving toward government jobs. At the 
same time, government jobs are the major way that minorities can get into the 
middle class right now, and this is important for society. You can't pull the 
rug out from people who have gotten there. It just isn't right or fair. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Isn't that one of the complaints about giving government jobs to the 
private sector -- that you might destabilize the middle class in some of the 
city's neediest neighborhoods? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's a very tricky thing. The one thing I've had to say over again, 
nobody's going to lose a job because you're privatizing it. By the same token, 
government has become very inefficient. As a result of competition, my 
prediction and my hope is that it will make the public boys, the city, do a 
much better job so we won't need the private sector. And I predict that's 
what'll happen.

SAN FERNANDO VALLEY HIT BY 2 AFTERSHOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pair of small aftershocks to the devastating Northridge earthquake rattled 
the San Fernando Valley Saturday, but no damage or injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A magnitude 2.7 aftershock struck at 5:54 p.m. and was centered two miles east 
of San Fernando. It was followed by a 3.2 temblor at 7:13 p.m., said Kathy 
Wyllis, seismic analyst at Caltech in Pasadena. The epicenter of the second 
aftershock was one mile west of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and Fire Department spokesmen said they received no calls about either 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The shakers were aftershocks to the magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake of 
Jan. 17, Wyllis said.

FOR PRIVATE CITIZEN BRADLEY, NO REGRETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Bradley still calls up City Hall when he sees potholes that need filling, 
he's still a regular on the dinner circuit and everybody still calls him 
"Mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 But some things do change after stepping down from an office held for 20 long 
years. One year after his retirement from public life, Bradley is a little 
slimmer, he has slowed down a bit and he enjoys his morning paper more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a joy to get up in the morning, walk out to the front yard, pick up the 
paper and say: 'I don't give a damn what's in it,' " Bradley said. "I had 
enough exposure in 20 years to last a lifetime. If my name was never printed 
again it wouldn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of his few interviews granted in the last year, the city's longtime 
chief executive says the transition from public official to private citizen has 
been smooth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just closed the door on what was a great 20-year period in my life," he 
said last week. "I really haven't looked back." 
</P>
<P>
 There was one slip -- something bound to happen after so long in the one job. 
</P>
<P>
 On his way to his private law office soon after stepping down, Bradley found 
himself driving toward the City Hall garage. "The car just went automatically." 
</P>
<P>
 The 76-year-old Bradley has not retired since turning over the mayor's office 
to Richard Riordan. He travels the globe and puts in long days as senior 
counsel at the Downtown firm of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm almost as busy in my new career as when I was mayor," he said. "The major 
difference is that I don't have the two to three dinners a week to attend -- 
and as a consequence I've lost 10 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley has purposely avoided passing judgment on his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the mayor has the right to set his own record and be judged by the 
people and the press without the former mayor looking over his shoulder and 
criticizing him," Bradley said. "I made the decision when I retired to stay out 
of it."  
</P>
<P>
 Staying out of it can be a pleasure at times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The morning of the earthquake I got out of bed, looked around and didn't spot 
much damage. Then I got back into bed and said: 'I don't have to go anywhere.' 
What a relief that it was someone else's problem now."

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; STREETWISE PSYCHOLOGIST HELPS THE POLICE COPE WITH THEIR 
JOB HORRORS, AND HE HAS LEARNED TO WORK OUT HIS OWN PROBLEMS; ARRESTING COP 
STRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The veteran cops were squirming in their seats even before their coffee got 
cold. To the group of mostly 20-year sergeants and lieutenants, the 
early-morning seminar on officer trauma sounded about as appealing as 
paperwork. Better to work out stress at a firing range or corner bar than with 
some touchy-feely shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 But the speaker didn't look like a psychologist, not with his drill-sergeant 
scowl and broad shoulders. And he didn't sound like one, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a cop," Larry Blum began, his New York accent barbed with attitude. 
"I never wanted to be a cop. I couldn't tell you about police tactics, either. 
But I am gonna tell you why you guys die out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the in-your-face world of Dr. Deadlift, cop shrink. Maybe it's 
because he grew up as a street kid in the bloody-nose Bronx, or because he 
practices triage psychology at crime scenes and emergency rooms, but Blum loves 
to get in that first punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Lt. Felix Osuna was in the audience that day. "I was sitting 
there thinking, 'This guy's a jerk.' About 30 cops were ready to get up and 
walk out, me included. But by the end of that day, I was a believer. Larry 
knows what he's talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum, who earned the Deadlift nickname because of his avid weightlifting, has 
believers in police stations across Southern California. They talk about his 
clinical successes, of course, but they speak just as much about his 
earnestness, his fierce loyalty and streetwise candor. Most of all, they know 
he carries the same burdens they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very protective of all of them," Blum, 49, says while holding one of 
the police caps that line the shelves of his Santa Ana office. The hats, and 
the scores of agency patches that surround them, were left as thank-you gifts 
by former clients. "I've stood over them in hospitals, I've stood over their 
bodies, and held up their widows and partners." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum looks up and smiles broadly. "I call all of them my babies." 
</P>
<P>
 His "babies" bring in a parade of horror stories. Officers with trembling 
hands and shot nerves tell the big man about the mayhem and murders, the lost 
partners and innocent bystanders, and all of the daily adrenalin rushes served 
with a side of stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum shows them how to cope with their anxieties and, at the same time, tries 
not to carry their weighty problems home with him. Often, that's not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started doing this work I was a very sensitive, emotional person 
filled with love of life," he says. "With the first five years of my practice, 
and all the call-outs for shooting and violence, I started losing my value of 
life. I became numb, hardened. Some of my close friends still accuse me of 
cynicism. But I have never lost my humanism. I still love good people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach resident's 12-year-old practice has a client list that has 
swelled to 15 agencies, most in Orange and Los Angeles counties. Speaking 
engagements and requests to appear as an expert witness in assorted trials vie 
for his time these days. He recently testified on behalf of Sgt. Stacey C. Koon 
in the Rodney King civil trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the other projects, he still spends most of his time doing what 
matters most to him: talking one-on-one with troubled officers. 
</P>
<P>
 He finds it easy to communicate with street cops, especially ones who patrol 
dangerous turf. A lot of that can be traced to his childhood, when he ran with 
the tough kids in a Jewish-Italian neighborhood in New York. His father was a 
salesman with a drinking problem that strained the household and led to his 
parents' divorce when Blum was 14, leaving the boy with little supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum says he still remembers the world view his father drummed into his head 
as a youngster: "Don't lie. Don't steal. Don't take crap from anybody. That's 
who I am. It probably helps me with the rank-and-file cops. They like the rough 
edges. But it's not something I picked up at a university." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did Blum forget that street education when he picked up his doctorate in 
psychology at the University of Michigan. Riverside psychologist Nancy Bohl, 
who also works exclusively with cops, says the two markedly different 
influences make Blum an attractive confidant to officers. "They trust him, they 
like him, and he can help them," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Any bridge helps. Although officers are far more open to counseling and 
discussing their feelings than they were a generation ago, Blum says, there are 
still codes of silence that come with the badge. Many prefer to swallow pain 
rather than show it. "It doesn't just gnaw at them, it rigidifies, it locks up 
inside them." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his former clients, for example, arrived at a domestic dispute to find 
an infant who had been shot point-blank in the head. The shooter, a boyfriend 
of the child's mother, had committed suicide after the heinous crime, and the 
officer walked away horrified by the sight and burned by his own helplessness. 
He told himself to shake it off and keep going. But it wasn't that easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time this guy looked at his own baby son in the crib at home, he got 
sick; he would vomit," Blum says. "He couldn't do away with that image. Until 
he talked about it and got OK with what he felt. Until he did that, he wasn't 
gonna be able to enjoy his own kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum says two in three officers will suffer some degree of post-traumatic 
stress symptoms in their career, and one in three will have a profound 
reaction. The symptoms can range from nightmares to gastric problems to 
freezing up in the field. The treatments include debriefing, counseling and 
sometimes biofeedback. 
</P>
<P>
 Cops who die in the field often have put themselves in a compromising 
position, Blum says. Distractions, anxieties and, in some cases, complacency 
cause them to overlook danger signs or leap into situations that they otherwise 
would avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, an officer in treatment can be counseled back to health in a matter 
of weeks, except in extreme trauma cases or when the emotional wounds have gone 
untreated for a long time, Blum says. "Every cop who is worth his or her salt 
carries baggage. I help them deal with it, manage it, so they can become or 
stay healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Blum forgot how to manage his own baggage. The burned-out 
cops, the late-night visits to hospitals and the Manila folders bulging with 
lurid crime-scene photos began to darken his after-hours life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I did the work was by saying to myself, 'OK, this is not my wife 
who's been stabbed 26 times with hands and feet bound. This is not my daughter 
lying here raped and murdered.' That's how I did it, but everything got too 
close." 
</P>
<P>
 As the horrors got closer, he pushed his wife and children further away, 
afraid they might be touched by it. As his father had done years before, he 
turned to the bottle for solace: "Vodka. I had no time for beer. And I never 
really learned the meaning of the word moderation. " 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Jim Harris has worked closely with Blum 
since 1986, and he saw the changes in his friend during those tough times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen so many cops walk away from the job as just hollow shells of who 
they had been because they've taken all the heartache and agony and held it 
inside," Harris says. "He finds ways to let them let it go. He's like this 
sponge soaking up their pain. Sometimes, though, you got to squeeze and let it 
back out." 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure built until Blum and his wife, Paula, separated briefly in the 
late 1980s. "It was the worst time in my life, no doubts about it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had met in New York as teens and had finally found success in 
California, but everything was being pulled down by the gory secrets he kept in 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of confidentiality, he would never tell us about what his cases were, 
nothing specific, only a global picture," Paula Blum says. "All this stuff was 
tearing his insides out, but he would keep it in. When he drank, all these 
terrible emotions would come out of him, just rotten things. We were all 
walking on eggshells." 
</P>
<P>
 The separation made Blum think hard about his options. "Either find a way to 
remain healthy in the way you do your work or lose your family, that's what it 
came down to," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step was to cut off the part of his practice that had him drafting 
suspect profiles and helping police with interviews of murderers and rapists. 
He decided he would counsel and evaluate only officers. "I only work with the 
good guys. That helped a lot."  
</P>
<P>
 He quit drinking, too. The couple celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary 
this year, and Paula, the director of senior services at the Long Beach Jewish 
Community Center, says the marriage is reaching a new level of success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although for a while I was trying to convince him to buy less weight 
equipment so we could buy a dining room set," she jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Blum turned to weightlifting to relieve the stress in his life 
and the pain in his back. A spinal injury had him facing the prospect of 
extensive and painful surgery, but instead he took a suggestion from one of his 
"babies," a Pomona cop who loved power-lifting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Deadlift was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the joy of my life," says Blum, who strengthens his back and eases his 
mind with the burn and sweat he finds among the clanging free weights. Earlier 
this year, he locked out with 600 pounds in the dead lift at the national 
police olympics. He laughs when it is suggested that maybe lifting great 
weights helps him carry the burdens his patients leave behind in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you this," he says. "I'm helpless to prevent cops from being 
harmed, and that is my biggest wound. I can control the weight in the gym. It's 
just me against the bar. And if I'm tough, tough enough, I can pull that 
weight." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum is now planning his retirement. His son, Noah, 23, and daughter, Nicole, 
20, are in college now ("They like me now that I can't tell them what to do"), 
and in five or six years he hopes to scale back his practice and just advise 
police departments on how to create in-house trauma-response teams. He has 
already helped to create such programs in Brea, Huntington Beach and South 
Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams are staffed by officers who quickly assemble and respond when a 
fellow officer experiences trauma in the field. With their training, they can 
reach out to their troubled peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great because the cop hears from another cop that, 'Hey, I've been where 
you are now. The things you are experiencing are nothing but normal reactions 
to a traumatic event,' " Blum says. 
</P>
<P>
 He blanches at the suggestion that he is a frustrated cop wanna-be, and adds 
that it's a job he could not handle. "I don't have the self-control. Take a guy 
that beats up a lady or a kid. I'd beat the hell out of him." 
</P>
<P>
 He also says the pressure cooker that his "babies" work in these days would be 
too much for him to handle. Southern California has become a high-scrutiny, 
low-tolerance place for police officers since the fallout from the Rodney King 
beating in March 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 When Blum testified as an expert witness on behalf of Koon, he explained to 
jurors that an officer's account of a traumatic event might be blurred or 
incomplete because of a tunnel vision of sorts that kicks in during times of 
duress. It's likely this tunnel vision accounted for some discrepancies between 
the videotape of the incident and the officers' firsthand reports, Blum 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum says that although he is not a "big fan" of Koon's, he was dismayed to 
see him decked out in jail fatigues. "There is something very, very wrong with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 And far more alarming, he says, is the message sent to law enforcement by the 
backlash against cops. He says probable-cause arrests and "bad-guy hunting" 
have been toned down by increasingly tentative officers who are afraid that 
aggressive law enforcement will land them in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made a grave error," he says. "We've told police, 'Don't get 
involved, because if you do, you can go to jail or lose your house.' As a 
society, we've betrayed the very people who would save us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to chart the impact of the King beating and trials on area police 
departments, Blum is organizing a research project with the help of officers on 
the front lines. He hopes the street-level cops will be able to provide data on 
changes in stress, morale, public perception and the way officers conduct 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 He only has to thumb through his patient files to find anecdotal evidence of 
the pressures coming to bear on today's patrol officers. Montebello Police Sgt. 
Tim Mahan was a wreck when he walked into Blum's office after a shooting three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahan had been directing traffic on Whittier Boulevard when he found himself 
staring down a stolen sedan with trio of carjackers. Mahan leaped from the 
car's path, but was sure he would feel a hot blast rip through his gut from the 
shotgun leveled out the passenger window. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-year veteran officer got off two rounds before he hit the ground, 
killing the 15-year-old holding the shotgun. "I couldn't believe I was alive," 
he remembers. He walked away with no visible wounds, but he was shaken more 
than he knew. 
</P>
<P>
 His anxieties were compounded by the criminal investigation and trial, and the 
civil case, that followed and the surreal sensation of being treated as a 
lawbreaker instead of a lawman. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw his name listed on a police report next to the word "homicide." In 
court he felt awkward sitting at the defendant's table after years of 
automatically taking a spot on the table to the right side of the courtroom, 
the prosecutor's side. His trial was in the afternoon in a courtroom that 
hosted one of the King trials during the morning, adding a circus feel to his 
own case. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahan was vindicated in both of his trials, but not before months of worrying 
that he might lose both his job and home. The memory of the shooting had left 
him with nightmares, and the emotional pressures he felt were manifesting 
themselves as physical ailments, making him miserable with bouts of stomach 
pain and diarrhea. Worse, other cops were beginning to whisper about his hand 
tremors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't trust Larry, or any shrink for that matter, so I walked into his 
office emotionally armed and fearful," Mahan says. "I was from the old school, 
too, where you don't say you're hurting; you play it off. I thought anything I 
said would cost me my job. But the healing began as soon as I began trusting 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum told Mahan that the stomach ailments were tied to the shotgun wound his 
mind had expected his body to suffer. The nightmares were because the carjacker 
was the same age as Mahan's son. Able to put a name to anxieties and recognize 
that they were normal reactions, not signs of weakness, Mahan was able to begin 
mending and eventually return to the force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry saved my career, no doubt about it," Mahan says. 
</P>
<P>
 To Dr. Deadlift, the man who bench-presses the dead weight that burdens his 
beloved clients, that makes it all worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good ones are the truest heroes and heroines you can imagine," Blum says. 
"They literally sacrifice their own lives to save strangers. Think about that. 
Who does that? Some of the sweetest, finest human beings I have ever met wear 
badges. I'd do anything for those cops."

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; A BIG MATH ATTACK; JAN DAVIDSON TURNED A LIFELONG PASSION 
FOR TEACHING INTO A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR SOFTWARE CORPORATION. BUT SHE HASN'T 
LET HER NEW LIFE AS A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSWOMAN DRAW HER AWAY FROM HER TRUE 
LOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twelve years ago, Jan Davidson was exactly where she wanted to be -- in a 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 She had known since age 13 -- when she began tutoring other children after 
school -- that she wanted to teach. 
</P>
<P>
 Her home life was on track as well. Davidson and her husband, Bob, were 
raising three preteen children in Palos Verdes. His career as a corporate 
executive was on a meteoric climb. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davidson had a vision that would forever alter their lives: Why not use a 
home computer to teach kids math?  
</P>
<P>
 It's not a radical notion today, but at the time only a handful of educational 
software programs were available, and almost none of them were widely used. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were dull and if a kid missed something they would make this horrible 
'beep,' " Davidson says with disdain. "Here you had this powerful tool for 
teaching and all you were giving a kid was negative feedback every time they 
hit the wrong key. And it was loud enough that everyone in the room knew that 
Johnny had made a boo-boo." 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson's computer experience was limited to an Apple II -- woefully 
primitive by today's standards -- purchased in the late 1970s. But she believed 
that if educational software could be as exciting as computer games, she might 
use it to good advantage in the classrooms where she ran an after-school 
tutoring service. 
</P>
<P>
 She sat down at her Apple with a friend who knew a bit about programming and 
created a game for grade-school students called "Math Blaster." 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you got an answer right, you'd shoot a man out of a cannon," 
Davidson explains. Kids loved Math Blaster. Their parents wanted to buy copies 
to run on home computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no 'beep.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson began selling the software through her tutoring service, and later 
via a catalogue distributed by Apple. 
</P>
<P>
 Her kids -- Elizabeth, now 23, Emilie, 20, and John, 18 -- were her first 
workers. When an order came in, they used her computer to copy the discs. Their 
mom used an unwieldy shrink-wrap machine ("I hated that thing," she says) to 
give the little packages a finished look. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson, 50, still sells "Math Blaster." But instead of asking her kids to do 
the work, she now has a team of employees -- about 500 in all. They work in a 
sleek, modern building -- with her name across the top -- in a Torrance 
industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Davidson & Associates racked up almost $60 million in sales. The 
original "Math Blaster" and its update have sold 1.6 million copies, making it 
the world's second most successful educational software title -- behind the 
"Carmen Sandiego" series. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice that I got rich," Davidson says. "But honestly, it wasn't my main 
objective. All I wanted to do was to teach kids." 
</P>
<P>
 If she is daunted by the events of the last 12 years, she hides it well. 
Dressed in a plain red jacket and simple gold necklace -- more parent-teacher 
night than corporate executive -- she speaks almost shyly about her financial 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Erin Yoshida comes into the office to set up a software demonstration. 
Davidson rushes over to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are wonderful!" the boss says. "I have not given you your hug yet." 
</P>
<P>
 She embraces a beaming Yoshida. It is not a David Viscot-style, touchy-feely 
'90s hug, but a sincere expression of appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshida, a 25-year-old who majored in fashion merchandising in college, 
coordinated the recent release of "Multimedia Workshop," a program that allows 
kids -- and adults, for that matter -- to create presentations incorporating 
photographs, drawings, text and even video. 
</P>
<P>
 "She got that program through testing and out the door," Davidson says with 
pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to have people here who are not savvy computer users to work on our 
manuals and programs," she adds, "because those of us who use them all the time 
might be jaded. Someone outside of the business would be more reflective of the 
average consumer." 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshida leaves the sparsely furnished office done in variations of gray and 
Davidson returns to the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to always think of education as something you did with kids," Davidson 
says. "Now I realize you learn all your life. I get a lot of satisfaction out 
of watching people grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I enjoy building the people as much as I do doing the products." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson grew up in Frankfort, Ind., a town that claims it gave birth to the 
hot dog. Her father distributed dairy products to grocery stores. Davidson, the 
oldest of three children, was a star student, but she did take time out for 
Indiana's overriding passion -- high school basketball games.  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I went to the games," she says, incredulous that anyone would even 
have to ask. "It's what you did in Indiana." 
</P>
<P>
 What kids didn't do is read heady tomes on educational theories. "Even then I 
was reading these books on pedagogy by John Dewey," she says. "I was always 
fascinated by education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I often get the question now, 'Would you have done something different if you 
were growing up today?' " noting that many women of her generation went into 
teaching. "And I really don't think I would have." 
</P>
<P>
 She attended Purdue University "because it was not far from home." Her first 
weekend there, she met Bob Davidson at a mixer. They married a week after she 
got her bachelor's degree in 1966. (She later earned a master's in 
communications and a doctorate in American literature, and taught at the 
community college level, while continuing to tutor.) 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 10 years, the couple moved three times -- and each of those 
times, she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got to California in 1976, I said to Bob, 'No more moves and no more 
babies.' " They settled into a home in Palos Verdes where they still live. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever they lived, Davidson tutored at home, a couple of students at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are working one on one, that's when you can actually see the moment 
the kid gets it," she says, clapping her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would work to get those moments." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Proposition 13, the 1979 tax-cutting measure that caused such a 
panic that some school administrators decided to end the school day at noon, 
Davidson founded Upward Bound. She headquartered her nonprofit tutoring service 
in a leased classroom at a Palos Verdes elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It mushroomed right away," Davidson says. "People didn't know what to do with 
their kids all afternoon, and they were afraid that they would slip behind in 
schoolwork." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep up with the demand, she hired teachers to oversee courses ranging from 
SAT preparatory seminars to remedial math. Upward Bound started out as a 
service for high school students, but as it grew in popularity, Davidson added 
classes for second-graders all the way up to adults. At its peak, during the 
1983-84 school year, about 3,000 students took at least one class at Upward 
Bound. 
</P>
<P>
 At about the time she launched Upward Bound, Davidson bought her Apple II, 
thinking it could be used to replace the numerous machines used in a speed 
reading course. On a computer, she figured, the same exercises could be 
customized to the individual students. 
</P>
<P>
 She needed a program for the course and that need begat "Speed Reader." Next 
came "Word Attack" for vocabulary, and then "Math Blaster." 
</P>
<P>
 When orders came in, the household would go into a disk duplication and 
shrink-wrap frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, while cleaning the room of her son, John, she came upon a business 
card he had made for himself about 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wrote in his little handwriting, 'John Davidson -- Best Disk Duplicator in 
the World.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson breaks into a big smile and shakes her head. "He really was a good 
disk duplicator. I took the card and put it in his baby book." 
</P>
<P>
 The day the first order for 100 programs arrived, she finally turned over 
production to a professional. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, a year after Apple picked up the programs, the company went out of 
the mail-order business. Davidson thought this would be a good time for her to 
get out of the software business. She decided to turn her venture over to a 
software publisher so she could get on with her tutoring and simply collect 
royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob was very successful in his career, he was working long hours and 
traveling a lot," she says. "I already had enough on my plate." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Davidson, who was executive vice president of the Parsons international 
engineering and construction firm in Pasadena, believed that his wife would be 
miserable with the fate of her programs in another's hands. But her mind was 
set, and the couple scheduled a meeting with a San Diego-based publisher. They 
were to meet at a Tiny Naylor's restaurant in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 The publisher never showed, and Bob took the opportunity to hammer home his 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I would never be happy turning over these programs to someone who 
didn't care or know as much about education as me," Jan recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 On the drive home, she finally acquiesced. 
</P>
<P>
 They later learned that the publisher had not stood them up. He had gone to a 
different Tiny Naylor's on the other side of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson waves to the receptionists at the front desk of Davidson & Associates 
and heads out the door. She walks at a fast clip, heading for an office four 
blocks away where the company has rented additional space. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing low heels, she takes shortcuts across lawns of other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always plan a little too much to do in the day," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has spread to three buildings and the home office is being 
remodeled to accommodate state-of-the-art multimedia studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson & Associates went public in 1993, after a series of buyout offers. 
One came just a couple years after Davidson started the company -- using $6,000 
from savings set aside for her children's college education ("You can imagine 
what it did to me to take out that money," she says). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they wanted to pay $2 million," she says. "Bob was really floored. It 
was beyond his expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 But Davidson would not entertain offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Bob I hadn't even gotten started yet." 
</P>
<P>
 As other companies realized that there was big money to be made in the 
educational software market, Davidson & Associates got a lot of big-name 
competition. CBS, for example, announced that it was jumping on the bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think CBS and others tended to look down and say, 'Who is this little 
schoolteacher out there making a couple of products?' " Bob Davidson says. 
"They should have never underestimated her." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest difference between the competition and Davidson, industry 
observers say, is her passion for education. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of companies back then that had the view that they were in 
the software business," says Phil Adam, co-founder of the computer game company 
Spectrum Holobyte. "Jan considered that she was in the education business, and 
that made all the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Ken Walsh, president of the Software Publishers Assn., puts it: "Jan 
didn't just know her customers, she was the customer." 
</P>
<P>
 After introducing more than 50 educational products, CBS pulled out of the 
business after just a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson & Associates is now producing new products at a faster clip than CBS 
did. But all products have to meet Jan Davidson's standards for what a student 
and/or teacher would truly like and need. It makes for long hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob and I kind of made a decision early on that what we would be willing to 
give up in our lives was an active social life," she says. "That wasn't so hard 
for me, because I get so much more satisfaction out of my work and my family 
than I do anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they contribute to several educational foundations, they are not on 
the charity party circuit. They seldom even go to the movies. "I spend so 
little time at home," Jan says, "I'm very jealous of that time. If I want to 
see a movie, we'll wait for it to be on video." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Davidson, 51, left Parsons in 1989 to join Davidson & Associates as its 
CEO. He looks after all the operations and financial aspects of the company, 
freeing Jan to oversee research and development of the products. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Davidson is currently on a cross-country bicycle trip with John -- a high 
school graduation present. But before he left, he said he didn't have to worry 
about being completely out of touch with the office.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have a cellular phone on my bike," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at the leased office space, Jan sits down to get a quick 
demonstration of a new software product, in progress, developed by an outside 
group for the Davidson label. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, wow!" she says, clearly impressed by the opening title screen of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's downhill from there. "I'm not sure about the design," she says to the 
project manager, a longtime Davidson employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the composition is very weak." 
</P>
<P>
 She quickly pulls other employees and even a visiting photographer over to the 
computer to get their opinions. Several times, she assures the project manager 
that her critical remarks might be premature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm overreacting to what they have done," Davidson says, but it's clear 
that everyone in the room is carefully weighing her reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to say I'm disappointed," she says, finally. "I'm sorry I could not be 
more positive." 
</P>
<P>
 On the way back to the office, Davidson walks quickly, but this time she is 
mostly quiet. "That one is scary," she says. The product is not coming along as 
she had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes outside contractors provide the company with a welcome dose of new 
creativity. Sometimes not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to go back to the office and check the contracts," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson may be known in the business as the schoolteacher who made good in 
the business world. "But no one," Bob Davidson notes, "should underestimate her 
business sense." 
</P>
<P>
 She has said in several recent speeches that technology, correctly applied, 
could help transform the embattled education system in this country. "As I 
visit schools throughout the country and talk with educators, I sense that our 
schools are preparing kids for a workplace that no longer exists," she said in 
the keynote address before the National Educational Computing Conference last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of our schools are still set up to teach kids how to work in an 
Industrial Age. But the world these kids are going to face is an Information 
Age." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, she fully expects that Davidson & Associates will be a leader, if 
not the leader in putting multimedia educational products in the schools and 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Davidson, the most satisfactory experiences in education are still one 
on one. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a place where you can make mistakes," she says, addressing a group of 
30 new employees in a motel conference room across the street from company 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although almost all these new hires are in their 20s or 30s, they are a varied 
lot, from dressed-for-success business-affairs types to T-shirt-wearing 
warehouse workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson works the room like a classroom, wandering among the attentive new 
employees as she talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a place where you should make lots of mistakes," she continues. "I 
used to have a sign in my schoolroom that said, 'If you don't make 10 mistakes 
a day, you aren't trying hard enough.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want you to be afraid to take a risk. Of course, we generally don't 
like it if you make the same mistake over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
 The employees laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the way you learn is by making mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that," she tells them. "I'm a teacher." Jan Davidson

INVISIBLE NO MORE, AND READILY HEARD; RANDALL ROBINSON CONTINUES TO BE A QUIET 
BUT STRONG FORCE FOR CHANGE 
</P>

 Randall Robinson just wanted to be noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1950s Richmond, Va., and Robinson was a 13-year-old delivery boy 
awaiting a signature for groceries he had delivered to a family in the white 
suburbs. He was standing in the shadow of an old prewar icebox listening to 
family members talk about the most embarrassing matters when he suddenly 
realized they didn't see him.  
</P>
<P>
 As much as he shuffled his feet and cleared his throat, no one paid any 
attention. It wasn't until years later when Robinson read Ralph Ellison's 
"Invisible Man" that he could put a name on the feeling, but that afternoon he 
understood, in the most gut-wrenching way, that he, too, was invisible. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Randall Robinson, 52, doesn't have to worry about people paying 
attention. He is the guiding light and co-founder of TransAfrica, an 
internationally recognized black lobbying organization. And when it comes to 
the most important issues in the international black community over the past 
decade -- South Africa and Haiti -- many believe he is one of the most 
influential leaders in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 They point to his recent hunger strike as a significant factor in forcing the 
Clinton Administration to change its Haiti policy -- "27 days into the hunger 
strike, Clinton blinked," wrote one national magazine. And to his 
anti-apartheid activism in the 1980s. Robinson's protests snowballed into a 
national movement that raised congressional consciousness and helped lead to 
the Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, which cut U.S. economic ties with South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after its passage, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), the prime Senate 
sponsor of the act, said: "When history is written of the struggle for a new 
South Africa, Randall Robinson's name will join those of Desmond Tutu, Nelson 
Mandela and the others who worked so hard to make the dream of freedom a 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, fellow Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry said: "It was Randall Robinson 
who first sounded the moral alarm on Haiti. And he had the moral authority to 
do so because of his work with the Free South Africa Movement in pushing the 
South African boycott bill through Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's quiet clout was never better demonstrated than in April and May.  
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton scored major points by 
excoriating President George Bush for his Haiti policy. "I am appalled by the 
decision of the Bush Administration to pick up fleeing Haitians on the high 
seas and forcibly return them to Haiti," Clinton said. But after the election, 
his Administration dragged its heels at changing that policy.  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson began a hunger strike April 12. By the end of the third week (he 
drank water and juice and lost 13 pounds) and as media reports about his health 
increased, the pressure on Clinton mounted. And while the White House publicly 
downplayed interest in Robinson, it was quietly sending emissaries to ask him 
what it would take to end his fast. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer was the same on the 20th day of the strike -- when Samuel Berger, 
Clinton's deputy national security adviser, came to call -- as it had been on 
the first. All Robinson wanted the President to do, he told Berger, was to keep 
his word. 
</P>
<P>
 Berger left the TransAfrica building in northwest Washington near Embassy Row 
making no commitment. Caught by reporters later, he had no comment, other than 
to express admiration for Robinson. Yet within a week -- during which there was 
a flurry of media attention as Robinson was briefly hospitalized for 
dehydration -- Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser was 
calling. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a quiet, lonely Saturday at strike headquarters in the TransAfrica 
basement. The only guests were Robinson's wife and young daughter, who was 
sitting in vigil at her father's bedside when the phone rang. Lake had two 
questions, Robinson recalls: What would Robinson do if the President announced 
the next day that he was changing his Haiti policy and that the refugees would 
no longer be immediately repatriated to Haiti but, rather, given a chance to 
prove their refugee status? 
</P>
<P>
 And second, would Robinson do the President the honor of accompanying Vice 
President Al Gore on Air Force One the next day, May 8, as it winged a 
delegation of American dignitaries to Johannesburg for the inauguration of 
Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa? 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's answer was simple -- he would wait to see what the President had to 
say and, given the shape he was in after a nearly monthlong hunger strike, 
thank you but no, he didn't think he'd be able to take the President up on his 
offer of free air fare to Johannesburg.  
</P>
<P>
 The next day, having seen the President's statement about offshore hearings 
for refugees seeking political asylum, Robinson announced that he was ending 
his fast.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Growing up the son of a history teacher and high school coach, Maxie (Iron 
Man) Robinson, Randall Robinson was instilled with a sense of pride and 
achievement at an early age. The whole family was: Robinson's older brother, 
Max Robinson, was the nation's first black network-TV anchor (he died of AIDS 
in 1988); one sister is an actress, the other is an elementary school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson won a scholarship to Norfolk State University. After three years of 
college, he was drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during his two-year stint in the Army that Robinson started to realize 
that African Americans should care about Africa after reading "A Kind of 
Homecoming," by E.R. Braithwaite, which told of a trip the author had taken to 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was only vicarious," Robinson says now, "but it was as though I had gone 
with him." 
</P>
<P>
 After his Army detour, Robinson returned to college and finished his degree in 
sociology in 1967. He earned a law degree from Harvard in 1970. He got the 
chance to go to Africa later that year on a Ford Foundation fellowship. There, 
on an island off the coast of Senegal, he stood in the preserved doorway of an 
ancient fortress from which thousands of Africans had been ushered on to a ship 
and sent to America. And it was then that the young boy who had once stood 
motionless, invisible in a white household in suburban Virginia, broke down and 
cried. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, Robinson and a number of supporters -- Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Arthur 
Ashe and Richard Hatcher among them -- started TransAfrica with a $5,000 
donation. The idea was simple: "As Greek Americans care about Greece," Robinson 
says, "and Jewish Americans care about Israel, (African Americans) should care 
about Africa. It's the fountainhead of our people, and our destinies are 
inextricably linked. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last analysis, African Americans will stand only as tall as Africa 
stands. And an Africa that takes its place on the world stage will be 
tremendously enabling to all African Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton wasn't the first President to feel the bite of Robinson's convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1980s, it was clear to Robinson and others that Ronald Reagan's 
policy of "engagement" with South Africa -- trading with that the country in 
the hope it would change -- was a failure. The defining moment for Robinson 
came in the fall of 1984 when the Botha government arrested virtually the 
entire (black) leadership of the South African trade union movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiting two like-minded individuals, Robinson called the South African 
ambassador and arranged an appointment on Nov. 21, 1984.  
</P>
<P>
 All went well for the first hour or so, until the ambassador was called out of 
the meeting. When he returned, Robinson recalls with a smile, "he was ashen 
faced. Of the three choices he had, we fervently hoped that in his 
apartheid-inflated bravado, he would make the right one" and have them 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests (including that of a U.S. congressman) made front-page headlines 
around the world the next day. Over the next year, anywhere from one to 120 
people were arrested at the South African Consulate every day -- more than 
5,000 total -- including such politicians and celebrities as then-Connecticut 
Sen. Lowell Weicker, Stevie Wonder, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Ashe. By the time 
the initial series of protests was over, Congress was on its way to passing the 
Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 (over Reagan's veto) and, with its last significant 
trading partner slipping away, the government in Pretoria was forced finally to 
confront the international legacy of its apartheid policy.  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson downplays his contributions. "I can't cause the President to change. 
Others have to do that. But to get them to do that, you have to get them a 
message. It must be kept simple, and it has to be repeated over and over and 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What Robinson is proudest of is TransAfrica, which he believes will be his 
legacy. He has seen it grow to a foundation with a $1.2-million annual budget 
and a $3-million capital campaign. Among its supporters are Sugar Ray Leonard, 
who contributed $250,000, and Bill Cosby, who has raised more than $500,000. 
Among other recent donors: sports-shoe manufacturer Reebok with $375,000 and 
Coca-Cola with $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always bridled at the notion that African Americans should only 
concern themselves with domestic issues," Robinson says. "Anywhere decisions 
about America and the world are being made, we have an obligation to 
participate." 
</P>
<P>
 And TransAfrica, he believes, has a special obligation. "American policy 
should reflect American ideals, and if those ideals are to be supportive of 
democracy and economic development, then we have not behaved that way over the 
past 30 years toward Africa and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somalias don't just happen," he says. "We had a lot to do with it. We sent 
the dictator of a peaceful, pastoral society that had survived 1,000 years $887 
million worth of arms -- everything he needed to destroy himself and his people 
-- just because we wanted access to an air base in the Gulf of Aden." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, former Rep. Williams H. Gray III, the special White House envoy 
for Haiti, told a House panel that Clinton is ready to consider unilateral 
military action if sanctions fail. He also said the United States is making 
progress in pulling together a multinational peacekeeping force for Haiti that 
would move in after the military regime falls -- peacefully or because of an 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always believed that if you've got a message that resonates, a simple 
message, a call for simple fairness, you've got a chance. And if you can craft 
strategies to deliver that message to the masses, it can work. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you can do that," he says later, "you have a chance . . . and it 
really doesn't matter if you are up against a President of the United States."

WORLD CUP USA '94; A TALL ORDER; MAJOR LEAGUE SOCCER, HOPING TO RIDE THE WAVE 
OF MOMENTUM FROM WORLD CUP '94 AND SET TO MAKE ITS DEBUT IN 1995, FACES THE 
DAUNTING CHALLENGE OF SURVIVING ON THE COMPETITIVE AMERICAN SPORTS LANDSCAPE

<P>
 Lee Stern can laugh about it now. He can find humor in a little enterprise he 
once undertook that had its ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I never was interested in money," Stern said. "Being in soccer 
prevented me from being one of the major owners of the Chicago Bulls." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern, a successful Chicago commodities broker, once was a major force in 
American soccer. He owned the Chicago Sting of the now-defunct North American 
Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned down a chance to be involved with the Bulls because by the time the 
offer was made "the Sting was losing more money than I could think about," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern, who also once was an investor in the Chicago White Sox, lost millions 
trying to sell soccer to America. 
</P>
<P>
 So did Texas oilman Lamar Hunt, who once owned the NASL's Dallas Tornado. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone in the United States has reason to be bitter by the mere mention of 
the word soccer, it is these gentlemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, last week there was little doubt who was running a soccer fever in 
Chicago and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 They, like so many other Americans, have been swept up in a euphoric wave of 
excitement over World Cup '94. Hunt had seen 10 matches by the third weekend 
and was leaving town to see more. 
</P>
<P>
 But before anyone declares America a bona fide soccer-crazy nation, there is 
much to be done. The architects of the World Cup organizing committee face a 
heady task, the development of a professional soccer league that becomes part 
of Americana. 
</P>
<P>
 That, after all, is the ultimate aim of this monthlong extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like soccer comes into America today as a virgin sport, untouched 
and untried," said Kyle Rote Jr., one of the biggest names in U.S. soccer 20 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Lee Sterns, Lamar Hunts and a host of other successful sports owners 
could not make it work, how will it be different this time? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the party will be over in a couple weeks and soccer will be where it 
was," said David Burns of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a Chicago-based 
company that promotes athletes for commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Leigh Steinberg, a sports agent from Newport Beach who represents a 
number of U.S. national team players, is not sure the sport will gain a 
foothold in America. And if it does not, then the legacy of the World Cup will 
be nothing more than fond memories. 
</P>
<P>
 After the United States upset Colombia in the first round of Group A, the 
sport's future looked promising. The next day, calls came pouring in, Steinberg 
said. But when the team lost a few days later to Romania, "It hit with a dull 
thud." 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the fickle nature of the American public. Obscure Olympic athletes 
such as speedskater Dan Jansen or skier Tommy Moe were darlings during the 
Winter Olympics last February, but where are they now? 
</P>
<P>
 Put simply, Steinberg believes soccer's future rests on the outcome of 
Monday's Brazil-United States match at Stanford Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't be different (this time) unless there is a spectacular upset victory 
against Brazil on July 4," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a trendy country. We tend to focus on things that are hot. All of a 
sudden soccer is hot." 
</P>
<P>
 But a bad show Monday with millions of viewers expected to be watching could 
cool America's interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the soccer community is unswayed. Now that the World Cup has captured 
the imagination of a nation, those who have toiled in the soccer trenches for 
much of their lives believe their sport and time has come. 
</P>
<P>
 It might take five years to find out if they are right. Major League Soccer, 
which is scheduled to open in 12 cities in April of 1995, is hoping to lay a 
foundation to sustain the sport. The World Cup was the jump start, and today, 
optimism is oozing from the Century City offices it shares with the World Cup 
'94 organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Rothenberg, head of World Cup USA '94, the U.S. Soccer Federation and 
MLS, is part of the reason many believe the new league has a better chance of 
succeeding than past efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alan came up with this brilliant scheme that might be the only scheme that 
could work," said Rote Jr., a Memphis sports agent. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the World Cup started June 17, the proposed league had so many 
question marks some were skeptical. For instance, the day before the Cup opener 
in Chicago, Rothenberg introduced seven cities as charter members of MLS 
instead of the expected 12. Rothenberg said this week five more cities will be 
named by Aug. 1, although others say it probably will happen sometime in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, sponsors and financing, the backbone of the single-entity league, 
which will have an operating plan similar to the franchise system used by 
McDonald's restaurants, have not been announced. 
</P>
<P>
 But as much as the World Cup has piqued interest, it has brought potential 
investors to the table, MLS insiders say. 
</P>
<P>
 Harley Frankel, senior vice president of MLS, worked as an NBA executive for 
eight years. Before that, he worked in the Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is a challenge that I think can succeed," he said. "What a lot of 
people miss is this is not an attempt to have instant success like the NBA or 
baseball is enjoying." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel said the league's blueprint to build slowly is solid, but the 
unexpected success of the World Cup has solidified its position. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has given potential investors more confidence," he said. "It has given 
television more confidence that it will succeed. The World Cup has given us 
more muscle." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Roy Wegerle of the U.S. national team said: "If this doesn't kick it in, 
nothing will." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, like most new endeavors, MLS faces many obstacles. There is a gulf of 
difference between interest and investment. No doubt the league has gained the 
attention of sponsors, but until the money is raised the going will be 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 The league hired a Wall Street investment banker to help raise funds, either a 
sign of strength or weakness. And those who invest must overcome the fears of 
MLS' own five-year projections. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a staff memo, the league expects to lose $63.6 million from 1993 
to 1997, including almost $30 million in its first season. The losses are based 
on an average attendance of 12,500 per match. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the Clippers, in their 10th season in Los Angeles, averaged 
11,489 in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest challenge facing U.S. soccer is bringing its community 
together with a common purpose. Although that is Rothenberg's aim, his 
stranglehold on the sport has caused ill will. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Davis, coach and general manager of the Los Angeles Salsa of the American 
Professional Soccer League, has fired a loud salvo. His league is being told it 
will serve as a second division, or minor league, to the MLS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why has the MLS been given preferred status when the APSL has been going for 
four years now?" asked Davis, a former member of the NASL's Cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't forget yet another league already in place: Jim Paglia's League 1 
America. All three want to have the prestigious first division status, but MLS 
has clout. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, it has Rothenberg, who has gained immeasurable respect from FIFA, 
soccer's world governing body, because of the success of World Cup '94. 
Rothenberg said FIFA President Joao Halvelange told him last week America's Cup 
has been the best in the sport's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Few would question the work of World Cup organizers. But when it comes to the 
MLS and the sport's future, Davis thinks an opportunity has been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am disappointed and frustrated that the MLS isn't going to play a game for 
nearly a year after the World Cup," Davis said. "The league should have been 
ready to capitalize on new spectator interest here as soon as the World Cup 
ended. They knew in 1988 that the World Cup was coming here, so they had six 
years to organize and get the pro league going." 
</P>
<P>
 Said John Harkes, a star on the U.S. national team: "If people who are up 
there in top places are doing it for the game and not for making a buck, it 
will succeed. If they're doing it to make a quick buck, it'll be out of there 
in a heartbeat. That's the way it's always been for soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 If MLS sticks to its modest goals in the beginning, it has a chance to gain 
acceptance. Hunt, 62, said he would love to join the fun, but is too old to 
start up another adventure. But being around football much of his life, he 
notes that sports goes through in cycles in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing stays the same," he said, adding that soccer just might catch on this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 To do so, it must compete with a broad menu of sports options, from baseball 
to football to basketball to hockey to college sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a culture where one sports dominates," Rote said. "You can't go 
from no passion and no knowledge in one step." 
</P>
<P>
 But the World Cup has at least changed perceptions. The international flavor 
of the matches in the nine host cities has been a wonderful experience for 
Americans who have participated. Without the electrifying scene of World Cup 
competition, soccer could lose its dynamics, said Burns, the Chicago agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Atmosphere isn't a bunch of little kids running around in shorts for momma 
and papa to watch them," he said. "That's the mistake soccer is making." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern believes soccer has made it here all along because of the number of 
youths playing -- as many as 16.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sport is here to stay," he said. "It's just too much fun for kids to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Does that translate into a successful pro league? 
</P>
<P>
 It has not in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the World Cup, it might in the future.

 Suddenly, the capital of Romania is Los Angeles. Romania 3, Colombia 1, at the 
Rose Bowl; Romania 1, United States 0, at the Rose Bowl. Now it's 
Romania-Argentina at the Rose Bowl today -- and with a victory, it's on to the 
quarterfinals at Stanford, and a victory there and Romania will be back in 
Pasadena for the semifinals and World Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 This is our team. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrescu. Popescu. Lupescu. Munteanu. Dumitrescu. Hagi. Belodedici. (Hey, it's 
got to be Vanna White's favorite team.) 
</P>
<P>
 So I figured somewhere in this Carpathian-crazed town, there were Romanian 
discos, Romanian bookstores, Romanian clothiers, Romanian boutiques, Romanian 
florists. 
</P>
<P>
 I figured wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Bucharest, this ain't. 
</P>
<P>
 About 24 million people live in Romania, and most of them have decided not to 
relocate to Los Angeles. Who can blame them? Only 2% of Romanians own an 
automobile, only 15% own a TV set. (Corresponding rates for L.A.: 106% and 
117%.) If you move here, you can't even get out of LAX without a car and you 
can't even find work without a TV script. 
</P>
<P>
 There are just 20,000 residents of Romanian descent in the Southland, with the 
greatest concentration in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 I went looking for them. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a Romanian Orthodox Church in Glendale, but they wouldn't convert me 
by game time. 
</P>
<P>
 There is world-famous Hollywood Boulevard, which is sort of Transylvania East. 
(Believe you me, ladies and gentlemen, if you stand on the corner of Hollywood 
and Highland long enough, you're bound to see folks dressed like Dracula.) 
</P>
<P>
 There is Greco's New York Pizzeria, a chain of L.A. pizzerias owned by the 
cousin of Romanian midfielder Gheorghe Hagi. I went to one of the two Greco's 
on Hollywood Boulevard and asked for Haji's cousin. The pizza man responded, 
"Haji who?" (For this I put a quarter in the meter?) 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, there is Mignon's Romanian restaurant on Vine in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 I went there Wednesday night for dinner, but was turned away -- Mignon's had 
just hosted the Romanian soccer team and 100 of its supporters, who came by for 
a homesick meal before going off to Universal Studios. (Tcch. Tourists. Like 
the "Back to the Future" ride is any better than going down the Danube in a 
raft.) There would be no silverware -- or service -- for at least an hour, so I 
was advised to come back later. 
</P>
<P>
 I returned Thursday for lunch and talked with co-owner Daniel Popescu, 33. 
Popescu's family had fled Communism in Romania in 1976 and asked for political 
asylum here. His family opened the restaurant in 1984, and Popescu and partner 
Mihai Istrate bought it from Popescu's aunt in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I ordered, I asked Popescu to characterize Romanian food. "We use a lot 
of garlic, some paprika," he said. "It's mostly beef, pork and chicken. It is a 
mixture of all the many people who have occupied Romania over the years -- 
there are Arabic influences, Hungarian influences, Austrian and German 
influences." 
</P>
<P>
 I then briefly considered the ciorba de burta (beef tripe soup) or the 
cashcaval pane (breaded cheese) or the mamaliguta cu brinza si smintina (hot 
corn meal with sour cream and feta cheese), but I settled for the mititei 
(skinless sausage) and french fries (french fries). Along with the matzo ball 
soup that came before the dish, it was a delicious bargain at $5.25. 
</P>
<P>
 I passed on dessert but asked the waitress about coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have regular and decaf -- and Romanian coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 "Romanian coffee?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Turkish coffee," she said. "It's kind of strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, and Machiavelli was kind of Machiavellian. I took one sip of this coffee 
and jolted back to childbirth -- it cleared my sinuses, cleared up my skin and 
wiped out five years of a bad marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving Mignon's, I was determined to find other Romanian delicacies to 
perhaps create my own Romanian feast at home. But Popescu had told me that 
would be difficult, that several Romanian restaurants and markets had closed in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 First I ventured to Chalet Gourmet on Sunset Boulevard. It had food items from 
more than 20 countries -- among them Greece, Portugal, Hungary, Jamaica, 
Morocco, even Texas ("fajitas marinade") -- but nothing from Romania. Chalet 
Gourmet did carry one Romanian wine: Premiat Pinot Noir, a soft and velvety red 
wine from the Dealul Mare region ("Chill Before Serving"). I grabbed it at 
$4.99. 
</P>
<P>
 I then made my way to Bucharest Grocery on Hollywood Boulevard, co-owned by 
Turkish emigres Diran Mutafyan and Kevoric Gulbenkian. They had bought the 
market from its original Romanian owner 20 years ago, and though they stocked 
smoked fish and homemade eggplant and Bulgarian and Hungarian cheeses, they, 
too, carried no food items from Romania. In fact, it was a bit disappointing to 
see Pringles and Nestle's Quik on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 (Incidentally, I asked Mutafyan, 67, if he had been watching the World Cup. He 
answered matter-of-factly, "Of course," and looked at me in a way as if to 
indicate that was the single stupidest question he had ever been asked. You 
know, I guess it was.) 
</P>
<P>
 This left me on a beeline for Bargain Circus on La Brea, a virtual culinary 
junkyard featuring canned, bottled and packaged items from the world over, 
including parts of which that haven't even been discovered. If it ain't in the 
Circus, it ain't circulating. And again, there were not any products from 
Romania. So I settled for Riga-smoked sprats from Latvia (69 cents), sea salt 
from Sicily ($1.49) and pineapple chunks from Thailand (69 cents) and figured 
I'd improvise. 
</P>
<P>
 I went home to improvise. 
</P>
<P>
 First I called 411 and asked for Nadia Comaneci -- I figured it would be nice 
to have a Romanian date for the evening -- but, naturally, she had an unlisted 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I closed my eyes and tried to visualize all the wonderful things I had 
seen on the Mignon menu -- Romanian stuffed cabbage, veal stew, herring salad, 
white caviar -- to inspire me. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I realized, "I have absolutely no idea of what I'm doing." My cooking 
expertise is limited to a microwave and Season-All. How was I going to create a 
gourmet Romanian meal? 
</P>
<P>
 I settled for a grilled cheese sandwich and the Premiat. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good thing I had chilled the wine.

WORLD CUP USA '94; THIS CUP BRIMMING WITH TEARS; SOCCER: TRAGEDY PLAYS A ROLE 
IN A TOURNAMENT THAT HAS OTHERWISE BEEN ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A player shot dead. A superstar caught for drugs. Violent death in the midst 
of victory dances. Fans flying to a game killed in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup is brimming with tears. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first U.S. appearance, soccer's world championship has been a 
spectacular success, with exciting matches, filled stadiums and a pulsating 
energy that has stayed under control at the nine sites. 
</P>
<P>
 But the world's most popular sport has a dark side, too, dramatically exposed 
by 12 gunshots in a parking lot in the cocaine capital of Medellin, Colombia, 
early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing of Andres Escobar, who scored an own-goal in the 2-1 loss to the 
United States that eliminated Colombia from the tournament, was a reminder of 
the passion and attention soccer generates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The popularity of our game has two faces," said Sepp Blatter, general 
secretary of soccer's governing body, FIFA. "The first face produces joy and 
enthusiasm and brings people together, as we have witnessed at the World Cup 
here. And on the other face, the game mirrors our life. It has violence, tears, 
corruption. Like life, it has all its problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Blatter, who has been involved with the sport for decades, called Saturday 
"the saddest day I have ever witnessed in football, in the World Cup or any 
other competition." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time in three days that soccer and its fanatically followed 
championship suffered a shock off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Diego Maradona, the captivating but troubled star of Argentina, 
tested positive for using five banned stimulants and was kicked out of the 
World Cup. Maradona was suspended for 15 months in 1991-92 for cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like somebody does not like the success of the World Cup," Blatter said. 
"I don't know who to blame. But the two cases we have had in 48 hours -- it's 
hard to digest for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament itself has been blissful. Capacity crowds have enthusiastically 
but peacefully cheered games that have seen more scoring, the emergence of new 
stars and a surprisingly strong showing for the home team, with a second-round 
berth for the United States for the first time since 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA has cracked down on on-field thuggery, handing out stiff suspensions for 
players who go at each other too violently. That has sidelined some key 
players, such as America's John Harkes, at important times, but it also has 
opened up the game. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been none of the hooliganism that sometimes springs up around 
European club matches and had American organizers on the alert. 
</P>
<P>
 But death has haunted this World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, 12 fans flying to Washington for Mexico's opener against Norway 
were killed when their private plane crashed. Highway crashes have killed at 
least two other soccer travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colombian team received a death threat against midfielder Gabriel Gomez 
before its game with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, riots broke out in Mexico City as fans celebrated their team's 
advancement to the second round. Three people were killed, including one who, 
witnesses said, was beaten unconscious and then blown apart by a firecracker 
placed next to his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Those deaths, as tragic as they were, were different than the killing of 
Escobar, a quiet man and smooth player who, for the second time in a week, 
found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something happens by accident, you can say it was the will of God," 
Blatter said. "But when people deliberately shoot and kill somebody because he 
made a mistake in the game, something is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can promote the sprit of fair play. We promote comfort in the stadiums. We 
control the game and approve sanctions against corruption and cheating, like 
the Maradona case. But we are helpless, sad -- what can you say in such a 
situation?" 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more than any other sport, soccer has had to deal with tragedy. 
Blatter said it would handle this one, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football is strong enough to go on," he said. "The globe is the ball, and it 
keeps turning."

JET CRASHES IN STORM, KILLING AT LEAST 16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A USAir jet crashed on its second approach to the Charlotte-Douglas 
International Airport during a thunderstorm Saturday, shearing off the top of 
telephone poles and killing at least 16 of the 55 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 One man was seen running from the plane yelling: "Help me, help me! I'm on 
fire!" People were being treated at the scene by emergency medical crews; at 
least 26 were taken to area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight 1016, a DC-9, had taken off from Columbia, S.C., said Kathleen Bergen, 
manager of public affairs for the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe there are survivors," Bergen said. She said the agency was not 
aware of any problems before the plane went down about 6:40 p.m. EDT. There 
were 50 passengers and five crew members aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport Director Jerry Orr confirmed that at least 16 people were killed. He 
said the plane hit a number of telephone poles and crashed near a house. 
</P>
<P>
 WBTV-TV in Charlotte reported that some passengers may be trapped in the 
crumbled tail section of the plane. Part of the fuselage was laying on top of 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolina's Medical Center told the TV station that its trauma center has 
admitted a dozen passengers, most suffering burns. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot had aborted his initial landing and was about to pull up and make 
another approach when he apparently struck telephone poles, Orr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Robinson, a minister who lives near the airport, said he was sitting 
in his car watching planes take off and land when he saw the jet crash about 
200 yards away during a bad lightning storm. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw a man with his clothes on fire running from the plane yelling, "Help 
me, help me! I'm on fire!" 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said visibility was very poor because of heavy rain and he could not 
see the control tower. 
</P>
<P>
 The last major accident at the airport occurred in 1974 when an Eastern 
Airlines jet crashed, killing 60 people.

PARALYZED, LINKED TO RESPIRATOR, CRASH VICTIM REACHES OUT TO LIFE; HEALTH CARE: 
KIM PATEK, NOW 22, SERVES AS AN INSPIRATION TO THOSE AROUND HER AS SHE BATTLES 
BOREDOM AND THE 'PAIN ON THE INSIDE OF ME.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Like the highway she was driving that warm July night, life stretched ahead 
for 20-year-old Kim Patek, a petite and pretty blonde with a new job and a new 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 But when her car ran off Interstate 29 and overturned, hurling her onto the 
hard pavement, that life changed. A split second turned the carefree young 
woman into a respirator-dependent quadriplegic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I wish I'd have died, not to go through all this pain and 
suffering," she said. "But now, I'm glad I've had this time. I'm with God. I 
know now I'm going to heaven. So I'm thankful for this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two years have passed since a phone call sent Jerri Patek and her 
husband, Fred, a former shortstop for the Kansas City Royals, to Heartland East 
Hospital in St. Joseph, where their daughter lay in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 A Missouri State Highway Patrol report said that at 3 a.m. on July 21, 1992, 
Kim lost control of her Ford Probe on the interstate in northwest Missouri's 
Buchanan County. The car hit a guardrail, ran off the road and overturned five 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's automatic shoulder harness snapped; she hadn't worn a lap belt that 
might have saved her from serious injury. The Highway Patrol report listed 
inattention and drinking as contributing factors to the crash. Kim has no 
memory of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pateks said doctors at Heartland East told them their daughter had 
suffered a serious spinal injury. Paralyzed from the neck down and unable to 
breathe on her own, she might not live through the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim spent months in hospitals, transferring to the Institute for 
Rehabilitation and Research in Houston in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pateks faced huge medical bills because Kim had no health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Patek -- who came to the big leagues with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1968, 
joined the Royals in 1971 and moved to the California Angels from 1980-81 -- 
had ended his playing career a few years before player salaries soared. He went 
public with Kim's story, talking about her injuries and the need to raise money 
to send her to a rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Royals played charity ballgames for Kim, and people donated more than 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Houston, the family hoped, where Kim would be weaned from her 
respirator. But their hopes were dashed by Dr. R. Edward Carter, director of 
the spinal cord injury program. He walked into Kim's room one day with the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor came in . . . and he just said, 'Kim, there's no hope.' He said 
I'd never breathe again." 
</P>
<P>
 Her reaction? 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you do but cry?" 
</P>
<P>
 When the tears stopped, Kim knew what she wanted. The next month, she went 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Home is a spacious brick house on a quiet lane on the edge of Blue Springs, a 
Kansas City suburb. The lower story of the Patek home is now the center of 
Kim's world. 
</P>
<P>
 A hospital bed and recliner dominate the main room. A cot where Jerri Patek 
sleeps next to Kim each night sits in the back of the room. Beside the hospital 
bed is the respirator, hissing and clinking quietly every few seconds. A 
mechanical lift to help turn Kim, keeping her lungs clear, is pushed aside. 
</P>
<P>
 A photo shows Kim and her sister, Heather, as toddlers, standing near their 
mother -- a trio of blondes. A portrait of Fred Patek in his Royals uniform is 
on one wall. Perched high on a shelf is a studio photograph of Kim taken a few 
months before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what she used to look like," Jerri Patek said matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kim was always the type whose appearance was very important to her," Jerri 
Patek said. "She was always so careful about her looks, her room was always 
just so, her hair was just so." 
</P>
<P>
 That, said Kim, now 22, is why she allows few friends to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want them to see the way I look," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother and grandmother curl the bangs of her long hair, polish her 
fingernails and apply her makeup. She wears stylish stirrup pants and oversize 
shirts decorated with bangles and beads. But the difference between the slim, 
tanned Kim before the accident and the heavier, paler Kim now is startling. 
</P>
<P>
 She leaves home three times a week for services at Hickman Mills Church of 
Christ but otherwise ventures out only to the doctor and an occasional shopping 
trip. Tubes, respirators, oxygen tanks, batteries -- all of the paraphernalia 
to keep Kim alive -- must be packed in a specially equipped van for outings. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes time for Kim to speak freely in front of visitors because "it takes 
me too long," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim must wait for the respirator to give her a breath before she speaks, and 
then the breath often ends before her sentence, words trailing away. 
</P>
<P>
 She glances up to her mother, giving silent permission for her to finish. 
Jerri Patek always hesitates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wait to let her finish because I don't want Kim to think she's not 
important enough for people to listen to her," she said, eyes brimming. "They 
can wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's injuries have had little impact on her personality, Heather said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's wonderful. . . . She's very pleasant, she's always been that way," 
Heather said. 
</P>
<P>
 What is gone is her independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months before the accident, Kim had moved into her first apartment and had 
just started working in an office in downtown Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's gone from having it all and always being on the go to always having to 
depend on someone else," said Wendee Brown, Kim's best friend, a student at 
Creighton University in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 And she has seen Kim begin to withdraw, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Steven Gialde, the Oak Grove physician who oversees Kim's routine care, 
said she suffered a partial severing near the top of the spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
 Her prognosis is uncertain. Carter, the Houston physician, said some people 
with Kim's level of injury live for years; others die quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The family knows that, barring a miracle, Kim won't recover. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a medical, scientific standpoint, you have to look at reality that it 
probably is never going to happen, but from a standpoint of looking from God, I 
never give up that hope," Fred Patek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father is gone much of the year as a coach for the Milwaukee Brewers' farm 
team in Stockton, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 He flew home in late May, when Kim's blood pressure dropped dangerously low. 
When he arrived, his concern for his family nearly kept him from returning to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to be home to help pick up some of the slack, but . . . they keep 
telling you to go back to work, so I have a lot of guilt feelings about that," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unhappy with private nurses, Jerri Patek and her mother, Delma Freeze, do all 
of Kim's care. Freeze moved in with the Pateks in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's routine care occupies several hours a day. But Jerri Patek spends much 
of the day watching television by Kim's side. 
</P>
<P>
 Only her eyes betray Jerri Patek's exhaustion. They close occasionally, almost 
against her will. She survives on three or four hours of sleep a day, snatched 
in fragments as Kim naps. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, Kim fights boredom and the pain that medication only partially 
relieves. She cannot feel a touch on her arm or leg, but "I can feel pain on 
the inside of me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Kim's life has narrowed, Heather's stretches ahead of her. She was 
married June 18 to Gary Rehkow. Kim was her maid of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kim always wanted to get married and have a family, and she used to baby-sit 
a lot and she loves kids," Fred Patek said. "Those are things that hurt when I 
think of them as a dad. I'll never get a chance to walk her down the aisle, and 
I'll never get a chance to hold my grandkids from her."  
</P>
<P>
 Working two jobs and planning a wedding left Heather little time to spend with 
her sister, who is only 10 months younger than Heather. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Kim relies on Heather for tales of the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is so interested in how your day went, what the weather is, how your 
drive was," she said. "Anything you tell her about, she's interested in . . . 
because she can't be out there." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Kim deals with her fate gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten used to it," she said. "I couldn't do this if I didn't have God 
with me. He helps me. I don't blame anyone for it. I have no one to blame. It 
was just an accident." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kim Patek Trust fund is established at Boatmen's Bank, P.O. Box 419038, 
Kansas City, Mo. 64183.

LAND OF IMMIGRANTS MAY SHUT OPEN DOOR; JULY 4: PRIDEFUL INDEPENDENCE DAY 
ORATORY ASIDE, IMMIGRATION ISSUE DIVIDES COUNTRY AS FALL ELECTIONS APPROACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Declaration of Independence, in its inventory of reasons for overthrowing 
a tyrannical government, lists one grievance that seems today almost quaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The king, wrote Thomas Jefferson, "has endeavored to prevent the population of 
these states, obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners and 
refusing to . . . encourage their migrations hither." 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration policy, especially as the fall elections approach, has become as 
prickly an issue now as then. But the attitude of many Americans has shifted 
into reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreigners today are migrating hither at a pace not seen since the beginning 
of this century, about a million a year. One recent poll found that 49% of 
Americans want to slow down that pace and 27% want to stop the flow altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a breather," said Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.). Eight years ago, 
Simpson wrote the law that extended amnesty from deportation to more than 3 
million illegal immigrants. Now he wants a five-year cutback on all 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 If America won't slam the Golden Door, other lawmakers demand that it at least 
close the Tortilla Curtain, a sneering epithet for the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, only about three in 
10 newcomers are "undocumented aliens," a category unknown in Jefferson's day. 
Even so, immigration experts say they are the main source of a rising national 
hostility toward all immigrants, legal and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican border is their path of least resistance, the route of about half 
the 3.85 million illegals the INS says are in the country. To many immigration 
critics, the 1,950-mile border is less a flimsy curtain than a tainted spring 
oozing a sort of social pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're never going to seal off this border, not 100%, not ever," said 
Silvestre Reyes. "It's unrealistic to think we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes is chief of the Border Patrol in the El Paso sector and knows the border 
as well as anyone. He is a product of its distinct culture, a culture unlike 
that in any other large section of the United States. Like most border 
residents, Reyes has relatives on both sides. His grandfather crossed over in 
1913. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Paso sector is second in size and activity only to San Diego. Across 
the Rio Grande from El Paso, population 511,000, is Juarez, Mexico, with 1.5 
million restless and for the most part desperately poor people. From their 
hovels in the Third World they gaze across a narrow stream at the First World. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Reyes' arrival a year ago, he has reduced illegal entry dramatically. 
Instead of chasing down illegals after they cross, his tactic is to discourage 
them from trying. 
</P>
<P>
 He stations agents like cavalry pickets, within view of one another, day and 
night, along a 9-mile fence on the north bank of the river. About 9,000 aliens 
used to cross here daily. Now only about 600 make it. 
</P>
<P>
 The other 8,400 likely will make it, too, eventually. Reports show that they 
have simply spread from El Paso to other crossing places in Texas, New Mexico, 
Arizona. Their northward flow is persistent and unceasing, like water around a 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
 To demonstrate that a blockade can work both ways, Mexicans in Juarez 
responded with a two-day boycott. El Paso merchants grumbled that business fell 
off by half. 
</P>
<P>
 Others on the U.S. side, locals who rely on paying less than minimum wages for 
lawn mowing, dishwashing, gas pumping and the like, have also let Reyes know 
what they think of his new policy. Not much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could forsee that," Reyes said. "They wanted me to keep out the prostitutes 
and panhandlers and leave the rest alone. I told them they can't have it both 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also knew that illegals who used to commute daily now would have to stay 
for weeks at a time. Or else move on and stay even longer. Why work here for 
$10 a day when they can go to Dallas or Denver and make $6 an hour? 
</P>
<P>
 So the border remains, as always, less a barrier than an inconvenience, more 
so at some places than at others. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other 14 twin cities that straddle the boundary, and at points between, 
the Border Patrol operates in its traditional way. Agents catch as many 
illegals as they can on U.S. soil and haul them back to Mexico. They often 
catch the same ones three and four times a day; agents and aliens soon get to 
know one another. Illegal entry is often little more than a game. 
</P>
<P>
 All the way downstream, where the Rio Grand empties into the Gulf of Mexico, 
Eufemia Lopez has a small sign nailed to her home on the outskirts of 
Brownsville, Tex.: "Se Atienen Partos. " In the local idiom, "Birthing Done 
Here." Lopez is a partera, a midwife. 
</P>
<P>
 About half her customers are Mexican nationals. They slip across the border in 
their final days of pregnancy to deliver the gift of life and receive in return 
a gift provided by the U.S. Constitution. When Lopez registers a birth at the 
courthouse, the newborn is an American citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 In large U.S. cities, mothers too poor to pay -- including undocumented ones 
-- have their babies in hospitals at public expense. 
</P>
<P>
 All children in America, citizens or not, may attend public schools. In every 
town on the Mexican border, without exception, the schools are woefully 
overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
 A research group in Washington, the Center for Immigration Studies, says 
illegal aliens cost the nation about $7 billion a year in medical, educational 
and other services. This is the main complaint of the various groups formed to 
curb immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just giving away America," said Glenn Spencer, a spokesman for one such 
California group called Act Now. "We have too soft a heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida claims to spend $1.5 billion a year on social services for about 
373,000 illegal immigrants. Its governor argues that this is a federal problem 
and has sued the government to collect. Texas, with 405,000, and California, 
with 1.6 million, have filed similar lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 (Any count of illegal aliens is obviously a guess; they do not come forward to 
be counted. So figures vary, usually according to the leanings of the counters. 
The INS estimates strive to be neutral.) 
</P>
<P>
 California, a trend-setting state whose population is 28% Hispanic, is out 
front in anti-immigration activism. 
</P>
<P>
 California Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, campaigning for reelection, would 
amend the Constitution to deny citizenship to native-born children of 
undocumented mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 He also favors an initiative on the November ballot that would deny a public 
education and all but emergency health care to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) wants to call out the National Guard to seal the 
Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Democratic colleague, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who as mayor of San Francisco 
was a champion of immigrants, now wants to buy tougher border control with a $1 
toll on every person who crosses. About 56 million a year cross legally at San 
Diego, the world's busiest port of entry. Illegal crossers, of course, do not 
stop at toll booths. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has already approved $45 million to hire up to 600 more Border Patrol 
agents, which would raise their strength to an unprecedented 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Agents make good salaries for this area," said Anthony Zavaleta, dean of the 
liberal arts college at the University of Texas in Brownsville. "We want as 
many agents as we can get, to help our economy. Will they make a dent in 
illegal entry? No way." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act aimed to stop or at least curtail 
illegal entry. It hasn't, at least not so anyone can notice. The reason, 
immigration authorities agree, has been failure to enforce sanctions against 
those who hire illegals. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the U.S. attorney general has urged a crackdown on such employers as well 
as an effort to devise documents for legal workers that can't be forged. One of 
the law's spinoffs has been a cottage industry in counterfeiting all along the 
border. Competition has produced not only quality work but specialization: 
green cards, Social Security cards, driver's licenses, birth certificates, name 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Employers welcome this," Zavaleta said. "It gives them the excuse that the 
phony documents looked perfectly good to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "But all that is beside the point. The people who sneak across are desperate. 
Their families are hungry. All they want is to work. If they make a long, hard 
journey from the Mexican interior, they will persist and will get across. They 
will stay longer and send money home. Whole villages in southern Mexico depend 
on American dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they could make a decent living in their homeland -- by their standards, 
not ours -- they would not leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Zavaleta, who was reared on a ranch in Mexico, also disagrees with the claim 
of Texas officials that illegal aliens cost the state more than double what 
they contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never bought that as an argument against immigration, legal or illegal. 
The illegal ones take unfilled jobs nobody else wants. The economy needs them. 
They buy gas, go shopping, pay taxes, start businesses. How can you measure 
their future contributions?" Such as, perhaps, that of a college dean. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's illegal-immigrant population is second only to California's, 
510,000 from many nations. But New York's Gov. Mario Cuomo appears to share the 
dean's view -- as well as take to heart the Statue of Liberty's summons to the 
world's huddled masses. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuomo, also up for reelection, decided against joining the lawsuit with the 
other three immigrant-heavy states. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sends out the wrong message," he told the New York Times. "I love 
immigrants. Legal, illegal, they're not to be despised." Many New Yorkers, he 
said, "know well that their own forebears arrived without papers." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Martinez said this: 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about immigration in terms of economics is a smoke screen. It is about 
nativism, about race, and it is ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was born in 1937 and reared in the barrios of San Diego. His people 
came from Texas. He knows all about cafe signs that said: "Dogs and Mexicans 
not allowed," knows first-hand what it is like to be rounded up and arrested 
for no other reason than he looks unmistakably Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is a fifth-generation American. He had to re-learn Spanish, which his 
family had long since lost, so he could lay aside his engineering degree, quit 
his white-collar job and go to work for the American Friends Service Committee 
on behalf of his distant countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
 He also knows personally other native-born Americans who were among the 1.1 
million Hispanics rounded up in California's "Operation Wetback" in 1954 and 
forcibly deported to Mexico -- and lured back whenever growers needed low-wage 
pickers. He has tried to help many of them prove their American citizenship, 
but with little success. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Americans," said Martinez, "have always been suspicious of people of 
different colors, different languages, always treated them badly. Economics 
plays a part, but it goes deeper." 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologists say it takes at least three generations, down to the immigrant's 
children's children, to complete the immigration process fully. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the foreign-born number about 8% of the population. In 1910 the figure 
was 15% of a much smaller population. Today hostility is directed mainly toward 
Hispanics and to a lesser extent Asians. But whatever an American's name -- 
Eisenhower, Goldwater, Toscanini, Brandeis, O'Neill, Rockne, DiMaggio, 
Clemente, Schwarzkopf -- the certainty is that his or her forebears once 
suffered stinging discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 But "a nation of immigrants" is not just a rhetorical flourish loosed at 
ethnic picnics. It is an apt description of a sovereign country founded and 
shaped by people who came from somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 With one exception: The Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
 That border was established by conquest. And that fact perhaps goes far to 
explain its ineffectiveness as a boundary. 
</P>
<P>
 The treaty that ended U.S. occupation of Mexico City in 1848 turned the 
northern two-fifths of Mexico into what is now one-fourth of the United States, 
completing America's dream of Manifest Destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gadsden Purchase of 1853, as an afterthought, added another chunk of 
Mexican soil for a railroad to speed the occupation. The Mexican president who 
succumbed to the purchase, Santa Anna, was exiled. A marker in Mexico City 
calls him "patriot and traitor," Mexico's Benedict Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, when America took its Southwest -- California, Arizona, New Mexico 
and Texas -- it took land, harbors, gold, silver, oil and the homes and labor 
of 80,000 people whose families had lived there for many generations before 
America even became a republic. Overnight the conquered became foreigners in 
their own land with little inclination to declare allegiance to the conquerors. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither, necessarily, do their descendants along the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lingering feeling all along the border that this land was stolen 
and by rights theirs," said Martinez. "In Mexico they still call the boundary 
river by its ancient name, Rio Bravo. And they certainly don't regard it (as) a 
criminal act to cross it to find work." 
</P>
<P>
 Just so. The most popular radio station in Mexico is the powerful one in 
Chihuahua that beams personal messages from home to illegal family members 
across America. A Different Perspective 
</P>
<P>
 The Southwest, about one-fourth of the United States, does not quite fit the 
definition "a nation of immigrants." That portion was taken by conquest from a 
people unwilling to lose it. A lingering resentment remains along the Mexican 
border. 
</P>

of Laredo:"

 "One is Texas and the gringos own it," Maria said. "This is Mexico. We own it. 
That's a difference."  
</P>
<P>
 "It's two names for the same place," Joey said. "We should own it all. It was 
ours once, and we didn't have to smile at gringos when we crossed the river."

FRENCHMAN'S ARREST CRACKS NARCOTICS RING; CRIME: GILBERT PIERRE JEAN-MARIE 
BARBE IS ACCUSED OF BEING A MAJOR HEROIN SMUGGLER. THE CASE'S SCOPE RIVALS THE 
INFAMOUS 'FRENCH CONNECTION' CAPER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By TOM HAYS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of his last moments of freedom, the man who called himself Gilbert 
Pierre Jean-Marie Barbe strolled along Manhattan's Central Park West, a Foot 
Locker bag swinging at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene -- captured in murky police surveillance photos -- made him look 
like an ordinary urban shopper. He wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Barbe lived his life as if he had stepped out of a spy novel. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least three years, authorities say, the eccentric, 48-year-old 
Frenchman trotted around the globe with a collection of fake passports, 
building a lucrative heroin-smuggling operation. 
</P>
<P>
 They say he lived part time in two luxury Manhattan apartments stocked with 
crystals and literature on New Age mysticism, closed drug deals on hotel pay 
phones and pocketed millions of dollars in profits. At times, he would launder 
his earnings. In a dishwasher. 
</P>
<P>
 But one misstep late last year brought his world crashing down. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives arrested Barbe in New York City on Nov. 17, setting the stage for a 
heroin seizure that made quantities from the last "French Connection" case in 
the late 1960s look modest. Dozens of other traffickers, large and small, 
including members of the mob, were implicated in a conspiracy to import and 
distribute 200 kilograms of heroin a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, while still uncertain about Barbe's identity, are building a case 
so massive and complex it's unlikely to reach trial until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown on the far-flung narcotics ring not only suggested that 
authorities had vastly underestimated the resurgence of heroin in New York 
City, the world's largest drug market. 
</P>
<P>
 It also closed a chapter in a twisting plot of international intrigue 
populated by eavesdropping investigators, tough-talking wise guys and 
professional junkies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the real-life saga of Gilbert Barbe, even Al Pacino made a cameo 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tip of the iceberg surfaced in the summer of 1991 in Hell's Kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there -- only blocks from Barbe's two Midtown apartments, on streets he 
probably never walked -- that two brothers from Puerto Rico found their 
American Dream in a blizzard of illicit powder, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Maximo and Melquiades Torrez allegedly arrived at work each morning in one of 
two apartments used as distribution centers for their goods: Glassine envelopes 
neatly folded and stamped with letters spelling "Big Shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The envelopes, peddled by a network of junkies and street people, went for 
about $15 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Business was good. The Torrez brothers allegedly sold about $11,000 of heroin 
a day. But their dealing angered local merchants and residents, who began 
complaining to police. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints finally reached a lieutenant with the Manhattan South Narcotics 
major case unit, Ray Ferrari, who had the brothers' phones tapped. At the time, 
police hoped to collect enough evidence for a simple conspiracy case that would 
put the brothers out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 But police were soon onto something bigger. One of the first voices they 
overheard was that of Juan (Don Juan) Castellanos, believed to be the Torrezes' 
supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Castellanos maintained a staff of workers in dingy East 
Harlem apartments who cut and packaged heroin under the "Big Shot" label. Also 
on staff were two quality-control junkies who would shoot up samples and rate 
the high on a scale of 1 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Once investigators identified Castellanos, they set up a series of wiretaps 
that slowly took them up the heroin food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 They soon learned Castellanos was allegedly a middle manager in an 
organization run by two men described as "the yuppies of the heroin trade." 
Richard Texidor and Reginald Bryant drove a fleet of Mercedes and Range Rovers, 
and lived in sprawling suburban spreads next to bankers and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair is alleged to have bought their product from a part-time supplier 
named John Nicolosi. Nicolosi is suspected of buying from Frank (Junior) Bassi, 
a career supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged connections of both Nicolosi and Bassi, a major player in drug 
smuggling since the 1950s, reached into three notorious Mafia families. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassi, 60, was a fugitive from a year-old heroin bust that landed his son in 
jail. But after moving to a safe house in the Bronx, he is believed to have 
continued to feed several distributors throughout New York City and Long 
Island, and parts of New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassi was brash. He was keen at spotting undercover police trying to tail his 
car, taking them on "rides" -- circuitous routes that made them give up in 
frustration -- and boasting about it later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I had eyes following me today," he would tell associates over his 
wiretapped phone, according to police. "It must be you they're after." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his contacts stood out: Gilbert Barbe. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that police knew anything about him; to them, Barbe was a disembodied 
voice floating beyond the arm of the law. He called Bassi sporadically and 
spoke to him in curt riddles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your watches are here," he would say in his heavy French accent, referring to 
kilos of heroin. "They're $135,000 each." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators traced the calls to several pay phones located throughout two 
large Midtown hotels. But dozens of stakeouts at both yielded nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We listened to this guy for months," Ferrari said, "but we couldn't touch 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing that their investigation had run its course, police planned a massive 
raid for Dec. 7. It appeared that Barbe would skate. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, just three weeks before the raid, the elusive Frenchman slipped. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When not in Paris or Thailand or points between, investigators say, Barbe was 
in Manhattan cutting big drug deals with small change. 
</P>
<P>
 His pockets full of quarters, he would call his customers strictly from the 
hotel pay phones. He never mentioned names, times or places -- much to the 
dismay of police who had wiretapped his customers' phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, they overhead one conversation on Nov. 16 that gave them a start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll call back tomorrow at 2 p.m.," the Frenchman told a voice believed to be 
Frank Bassi's. 
</P>
<P>
 At exactly 2 p.m. on Nov. 17, detectives began circling the pay phones in the 
Parker Meridien hotel. The sound of a thick French accent triggered a Pavlovian 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd heard that voice thousands of times," said Detective Jerry Rosenberg. 
"We knew it instantly." 
</P>
<P>
 For the next several hours, detectives watched as the man with the French 
accent, goatee and long dark coat went to the Hilton, purchased a roll of 
quarters, made more phone calls, then hopped into a cab. 
</P>
<P>
 The detectives commandeered their own cab, following him to a restaurant on 
the Upper West Side. Outside, Bassi was waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbe climbed into Bassi's brown station wagon for a short ride. When he 
stepped out, he was carrying a shopping bag. 
</P>
<P>
 The detectives finally stopped Barbe when he entered a subway station at 
Columbus Circle, telling him they wanted to question him about robberies at 
Midtown hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Visibly nervous but cooperative, the suspect told police he was a diamond 
trader named Gilbert Barbe. When they asked about the bag, he showed them a 
shoe box filled with $20,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a legitimate businessman," he continued to insist, inviting them to 
inspect his apartment on West 56th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbe produced a passport, a driver's license and piles of shipping records 
showing an address for a warehouse in Queens. 
</P>
<P>
 As the suspect paced back and forth in the apartment under the watchful eyes 
of detectives, another set of investigators paid a visit to the warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, they found nothing more than two large shipping containers, 
apparently empty. But a closer inspection ended the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a secret compartment, they discovered $1.7 million in neat piles. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbe was arrested that night. His suppliers and dealers, still unaware of his 
arrest, were next. 
</P>
<P>
 At dawn on Dec. 7, nearly 500 officers raided more than 30 locations 
throughout the five boroughs, Long Island and in parts of New Jersey. By 
afternoon, nearly 70 suspects -- including Bassi, the Torrez brothers, 
Castellanos, Texidor, Bryant, Nicolosi, organized crime soldiers and a police 
officer accused of providing counterintelligence -- were in custody. (All but 
Melquiades Torrez are awaiting trial; he pleaded guilty to a drug-conspiracy 
charge and was sentenced to 5 to 10 years.) 
</P>
<P>
 Six days later, police arrived at a West 57th Street building where Barbe had 
another apartment. The doorman wore a Santa outfit with a flashing belt; the 
detectives carried sledgehammers with which they smashed down Barbe's door. 
</P>
<P>
 As they walked in, one of the heroin smuggler's neighbors, Al Pacino, walked 
out. He paused to gawk at the investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The search of the Frenchman's hideaway didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the front closet of the 26th-floor studio, detectives found five 
identical black suitcases. All told, they held 424 pounds of pure heroin with 
an estimated street value of $240 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The seizure -- although not approaching the national record of 1,071 pounds 
recovered in an Oakland, Calif., raid in 1991 -- was the largest ever for the 
New York City Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 It also eclipsed the 79 pounds recovered in another high-publicity probe 
linked to French nationals -- the so-called "French Connection" case. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, which became the basis for a book and two movies, heroin was 
smuggled through Marseilles in cans of imported fish, expensive European cars 
and secret compartments of private and commercial jets. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, authorities said, Barbe wrote the sequel: 
</P>
<P>
 In Kiev, he purchased six shipping containers outfitted with false bottoms. In 
Thailand, he filled the false bottoms with heroin bought at $12,000 a kilo. In 
Singapore, he had the containers loaded with rattan furniture as a cover. 
</P>
<P>
 The containers were shipped to Port Newark, N.J., where they cleared customs, 
then trucked to Queens. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret compartments served a dual purpose: To import heroin and export 
cash, both in massive quantities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barbe may be out of business, but his mystique endures. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer did not return numerous phone calls. And personal data provided by 
investigators is sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Records, books and literature collected at his apartments suggest he is a 
vegetarian, a Buddhist, a follower of New Age mysticism. 
</P>
<P>
 The $69,000 in cash was found in his 57th Street apartment hint at another 
trait: paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
 About $40,000 was neatly stacked in the dishwasher. Because he kept literature 
explaining that U.S. currency often is tainted with narcotics residue, 
investigators speculate he washed his money. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also recovered five passports, including one with the name Joel 
Guichard, his alias for the bogus furniture import-export business.

 Prosecutors, investigators and court documents still refer to him as Gilbert 
Pierre Jean-Marie Barbe. But sources concede that probably is not his real 
name. Publicity could hinder the investigation, they say.

MOVEMENT TO RECLAIM LOST LAND REFUSES TO DIE; SOUTH AMERICA: THE ASSASSINATION 
OF THREE INDIAN LEADERS IN COLOMBIA FAILS TO DETER INDIGENOUS PEOPLE FROM 
TRYING TO RETAKE RESERVATIONS FROM SETTLERS. 
</P>

<P>
 The three Indians -- friends who grew up on the same reservation and ascended 
to top national posts -- were barreling down a gravel road when they drove 
straight into an ambush. 
</P>
<P>
 A fusillade of bullets erupted out of the night on March 26, riddling the 
Indians' red pickup with some 60 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men -- leaders of the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia 
and a tribal chief who also served as alternate senator -- didn't have a 
chance. Their driver died alongside them. 
</P>
<P>
 Settlers are suspected in the bloodiest attack on Indian leaders in modern 
Colombian history. It came as militants of the Zenu tribe are retaking their 
reservation from settlers and are feuding with the mayor over hundreds of 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight of the Zenu is the struggle of tribes across the continent to regain 
lost land. 
</P>
<P>
 In Venezuela, the Yucpa tribe went on an arson spree and blocked highways this 
year to press for the return of land in the foothills of the Sierra de Perija 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, the Macuxi tribe has been clashing with encroaching non-Indians in 
the Amazon rain forest -- a Wild West atmosphere of raids on Indian villages by 
rifle-toting ranchers and counterattacks by Indians on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zenu's fight goes back to Spanish colonial times when the tribe was 
granted a 205,000-acre reservation called San Andres de Sotavento, also the 
name of the area's main town. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians lost their rolling hills and plains over the centuries to whites 
who simply ignored reservation boundaries and settled there, and to businessmen 
who loaned the Indians money for seeds and tools and then took the land when 
crops failed and the Indians couldn't repay the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the newer non-Indian settlers are drug traffickers who have invested 
their earnings in cattle ranches. 
</P>
<P>
 As a ceiling fan stirs the air in his sweltering, cramped office in San Andres 
de Sotavento's "Indigenous House," acting Zenu Chief Jose Carmona -- replacing 
Chief Hector Malo who died in the ambush -- and fellow tribal leaders declare 
they won't be cowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Their decision to continue retaking reservation land and confronting the mayor 
puts them on a collision course with the settlers, including the traffickers 
who have no compunction about gunning down anyone who stands in their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not afraid," said Jose Lucas, whose brother Luis was one of the slain 
leaders. "As warriors, we must keep going forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Parked in the courtyard below Carmona's second-floor office is graphic 
evidence of the ambush: the charred, bullet-riddled pickup in which the four 
Indians died. 
</P>
<P>
 The killers burned the pickup, the only vehicle the government had given the 
reservation. With no money to carry out their programs, the Indian leadership 
can't even afford to fix the Indigenous House's backed-up, reeking toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away is the settlers' center of power: the office of Mayor Juan 
Bautista. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian leaders say they suspect Bautista was behind the ambush because he has 
refused to release $700,000 the government allocated for the reservation, and 
because Chief Malo received a death threat two days before the ambush as he met 
with his subchiefs to plan how to get the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Bautista, sitting behind a desk in his air-conditioned office and with gold 
chains adorning his neck and wrist, denied responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had nothing to do with it," he said. "My conscience is clear." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, young toughs with pistols in their waistbands stood guard. Colombian 
mayors, often targeted by anti-government rebels, commonly use bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this year, Bautista decided how federal funds earmarked for the 
reservation should be spent. Now, reservations are in charge of such funds, 
though they still must be channeled through local mayors' offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Bautista said he has not handed over the money because the Indians haven't 
submitted the proper paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior government official in Bogota said it was unlikely Bautista was 
behind the ambush because "he's not stupid; it would have been much too 
obvious." 
</P>
<P>
 Settlers who elected Bautista and who created paramilitary groups -- initially 
to fight leftist guerrillas but which are now being used against Indians -- 
probably ordered the massacre, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought they could kill the Indian movement by assassinating the 
leaders," said the official, interviewed on condition of anonymity. "On the 
contrary, the Indians are becoming even more determined." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, the Zenu began recovering reservation land lost over the 
centuries by simply moving in. 
</P>
<P>
 They build huts on the land, forcing a confrontation with settlers and 
triggering the intervention of the Agrarian Reform Institute, which buys the 
land and gives it to the Indians for communal use as recovered reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Zenu leaders complain they must create a climate of crisis before the 
institute steps in. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Indians have a constitutional right to their reservations, government 
officials say the state can't simply expel ranchers whose families have worked 
the property for generations and -- considering the many claims by tribes 
across the country -- can't afford to buy all the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just not enough money in the budget," said Jorge Lopez, the vice 
minister of government. 
</P>
<P>
 About 39,000 acres -- one-fifth of the reservation -- has been recovered with 
the strategy, in which the Indians risk being shot, beaten or jailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberto Santos, wearing only sandals and ragged pants secured by string, is 
the Zenus' symbolic presence on a disputed ranch called San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Living with his wife and eight children in a shelter of thatched palm fronds 
supported by wood beams, Santos grows crops on San Francisco with other Indian 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, security forces burned the Indians' huts on San Francisco, 
destroyed their crops and threw nine Indian men, including Santos, into jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians say they have no choice but to persist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hunger makes us brave," said Rafael Noriega, a Zenu subchief. "Landowners pay 
us 1,500 pesos (about $2) per day to work their fields. If a man has children, 
how can he feed them? 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have our own land."

BERLINERS UPROOTED BY THE WALL DURING COLD WAR WANT PROPERTY BACK; GERMANY: 
ABOUT 1,500 WHOSE HOMES WERE CONFISCATED AND RAZED IN 1961 ARE PRESSURING 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH IS RESISTING. OFFICIALS CONTEND THAT GIVING IN WOULD 
SET A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT.

<P>
 Five years after the destruction of the Berlin Wall, killer of Cold War 
freedom-seekers, its ghost has risen to cause more heartaches. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1961, the East German Communists bulldozed, dynamited and burned whole 
neighborhoods in a 95-mile-long swath through the city and around West Berlin 
to make space for the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 People were given only hours to leave their homes. Some jumped from windows 
and fled to the Western sector, but most piled their belongings onto carts and 
moved out of what would become a no man's land. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Communists are gone and Germany is reunited, about 1,500 of those 
who owned their homes -- East Germany had a mix of nationalized and private 
property -- demand that their land be returned. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 
government, which inherited much of the property, says that it was seized under 
East German law and that giving it back would set a dangerous precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispossessed owners say that's immoral. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we were through with totalitarianism, but the federal government 
is continuing a crime committed by the Communists," said one of them, 
58-year-old Renate Saebsch. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute began soon after Germany was reunified in 1990 and has been 
heating up since. A growing number of politicians and legal experts are siding 
with the dispossessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlin's municipal government, usually a close ally of Kohl, opposes him in 
the property dispute and is blocking any plans by the federal government to 
develop the real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't criticize the wall for decades . . . and then refuse to give its 
victims satisfaction," said Elmar Pieroth, the city finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
 East Germany built the wall in August, 1961, to stop its citizens from fleeing 
to the West. At least 172 people were killed trying to get through or over it. 
</P>
<P>
 The few remnants include a stretch not far from Checkpoint Charlie, the 
crossing in the old American sector, filled with ragged holes chopped out 
during celebrations of the wall's end in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 A death strip that once bristled with machine guns, guard towers and electric 
fences, guarded by snarling dogs, now is largely covered with grass. Children 
play where their elders died trying to flee. In a few places, there are small 
monuments to victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Decapitated tops of several guard towers, collected on one lot, resemble giant 
eight-sided mushrooms sprouting from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 New streets have been built parallel to the wall's route. Gypsy women sell 
Cold War souvenirs from sidewalk tables: Soviet and East German officers' caps, 
Communist medals, chunks of masonry they say are pieces of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 American investors will be building a huge office complex where Checkpoint 
Charlie's barriers and soldiers once stood guard against the East. Daimler-Benz 
and Sony plan big projects on Potsdammer Platz, a square that was once the 
heart of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ownership dispute, involving about half the lots seized to create the 
wall, is delaying development elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthias Weckerling, spokesman for the federal Justice Ministry, says the 
government would like to return the properties to their original owners, but 
cannot under the current legal conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 East Germany seized the land under its defense law. Weckerling said giving the 
real estate back could call into question every legal property expropriation 
undertaken in four decades of Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools, fire stations, hospitals, streets, army barracks and sewage plants 
were built on expropriated real estate in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlin has proposed federal legislation stating specifically that only those 
whose land was taken for the wall would be eligible to recover it. Some of 
Kohl's Cabinet ministers support the idea, but others contend it is 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the property owners are losing patience. 
</P>
<P>
 Inge Bergk, 59, accuses the federal government of intending to sell the land 
and pocket the profits.

FRENCH ARMY COURSE AIMS TO TEACH REPORTERS HOW TO SURVIVE A WAR; JOURNALISM: 
LESSONS INCLUDE HOW TO SPOT A SNIPER, FIRST AID AND EVASION TECHNIQUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Exploding grenades shake the air and machine guns chatter. Journalists 
scramble through a smoky maze of blackened buildings, a sewer and passageways 
filled with tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's gunfire over that wall! Stay low!" one reporter yells to his 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a surreal war zone atop a 19th-Century fortress overlooking this 
Mediterranean port near the Spanish border. It also is make-believe. 
</P>
<P>
 In a three-day program at the French army's National Commando Training Center, 
journalists learn how to adjust to warfare and avoid becoming statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 63 journalists were killed around the world, many in combat zones, 
according to the French organization Reporters Without Borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "A press card or white paint on a U.N. vehicle are no longer enough," said Lt. 
Col. Jean-Paul Legras, commander of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to show you little things that won't protect you, but will make you 
less vulnerable," Legras said in greeting the fourth class of the year-old 
program. "This has nothing to do with 'Rambo.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His center normally operates courses of two to four weeks for army officers 
and French Legionnaires. The brief session for reporters includes avoidance of 
snipers, mines and booby-traps, lethality of weapons, first aid and basic 
hand-to-hand evasion techniques. The only charge is about $60 to cover food. 
</P>
<P>
 The French Defense Journalists' Assn. asked the army for the program, similar 
to one in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the Gulf War, we had trouble working with the military, and Yugoslavia 
was an emerging war zone," said Stefan Ciezka, the association's treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the instruction involves common sense, reminding everyone to be alert 
and resourceful. During sniper instruction, the class sat outside a two-story 
house while the trainer pointed out possible sniper nests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most likely spot is the roof," Lt. Michel Marzoc said. Then a commando 
sprang out through a skylight, submachine gun blazing with blanks, startling 
the pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 Look out for any opening in a house, from a chimney to a ground-level vent, 
journalists are told. In a high-rise, the choice spot is an upper floor -- but 
not the top, an obvious target for sniper-hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 Wear dull or dark clothing, but if you choose green, "don't complain you were 
mistaken for a soldier," one instructor said. "And don't carry army rations." 
</P>
<P>
 Instructors showed how, through teamwork, two reporters could quickly pull 
each other through a window or drag a wounded comrade to safety. Using a smoke 
bomb for cover, the victim clasps his hands around the neck of the rescuer, who 
crawls on all fours. 
</P>
<P>
 When looking for a hide-out, push open a door slowly because it could be 
booby-trapped, the soldiers warned. The journalists practiced, carrying a block 
of wood in the shape of a video camera. 
</P>
<P>
 In a final test, students, alone or accompanied by commandos, negotiated a 
maze of buildings and alleys while soldiers shot blanks and exploded grenades 
at a safe distance. Reporters drove through a checkpoint manned by "drunken" 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The most chilling part of the course displayed mines, other booby-traps and 
slides of maimed victims. Millions of anti-personnel mines, which cost as 
little as $1.50 each and can look as benign as a tuna can, are scattered in 
current or former combat zones around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 First-aid techniques taught in the course include treatment for shock and 
bleeding, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and making stretchers and splints from 
available materials. Students practice using hypodermic needles on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 At the nearby Mont Louis commando base in the Pyrenees, the class watched 
commandos fire rifles, machine guns and an antitank missile. Bullets went 
through wooden blocks and hollow brick walls, but were stopped by sandbags, 
walls of poured concrete and, surprisingly, tightly bound stacks of magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 By agreement with the journalists' association, there will be at least one 
session in September and two more next year, Ciezka said. 
</P>
<P>
 The training does not always instill confidence. A German TV cameraman who 
filmed it said the course "reinforced my feeling never to cover a war zone."

NEWLYWED DIES IN CRASH, BUT HOPES FOR CHILDREN LIVE IN EXTRACTED SPERM; 
FLORIDA: A RARE SURGICAL PROCEDURE PERFORMED AFTER GROOM'S DEATH COULD ALLOW 
WIDOW TO BECOME PREGNANT. BUT CHANCES OF SUCCESS ARE SLIM, DOCTORS WARN.

<P>
 The remarkable legacy of 22-year-old Emanuele Maresca was born of tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Maresca was killed in a car accident just 16 days after his wedding. But a 
rare surgical procedure performed after his death may allow Maresca's young 
widow to give birth to his child. 
</P>
<P>
 A specialist conducted post-mortem surgery and removed an organ that stores 
sperm, allowing Maresca's reproductive fluid to be extracted, frozen and stored 
for later use by his 22-year-old wife, Pamela. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles doctor said he has performed a similar procedure on dead men 
four times, but the frozen sperm has never led to a pregnancy. He and the 
Florida physician say that if Pamela Maresca becomes pregnant, it apparently 
would be the first conception with sperm taken from a dead man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just wonderful. It gives us all something to hang onto," said 
Maresca's widow. "Even though we've lost Manny, we will have something of him 
in the future. I'm sure he would agree with what we've done." 
</P>
<P>
 Tragedy struck the newlyweds the night of May 19 after they left their jobs at 
a Titusville restaurant. They bought some milk and cookies, got into their new 
car and began the late-night drive to their Orlando-area home. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few miles from their destination in Oviedo, Maresca may have been 
distracted as he rounded a curve, his widow said. He lost control of the car 
and crashed into a utility pole, suffering massive head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The college student was rushed to Orlando Regional Medical Center, where his 
uninjured wife, his mother and father and their large family waited throughout 
much of the next day to find out whether doctors could save him. 
</P>
<P>
 They failed. Doctors advised the family late in the day that Maresca's brain 
had stopped functioning. The grieving wife and Maresca's parents began making 
arrangements to harvest and donate Maresca's vital organs once he died. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was distraught, and I said to Pamela that I would have been so glad if she 
had been pregnant," recalled Leslie Maresca, the victim's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother's comment led to efforts to extract semen from Maresca through the 
use of a special machine often used for paraplegics and others unable to engage 
in sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Those efforts didn't work. So Dr. Mark Jutras, a reproductive endocrinologist, 
was called in. Jutras conducted surgery after Maresca's death and extracted the 
victim's epididymis, a tubular duct system where sperm is stored. 
</P>
<P>
 Jutras then dissected the epididymis and sent it to an Altamonte Springs lab 
that freezes and stores sperm and assists physicians with therapeutic 
inseminations. A lab technician managed to recover two samples of sperm. 
</P>
<P>
 The sperm was frozen and will be held in storage for about a year, when Pamela 
Maresca plans to be artificially inseminated after one of her eggs is 
fertilized with the sperm in a laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very eager to have children in the future, but we had never discussed 
the possibility of anything like this," Pamela Maresca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Maresca was overjoyed by what she considers an "almost miraculous 
series of circumstances" -- that Dr. Jutras had experimented with the 
epididymis and was available immediately, that her daughter-in-law was so 
enthusiastic about the idea and that the cryogenic lab had only recently gone 
into operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many wonderful coincidences that we have to believe God had a 
hand in this," Leslie Maresca said. "Maybe it was just meant to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband, Armando, have five other children. Emanuele was their 
oldest. 
</P>
<P>
 Jutras said he had experimented with rats during his medical training, 
removing the epididymis and cutting it up to get the sperm, but had never 
performed the procedure on a human. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw no reason not to do it in this case. I was pretty confident it could be 
done although I had never performed the procedure on a human patient before, 
and I didn't know if it had ever been done," Jutras said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the operation, Jutras discovered there had been one other reported case, 
in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Cappy Miles Rothman, a urologist in Los Angeles, extracted the epididymis 
and obtained sperm from a 30-year-old man fatally injured in a car wreck. It 
was done at the request of the victim's father. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of Rothman's November, 1980, report in The American Fertility 
Society's journal, Fertility and Sterility, there were no provisions for lab 
fertilization so that such sperm could be used for pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Laboratory fertilization techniques were developed shortly after that, Rothman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothman said he has performed the same surgical procedure three more times 
because "it invariably makes the family very happy to have it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I assume they wanted the option to use it in the future, but I don't know of 
a case that it has resulted in a pregnancy," Rothman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maresca, a student at the University of Central Florida, wanted to become a 
professor, teaching creative writing and English. 
</P>
<P>
 "He left us songs, poems and stories, which I am going to get published," his 
mother said. "He left us with a lot of wonderful things. It was quite a legacy 
for someone so young."

RIGHT-WING JEWS RALLY TO PROTEST HATED ARAFAT'S RETURN; ISRAEL: THEY SPILL INTO 
STREETS OF JERUSALEM AND VOW TO PREVENT PLO LEADER'S EVER SETTING FOOT IN THE 
HOLY CITY.

 Tens of thousands of right-wing Jews flooded the streets of this city late 
Saturday and early today, clashing with police to protest the 
government-sanctioned return of Yasser Arafat and vowing to prevent the PLO 
chairman from ever setting foot in this holy city. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters, egged on by fiery speakers at a two-hour rally at Zion Square, 
launched a march after midnight along streets bordering Palestinian East 
Jerusalem and the Old City. Bands of young Israeli stone-throwers were broken 
up by riot police with batons, and four police officers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred protesters were stopped by police at Damascus Gate, which 
leads to the Muslim quarter of the Old City, but they left after an agreement 
with authorities. The Old City was sealed off by hundreds of police, and a few 
demonstrators who managed to get inside were stopped as they tried to break 
into the Temple Mount, one of Islam's holiest sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest was the first large-scale attempt by the right wing to regroup 
after months of disarray. Right-wing leaders used Arafat's return to the Gaza 
Strip on Friday -- and fears of his designs on Jerusalem -- to rally opposition 
to the peace accord signed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization leader. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50,000 people turned up for the initial rally, suggesting significant, 
though not overwhelming, opposition to the accord that has so far returned the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho to Palestinian rule. Organizers had said they hoped to 
attract 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally began in darkness after the end of the Sabbath, with hundreds of 
police watching quietly from rooftops and side streets. It brought together a 
variety of Israelis, from gray-haired Orthodox Jews in black coats to youths in 
T-shirts and couples pushing their dozing children in strollers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here because we have just one Jerusalem and we will protect it," 
declared Benjamin Netanyahu, chairman of the rightist Likud Party, to cheers 
from the crowd. Arafat, Netanyahu added, "belongs in a court of law for war 
criminals, not in Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 Netanyahu drew loud applause when he shook hands with Ariel Sharon, the former 
defense minister, suggesting a temporary end to an enmity that has divided the 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all unified in this struggle for Jerusalem," Sharon said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the demonstration broke up, thousands began their march through the streets 
toward Rabin's house. Early today, the authorities said one group of protesters 
made it to a square outside the prime minister's house and refused to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said rocks were thrown at the U.S. Consulate, though no significant 
damage was reported. At a Palestinian-owned bakery in East Jerusalem, workers 
cowered inside as protesters pummeled the shop with stones. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, two of the bakery workers emerged to plead with the attackers. "Why are 
you throwing stones? We're supposed to have peace now," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 A protester responded, "How can we have peace when our people are being 
murdered in their beds?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We should throw all of you into the sea!" the other bakery worker shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 Retorted the rock thrower, "No, we'll throw you into the sea." 
</P>
<P>
 Although police had to break up several groups of stone-throwing youths, no 
serious incidents of violence were reported and, despite the tense atmosphere, 
the clashes appeared relatively mild. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just doing this nonsense to get some attention," said one protester, 
Yehoshua Reinfeld, 17, who joined the group that confronted nearly 100 riot 
police at the Damascus Gate to the Old City. "Maybe this way, people will 
understand that this is our homeland." 
</P>
<P>
 "The government is leading us to destruction," said Haim Ben-Tzimchon, a 
48-year-old grocery store worker who made the 45-minute drive to Jerusalem from 
Tel Aviv for the rally. "It is just pursuing a policy of concessions, 
concessions that will cost us not only Gaza and Jericho but also Jerusalem. 
This is surrender, not peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerusalem, now controlled by Israel, is considered a holy city by Jews, 
Muslims and Christians. Arafat has said he will soon return to Jerusalem to 
pray on the Temple Mount in the Old City, though his aides say that trip will 
probably not occur until later. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said the government does not oppose a visit to 
Jerusalem by Arafat. "We can't prevent anyone who wants to come and pray in 
Jerusalem from coming and praying," Peres said. "Even after he prays in 
Jerusalem, Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, united, strong." 
</P>
<P>
 "All of this hysteria" from the right, he said, "is out of place." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, speaking in Gaza on Saturday, said, "We respect the Jewish holy sites 
in Jerusalem, and we expect them (Israelis) to respect our sensitivities as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 But the thought of Arafat, who led a long guerrilla war against Israel, 
visiting Jerusalem has helped galvanize the right, bringing together divided 
parties that have been suffering from a lack of new ideas since the peace 
accord was signed last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10,000 Jews turned up for Saturday afternoon prayers at the Western 
Wall, Judaism's most sacred site, in a peaceful show of opposition to the peace 
plan and to Arafat visiting Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Although right-wing leaders say they want to avoid confrontations with the 
police, they insist they are determined to use rallies and civil disobedience, 
by blocking roads, for example, to press their demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is happening in my country at the moment is a horror story and we have 
no other options left," said Frieda Ross, 42. She said she showed up at the 
rally Saturday night because "how else are we to show our dissatisfaction?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not against peace," she added. "I don't believe killing Arafat is the 
answer. But I don't want him here. I don't begrudge the Palestinians anything. 
But this is the home of the Jews."

FOR ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS, A GLIMMER OF HOPE; HEALTH: EMORY UNIVERSITY STUDY 
FINDS LIGHT THERAPY MAY EASE DEPRESSION AND SLEEP DISORDERS. BUT DOCTOR SAYS 
MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO BE SURE IT IS EFFECTIVE, AND WARNS AGAINST TRYING 
TREATMENT AT HOME. 
</P>

<P>
 After many restless nights filled with hallucinations of bears in her bedroom, 
Eveleth Harshman says she now sleeps soundly after reading a single magazine 
article. 
</P>
<P>
 The same kind of light therapy used to treat the winter blues has alleviated 
much of the disturbed sleep and agitation the 80-year-old woman suffers as a 
result of Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Harshman, who can remember the name of the brain surgeon who operated on her 
at age 9 but can't recall her telephone number, is among 30 patients 
participating in a study of light therapy at Emory University. 
</P>
<P>
 Light therapy may enable Alzheimer's patients to remain at home or ease the 
problems they have living in nursing homes, said Dr. Robert Green, director of 
Emory's Neurobehavioral Program and Memory Assessment Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it works, you would have a treatment option that would be low-cost, 
low-tech and easily available to care-givers and nursing centers across the 
country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 4 million Americans are believed to have Alzheimer's, which 
gradually wipes out the memory until its victims can no longer perform even the 
simplest task. There is no test to definitively diagnose Alzheimer's; doctors 
rule out all other possibilities and confirm a diagnosis during autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Emory research, funded by the National Institute on Aging, is based on 
previous studies of people with severe winter blues, or Seasonal Affective 
Disorder. The depression they experience can sometimes be alleviated by the 
systematic exposure to high levels of artificial light. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how the light affects the brain isn't known, but it apparently affects 
the levels of two brain chemicals, a neurotransmitter called serotonin and a 
hormone called melatonin. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the brightness and duration of light also affect sleep patterns, 
restoring a person's ability to sleep well at night. Disrupted sleep frequently 
occurs among Alzheimer's patients, resulting in restlessness, pacing, 
wandering, irritability and other behavioral problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Drugs can lessen those problems, but often result in unwanted side effects. 
Emory's Green and his colleagues think that exposing Alzheimer's patients to 
bright light may provide a safer way of improving their sleep and alleviating 
their agitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are studies that show that this (sleep problem) is in fact one of the 
things which disrupts family members the most and actually leads to nursing 
home placement," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Norman Rosenthal, an expert on Seasonal Affective Disorder and a 
psychiatrist with the National Institute of Mental Health, said the study makes 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Light is known to help consolidate the sleep of some people," he said. Light 
therapy would not cure Alzheimer's, but anecdotal reports indicate it may 
succeed at relieving some of its symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a reasonable hope that some relief could be provided," Rosenthal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients entering the study wear a watch-like device on their wrist to measure 
the amount of light they are normally exposed to and the amount of movement or 
time they are awake. The patients wear it throughout the four-week study. 
</P>
<P>
 After a week spent in normal light, they spend two weeks in light therapy, 
followed by a fourth week without the light treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 During the treatment, participants sit on a pastel sofa in a waiting room 
facing a bank of six light boxes about 3 1/2 feet to 5 feet high. For 1 1/2 
hours, they read or talk with others while the fluorescent light penetrates 
their eyes. Green estimated that patients receive light about five times as 
bright as in an office. 
</P>
<P>
 Harshman joined the study in April after her son, Bill, learned of the 
project. Initially, she wasn't interested, but decided she had "nothing better 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 At her first treatment, "they gave me a pile of magazines and I read, and 
after awhile I realized a lot of time had passed," said the former teacher. "I 
was very curious the whole time -- and I'm still curious -- about what the end 
result will be." 
</P>
<P>
 The positive results are so obvious to Harshman's family that they would like 
her to continue to participate in the research. But Green said that the outcome 
is uncertain and that many more patients will have to participate to determine 
whether the therapy is effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Green cautioned care-givers against trying to recreate his experiment at home, 
saying that he has no evidence yet that light therapy is effective.

WARTIME INTERNMENT CAMP BINDS GERMAN POWS, AMERICAN GUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADOLPHE V. BERNOTAS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty years ago in the northern White Mountains, the village of Stark became 
the unlikely site for a remarkable community: a World War II prisoner-of-war 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp Stark existed between April, 1944, and July, 1946, nearly doubling the 
community's population of about 400. But despite wartime animosities and 
suspicions, it left a positive mark on residents of two continents. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, five former POWs and about 30 of the Americans who guarded them met 
for a German-American Friendship Day, a reunion 40 years after the lives of 
captive and captor, native and foreigner had touched. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 people turned out for the reunion at Stark's covered bridge and 
the festivities that followed, one of the most important days in Stark's 
220-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Dartmouth College history professor Allan Koop, who chronicled Camp Stark in 
his book, "Stark Decency, German Prisoners of War in a New England Village," 
describes the POW camp as "an island of decency in a world at war." 
</P>
<P>
 Koop, the son of former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, and Madeleine Croteau 
of the Stark Improvement Society organized the reunion. Now they're looking to 
a 1996 observance, the 50th anniversary of the closing of Camp Stark and the 
10th anniversary of the first reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp Stark was home to about 300 of the nearly 400,000 Germans held prisoner 
in camps across the country. According to Koop, the camp came into existence 
because of New Hampshire's powerful politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown Paper Co., the North Country's largest employer in nearby Berlin, 
desperately needed woodcutters for its pulp and paper mills because the war had 
depleted its work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Adams, a timberland manager in the North Country who was about to 
become a member of Congress and, later, governor and then aide to President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower, and U.S. Sen. Styles Bridges used their influence to get 
a POW camp to provide labor for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 An abandoned Civilian Conservation Corps camp on the south side of Route 110 
about 30 miles from the Canadian border became the camp. The 50 American guards 
lived in similar quarters on the north side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the POWs later became American or Canadian citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a couple of chimney bases and guard-tower foundations, the camp now 
is but a clearing in the woods, only a roadside sign marking the site. 
</P>
<P>
 What made the camp unusual was that its inmates were mostly members of the 
999th Division, an assembly of dissidents, communists, socialists and perceived 
misfits who had once been imprisoned by the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 The 999th was created by Adolf Hitler to give members a chance to redeem 
themselves for Germany. Generally, they were older and better educated than 
regular German troops, wiser to the ways of the world and more cosmopolitan. 
Some spoke not only German but also French, English, Dutch, Italian and 
Norwegian. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp population included an editor of a socialist newspaper and a former 
socialist politician. Some of the inmates had fought against the fascists in 
the Spanish Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 999th, part of the Afrika Korps, was defeated by the Allies in 
Tunisia, its members felt no compunction in surrendering to democratic forces. 
"Many shared the political ideology of their enemies rather than the beliefs of 
their compatriots," Koop wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Camp Stark had its share of Nazis and political strife among the POWs 
was common, most of its inmates were anti-Nazis, Koop wrote. Indeed, they 
elected their leader rather than let the ranking officer, a Nazi, be their 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 When in 1945 the inmates were shown films of the Holocaust, the reaction was 
not one of denial, but shame and, "I told you so," Koop wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark's German cook prepared special food for the camp's American interpreter, 
a Jew. The camp during those two years also enjoyed the reputation of having 
the best food in the North Country. 
</P>
<P>
 When President Franklin D. Roosevelt died in 1945, the POWs expressed their 
condolences to the camp commander and could barely hold back tears. But when 
Hitler died two weeks later in his Berlin bunker, there was no emotion, Koop 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was allowed by the Geneva Convention, few inmates wore their 
German uniforms, preferring their work clothes marked with "PW." 
</P>
<P>
 There were escapes, though all POWs eventually were caught. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, 10% of the inmates were on the loose. The runaways often claimed 
to be Dutch sailors, and usually were picked up by the local constabulary in a 
day or so. One fugitive was picked up hitchhiking by the Lisbon police chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Koop recounts tales of one fast-talking inmate who conned a guard into letting 
him outside the gate. Another who fled to the hills made himself a home in a 
cave where he was determined to spend the winter, until a couple of local 
hunters persuaded him to return to the warmth of the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Two fugitives returned on their own with stomachaches caused by eating 
berries. 
</P>
<P>
 Koop wrote that the escapes created excitement among local residents eager to 
collect the $15 bounty, which often led police to "capture" surprised local 
fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
 The most successful escape was made by an artist fluent in several languages 
who made his way to New York City and was getting by drawing portraits of 
visitors to Central Park. But three months after he fled Stark, he ran into the 
camp's interpreter at Penn Station. The irony was multiplied when both men 
turned out to be from Vienna and had lived a few blocks apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most POW camps, Stark had an escape tunnel, but it was discovered before 
it was used. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the interaction of the POWs was with their guards, there also 
was contact with Brown Co. employees and their families and the occasional 
contacts in Berlin where inmates requiring hospital or dental care were taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Koop noted that guards sometimes would help tired prisoners saw wood so they 
could meet their daily quotas. German mechanics repaired Brown Co. trucks, 
inmate artists made gifts of drawings and paintings now cherished as treasures 
and mementos in many North Country homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In an odd turnaround, inmates, who earned up to $1.50 a day, could buy 
cigarettes at the camp store while tobacco was rationed to civilians. Koop 
wrote that cartons of cigarettes would end up as gifts for Brown Co. employees, 
as would inmate-made toys for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp's German doctor was preferred by some American guards over their own 
physician and the German often made rounds of Stark to treat villagers. 
</P>
<P>
 One day some guards were humming "Don't Fence Me In" and, when a German POW 
asked what the tune was, the guards taught him the words. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next morning all the Germans were singing it, in German and English," 
Koop wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years later, in Stark Town Hall, former prisoners of war and their 
families, former guards and their families, former civilian foremen and their 
families, and the people of Stark all linked arms and sang, 'Don't Fence Me 
In.' 
</P>
<P>
 "There was not a dry eye in the hall," Koop said.

HURRICANE WARNINGS ISSUED AS STORM NEARS FLORIDA COAST

<P>
 Tropical Storm Alberto, the first of the hurricane season, bore down on the 
coast of northern Florida on Saturday, packing growing winds of 60 m.p.h. and 
heading for an area filled with Fourth of July vacationers. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm's sustained winds grew from 45 to 50 m.p.h. during the day.By the 
time Alberto reaches land, winds could increase to near hurricane force, 
National Hurricane Center specialist Lixion Avila said. A tropical storm 
becomes a hurricane if its maximum sustained winds top 74 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurricane warnings were issued for areas from Gulfport, Miss., to Cedar Key, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the Florida Panhandle will feel this storm," said Bob Sheets, 
director of the hurricane center. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal residents began to board up windows and get ready to flee the area. 
Long lines formed at gas stations, and stores were doing a brisk business in 
bottled water and emergency equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Landfall was expected about noon today, probably in northwestern Florida, but 
perhaps in Alabama or even eastern Mississippi, Avila said. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles urged Gulf Coast residents to monitor news 
broadcasts about the storm's progress and prepare for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm developed Thursday off Cuba, where it dumped 10 inches of rain.

MEDICAL BILLS IN CAR CRASH DECIMATE FAMILY FINANCES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like millions of other Americans, Kim Patek fell through the cracks of the 
health-insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 20, she was not covered by her father's policy, which terminated 
coverage at age 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought she was still under my major league plan, which cost me $8,000 a 
year," said Fred Patek, a former shortstop. "And when I asked why I hadn't been 
notified that she wasn't covered under my family insurance while I was still 
paying for full family coverage, the most consistent answer I got is they don't 
have to tell me she's not covered." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kim had begun a new job, the waiting period for insurance had not yet 
passed when she was critically injured in a car accident in July, 1992, and 
became a respirator-dependent quadriplegic. 
</P>
<P>
 So when medical bills for hundreds of thousands of dollars began arriving at 
the Patek home, the family knew it had to do something. Patek went public. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys, the Kansas City media, are the ones who did it," he said. "We got a 
great response. We've got great letters. I have a sack of mail, and I've kept 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Patek, one of the most popular of the Kansas City Royals in the 1970s, said 
his frequent work for charities probably helped. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has a firm estimate on Kim's medical expenses to date; Patek said the 
total is more than $1 million. He liquidated everything he could to pay the 
huge, initial bills and was ready to sell his home if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public sent in more than $100,000 -- the Pateks did not want to say 
exactly how much -- to Kim's trust fund. The money will cover expenses for a 
few years, said Bob Harmon, a longtime family friend and treasurer of the trust 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicaid now pays some of Kim's expenses; it paid almost nothing the first 
year, Harmon said. In the last 12 months, the family spent about $55,000 from 
Kim's trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
 More money could come in from settlement of a lawsuit Kim has filed against 
Ford Motor Co., Heartland East and four doctors and their practices who were 
involved in her treatment, claiming product liability and medical malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, which demands a jury trial, does not seek a specific amount in 
damages, said Max Foust, Kim's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under Missouri law, you don't ask for an amount," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges Ford's design of the automatic shoulder belt was flawed 
and that the physicians who gave Kim her initial care failed to take steps that 
could have lessened the severity of her injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants had no comment on the lawsuit, which is set for trial Aug. 8 in 
St. Louis Circuit Court, where the case was filed against Ford.

 Americans have been ambivalent about immigration since the nation's beginning. 
Benjamin Franklin, before he signed the Declaration complaining about barriers 
to immigration, was complaining about immigrants.Germans, the doughty 
Pennsylvanian groused, were being allowed "to swarm into our settlements and by 
herding together establish their language and manners to the exclusion of 
ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Spite toward newcomers with strange names and tongues and complexions has 
accompanied every peak period of immigration since. And each wave has taken 
much of the heat for whatever home-grown social problems they encountered. 
</P>
<P>
 Italians, President Herbert Hoover wrote in a note to a New York congressman, 
are "predominantly our murderers and bootleggers . . . foreign spawn (who) do 
not appreciate this country." The congressman was Fiorello LaGuardia. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be noted that Hoover's immigrant forebear, Andreas Huber, was one of 
the German-speaking "swarm" that so annoyed Benjamin Franklin.

EARLY ADOPTION FOUND OF VALUE TO FUTURE LIVES

 The earlier the adoption, the better a child does in adolescence, according to 
a study of teens adopted when they were babies. 
</P>
<P>
 The study issued late last month casts doubt on the belief that adopted 
teen-agers are more likely to be troubled than others their age. 
</P>
<P>
 Early adoption is "the key in the successful attachment of child to parents, 
and vice versa," said study co-author Peter Benson, a psychologist. "We cannot 
overstate its power." 
</P>
<P>
 Benson said that more than three-fourths of the adopted teens studied are in a 
"positive zone of mental health." 
</P>
<P>
 The four-year, $1-million study, described as the largest U.S. study of 
adopted babies, focused on children who were less than 15 months old when they 
were adopted between 1974 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 members of 715 families in Colorado, Illinois, Wisconsin and 
Minnesota were questioned. The study was funded by the National Institute of 
Mental Health. 
</P>
<P>
 "What seems particularly important is how parents deal with adoption," Benson 
said. "In families that are thriving, adoption is a fact of life that is 
accepted and affirmed, not dwelt on. It's no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 27% of the 881 adopted teens surveyed said being adopted "is a big part 
of how I think of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the report's other conclusions: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Transracially" adopted babies (most in the study were Asian) do as well 
when they reach adolescence as those adopted by parents of their own race. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parents with adopted babies stick together. Only 11% of those studied were 
divorced or separated, compared with 28% in a national sample of couples with 
adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 * The adopted teens studied were slightly less likely to engage in "high-risk 
health behavior," such as substance abuse and early sex.

10,000 GAYS MARCH IN PROTEST IN ROME

<TEXT>
<P>
 An estimated 10,000 homosexuals demonstrated in central Rome on Saturday to 
protest against what they said was the indifference of Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi's new conservative government. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Rome Mayor Francesco Rutelli and marching behind a banner that said 
"Proud to Be Here," they filed through the streets of the capital to press 
demands for greater rights including official recognition of gay couples. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, a conservative media tycoon, became prime minister in May at the 
head of a government that also includes the neo-fascist National Alliance, some 
of whose members are strongly opposed to homosexuals.

PHILIP MORRIS CHALLENGES FLORIDA'S ANTI-TOBACCO LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Philip Morris is challenging what is considered the nation's toughest 
anti-tobacco law on grounds it is unconstitutional and was rammed through the 
state Legislature by a cabal of greedy lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "These attorneys stand to gain financially from the act as much or more than 
the state," says the lawsuit filed by the cigarette maker and other businesses 
late Thursday, the day before the law took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The law allows the state to sue tobacco companies for the costs of treating 
Medicaid patients who have lung cancer, emphysema or other smoking-related 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has spent an estimated $1.2 billion to treat Medicaid patients with 
smoking-related illnesses since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, signed by Gov. Lawton Chiles last month, also prohibits companies 
from arguing that some of the blame rests with the smoker. It allows courts to 
impose judgments based on the companies' market share rather than their 
percentage of fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's typical of those acts that pass without proper deliberation," said Barry 
Richard, a lawyer who represents those filing suit. "In a lot of minds, it was 
drafted to do one thing. In effect, it does much more." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit claims the law is unconstitional and arbitrary, and could expose 
virtually any industry to a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles spokesman Ron Sachs said Friday that the law will be used to sue only 
the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "A challenge was anticipated and it will be defended," Sachs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Philip Morris Inc. in the lawsuit were Publix Supermarkets Inc., the 
National Assn. of Convenience Stores, and Associated Industries of Florida, one 
of the state's top business lobbying groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Messages seeking comment were not returned Friday from the offices and homes 
of officials with Publix, Philip Morris and Associated Industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit accuses a group of about 100 trial lawyers that it called the 
"inner circle" of masterminding the legislation and helping steer it through 
the state's House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no public notice, no legislative debate and no meaningful 
explanation of the amendment's contents," the lawsuit says. "Both houses passed 
the act unanimously, with only the act's few drafters and sponsors having an 
understanding of its actual content." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit says the law would benefit trial lawyers because it allows the state 
to enter into agreements with private attorneys and pay them up to 30% of the 
amount it collects in a successful lawsuit.

INS OFFICIAL IS ACCUSED OF SELLING RESIDENCY CARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A top immigration official stands accused of making as much as $1 million by 
selling green cards for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department investigators said William Malcolm Tait had bypassed 
Immigration and Naturalization Service controls since 1983 to help a man obtain 
15 residency visas to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 That man is cooperating with authorities, the San Francisco Examiner reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tait allegedly made from $300,000 to $1 million in the scheme, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tait, 45, a deputy director at the INS office in San Francisco, was arrested 
Thursday in Dallas, where he was on temporary assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always been doing a good job -- that's why headquarters was using him 
for temporary assignment," said Philip Waters, who heads the INS office in San 
Francisco.

WOUNDS DEEP 10 YEARS AFTER NATION'S LARGEST DEATH ROW ESCAPE; VIRGINIA: 
BREAKOUT OF SIX CONDEMNED MEN, ALL OF WHOM WERE RECAPTURED, STILL HAUNTS 
MECKLENBURG CORRECTIONAL CENTER, THOUGH EMPLOYEES RARELY MENTION IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE GEARAN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These days, Prince A. Thomas Jr. patrols the 20-foot fences surrounding the 
Mecklenburg Correctional Center. He has little contact with Death Row or its 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to go over there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Small wonder. Ten years ago, on May 31, 1984, Thomas was among 14 prison 
employees who were taken hostage by a determined band of six condemned men. The 
hostages were stripped, bound and locked in a cell. 
</P>
<P>
 The six, sentenced to die for a total of nine murders, then drove through the 
open gates of Virginia's most secure prison. It was the largest Death Row 
escape in American history. 
</P>
<P>
 All were recaptured within three weeks; five of the six have been executed. 
The breakout still haunts Mecklenburg, though employees rarely mention it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't ever get over it," said Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't take nothing for granted. The only reason you walk out of here 
every day is because the inmates let you walk out. . . . I'm very aware of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The escape was carefully planned, craftily prepared. The inmates had secreted 
homemade knives in cracks in their cell walls, then painted over the cracks. 
For months they listened to the guards' conversations over an intercom, noting 
assignments, names and shift changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Briley brothers -- James and Linwood -- were the masterminds; they had 
been accused of 11 murders in Richmond, although they were not tried for all of 
them. "You can't burn a guy but one time," the city prosecutor said after both 
Brileys were sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Richmond Circuit Judge James Wilkinson called the brothers' crimes the "vilest 
rampage of rape, murder and robbery the court has seen in 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The others: Derick L. Peterson, 22, killer of a supermarket worker; Willie 
Leroy Jones, 26, who robbed and killed an elderly couple; Lem D. Tuggle, 32, 
convicted of killing a woman; Earl Clanton Jr., 29, who strangled a librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 No one noticed when, after an evening recreation period, Clanton hid in a 
bathroom instead of returning to his cell. About 8:30, Clanton emerged and 
overpowered a lone guard in the cellblock's control room. 
</P>
<P>
 He released the others, and for more than 90 minutes the group held the 
building hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 No one outside the building knew anything was amiss. About 10:30, the group 
forced a hostage to radio an emergency call. There was a bomb on Death Row and 
the guard would need a prison van immediately to remove it, the guard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The six donned riot gear and ran from the building, pretending to douse the 
bogus bomb with fire extinguishers. They jumped into the waiting van and 
disappeared into the hot, late spring night. It was close to a half-hour later 
when prison officials discovered the ruse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a freak happening," said Jerry Davis, records manager at the prison. 
He is one of only a few senior prison officials who remain -- most were 
transferred after the escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "They walked out; they did not break out. You have to remember that. It took 
human error for them to escape," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The escape terrified prison employees and residents of this rural 
tobacco-farming area near the North Carolina line, where the prison represents 
welcome employment but also makes an unsettling neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid to even go out of my house," said prison operations officer 
Joanne Royster, who was an inmate counselor at the time of the escape. "I would 
park my car right next to the door so I could run right out of the house. 
Everyone was scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Clanton and Peterson were caught the next day in Warrenton, N.C.; Jones and 
Tuggle a week later, in Stanford, Vt., after Tuggle robbed a gift shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brileys were last. It took hundreds of law enforcement officials from 
several states, aided by a bounty hunter, three weeks to track the pair down. 
</P>
<P>
 When FBI agents closed in on June 19, the Brileys were calmly barbecuing 
chicken in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were executed within a year, and the others soon followed. The sole 
survivor, Tuggle, declined to be interviewed; on June 8, a judge overturned his 
conviction and ordered that the state release him or retry him. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakout prompted a state investigation, which found that Mecklenburg, 
which was touted as state-of-the-art and virtually escape-proof when it opened 
eight years earlier, was actually vulnerable to escape because of weak security 
procedures and poorly trained employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was terribly embarrassing," said Carl K. Hester, assistant warden at 
Mecklenburg Correctional Center. "We have done all we could to ensure nothing 
like that ever happened again." 
</P>
<P>
 New security officers were hired. There are daily checks of the cell windows 
on Death Row, and the evening recreation period was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 A new wall with another locked door was added to the three cellblocks that 
make up Death Row. Individual guards no longer control all the locks and can 
lock themselves into their stations for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, after an incident like that, there were changes," Hester said.

'1647' SHOP ATTRACTS A LARGE FOLLOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When she was a teen-ager, Dawn French couldn't find attractive clothes to fit 
her more-than-ample curves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought terrible things, anything that fitted," she said. "I was angry 
because I wasn't able to be fashionable. It was impossible to find a single 
garment that would fit you, other than a floral dress for a 50-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 So when French grew up to be a famous actress and comedian, she opened a 
clothing shop for large women. She calls it 1647, for the 47% of British women 
who are size 16 -- U.S. 14 -- or larger. 
</P>
<P>
 French said it thrills her to see women "reborn because of such a ludicrously 
simple thing as being able to wear clothes they feel happy in." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes there is a line outside the small store in a trendy north London 
neighborhood. French started a mail-order business in 1991 and the catalogue 
has grown from a postcard to 12 pages. Mail orders now account for 40% of the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothing sizes start with small (bust up to 48 inches, waist to 44 and hips to 
50) and run through large (bust up to 66 inches, waist to 60 and hips to 70). 
</P>
<P>
 All members of the staff are large and there's a bowl of heart-shaped 
chocolates for clients of the guilt-free haven. 
</P>
<P>
 The clothes are designed by Helen Teague, 38, who was born in Manchester but 
spent much of her youth in Ghana, a West African country where big women are 
celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Teague has an exceptional eye for current fashion, color and style, and uses 
natural fabrics whenever possible. Her linens, wools and silks contrast with 
the cheap fabrics used for large sizes by many mainstream stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuts are soft and full without being tent-like. The collection includes 
comfortably casual, sleekly professional and elegance for evening. 
</P>
<P>
 A chambray denim jacket with tie fastenings attached by tiny brass buttons is 
teamed with matching palazzo or tapered pants. A chambray dress wraps over a 
black tunic. For the office, a simple tunic dress in oatmeal pin-stripe is worn 
with a silk satin shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 French's shop is more like a salon. Some women spend hours trying on clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about inspiring confidence," said Denise Darlow, an employee. 
</P>
<P>
 A customer, Barbara Bartram, said, "They indulge us, they make us feel good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because we're large doesn't mean we don't want to look good. I'm nearing 
50. My husband is younger than I am. I'm sure he doesn't want me looking older 
than I am."

MAUNG MAUNG; CIVILIAN PRESIDENT OF BURMA FOR A MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maung Maung, 69, a Western-educated intellectual who ruled for one month in 
1988 as the only civilian president of Burma, now called Myanmar. Maung Maung 
became president Aug. 18, 1988, when his predecessor was ousted by student-led 
pro-democracy demonstrations after 17 days in office.Military rulers apparently 
believed that Maung Maung's civilian status would help quell the protests. But 
they escalated, and Defense Minister Gen. Saw Maung took power Sept. 18. The 
military crushed the unrest in bloody attacks on the protesters. Lt. Gen. Than 
Shwe took over as head of the junta in April, 1992. Maung Maung was the only 
civilian among four presidents who ruled under the one-party socialist system 
imposed by military leader Gen. Ne Win in 1962 and abandoned after the 1988 
demonstrations. In Yangon, formerly Rangoon, Saturday of a heart attack.

 All was well once again Saturday with the Liars Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The fish were biting, it was the start of Independence Day weekend and the 
Seal Beach Pier had finally reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 The May 21 fire not only did $350,000 in damage and closed a large section at 
the middle of the wooden pier, but it disrupted a way of life for the handful 
of fishermen who congregate there every weekend. For them, the pier means 
friendly conversation as well as recreation, said Lloyd Murray, a chatty Seal 
Beach resident of 50 years who nicknamed the local fishing group the Liars 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life was coming undone," said Murray, 67, a retired McDonnell Douglas 
employee who started work at the defense giant "even before McDonnell came 
aboard." 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent a lot of happy hours on this pier," he said. "You know, criminals 
always return to the scene of the crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow club member Kevin Dufresne fished elsewhere while the pier was closed 
but said it just wasn't the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to Belmont (Pier) a couple of times, but this is where our friends 
are," said Dufresne, 40, an auto parts salesman from Bellflower. "We have our 
own clique here. We all come out and visit." 
</P>
<P>
 On a warm, sunny Saturday, Seal Beach returned to a welcome normalcy with the 
reopening of the landmark pier at 6 a.m. For the first time in more than a 
month, the beach crowds could once again stroll to the end of the 1,865-foot 
pier, the county's longest. 
</P>
<P>
 Out at the end of the pier, the employees at Ruby's, a replica 1950s-era 
diner, had spent all day Friday and Saturday morning scrambling to restock, 
reassemble and clean the restaurant for its own reopening. The doors finally 
opened about 1 p.m. and manager Greg Brown said business was steady all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the diner's employees found work at other Ruby's restaurants around 
Orange County during the closure, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately it was summertime and business had picked up so they could use 
our employees," said Brown, 37, of Seal Beach. "This turned out to be an 
opportune time for this to happen. It all worked out pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 For Julian and Barbara Bailey of Seal Beach, the Saturday morning reopening 
meant they could return to their daily stroll. The pier is an extension of Seal 
Beach's Main Street, which is the center of the old-fashioned charm of the 
community, said Julian Bailey, 73, a retired insurance brokerage president. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like the beach towns we had when we were growing up," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beach life has not been the same in this coastal community since the 
midsection of the landmark pier burst into flames about 3 p.m. May 21, sending 
out plumes of thick black smoke and temporarily stranding about 100 pier 
visitors at the end of the boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials initially thought an electrical problem had started the blaze 
but now believe it was caused by coals from a barbecue grill that dropped under 
the pier and ignited a gas line. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular pier has seen a battering array of disasters during its lifetime. 
It was first built in 1906, destroyed by storm, and then rebuilt in its present 
form in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 The May 21 fire was the third time in the last decade alone that it has been 
closed for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983 a fierce winter storm churned up huge waves that damaged the pier's 
midsection. Then, in 1992, a fire sparked by electrical wires in a lifeguard 
tower burned the same general area as the latest fire. Only a few months later 
the Big Bear earthquake cracked the pier's support pilings. 
</P>
<P>
 The reopening Saturday is only temporary and city officials plan to close the 
pier again in the fall for a final phase of repairs.

DISPLAYING ART OF SURVIVAL; LAGUNA'S PAGEANT OF MASTERS EMERGES FROM MUDDY MESS 
WITH HELP OF VOLUNTEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "It's gone. It's all gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The words came to Glen Eytchison in an early-morning phone call last Nov. 11, 
but at first he had trouble deciphering them. What was gone? What was the 
caller talking about? 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, it became apparent that something serious was happening at the grounds 
of the Pageant of the Masters, Laguna Beach's most famous tourist attraction. 
Eytchison, the pageant's director for 16 years, had left his office at the 
pageant grounds just hours before. Now, he rushed back. 
</P>
<P>
 His first view of the damage was through a window of the pageant office 
kitchen: Appliances and dishes were afloat in a soup of mud several feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like 'The Poseidon Adventure,' " he said, comparing the scene to a 
1972 disaster movie about a cruise ship capsized by a tidal wave. "It was like 
the building had been picked up and shaken like a martini." 
</P>
<P>
 That was only the beginning. In front of the orchestra pit was a jumbled pile 
of sets and props 15 feet high. The pit itself was full of mud. Stage supports 
were knocked askew. Inside the office buildings, some walls were knocked out, 
while locked closets were filled with three feet of mud. 
</P>
<P>
 It had rained less than an inch the night of the flood, but that was enough to 
unleash a torrent of mud from a canyon denuded in the firestorm of late 
October. Now, buried in the muck were computers -- with all their stored data 
-- along with administrative records, irreplaceable art books, makeup, costumes 
and tools from the carpentry shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "And live rattlesnakes in the mud," Eytchison said last week. "That was 
interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Some wondered if the pageant could recover in time for its 1994 season, but 
those who know the operation best say they had faith all along. Don Williamson, 
an architect and the pageant's director for 15 years before Eytchison took 
over, inspected the buildings not long after the mudslide and now terms them "a 
god-awful mess . . . really shocking." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added: "You know the old adage about show business. I had sympathy for 
Glen, but I figured he would find a way to put it all together." 
</P>
<P>
 Eytchison, his staff and an army of volunteers have put it together. The 
Pageant of the Masters, first held in 1932 and interrupted only during World 
War II, will have a special performance for firefighters Tuesday before 
launching its regular 1994 run on Friday. A quirky local institution, the 
pageant features live volunteers in elaborately staged tableaux vivants , live 
re-creations of famous and lesser-known works of art. 
</P>
<P>
 The survival of the pageant is a symbol of the resilience of the community 
itself, and its artistic core, said artist Roark Gourley, who helped organize 
relief efforts after the fires that destroyed 366 homes last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you dropped an atomic bomb on Laguna, there'd be artists back here 
two weeks later, just because we love the place so much," the sculptor said. 
"The pageant and the Festival of Arts, to me, is the heart of Laguna." 
</P>
<P>
 For the pageant, the drama started Oct. 27, the day of the fires. As flames 
encroached on all sides, Eytchison and a few staff members -- and even some 
strangers -- fought back with hoses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were people just showing up to help us who we were never able to 
thank," he said. "It was really impressive. It was moving." 
</P>
<P>
 A few trees on the border of the pageant grounds were scorched, but the 
buildings were saved. The pageant became a focus of local relief efforts and 
was to be the site of a benefit concert with comic Elayne Boosler and singer 
Graham Nash. But the concert never came off. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 10, Eytchison left about midnight for home, planning to come in early 
the next day. Motion-detector alarms later helped piece together what happened 
next: At 4:20 a.m., a wall of mud cascaded from a side canyon through 
construction shops into the Irvine Bowl itself and out through the backstage 
area and pageant offices. Along the way, the mud knocked out walls and carried 
them along, depositing them in one big stack. It all took about two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been easy to fall into despair, surveying the wreckage just a 
few hours later, Eytchison said. Damage was later estimated at more than 
$500,000. What's more, three months of research already had gone into the next 
show, and all of it was buried in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
 But before long, volunteers began to appear, and the long, difficult task of 
digging out began. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just when I thought the world was caving in, there's a line of volunteers 
here," Eytchison said. "On one hand, I was totally depressed. On the other 
hand, you can't help but be completely moved and impressed by the dedication of 
these people. That is what got me through. That is what got everybody through." 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing we had to do was get it organized again so (Eytchison) could 
start working on this year's show again," volunteer Lisa Tyson said. "It was 
just a matter of picking through what was there to see what we could save." 
</P>
<P>
 Local shops donated shovels and wheelbarrows. The owners of a neighboring 
restaurant, the Tivoli Terrace, fed volunteers for free for more than a month. 
Much of the work involved wading through cold, stinking mud and digging for 
whatever could be salvaged. Several volunteers likened it to archeology. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things fished out of the mud was a pageant sign from the 
'40s, with a depiction of Botticelli's "Venus." "We got an easel and put her 
out," Eytchison said. "She became our mascot." 
</P>
<P>
 Books became a primary focus of the salvage. Most were ruined, but volunteers 
carefully washed off the pages and opened the books to dry at pages featuring 
art already selected for the next pageant.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a race against time," volunteer Kristen Nannes said. 
</P>
<P>
 All but one of the pageant's computers were packed solidly with mud, but with 
the help of a computer technician who called after reading of the mudslide, the 
data in one of them was retrieved. Volunteers, working hour after hour, later 
keyed other information back into new computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, more than 40,000 sandbags were hauled onto the festival and pageant 
grounds, fashioned into five-foot-high walls that would, officials hoped, 
channel the runoff from future storms harmlessly through the grounds and out 
onto the street. The bags were later replaced with large cement blocks, which 
will be used through the next three rainy seasons until the vegetation on 
nearby slopes comes back fully. 
</P>
<P>
 New storm drains also were built, and eventually structural repairs were 
undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as salvage and other operations went on, Eytchison had to plan the next 
show. Working from folding tables on the stage of the adjacent Forum Theatre -- 
his office was destroyed -- he began choosing works for the show that debuts 
this week. The planning usually takes place in September through December, but 
was not completed this year until February. 
</P>
<P>
 The pageant might be considered a quaint anachronism in this era of high-tech 
entertainment, but it endures. In its first year of existence, the pageant drew 
an estimated 2,200 people. Crowds now average about 200,000 each summer, over 
52 performances.  
</P>
<P>
 "The pageant has a life of its own somehow," Williamson said. "It's such a 
naive concept, really, but if you do it honestly, it becomes a show." 
</P>
<P>
 Employing a crew of 25 and a cast of about 130 volunteers, the show is a 
unifying force in this tightknit community. If anything, the events of the past 
eight months have pulled them closer together, many say.

FOOTBRIDGE WIDENS GULF BETWEEN NEIGHBORHOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A footbridge -- now nothing more than two unconnected foundations jutting 
skyward on either side of the Santa Ana Freeway -- has come to symbolize the 
struggle by the city's wealthier neighborhoods to seal their borders against 
outsiders in a desperate bid for safety. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side are people like Mel and Terri Vernon, who have paid a high price 
for their tree-lined streets and shaded porches and who draw a hard line in the 
sod when it comes to compromising that placid life -- for themselves, or the 
toddler they are raising. 
</P>
<P>
 They keep a sharp eye out for strangers, they know how to organize and they 
want construction of the bridge halted. 
</P>
<P>
 On the west side of the freeway are people like Vivian Ruiz Valdez, whose 
family lives in a crowded apartment complex. Ruiz Valdez wants her 8-year-old 
daughter to be able to walk across the new footbridge to the elementary school 
in the Vernons' neighborhood -- instead making a circuitous trek by bus or foot 
on busy streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle are officials with three public agencies: Caltrans, the city and 
the Santa Ana Unified School District, all somewhat startled by the sharp tenor 
of debate, which has become increasingly fierce in recent weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 The issue has everyone talking about subjects key to the city's psyche: fear 
of crime and the growing population of low-income immigrants; the legacy of 
crowded apartment buildings spawned by haphazard development in the early 
1980s; and the desire by some to mend Santa Ana's sharp disparities and extract 
lessons from the city's diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Transportation is building the bridge to replace 
a tunnel that about 133 schoolchildren were using to trek to school on the 
eastern side before a freeway widening project closed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Caltrans and city officials have tossed the issue to the school district, 
asking the board to decide whether the children from the west side really need 
the new bridge. The board is expected to make a decision July 12. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Audrey Yamagata-Noji cautioned residents not to let the 
issue divide an already troubled city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of you who have lived here 30 or 40 years have faced a lot of changes," 
she told an audience packed with about 100 bridge opponents at a recent board 
meeting. "What I hope we don't do is point across neighborhoods and say 'It's 
those people over there,' but that we solve problems as a community." 
</P>
<P>
 Some complain that the opposition to the bridge smacks of discrimination. 
Others say the fears that it will bring a crime wave are exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton said police have no reason to believe that 
crime increased any more from west to east than it did in the other direction 
when the tunnel was open, and he knows of no gang that claims the Santa Ana 
triangle as its territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone can say that a bridge like that would have such a 
devastating impact because floods of criminals are going to use it to access 
the other side," Helton said. "Criminals do go on foot, and they do use 
vehicles, depending on what crime they're going to engage in." 
</P>
<P>
 To opponents with the Northeast Neighborhood Assn., however, completion of the 
bridge signals nothing short of death for their neighborhood. Like the tunnel 
before it, they say, the overpass will attract taggers and open a passage way 
for lawbreakers to their closely monitored streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're convinced that it will create decades of problems for all involved," 
said Mel Vernon, who has helped launch a petition drive to halt construction. 
"We feel confident that the bridge will be graffitied. It will allow some 
people who have committed crimes to cross over." 
</P>
<P>
 Vernon vows to chain himself to the lumbering structure or take legal action 
if Caltrans proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be able to maintain the integrity of the neighborhood, and one way 
of doing that is to limit access to the neighborhood," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to persuade the school board to call Caltrans off the project, 
the residents have gathered more than 300 signatures. At Tuesday night's school 
board meeting, people from the neighborhood talked of the shootings and 
burglaries they say the tunnel ushered onto their streets.  
</P>
<P>
 The $1.3-million project -- Caltrans has already spent $600,000 -- will bridge 
the freeway at 20th Street, linking Hoover Elementary School and homes on the 
east with a small, triangular neighborhood brimming with apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials, who have been paying the school district to bus 133 
children to Hoover during construction, said they will consider abandoning the 
bulky, wood-framed bridge half-built if school and city officials request that 
they do so in writing and supply some good reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district plans to canvas parents on the west side before making a 
decision, and Yamagata-Noji urged residents to get the Santa Ana City Council 
involved, too. 
</P>
<P>
 East side residents have suggested that the busing simply continue until a new 
elementary school on French Street is completed in about three years, 
eliminating the need for the children to cross over at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some in Vernon's neighborhood, however, say the fervent opposition to the 
bridge is misguided and betrays Santa Ana's deep fear of its changing face. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad," Jenny Doh said. "It seems like people are organizing in order to 
get us even more isolated, to make sure that we're more and more secured down 
into this weird cocoon. I think the more that happens, the lower the quality of 
life will be in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 Doh was booed by her neighbors at the school board meeting when she said Santa 
Ana needs "bridges that foster understanding and harmony by connecting our 
lives with the lives of others." 
</P>
<P>
 She called on the school board to build the bridge so children can get to 
school safely and families like hers can walk over to the Bowers Museum and 
soon-to-be built Discovery Museum on the west side. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're committed to this city. We want to live here, we want to start a family 
here, and the reason we chose this city is because we feel that the diversity 
is a real plus," Doh said. "I don't know where people are getting the idea that 
chaos would break loose if a bridge were built." 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Teutle knows what it's like on the west side of the freeway. The Mexico 
native lived there before moving his family to the Northeast neighborhood in 
December, smack up against the looming foundation for the new bridge that would 
connect him with his past. 
</P>
<P>
 Tales of the tunnel -- including one of a thief who disappeared through the 
hole on a stolen bicycle -- prompted him to act. Teutle said he has collected 
more than 200 signatures opposing the bridge over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 He concedes that some people might find his new neighborhood's mission 
exclusive, but Teutle said he moved away from a neighborhood crowded with 
lower-income renters in search of safety and peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably wouldn't have opposed the bridge if it was the same type of 
neighborhood over there as over here," he said. "But it's mostly apartments. 
They've got gang members over there, graffiti and everything else. We don't 
want that coming across. That's the reason why we moved over here and purchased 
this house. It's family living." 
</P>
<P>
 Some on the west side say discrimination is behind the opposition to the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more white people over on that side. There are Mexicans over there, 
too, but they forgot where they came from," said Vincent Valdez, 30, who said 
crime is a citywide problem that the bridge won't enhance or erase. 
</P>
<P>
 "They started it already. They should finish it," said Ruiz Valdez, 26. Her 
8-year-old daughter is now being bused to school, but there is no guarantee the 
busing will continue, and even now her daughter must walk on busy 17th Street 
when she stays after school. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents, like Ruiz Valdez, have been largely silent on the issue, 
unaware of the fear their neighborhood has spawned. Only one parent from the 
west side showed up at the meeting and, in a brief statement, she implored the 
board to proceed with construction "for the safety of her children." 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents on the west side concede that the tunnel was a haven for drug 
users. But they said the crime goes both ways. It has hit them equally hard if 
not harder, they say, and they blame people crossing over from the east side 
into their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Magdalena Salazar, 52, who has lived in a west side house that abuts the 
freeway for two years, said the children need the bridge. But if the school 
district promises to keep busing them, she would agree that construction be 
halted.

ARF PROVIDES THE OPTION OF FOSTER CARE FOR PETS; ANIMALS: THE NETWORK, WHICH 
HAS PRO-LIFE POLICY, HOPES TO CREATE ITS OWN SHELTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Her paws propped against the front-yard fence, Grayce the gangly golden 
retriever barks a friendly greeting to visitors at the Schurman home in 
Capistrano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Minnie, a deaf and blind 13-year-old cocker spaniel, careens off the 
furniture like a canine bumper car, and a tiny 4-month-old miniature pinscher, 
also named Minnie, yelps, her ears perked and her head cocked. Curly, a 
9-year-old cockapoo, peers quietly in through the screen door. Lindsey, a black 
and white cocker, barks like a ruffian watchdog and suddenly barrels toward the 
front door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't mind her, she's got no teeth," said Pat Schurman, who is also the proud 
owner of a parakeet, three cats, two horses and a baby African tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken and Pat Schurman are what is known around here as an ARF family, so 
designated because they are volunteers for the Animal Rescue Foundation of Dana 
Point. It is a calling that requires a love of animals and the willingness to 
do ARF's work, which consists of taking in at a moment's notice homeless or 
lost pets until their owners or a new home can be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit ARF started two years ago as a kaffeeklatsch, a group of concerned 
citizens who, as co-founder Glenda Rosen describes it, "used to see the animals 
on the streets on a daily basis" and resolved to do something about it. Today, 
ARF has a network of 30 volunteer families like the Schurmans, more than 1,500 
dues-paying members, a local cable television show and a proven ability to draw 
600 people -- with their pets -- to a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely extraordinary," said Mission Viejo City Councilwoman Sharon 
Cody, an animal lover who led the fight to build a shelter in her city. "I have 
followed the beginnings of a lot of animal organizations, and ARF has been able 
to achieve things I have never seen anybody achieve. They amaze me."  
</P>
<P>
 All animals that become ARF pets are neutered and given complete physicals and 
medical treatment before they are placed in foster homes. Veterinary treatment 
makes up the bulk of ARF's costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we had ARF, the options for someone who had to give up a pet were to 
take it to the pound, put an ad in the paper or put it to sleep," said Dr. 
James Bridge of the Dana-Capistrano Animal Clinic, a veterinarian who works 
closely with ARF. "Now these people can relinquish the pet to ARF and they will 
foster it. It's an option we didn't have before." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of its phenomenal growth, ARF is progressing toward its goal of 
creating its own permanent animal shelter to serve Dana Point. Earlier this 
month, the Dana Point City Council postponed renewing its annual contract for 
animal services with the county, and city officials are talking with other 
South County cities about the feasibility of a regional, pro-life shelter for 
the area that would be partly staffed by ARF volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years of unsuccessful pleading with Dana Point city officials for 
help and financial backing, ARF finds itself on the other side of the 
bargaining coin. Now it is courted by officials of Mission Viejo and San 
Clemente who seek potential partners to help finance and operate their 
shelters.  
</P>
<P>
 "I really want them here in Mission Viejo," said Cody, whose city opened its 
shelter last October. "It makes perfect sense to me. From the beginning, we 
chose our site because it has expansion possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente city officials have also offered to have ARF become involved with 
its shelter, and Fire Chief Gene Begnell, who runs the shelter, acknowledged 
that a regional approach to animal control makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to see if it's not a better idea to provide animal services on a 
regional basis," Begnell said. "There seems to be an economy of scale and we're 
looking at that." 
</P>
<P>
 Most South County animal activists agree that the county, despite the best 
intentions, does not have the staff to provide service promptly to the area. A 
county study showed only two animal control officers were covering 350 square 
miles from the Tustin Ranch to Rancho Santa Margarita to South County, 
according to Cody. 
</P>
<P>
 "Field service is a tremendously important component of animal control," Cody 
said. "If an animal is in imminent danger, or is down because it has been hit, 
we need an officer there right now, not in 45 minutes. Two officers just cannot 
patrol 350 (square) miles and get where they need to be." 
</P>
<P>
 ARF was started in the first place because of the slow response time and the 
fact that the county shelter was in Orange, about 40 miles from parts of South 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 That distance, plus the county policy of euthanizing animals, were more than 
Rosen and the ARF founders could tolerate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was obvious we needed something closer to home, a local shelter or a 
regional shelter, and it was obvious it was not going to be acted on by the 
city," said Rosen, a seven-year resident of Dana Point. "Without a local 
shelter, animals can be destroyed in three days. So 12 of us got together, 
believing we have such enormously talented people in this community, we have to 
find a way to provide these services." 
</P>
<P>
 The root of ARF's success is the pro-life, humane policy for caring for 
temporarily unwanted or abandoned pets and its unwavering commitment to help 
any animal it takes under its wing, Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are few things that bring us greater joy in life than the unconditional 
love of a pet," said Rosen, a licensed therapist who offers pet loss counseling 
as part of ARF's services. "We come to this mission from a variety of 
backgrounds, but we are absolutely a family when it comes to our cause." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the network of families like the Schurmans that provides the framework 
for ARF's success, Rosen said. The Schurmans and others provide foster homes 
for pets that have been abandoned or given up by their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Volunteers like the Schurmans are our centerpiece, the blood and guts of our 
organization," Rosen said. "These are people who work full time and then come 
home and transfer pets to veterinary clinics or other foster homes. They make 
ARF what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 calls a day come in to ARF volunteers from people who have found or 
lost a pet or who must give up a pet, or from the 21 veterinarians who are 
affiliated with the program. Every Friday, ARF volunteers make up a list of the 
animals that are under their care and seeking homes and then distribute the 
list to area clinics and shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, often elderly pets end up at a temporary home like the Schurmans'. 
Minnie, the deaf and blind cocker spaniel, was destined to be put to sleep, as 
was Curly the cockapoo, who has been with the Schurmans since Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pets under 5 years old are very easy to place. We have a 100% success rate 
with them," said Pat Schurman. "Older ones like Minnie and Lindsey aren't so 
easy. But, really, they aren't so demanding as puppies or kittens, they make 
wonderful companions and they have a lot of love to give. All they are really 
asking is to live out their years."

 Tern Time--It has been a tough breeding season for the endangered California 
least terns at the Bolsa Chica State Ecological Reserve in Huntington Beach, 
where a red fox and an American kestrel have taken a toll on both eggs and 
fledglings, it was reported early in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tern species that nest in the wetlands reserve were not as badly 
affected by the predators, observers have said.In any case, birders can still 
see plenty of adult tern activity at Bolsa Chica now. 
</P>
<P>
 Tern species that nest on two islands in the wetlands, in addition to the 
California least tern, include black skimmers, Caspian terns, elegant terns and 
Forster's terns. The most abundant nesting tern in the reserve is the elegant 
tern; last year, more than 1,800 nesting pairs were recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 The reserve is open to the public during daylight hours. Public tours are 
offered by Amigos de Bolsa Chica on the first Saturday of each month. For 
information, call (714) 897-7003. 
</P>
<P>
 Star News--KNBC weatherman Fritz Coleman will speak Friday night at the 
monthly meeting of Orange County Astronomers about "Astronomy and the Weather." 
The meeting, open to the public, will be held at 7:30 p.m. in the Science Hall 
of Chapman University in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 With a comet's impending collision with Jupiter the big astronomical news this 
month, the astronomers group will set up telescopes at the Orange County Fair 
from 2 to 10 p.m. July 16 and 17. During the day, fair-goers can observe the 
sun, but at night, the scopes will be trained on Jupiter. The club is also 
trying to set up a video link with its big telescope in the desert near Anza.

OCTOBER FIRES TALK OF DAY AT LAGUNA ART FESTIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAIME ABDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The oil and watercolor paintings were carefully mounted on makeshift walls, 
the ceramic mushrooms protruded from the sides of a moss-covered rock display. 
The crowds, heavier than usual, milled about the colorful artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared to be a routine Saturday as the first of the summer art festivals 
got underway in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But much of the talk at the Art-A-Fair and the Sawdust Festival was not about 
the fine ink and watercolor paintings depicting wizards and gnomes or the 
smooth gray-and-white sculpture of a dolphin. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibitors and patrons alike were talking about the fires last fall that 
ravaged the city, the rain and mud that damaged the home of the Pageant of the 
Masters and the quick recovery that allowed the city's biggest tourist 
attraction to open on time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard for visitors not to talk about the fires. They drove into town 
mostly on Laguna Canyon Road, where the charred and denuded hills were just 
outside their car windows. They asked the local artists if the fires came 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I tell them, 'You are sitting in fire central,' " said Scott Sutton, a 
Laguna Beach artist and author whose Art-A-Fair booth was filled with his 
children's books and ink and watercolor paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, curiosity about the fire and rain damage is generating big crowds, 
said Martin Roberts, a spokesman for the Sawdust Festival, which opened 
Thursday. From the grounds, tourists simply look across the street at the 
blackened hills for a constant reminder. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds will get bigger next Friday when the Festival of Arts and the 
Pageant of the Masters open. All four events are next to each other on either 
side of Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "This show has been going nonstop for the past 28 years," Roberts said. "It 
has been through every political and economic change in America, and it 
triumphed over the worst natural disaster to hit Laguna Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, "look around," he said, pointing to the sea of colorful booths 
stocked with everything from musical instruments to children's costumes. "You 
would never know the show was ever threatened by flames." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, while the visitors are talking about the fires, the locals are thinking 
about the catastrophe, said Alice Helcuk, a Laguna Beach resident attending the 
festivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't find any of the locals talking, but you know it is in the back of 
their minds," she said. "No one will ever forget what happened here, but you 
try to move on. And by not always talking about it -- that makes it easier."

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; FOE 
NOMINATES CONROY'S CONVICTED ALLIES AS GOOD CANDIDATES FOR HIS PADDLE

 Paddles 'R Us: The recent success of Assemblyman Mickey Conroy's bill calling 
for the paddling of juvenile graffiti vandals got a rise out of Bob Mulholland, 
the California Democratic Party's hard-nosed campaign adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear Mr. Conroy," Mulholland wrote last Wednesday, a day after the measure 
was approved in the Assembly Public Safety Committee. "If you're concerned 
about crime, why don't you amend your paddling bill (AB 150X) to include your 
friends Pat Nolan and Frank Hill?" He was referring to the Republican 
legislators convicted this year on corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulholland added a postscript: "You could do the paddling yourself in the 
Assembly Chambers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrat said later that much of his dislike for Conroy stems from efforts 
by the Orange Republican to get state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), the 
former Vietnam anti-war activist, thrown out of the Legislature for alleged 
treason. Mulholland was once the political director for Campaign California, a 
grass-roots group formed by Hayden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never liked the guy," Mulholland said of Conroy. "I've never seen the 
guy as anyone with any kind of intelligence to pay attention to. And I'm 
flabbergasted by the idea of Mickey Conroy leading the fight on crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Secret plan: The Conroy team says it was ready to strike back had the Assembly 
Public Safety Committee balked at the paddling bill out of fear that such 
punishment could cause permanent physical damage. The team's secret plan called 
for chief of staff Pete Conaty to step up and offer a paddling demonstration on 
his 15-year-old son, Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have complained that paddling could cause spinal injuries, and we 
wanted to be able, if necessary, to show how nonsensical that was," said Chris 
Manson, a Conroy staffer. Fortunately for Patrick's posterior, the bill got the 
requisite four votes to move forward.

 If you can't stand the heat . . . : Long known for their vitriolic attacks 
against those liberals, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and former 
Fullerton congressman William E. Dannemeyer joined other Republicans from 
across the country in crying foul when Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento) 
criticized the rising influence of the religious "radical right" plank of the 
Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said 
recently that Republicans "are being forced to the fringes by the aggressive 
political tactics of the religious right," and predicted that the GOP would 
suffer a backlash. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan said that "like McCarthyism, Fazioism is defined as personal attacks 
and widely indiscriminate allegations based on unsubstantiated, fear-mongering 
allegations." He backed a resolution that "recognizes constitutional protection 
of religious beliefs and condemns religious bigotry and intolerance." 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer, meanwhile, challenged Fazio to a debate, but predicted that "the 
last thing Vic Fazio or any of those liberals want is to debate me any place, 
any time, on any subject." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Fazio refused to debate. He told Dannemeyer that if the former 
congressman had read his speech on the subject, he would see that he favors 
people "of all religious pursuasions" participating in politics. He said he 
just doesn't like the religious right's agenda, which calls for the abolishment 
of Social Security and the Department of Education, among other things. "It is 
this agenda that the Democratic Party proudly fights to defeat," Fazio said. 
</P>

 Radio voice: Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) was picked by Republican 
congressional leaders and national GOP Chairman Haley Barbour to deliver the 
party's response to President Clinton's weekly radio address that aired 
Saturday. The duty is split between Republican senators and congressmen, so Cox 
said he was proud to be asked to lock horns with Clinton. But he claimed not to 
be nervous about addressing a national audience. "It's radio. You get to read 
(the response)."

 Doling out support: Before his death, former President Richard Nixon was 
scheduled to help raise operating funds for his presidential library in Yorba 
Linda by speaking at a formal dinner. With his passing, Senate Minority Leader 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.) has been asked to be the main speaker at a $2,500-per-person 
tribute dinner this month in honor of Nixon. A library spokesman says it's the 
first fund-raising event specifically for the facility's operating budget, 
which totals about $2.8 million a year and relies on private contributions and 
entrance fees. The library receives no federal funding due to a longstanding 
dispute with Congress following Nixon's resignation from office that made the 
museum ineligible to become part of the National Archives system. UPCOMING 
EVENTS 
</P>
<P>
 * Wednesday: The Orange County Republican Party hosts a "unity" reception with 
local candidates, featuring U.S. Senate candidate Michael Huffington, beginning 
at 4:30 p.m. at the Newport Marriott. Tickets are $5 each. Huffington's 
campaign is co-sponsoring the event. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thursday: The World Affairs Council of Orange County hosts a discussion by 
Orange County congressmen on the topic: "How well -- or badly -- is the U.S. 
doing in world affairs?" The dinner -- $35 for non-members and $25 for members 
-- begins at 7:30 p.m. at the Disneyland Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Saturday: State Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, who is seeking reelection, will 
attend a breakfast meeting at 7:30 a.m. with local Republican officials at the 
Center Club in Costa Mesa. Later, Lungren and Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) will 
participate in a Crime Prevention Summit in La Mirada, beginning at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Saturday: Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) kicks off his reelection 
campaign with a $125-per-person fund-raiser at the Hyatt Regency Irvine, 
beginning at 6:30 p.m. The hosts for the event, called "A Salute to a Fighter," 
are the five other members of the Orange County congressional delegation.

CONCERT AT OAK CANYON RANCH CANCELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A rock concert scheduled for today to benefit the Orangewood Children's Home 
has been canceled, organizers said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 tickets at $8 apiece were sold for the event, which was to 
have been held at Oak Canyon Ranch, near Irvine Lake, said an angry Tony 
Cardullo, who promoted the event for Fountain Valley-based Taurus Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets can be refunded at the point of purchase or held for a rescheduling of 
the event Saturday or July 16 at a site still to be determined, according to 
taped information on the concert hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardullo said he was informed late Friday afternoon by the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department that the event -- which Cardullo described as "alternative 
rock 'n' roll" -- would have to be canceled because he had not acquired the 
proper permits.  
</P>
<P>
 He called the cancellation arbitrary and discriminatory against rock music. 
The ranch carried the permits and has held many concerts without interference, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a cut-and-dried case of discrimination," said Cardullo, 25, a Fountain 
Valley resident. "Oak Canyon has been doing this kind of thing for 11 months. 
Whatever was wrong all of a sudden became wrong because of the style of music. 
If this were a country show, there would be no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. William Francis refuted Cardullo's version of what happened, 
saying the department is not responsible for granting permits. The county Fire 
Department refused to sanction the event and denied the permits, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we are shutting it down. We went out and found there were no 
permits," Francis said. "If county fire is not going to sanction this, we have 
no choice. We don't make up the laws, we just obey them and enforce them." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Fire Department said Saturday he knew nothing of the event 
or the cancellation of the show, billed as "Independent's Day '94."  
</P>
<P>
 The groups slated to play included Standing Hawthorne, Freak Daddy, Jimmy Eat 
World, Egg Beater and One Eye Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not rap, heavy metal or punk, this is alternative music," said 
Cardullo of the more than 30 bands scheduled to play at the event. "It's just 
like the music that drew 17,000 people to Irvine Meadows about three weeks ago 
with no problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardullo said he plans to hold a protest today over the show's cancellation at 
the Sheriff's Department headquarters in Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 Orangewood spokesman Frank Martinez said the home had helped promote the 
concert on radio station KROQ and was expecting a portion of the proceeds, but 
was not involved in sponsoring the event. 
</P>

 NEW NIXON MOVE: Archives at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace will soon 
get a huge jump in size. All the books and papers from Nixon's home and office 
in New Jersey have been crated and are en route to Yorba Linda. . . . But 
library spokesman Kevin Cartwright says reports that it will re-create Nixon's 
home library the way it has the White House Lincoln study are untrue. The idea 
has come up, but there are no specific plans. 
</P>
<P>
 DUBIOUS NIXON? Two months after the Nixon funeral in Yorba Linda, critics are 
back at it. Best-selling author David Halberstam, in the Columbia Journalism 
Review, chastises him for failing to understand the underlying dynamics of the 
Vietnam War. Esquire magazine this month anoints Nixon as "Most Dubious 
Achiever of all." . . . It includes two pages of past Nixon "Dubious 
Achievement" items, with headlines like "Waiter, There's a Bug in My Soup" and 
"Alert! Tricky Dicky on the Loose." 
</P>
<P>
 HE'S CLASSIC: Boyd Coddington is the reason organizers of the three-day, 18th 
Newport Beach Collector Car Auction say it's their biggest yet. The famed 
custom car builder will bring in 19 cars for auction. "Make it unique, and make 
it better than before," Coddington, 48, calls his philosophy. He'd built 100 
hot rods by the time he was 21. . . . The auction, which starts Friday at the 
Hyatt Newporter, will include close to 300 classics and collector cars. 
</P>
<P>
 POLITICAL SIGN? The city Traffic Commission in Orange had recommended against 
flashers on a "Signal Ahead" sign on a steep graded stretch of Canyon View 
Avenue. Research showed only one accident there in three years. But that one 
involved County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose car was broadsided by a 
driver running a red light. And Vasquez joined in with neighbors asking for the 
flashers. . . . The City Council this week ignored the Traffic Commission 
recommendation -- it ordered two amber flashers be put on the sign.

ROLE PLAYERS STEAL SPOTLIGHT; DODGERS: RODRIGUEZ, HANSEN AND GWYNN FUEL 9-3 
VICTORY OVER THE PHILLIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a starless Southern California night, some of the Dodgers' lesser lights 
twinkled brightly through the fog. 
</P>
<P>
 And Henry Rodriguez absolutely glowed. 
</P>
<P>
 With the big power-hitters on the bench, three role players went on a roll 
Saturday night, leading the Dodgers to a 9-3 victory over the depleted 
Philadelphia Phillies before 38,237 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 After an admittedly lifeless shutout loss Friday night, Manager Tom Lasorda 
shook up the lineup -- loading it with left-handers -- and the Dodger offense 
came to life Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza and Eric Karros were given the day off, but with Rodriguez hitting 
line drives all over the park, who needed them? 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez started at first base and batted clean up, hitting a single, double, 
and home run in five at-bats, scoring twice and driving in a career-high five 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Wallach didn't play, but his backup at third base, Dave Hansen, who has 
only one other start this season, singled twice, doubled and figured in three 
Dodger runs. 
</P>
<P>
 And Chris Gwynn, like Hansen used almost solely as a pinch-hitter, stepped 
into the starting left fielder spot with two singles, a walk, and an RBI. 
Overall, the Dodgers had 16 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nice for all of us to get out there," Hansen said. "We sit there on 
the bench and we do the team thing that way. But it was nice to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Starter Tom Candiotti (6-3), staked to a 9-1 lead in the sixth, took it from 
there and delivered a strong complete-game performance. It was his team-leading 
fifth complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti, who gave up 10 hits, struck out seven and walked two, giving up one 
run in the fifth and two in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really got into a groove from the outset, got the knuckleball in the strike 
zone," Candiotti said. "I gave our offense a chance to get going, and that was 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight, the ball was moving for me, it was in the strike zone. That makes it 
an easy day." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory kept the first-place Dodgers 5 1/2 games ahead of the Colorado 
Rockies -- the widest division lead in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies, meanwhile, are playing without injured hitting stars Lenny 
Dykstra, Darren Daulton and Dave Hollins. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably most satisfyingly to Rodriguez, Hansen and Gwynn -- all left-handed 
hitters who rarely get a chance to face left-handed pitchers -- most of their 
damage came against left-handed reliever Andy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomorrow, it's Fernando (Valenzuela, a left-hander)," Rodriguez said. "I may 
play left field, I might not play at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter was pitching in relief of emergency starter Paul Quantrill (2-2), who 
went four innings in place of scheduled starter Shawn Boskie, scratched after 
suffering from dizzy spells Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Dodgers broke open the game with seven combined runs in the fifth and 
sixth innings, Carter was roughed up for six hits and six earned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth, with Delino DeShields on first base, Rodriguez hit a 2-and-1 
pitch from Carter deep into the empty right-field pavilion for his sixth home 
run of the season. That extended the Dodgers' lead to 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen followed the homer with a bloop double barely over the outreached glove 
of shortstop Kevin Stocker, and scored on Gwynn's ground-ball single to right. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a four-run sixth, the Dodgers batted around, with Rodriguez's two-run 
single and Hansen's run-scoring single the key blows. Raul Mondesi also had an 
RBI-single in the inning.

WORLD CUP USA '94 ROUND OF 16; SPAIN NOT TOO FRIENDLY; SOCCER: TEAM GETS FOUR 
YELLOW CARDS AND ONE BIG BREAK TO ROUGH UP SWITZERLAND, 3-0. 
</P>

<P>
 You spend three weeks in America, this is what happens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish soccer team arrived in Chicago on June 10 as a polite group of 
underachievers with the killer instinct of a flamenco dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 They advanced to the World Cup quarterfinals Saturday as a cocky, thuggish 
bunch badly in need of a shave. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland never saw it coming and never stood a chance, falling, 3-0, to 
Spain in a second-round game before 53,121 at RFK Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain advances to a quarterfinal match Saturday in Foxboro, Mass., against the 
winner of the second-round game there between Nigeria and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the Spaniards care who they play. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we play like this, I think we can win everything," defender Jorge Otero 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or how they play. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the World Cup, this is not a friendly," midfielder Jose Maria Bakero 
said. "We do what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Such as, record more fouls (18) than shots (12). 
</P>
<P>
 And receive four yellow cards for bad behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were so rough, Spain's Juan Antonio Goikoetxea and Switzerland's Yvan 
Quentin began tugging at each other and nearly started that rarest of World Cup 
occurrences, the bench-clearing brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 And the game was only in the 18th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Swiss were allowed to collapse at midfield with the final 
whistle, their white pants were covered with grass stains and their faces with 
shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just did not expect this," Swiss defender Alain Geiger said. "We were not 
prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Spain's victory completed one of the best days in that country's sports 
history, which began with Conchita Martinez's victory over Martina Navratilova 
for the Wimbledon women's title and continued with Miguel Indurain's second 
place standing in the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
 But the only way those two events would have compared to the soccer victory is 
if Martinez had thrown her racket at Navratilova and Indurain had thrown tacks 
under his opponents' tires. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, Switzerland was not just tired physically," Otero said, "they 
were tired morally." 
</P>
<P>
 Things were actually even for, oh, 14 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Switzerland's Stephane Chapuisat dribbled down the left side and into the 
penalty area and was headed for a goal . . . when Spain's Miguel Angel Nadal 
tackled him. 
</P>
<P>
 No penalty was called. The Swiss were stunned, and their large group of fans 
began booing and whistling. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all the distraction the Spanish needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Next thing anybody knew, Spain's Fernando Hierro was dribbling through the 
middle of the Swiss side of the field, faking a pass to Sergi Barjuan, keeping 
the ball himself, jumping through three tacklers and kicking the ball into the 
right side of the net from 25 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, in the 15th minute, came exactly eight seconds after the blown 
penalty call. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to rub it in, Barjuan was clearly offside on the play. That was also not 
called. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't notice what happened on their side of the field, because I was busy 
noticing the obvious offside on the other end," Switzerland Coach Roy Hodgson 
said. "That man was clearly offside. The Spanish are not three goals better 
than us." 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to play without star midfielder Alain Sutter, who did not respond to 
pregame treatment for a broken toe, the Swiss were clearly lost on the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help them that, once down, Spain beat on them even harder. In a 
five-minute span after the goal, Spanish players were given three yellow cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Those four cited players will have to play carefully in the next game to avoid 
another yellow card and a suspension from a possible semifinal match. Not that 
the Spaniards were thinking about anything but Switzerland on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our style today was very effective," Spain Coach Javier Clemente said. "They 
could not cope with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor could they cope with Spanish goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, who had one of 
the best games of the tournament with several diving and one-handed saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting recent criticism with sarcasm, Clemente announced, "I hope the 
journalists in Spain conduct a survey tomorrow to see if, indeed, Zubizarreta 
is a good goalkeeper or not." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that sort of biting afternoon. By the time the Spanish scored their 
second goal, in the 74th minute on a 15-foot shot by Luis Enrique Martinez, the 
Swiss were so beaten they allowed Barjuan to move unmolested through the middle 
to give the assist. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain's final goal came after a flurry of near misses, when frustrated Swiss 
goalkeeper Marco Pascolo finally tackled Albert Ferrer in the penalty area. 
Aitor Beguiristain easily converted the penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Even renowned Spanish tenor Placido Domingo was moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing outside his countrymen's locker room, the maker of beautiful music 
shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish there be no fouls allowed in football but, because there are, you do 
what you must do," he said. "After all, this is not a game for little ladies."

WORLD CUP USA '94 ROUND OF 16; GERMANY CLEAN AS A NON-WHISTLE; SOCCER: VOELLER 
SCORES TWICE IN 3-2 VICTORY, BUT LACK OF A CALL HAS BELGIANS CRYING FOUL. 
</P>

<P>
 The foul was obvious, the choice was clear, the world was waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameras had caught the German red-footed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, referee Kurt Rothlisberger, a schoolteacher from Switzerland, did a 
curious thing with a whistle in the 70th minute of Saturday's World Cup game. 
</P>
<P>
 He swallowed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany did not require favors to defeat Belgium, 3-2, before 60,246 at 
Soldier Field. Looking almost ordinary in group play, the Germans came out 
swinging in the round of 16, scoring three goals in the first 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory advances Germany, reigning World Cup champion, to a July 10 
quarterfinal match against the winner of Mexico versus Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's exciting match, unfortunately, will not be best remembered for the 
continued brilliance of forward Juergen Klinsmann, or for the soccer 
resurrection of Rudi Voeller, a 34-year-old striker who scored twice after 
being reunited with Klinsmann on the offensive front. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Germany-Belgium will take its tainted place in the FIFA hall of shame 
because of a critical non-call in the game's defining moment. 
</P>
<P>
 With his team trailing, 3-1, in the 70th minute, Belgium's Georges Grun 
centered a pass in the German penalty area to forward Josip Weber, who split 
two defenders -- Thomas Helmer and Andreas Brehme -- and had a clear shot on 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Weber could get off a shot, Helmer took him down from behind, an 
offense that should have warranted a penalty kick under guidelines FIFA 
outlined before the tournament to protect offensive players. 
</P>
<P>
 Helmer, who earlier in the game had received a yellow card, might have easily 
been red-carded for the "professional foul," which would have left Germany a 
man short for the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rothlisberger stood silent as ballistic Belgians stormed the referee in 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
 How important was the non-call? In the 90th minute, Belgium defender Philippe 
Albert cut the German lead to 3-2 when he drove a shot past goalkeeper Bodo 
Illgner. 
</P>
<P>
 In the frantic final seconds, the Belgians came close to tying the score. The 
Germans missed some chances too, but that was not a topic of discussion later. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Van Himst, the Belgium coach, could not hide his disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Millions of spectators saw what happened," he said of the non-call. "I do 
believe such a decision is a scandal. I don't know what was going on in the 
mind of referee, but if I was in charge the referee would be sent home." 
</P>
<P>
 The Belgium delegation, headed by Roger Vanden Stock, announced it would file 
a letter of protest to FIFA, although most suspect the letter soon will find 
the bottom of a wastebasket. 
</P>
<P>
 "FIFA has told us the rules were going to change," Vanden Stock lamented. 
"Tackles from behind should be punished. We are a victim of these new rules." 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA took a hard line on hard tackles in the first round. For taking down a 
South Korean player in the goal area, Spain's Miguel Nadal received a red-card 
ejection and later was suspended for two games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans, of course, saw the play differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it should not have been a penalty kick," said Helmer, the perpetrator. 
"It was not a foul. I touched him, to bother him a bit. But it was not an 
intentional foul. And that's how the referee saw it." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Berti Vogts, the German coach: "The referee did not whistle, therefore, 
it was not a penalty kick." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy did nothing to undermine the Germans' dominance of the game. 
If not for some spectacular goalkeeping by Michel Preud'homme, Germany might 
have scored six or seven goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The same Germans who wilted in the Texas heat took to a cool summer rain like 
the waters of Lourdes. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of tinkering, the Germans apparently found the bookend to 
complement Klinsmann, who scored his fifth goal of the World Cup in the 11th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer was an old face, Voeller, who was recalled to duty after retiring 
from the national team two years ago. Voeller, who teamed with Klinsmann on the 
1990 championship team, was nothing less than spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave Germany a 1-0 lead in the sixth minute when he took a pass from Lothar 
Matthaeus and fired a shot past a diving Preud'homme. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgium tied the score two minutes later when Georges Grun recovered a headed 
ball in front of the German goal and lofted it over Illgner's head. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Klinsmann and Voeller took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany took the lead for good in the 11th minute, the result of some fancy 
footwork. Klinsmann got the ball rolling when he back-heeled a pass to Voeller, 
who dribbled toward goal and then punched the ball left to a streaking 
Klinsmann, who beat Preud'homme to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 Voeller, who returned to the national team just before the tournament, scored 
again, in the 40th minute, when he headed in Thomas Haessler's corner kick.

NAVRATILOVA IS DEFEATED IN FAREWELL; WIMBLEDON: SURPRISING MARTINEZ SCORES A 
6-4, 3-6, 6-3 VICTORY IN LEGEND'S EMOTIONAL FINAL MATCH IN TOURNAMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 There were tears, of course. A forgotten curtsy to the Duchess of Kent. A 
victory lap around Centre Court for someone who lost. There was a lone British 
voice from the crowd shouting . . . no, pleading, "How 'bout next year, 
Martina?" 
</P>
<P>
 But there will be no return. Martina Navratilova, her storybook career forced 
to do without a happy ending Saturday, could only smile sadly, shake her head 
no and then blow a kiss toward the voice. The Wimbledon championship that 
Navratilova craved, the silver salver that she had hoped to hold above her head 
at match's end, now belongs to Conchita Martinez, who won, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened on a grayish, muggy afternoon that drew royalty -- Princess Diana 
at court's edge, Navratilova at court's center -- to the still air of the All 
England Lawn Tennis Club. And while the audience saw its share of sloppy tennis 
(five double faults and 13 broken serves) it also saw Navratilova, 37, prowling 
the net like the old days and Martinez whacking backhand winners with numbing 
regularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came set point. Navratilova's final backhand of her 22 years at Wimbledon 
landed wide of the line and that was that. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that it mattered Saturday. After all, it might have been Martinez's 
tournament, but it was Navratilova's moment. 
</P>
<P>
 When Navratilova strode across the green carpet to accept her runner-up plaque 
from the Duchess, the crowd stood and applauded for two full minutes. It was 
the least it could do. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 4-seeded Navratilova looked at the small plate (much too small, 
remarked someone later, for a player of her stature) as if it would make a 
swell doorstop, then blew more kisses to the appreciative audience. Standing 
nearby was Martinez, clapping, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Later there was a slow walk around Centre Court and a moment spent to retrieve 
a bouquet tossed at her feet. It was a farewell rarely seen here. Bluebloods 
and commoners alike dabbing their eyes with hankies. The applause rolling from 
green wall to green wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Duchess herself was moved to gentle persuasion. Standing there with 
Navratilova, who has announced her retirement at season's end, the Duchess 
asked if a 1995 Wimbledon playing appearance might not be in order after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova offered a polite no, but did say she might come for a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we'll definitely have tea," said the Duchess. 
</P>
<P>
 Tea, but no tennis. It will have to do. 
</P>
<P>
 So heavy hearted was the occasion that William Crowe, the U.S. ambassador to 
Great Britain, shook Navratilova's hand . . . and began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you crying for?" Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova knew the answer. You don't reach the finals of Wimbledon 12 times, 
win the tournament nine times and flirt with middle age and a 10th title 
without tugging at a few heartstrings, including your own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not crying because I lost," she said, "I'm just crying because it's 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 So it is, but not without a fight. At times it was vintage Navratilova, other 
times the play of a 37-year-old with a case of bad nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Navratilova charged the net and put 22 of 34 shots away for points. 
But she also struggled scoring points with her serve, double faulted away two 
of those three crucial games in the third set and had no answer for Martinez's 
powerful backhand passing shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today she passed me as well as anybody ever has," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the day was full of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3 Martinez, playing in her first Wimbledon and Grand Slam event singles 
championship, supposedly was the one who would collapse from the pressure of 
Centre Court and the weight of nationalism. Not only did she have to beat 
Navratilova, she had to carry the flag for Spain, which had produced only one 
other Wimbledon finalist -- Lili de Alvarez in 1928. De Alvarez lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was Martinez accustomed to the pomp and circumstance of Saturday's final. 
Watching in the royal box was Diana, Princess of Wales; the Duke and Duchess of 
Kent; South Africa Deputy President F.W. De Klerk; the U.S. ambassador; the 
ambassador from Spain; the mayor of London; Jose Ferrer and assorted lords, 
captains and a whole bunch of her majesty's something or others. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez won the first game in four consecutive points. So much for nerves. 
She fought back from deficits of 2-3 and 3-4 to win the set. 
</P>
<P>
 The second set wasn't so wonderful. Down, 3-0, Martinez experienced some 
tightness in her lower back muscles and had to receive treatment. She lost the 
next game, but then stormed back to cut Navratilova's lead to 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova held serve to win the fifth game and broke Martinez's to win the 
sixth and the set. 
</P>
<P>
 On to the third and final set. Surely this would be where Navratilova's 
experience would be the difference. Not quite -- Martinez went up, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova tied the set, 2-2, and served for the next game. As she readied 
herself for the toss, someone from the crowd yelled, "C'mon, Martina." It 
wasn't a cry of encouragement as much as it was a command, as in, "Hurry up and 
win this thing, will you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova double faulted away the game. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Martinez took control. A backhand winner gave her a 5-3 lead. 
Navratilova's floating backhand that kept going and going . . . wide! . . . 
gave her the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a really good player," Martinez said of the legend, "and my feelings 
are -- you know, she did great to get into the finals and play so relaxed and 
I'm really sorry to beat her. But I'm really pleased that I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova and Martinez hugged after the match. That's when Navratilova saw 
part of herself in the 22-year-old Spaniard. She saw memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember how that first one felt," she said. "It's such a pure feeling, 
that first time. So I hope she can feel it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova had it all wrong. Years from now, if Martinez is really lucky, she 
will have a day like Navratilova's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel this place in my bones," Navratilova said. "I feel all those champions 
out there, dead and alive, when I'm out there. There's no place like it."

LANGSTON ENDS ANGEL LANGUISHING FOR NOW; BASEBALL: ROOKIE CATCHER DALESANDRO 
AND SALMON HELP TO STOP A FOUR-GAME SKID AND FRUSTRATION IN 1-0 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Langston solemnly watched the first half of the Angels' season unfold, 
camouflaging his frustration while suppressing his anger. 
</P>
<P>
 He has never played on a winning team in his 10-year career, but he believed 
this year would be different. The Angels promised the rebuilding was over, and 
this would be the year they crossed the threshold into contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of us thought it would turn out like this," Langston said. 
"It's been very, very frustrating for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 So Langston took it upon himself Saturday evening to change the Angels' fate, 
pitching a 1-0 shutout over the Baltimore Orioles before 47,154 at Camden 
Yards. The victory ended the Angels' four-game losing streak and produced only 
their 11th victory in the last 32 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are saying we're fortunate to be in this division," Langston said. 
"But unless we start playing good ball, we're going to be so far out -- even in 
this division -- it's going to be tough to get back in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels may be only four games out of first place in the American League 
West, but when you're 34-47 at the season's midpoint and are on pace to finish 
with the second-worst record in franchise history, it's a little silly to be 
talking about a pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the most disappointing first half since I've been here," Angel 
President Richard Brown said. "I thought we'd be contending, but with a record 
far better than the one we have now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as if this team is not capable, the talent is there, but right now 
we're underachieving. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (the front office) can't hit, run and throw, but whenever you see failure, 
it has to be shared by all." 
</P>
<P>
 Embarrassed? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we all are," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said. "We all expected 
more. If we didn't, we'd be a group of losers." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, for at least one night, Langston (5-4) greatly eased the Angels' 
frustrations. He yielded only three hits, and retired the final 16 batters he 
faced. The only Oriole baserunner to reach second base occurred in the fourth 
inning when shortstop Gary DiSarcina booted a two-out grounder by Jeffrey 
Hammonds. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the last Oriole to reach base. Langston pitched his first shutout 
since June 17, 1992, spanning 66 starts, and it was his first complete-game 
victory since April 28, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it funny how this game is?" Oriole Manager Johnny Oates said. "Last 
night, they couldn't get a guy out. And tonight, we couldn't get a guy to 
third." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it was crazy. Only 24 hours after the two teams combined for 11 home 
runs -- equaling a major league record -- Angel rookie catcher Mark Dalesandro 
produced the game's only extra-base hit with a fifth-inning double. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalesandro wasn't even supposed to play. He was at his usual spot on the bench 
when catcher Greg Myers bruised his thumb in the first inning. Veteran Andy 
Allanson, who was just called up Tuesday, discovered during batting practice 
that he had a broken right index finger. He'll go on the disabled list and 
probably will be replaced by Chris Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 That left Dalesandro, who only began catching professionally last season, and 
never had even caught Langston in warm-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? The kid produced his first major league hit, scored the 
game-winning run and caught a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, it was an honor," Dalesandro said. "This is a night I'll remember 
as long as I live." 
</P>
<P>
 While Langston was stopping the Orioles and their 17-game homer streak, the 
looming question once again was whether the Angels could score. 
</P>
<P>
 Oriole starter Ben McDonald was matching Langston pitch for pitch until the 
eighth. He then made the crucial mistake of walking Dalesandro, and two outs 
later, he was standing at third with Tim Salmon at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, who hit two home runs Friday, became the offensive hero with a mere 
broken-bat single that dropped into shallow center field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take the broken-bat any time," Salmon said. "It's no secret I was very 
lucky on that one. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, hey, with the way things have been going for us, we'll take it."

SLEW OF DAMASCUS MAKES CLAIM TO FAME; HORSE RACING: GELDING WHO ONCE COULD HAVE 
BEEN PURCHASED FOR $16,000 WINS THE HOLLYWOOD GOLD CUP AS FAVORED THE WICKED 
NORTH FADES BADLY. 
</P>

<P>
 A one-time claimer of the year beat a potential horse of the year Saturday 
when Slew Of Damascus won the $750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup while The Wicked 
North, the 3-5 favorite, struggled home fourth in a five-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 Slew Of Damascus had never won a major race, never won at 1 1/4 miles and lost 
to The Wicked North at Hollywood Park a month ago. But Slew Of Damascus went to 
the front this time under Gary Stevens, who got the mount when Corey Nakatani 
switched to ride Fanmore, and outran Nakatani's horse through the stretch for a 
three-quarter-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Fanmore, running on dirt for the first time, finished a half-length ahead of 
Del Mar Dennis, and it was another 7 1/2 lengths back to a punchless The Wicked 
North, who dropped out of contention with a half-mile left. Arcangues, winner 
of last year's Breeders' Cup Classic, finished last in the smallest field for 
the stake since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Paying $18 as the third betting choice, Slew Of Damascus capped an incredible 
run for his owners, Victor Naccarato and his cousins, Edris Harbeston and 
George Losh, all of Yakima, Wash. They paid $1,500 apiece to buy the 
Tennessee-bred at an auction in Arkansas in 1990, and the son of Slewacide and 
Damascus Isle has now earned $996,550 after Saturday's $412,500 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Slew of Damascus, a 6-year-old gelding, has 14 victories, four seconds and 
four thirds in 31 starts. "By rights, a horse this age can't be dancing all the 
dances," said his trainer, Bay Meadows-based Craig Roberts. "But he's still 
dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in his career, Slew Of Damascus ran for claiming prices as low as 
$16,000, and as recently as March 7, 1993, he could have been bought out of a 
race at Golden Gate Fields for $32,000. He won that day by seven lengths, 
clinching claimer-of-the-year honors, and hasn't run for a claiming price 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 A $10,000 yearling, The Wicked North has also been an over-achiever, and he 
was a leading horse-of-the-year candidate before Saturday, having finished 
first in four consecutive stakes, including a disqualification for interference 
in the Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux might have been beaming after some of The Wicked North's 
workouts since his victory in the Californian on June 5, but he was not a 
confident jockey going into the Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not shocked," Desormeaux said after the race. "The past couple of weeks, 
he hasn't been 100%. He was not himself in one of the works. He might have 
turned in a pretty number (time), but it wasn't pretty if you had to make him 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Going down the backstretch, with Fanmore running closely behind Slew Of 
Damascus, Desormeaux had The Wicked North a close third on the outside, 
seemingly in a perfect spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "He emptied out," Desormeaux said. "I think I was empty when we got in the 
gate. I mean, the horse was tired. At the half-mile pole, I knew it was over. 
Give him a little rest, and I think he'll be the one to beat again." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the race's handicap conditions, Slew Of Damascus carried 117 pounds, 
five less than the high-weighted The Wicked North and Arcangues. Slew of 
Damascus' time of 2:00 3/5 was the slowest for a Gold Cup winner since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to knock the other horses, but if you had a horse that was 
healthy, this was the kind of a race you'd want to run in," Roberts, 59, said 
after his biggest victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Slew Of Damascus got an unexpected breather in February after he broke through 
the starting gate before the San Antonio Handicap at Santa Anita. He ran off, 
was scratched by the stewards and suffered a torn right front hoof. Idle for 
about a month, he couldn't run in the race Roberts was pointing for, the Santa 
Anita Handicap, but returned to action in April with a sharp victory on grass 
at Golden Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Slew Of Damascus had been wearing a bar shoe to protect the hoof, but he 
worked a fast five furlongs at Bay Meadows on Tuesday without the special shoe. 
Then Roberts, borrowing a strategy that might have started with trainer Charlie 
Whittingham, an eight-time winner of the Gold Cup, saddled Slew Of Damascus in 
the tunnel, away from the other horses in the paddock. Before Slew Of Damascus 
won the Native Diver Handicap at Hollywood in December, he kicked his trainer 
in the paddock, causing a grapefruit-sized swelling in Roberts' right thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got over that in a hurry," Roberts said Saturday. "And today I don't feel 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens had ridden frequently for Roberts when they were among the leading 
horsemen at Longacres in suburban Seattle in the 1970s. When Nakatani, who rode 
Slew Of Damascus to a third-place finish in the Californian before winning the 
Native Diver with Roberts' horse, told the trainer that he was riding Fanmore 
out of a loyalty to trainer Bobby Frankel, Roberts hired Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens' previous Gold Cup winner, Cutlass Reality in 1988, was also a 
6-year-old. "This is a very intelligent horse," the jockey said of Slew Of 
Damascus. "At the sixteenth pole, he gave me another burst. Then he kept 
stretching his neck out. He wouldn't let go." 
</P>
<P>
 Slew Of Damascus' next start is expected to be the Del Mar Classic, a 
$1-million race, on Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse may have run his last race at Bay Meadows," Craig Roberts said.

<P>
 South African Simon Hobday, still on a record pace, has a three-shot lead in 
the U.S. Senior Open at Pinehurst, N.C., which once again was delayed by a 
storm Saturday and suspended overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobday was 13 under par with five holes to play in the third round when 
darkness halted play on the rain-soaked No. 2 course at the Pinehurst Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobday, who tied the Senior Open 36-hole scoring record of 133, is in sight of 
the 54-hole Senior Open scoring record of nine-under 204. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm playing better than I know how," Hobday said. "I don't even want to talk 
about it. It might go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Albus, playing in the same threesome with Hobday, was 10 under for the 
tournament through 13 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two and 16 others -- including most of the leaders -- marked their 
positions and will finish the third round today, and weather permitting, the 
final round will be played in the afternoon. 
</P>

<P>
 Greg Kraft, a third-year player who ranks 169th on the money list, shot a 
four-under-par 68 to grab a one-stroke lead over Jeff Sluman and defending 
champion Nick Price after three rounds of the Motorola Western Open at Lemont, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 With an 11-under-par 205 total after 54 holes, Kraft enters the final round as 
the leader for the third time in his brief career. 
</P>
<P>
 Price shot even-par 72 over the Dubsdread course at the Cog Hill Golf and 
Country Club. He is at 206. Sluman turned in a 69, capping his round with 
birdies on the last two holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Three strokes back at 208 were Jim Gallagher, tying Kraft for the day's best 
round of 68, Fred Couples with a 69 and Bill Glasson with a 72. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Alicia Dibos of Peru shot a four-under-par 68 and held the lead in the 
rain-interrupted second round of the Youngstown-Warren LPGA Classic at 
Youngstown, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 65 of the 131 players managed to complete the second round, which was 
suspended after a four-hour rain delay. Of the early starters who finished the 
second round, Dibos held a one-shot lead at three-under 141. Barb Bunkowsky 
matched Dibos' 68 and was at 142.

 Kim Williams, a professional golfer on the LPGA tour, was shot in the neck 
Saturday night as she approached a store in Niles, Ohio, apparently the victim 
of a drive-by shooting, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 31, was shot about 9 p.m. while walking in the parking lot toward a 
discount store to buy baby oil, which she uses as a rust preventive for her 
putter, a hospital spokesman said. She was listed in fair condition. Williams 
was competing in the LPGA Youngstown-Warren Classic and had a one-under par 71 
in Friday's first round. She didn't complete Saturday's round because of rain.

 Orlin Norris retained his World Boxing Assn. cruiserweight title when he 
stopped No. 1 contender Arthur Williams in the third round in Las Vegas. Norris 
(41-3 with 23 knockouts) landed three uncontested right hands in the third. The 
last knocked Williams (21-3-1, 16 knockouts) down at 1:08, prompting referee 
Richard Steele to stop the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the card, Wilfredo Vazquez (41-6-3, 33 knockouts) retained his WBA 
junior-featherweight title when he stopped Jae-Won Choi (18-1) of South Korea

 Nigel Mansell, who today will drive in his first Formula One event since 
winning the title in 1992, went from seventh position in Friday's provisional 
qualifying to first, but had to settle for the outside of the front row for the 
French Grand Prix when Williams-Renault teammate Damon Hill won the pole from 
him with five minutes left in the time trials. Hill averaged 124.656 m.p.h. on 
the 2.461-mile track.

track record of 113.845 set last year by Bobby Dotter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Sauter scored the first major victory of his stock car racing career by 
winning the Milwaukee 100. . . . Chip Hanauer was the top qualifier with an

waiting to get autographs with anyone remotely connected with the event, even a

 "Hey, he's in the way of my shot," says Debbie Luciano, looking chagrined when 
a television cameraman blocked her view. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Danny, explained the problem. "We want picture of the big guy," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup is in town, right? The Lucianos, passing through from Phoenix, 
weren't about to waste so much time and not get a picture of the star of the 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Danny Luciano: "The big guy -- Robert Shapiro." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 15 miles away from the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, the World Cup does not 
exist in Los Angeles. At least not at the Downtown Criminal Courts Building, 
scene of the O.J. Simpson hearing, where his attorney, Shapiro, has apparently 
become something of a celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way these spectators would be interested in Romario, Hagi or Baggio 
is if any of the three offered up commentary on Court TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're aware of (the World Cup)," said Danny Luciano. "But we're aware of a 
lot of things. It's boring on TV. TV doesn't do it justice. You've got to be 
there in person." 
</P>

 Apparently the same is true for trials.

 A security woman snapped a picture of visiting tourists and said she would 
speak to a reporter, but only if her name was not used.

 "I'm glad Colombia's out, even though I'm from Panama," she said. "So far they 
(the Americans) have gone a lot farther than I thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Has she heard anyone discussing the World Cup outside the courthouse?

 "No," she said. "The only thing these people ask is: 'Where's O.J.? Can we see

 Cliff Chard, the manager of Adventures Unlimited, a bookstore and news stand 
in Long Beach's Belmont Shore, was running the gamut of emotion Saturday in the 
aftermath of Andres Escobar's shooting death in Medellin, Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, there was a message-board sign in the store's window, questioning 
what would be worse: Colombian players "facing your coke- and death-dealing 
sponsors when you get back home" or the Knicks' John Starks having to deal with 
the New York media after losing to Houston in the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was mortified," Chard told columnist Chuck Culpepper of the Lexington 
Herald-Leader on Saturday. "I am, for better or worse, the author of that sign. 
I was mortified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I didn't feel responsible, but I felt really bad about it. 
Obviously, it was tongue-in-cheek, and to have the reality happen was just 
really sad." 
</P>
<P>
 A friend of Chard's from Colombia chided him after learning about the message

 The biggest problem for Belgium was helping its fans get to Chicago for its 
game Saturday against Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10,000 Belgian fans were in South Florida, expecting to stay for a 
Belgium-Ireland match Tuesday. However, Belgium's 1-0 loss to Saudi Arabia on 
Wednesday sent the Belgians to Chicago instead. Scheduled flights out of 
Orlando simply couldn't accommodate the hordes of followers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If 500 fans from Belgium are in Chicago, that would be a success," said Roger 
van den Stock, an official of the Belgian Football Assn. before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 3-2 loss to Germany, the Belgians can go home. HELENE ELLIOTT

 Each of Saudi Arabia's 22 players will get a souvenir of today's game against 
Sweden: a new Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless of the result Sunday, I will give each player a car," Saudi 
businessman Wafaa Zawawi told the Swedish newspaper Idag after visiting Volvo 
headquarters in Goteborg, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 His gift is worth about $650,000 and might require some garage expansions in 
Saudi Arabia, where each player received a Mercedes after the team clinched a 
berth in the World Cup.

 Swiss fans Kelly Kubisiak and Darrly Chesley from Virginia won smiles wherever 
they went at RFK Stadium on Saturday.Kubisiak was the one wearing the 
4-foot-long hat that looked like a large piece of well-known yellow cheese. 
Chesley's had the red knife with its trademark gray cross. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought of hats with chocolate, a cow and a dollar bill. And we actually 
tried one that looked like a watch -- but it was slow," Chesley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither man has spent time in Switzerland. 
</P>

 "The Swiss happen to be playing in the only game we could get tickets for," 
said Kubisiak, the hat maker. Construction time: "about one case of beer."

 Belgium came as close to the last-ditch hockey strategy of pulling its goalie 
as you will ever see in soccer when its goalkeeper, Michel Preud'homme, left 
the net to join his team's comeback cause late in the second half of Saturday's 
game against Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 With Belgium trailing, 3-2, Preud'homme sprinted downfield to take part in the 
offense at the German end. He nearly made head contact with a corner kick 
delivered by teammate Josip Weber.

<P>
 "I had nothing to lose," Preud'homme said. "If I can help the team tie the 
game, 3-3, then we can go to extra time. That was my intention." CHRIS DUFRESNE

 Fears that rowdiness might mar the World Cup festivities in Orlando have 
proved groundless, and Ireland's Charlton hopes the peace remains unbroken. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Orlando Sentinel, there were more incidents of petty theft 
and violence in the two weeks preceding the tournament than in the first two 
weeks the event brought thousands of tourists to town.So far, the worst 
incidents have involved bar patrons who refused to leave at closing time. 
</P>
<P>
 However, fears of hooliganism have been rekindled because Monday's game 
between Ireland and Holland matches teams whose followings are among the 
largest -- and most outgoing -- of any World Cup entrant. Charlton expects the 
rivalry to stay on the field and not carry over into the streets of Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what the result, the Irish and the Dutch have always gotten on very 
well. I'm sure whatever the result Monday, they'll both have a party and sing 
songs," he said. HELENE ELLIOTT

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; PIAZZA'S START IS AMONG THE ELITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a season of numbing numbers, Mike Piazza rolls on, continuing to bury the 
sophomore jinx. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of it can be gauged by tape measure, but there is this remarkable 
yardstick as well: 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding his September call-up in 1992, Piazza began the weekend series 
against the Philadelphia Phillies having produced 271 hits, 54 home runs and 
184 runs batted in during his first 1 1/2 seasons in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those figures surpass the totals compiled by each of the 11 Hall of Fame 
catchers during their first two years in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the Dodger catcher is half a season ahead of baseball's most honored 
catchers -- although he could lose some of that edge if there's a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the two-season statistics of Johnny Bench, Yogi Berra and Roy Campanella 
really compare to Piazza's 1 1/2-season statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Bench had 41 home runs, 172 RBIs and 311 hits in 1968 and '69. Berra had 34 
homers, 189 RBIs and 258 hits in 1948-49. Campanella had 53 homers, 171 RBIs 
and 248 hits in 1949-50. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza, before the Philadelphia series, had already hit 28 more homers than 
Hall of Fame catcher Roger Bresnahan totaled in his 17-year career and 43 more 
than Hall of Fame catcher Ray Schalk in his 18-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's flattering, but I'm not concerned about comparisons," Piazza said. "I 
don't believe in setting goals or following my numbers during the course of a 
season. I think you can get caught up thinking, 'I'm ahead or behind where I 
should be, I'm above or below my level.' And either way that's not good." 
</P>
<P>
 Not good? 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike is the best right-handed hitter in the league right now," Dodger hitting 
coach Reggie Smith said. "He has so much strength and power that he makes his 
own holes. I mean, what does he have already . . . 19 homers, 72 RBIs. Most 
catchers would be happy to have those numbers at the end of the year. Combine 
that with his average (.337 through Friday night), and you're talking about 
something you'd look for from a five-tool player, someone with the ability to 
run and who doesn't face the demands of catching." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza appeared in 149 games as National League rookie of the year last 
season, which he remembers only as a blur. He is headed for another 140-plus 
appearances but is more relaxed, more settled into the major league routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Familiarity, Piazza and Smith both believe, will continue to make him an even 
better hitter, but the challenges and expectations will rise along with that. 
</P>
<P>
 "How long can he keep it up? As long as he's healthy," Smith said. "People 
say, 'Wow, what will he do when he knows the pitchers and the league?' You have 
to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any hitter really knows himself or the league until he's had 
1,500 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike literally believes he can hit every pitch and every pitcher every time 
up there. You want him to believe that, but he's so intense and gets so upset 
at times when he makes an out, that he also has to learn to temper and control 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has to be able to leave the batter's box and put on the catcher's gear." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza has shown the ability to do that, but how much longer will it be 
required? The Dodgers wince every time he's in a collision at the plate, and 
the suspicion lingers that he eventually will move to another position -- first 
base, perhaps. They have drafted a high school catcher in the first or 
compensation rounds of two of the last three drafts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't worry about it until it's presented to me," Piazza said of a possible 
move. "I enjoy catching, and the reason I don't like the idea of moving is that 
I've put so much work into improving and still have more to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, catcher Piazza will start for the National League in the 
All-Star game, his statistics even more impressive considering he was batting 
.086 with one home run before the second weekend of the season, when he went 
seven for 13 in Pittsburgh, all singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I'm most proud of is what I did in that series," Piazza said. "I 
learned I could adjust, cut down on my swing, try to hit singles to center 
field. It was a turning point. That series served to kick-start the season for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't hurt that Tim Wallach was moved behind Piazza in the batting order 
and went on a tear. Nor has it hurt that Piazza, unlike Bresnahan or Schalk or 
some of the other Hall of Fame catchers, has been able to face 
expansion-diluted pitching in a livelier-ball era, but that's not to diminish 
the remarkable early steps that the 62nd-round draft choice has taken toward 
joining them in Cooperstown. BALLOT BOX 
</P>
<P>
 All-Star teams will be announced on NBC this afternoon. Starters again were 
selected by fans in a popularity process that normally has little to do with 
the performances of that season. According to the tabulations announced this 
week, and which probably have not produced a change in leaders since, voters 
seem to have paid attention in the American League but not the National. 
</P>
<P>
 The American League leaders were Frank Thomas at first base, Roberto Alomar at 
second, Cal Ripken Jr. at shortstop, Wade Boggs at third, Ivan Rodriguez at 
catcher and Ken Griffey Jr., Kirby Puckett and Joe Carter in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two arguments: Chuck Knoblauch over Alomar at second and Albert Belle 
over Carter in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The National League leaders were Gregg Jefferies at first base, Mariano Duncan 
at second, Ozzie Smith at shortstop, Matt Williams at third base, Piazza at 
catcher and Barry Bonds, Lenny Dykstra and Roberto Kelly in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The way it should be: Jeff Bagwell at first base, Bret Boone at second, Barry 
Larkin at short, Williams at third (but only narrowly over Wallach), Piazza at 
catcher and Moises Alou, Dante Bichette and Tony Gwynn in the outfield, with 
apologies to Marquis Grissom, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 * BEAT GOES ON: Cal Ripken Jr., facing the Angels this weekend, has drawn 
within 152 games of Lou Gehrig's consecutive-games record of 2,130. The 
Baltimore Oriole shortstop is enjoying another big season: .308 average, 57 
RBIs, 11 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is writing to tell me he's killing us by playing every day," Manager 
John Oates said. "Nobody is telling me I have to give him a day off. I used to 
get 10 letters a day and I could always tell which ones they were. No name. No 
return address. It's funny, but they stopped writing." CAP RAP 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney's for the owners' Player Relations Committee spent much of the week 
trying to walk officials of the players' union through the 27-page, 
single-spaced, salary-cap proposal presented by the owners two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no walk in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't feel any better about it," said Lauren Rich, the union's assistant 
general counsel. "There are specific areas of grave concern, but we'll discuss 
those with the PRC next week." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, she said, there are three fundamental issues that trouble the 
union about the cap. The union says: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It hurts, rather than helps, competitive balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It inhibits a general manager's flexibility," Rich said. "A GM won't be 
permitted to make decisions based on field considerations. Those decisions will 
be made by accountants using salary as the determination. It will affect clubs 
at both ends of the cap." 
</P>
<P>
 -- It destroys free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we understand it, 12 to 14 clubs would have been above the cap this year," 
she said. "That means the free-agent market would have been cut in half, and 
how many of the remaining clubs would have actively pursued a free agent?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- It inhibits the growth of revenue by guaranteeing a profit to the clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are guaranteed a profit, how hard do you work to increase it?" Rich 
asked. "It removes the competitive drive and increases the incentive for clubs 
with allied businesses (such as radio-TV) to hide revenue by shifting it to 
those businesses. Every dollar that's hidden represents a saving (to the club) 
of 50 cents (the players' share under the 50-50 split of the owners' 
proposal)." 
</P>
<P>
 The union, of course, has other concerns. A cap, in general, restricts 
salaries, the union believes, and this proposal would lower the percentage the 
players now receive for compensation from 58% to 50% of industry revenue. It 
also would eliminate arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 The union will present its own proposals within the next two weeks. They are 
generally designed to preserve the status quo and will be filed in the nearest 
waste basket if the owners, as they insist, are genuinely united in support of 
a cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged unity will be tested when the union sets a strike date -- its only 
leverage against the owners declaring an impasse and unilaterally imposing a 
salary-cap system. That date is expected to be between Aug. 16 and Sept. 30, 
threatening the owners' postseason TV revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is now unlikely that a date will be set at a meeting of the 
union's executive board July 11, the day before the All-Star game. Rich said 
the union might not have presented its proposals to the owners by then. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we have, they will not have had time to react," she said.

 * AGELESS: Fernando Valenzuela returns to the Dodger Stadium mound today at 
33. An alleged 33. Charlie Hough, who was sold by the Dodgers to the Texas 
Rangers about a month before Valenzuela made his debut in 1980, doesn't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean he was 19 when he broke in, and he could throw one of these?" the 
46-year-old Hough said, pretending to throw a screwball. "Plus he had 
outstanding command and a great pickoff? 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty-three? Sure, he broke in the majors when he was 11 after 10 years in 
the Mexican League." 
</P>
<P>
 * ADD FERNANDO: Why the Phillies move? Four pitchers who opened the season in 
their rotation -- Curt Schilling, Tommy Greene, Ben Rivera and Jeff Juden -- 
are on the disabled list; General Manager Lee Thomas was unable to make a trade 
at a time when it is difficult to trade for pitching and difficult to trade, 
period, because of the strike threat; and Tyler Greene, their No. 1 draft 
choice from Wichita State in 1991, continues to disappoint. He was 6-10 in 
triple-A last year and was 2-9 there this year when Valenzuela was signed. 
</P>
<P>
 * BACK TO THE FUTURE: Ryne Sandberg, who lives in the Phoenix area, said in a 
Chicago Tribune interview he will not play again but wouldn't rule out joining 
a Phoenix expansion franchise in some front-office or field capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 He conceded the instability of the Chicago Cub organization was a major factor 
in his premature retirement. Sandberg played for 13 managers, counting interim 
skippers, in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs had only their third winning season in the last two decades under Jim 
Lefebvre in 1993, but Lefebvre was fired by General Manager Larry Himes and 
replaced by Tom Trebelhorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played hard at the end of last season," Sandberg said. "We supported 
Lefebvre and finished with the third-best record since I've been with the Cubs. 
And for what? In the last few years I could see the way things were going, and 
it didn't look good." 
</P>
<P>
 * BAD PITCH: The Texas Rangers continue to lead the American League Worst 
despite the worst earned-run average in the league, almost 5.7. The Rangers, 
through Thursday, had given up 818 hits in 693 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 They moved to ensure that pattern by signing former Dodger Tim Leary, who was 
released by the Seattle Mariners last year after giving up 202 hits in 169 1/3 
innings and quit the Montreal Expos' triple-A affiliate June 4 because he was 
not promoted to the majors with a 2-4 record, 5.40 ERA and a yield of 70 hits 
in 50 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Texas pitching coach Claude Osteen: "The type statistics we're putting up 
are mind-boggling. I've never faced this in my entire career as a pitching 
coach."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; HERSHISER GIDDY ABOUT FACING FERNANDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orel Hershiser, one of the few Dodgers remaining from when Fernando Valenzuela 
last pitched at Dodger Stadium, said Saturday he is eagerly looking forward to 
pitching against Valenzuela in their sold-out matchup today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a fun game to play," Hershiser said."I think it's going to 
be a mix of emotions and sentiment because it's Fernando out there, and 
competition, because it's a big league game. 
</P>
<P>
 "But no matter what, it's going to be a lot of fun. Whether we win or lose, 
I'm sure it'll be a game we'll all remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, signed by the Philadelphia Phillies last week, last pitched for 
the Dodgers at the end of the 1990 season. He was released before the 1991 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda agreed it seemed fitting that it would be Hershiser 
who faced Valenzuela and said it would be impossible to watch Valenzuela pitch 
today without remembering the mania that surrounded him in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be interesting to watch him," Lasorda said. "How can you forget 
it? The guy was exciting, the guy was a winner. He set the baseball world on 
fire." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia's scheduled starter, right-hander Shawn Boskie, was a late 
scratch Saturday after suffering from dizziness caused by a viral infection. He 
was replaced by right-hander Paul Quantrill. . . . Catcher Mike Piazza was 
rested, replaced by Carlos Hernandez. TIM KAWAKAMI

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; STRUGGLING MAGRANE DEMOTED TO BULLPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, publicly conceding for the first time that signing starter Joe 
Magrane to a lucrative contract was a mistake, swallowed their pride Saturday 
and demoted him to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who provided Magrane a contract last September that will guarantee 
him $3 million and can be worth as much as $9.3 million over three years, made 
the decision after Magrane yielded six hits and seven runs (four earned) in 2 
1/3 innings Friday in their 14-7 defeat to the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane, who has pitched only four times in relief in his seven-year career, 
will pitch in long relief. Russ Springer (2-1, 6.75 earned-run average) 
replaces him in the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane, 2-5 with a 6.64 ERA, has pitched longer than six innings in only 
three of his 11 starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Most troubling to Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann is that in Magrane's last 
five starts, he yielded 52 baserunners in 27 2/3 innings, including eight home 
runs. Thus, Magrane becomes the first official casualty of Friday night's 
home-run barrage, in which the two teams combined for 11, tying a major league 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not happy about it," Magrane said, "I'm not happy at all. But I'm not 
going sit here and bitch and moan. I'm going to keep busting my butt to get 
this right. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds weird to be talking about it, but we are in a pennant race, and 
it's not fair to the team to keep me in there." 
</P>
<P>
 The demotion will have a severe impact on Magrane's future earnings because it 
now will be nearly impossible for him to make 20 starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
 If he reached 20 starts, the Angels would be required to pay him a $500,000 
bonus this year and increase his base pay from $1.5 million to $2.5 million in 
1995. He also would receive $100,000 for every start beginning with his 20th. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it crosses my mind," Magrane said. "I make no bones about it. My 
contract is structured to start games, but the way I've been performing, I 
wouldn't have been comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contract was made in good faith, and it continues to be. I'm not going to 
file a grievance, or anything like that. I made my own bed, now I have to sleep 
in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi: "There's not a contract on the club 
that we weren't prepared to handle. That really didn't play in it. The reasons 
for making the move were purely performance and trying to win some games." BOB

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJOR LEAGUES; RANGERS SIGN LEARY, ACTIVATE 
PAVLIK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Texas Rangers signed veteran right-hander Tim Leary and activated 
left-hander Roger Pavlik from the 15-day disabled list.  
</P>
<P>
 Leary, 35, worked out for the Rangers on Wednesday in Minneapolis, and the 
club was impressed enough to offer him a contract.He has a career record of 
77-104 in 286 games with six teams. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, he was 2-4 with a 5.40 ERA in nine games for triple-A Ottawa of 
the American Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavlik, meanwhile, started Saturday night against the Detroit Tigers, getting 
the loss after giving up four runs in the first inning. It was his first start 
since June 11. 
</P>
<P>
 He was initially put on the disabled list after straining a muscle in the back 
of his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 To make room for Leary and Pavlik, the team put infielder Doug Strange on the 
15-day disabled list with a sore right knee and optioned left-handed pitcher 
Dan Smith to triple-A Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
 Strange was batting .214 with four home runs and 21 RBIs in 57 games. Smith 
was 1-2 with a 4.09 ERA in 11 relief appearances since he was called up from 
Oklahoma City on June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City first baseman Wally Joyner was put on the 15-day disabled list, 
retroactive to June 26, because of a strained left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner injured the shoulder diving for a ball in Yankee Stadium June 3 and has 
aggravated it several times since.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; EXPOS HOLD OFF GIANTS AS HILL WINS NO. 12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five Montreal home runs almost weren't enough to hold off the San Francisco 
Giants on a day when the ball was jumping out of Candlestick Park and the Expos 
were involved in yet another brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenny Webster's three-run shot in the seventh inning was the biggest blow, but 
Montreal needed John Wetteland's 1 2/3 innings of relief to seal a 10-9 victory 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wil Cordero, Mike Lansing, Sean Berry and Moises Alou also homered to help Ken 
Hill become the National League's first 12-game winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The homers, however, were almost lost in the scuffle after an eighth-inning 
brawl that resulted in the ejection of Expo reliever Mel Rojas and Giant 
bullpen coach Bob Brenly. One pitch after John Patterson made the score 10-8 
with a two-run homer, Rojas hit Barry Bonds with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds walked slowly toward the mound, yelling at Rojas. Brenly then blindsided 
the Expo pitcher as both dugouts emptied. Order was quickly restored, but not 
before Rojas punched Brenly in the face, cutting his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 5, Florida 0 -- Greg Maddux pitched seven shutout innings and Fred 
McGriff homered and drove in two runs, lifting the Braves to victory at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux (11-4), who lost his previous two decisions, gave up four hits as his 
earned-run average fell to 1.79. He threw only 85 pitches and only one Marlin 
reached third base. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff's 21st homer, against Terry Mathews (1-1), gave the Braves the lead in 
the second inning. McGriff, who went three for four, is eight for 14 in the 
series with two home runs, three RBIs and four runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 8, Pittsburgh 2 -- Reggie Sanders and Tony Fernandez had four hits 
each and Cincinnati continued to give Erik Hanson plenty of support in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Morris went two for three with two walks to give him a .407 average and 14 
RBIs in six games against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson (5-5), who has watched the Reds outscore the Pirates by 27-9 in his two 
starts in Pittsburgh this season, including a 19-7 victory on April 28, later 
added a run-scoring single that made the score 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 5, Chicago 4 -- Craig Biggio's single off the left field wall drove in 
Andy Stankiewicz in the ninth inning for the winning run at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Stankiewicz led off the ninth with a walk, and one out later he moved to third 
on a single by Brian Hunter, who was tagged out in a rundown. Biggio followed 
with his winning hit against Chuck Crim (3-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 7, St. Louis 5 -- Pinch-hitter Dante Bichette hit a three-run homer 
and Andres Galarraga singled in the go-ahead run in the Rockies' five-run 
seventh inning at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss stopped the Cardinals' winning streak at five and ended the Rockies' 
four-game losing streak. The Cardinals were leading, 5-2, when Rich Rodriguez 
(2-3) started the seventh inning in relief of starter Bob Tewksbury. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Munoz (4-2) pitched a scoreless sixth to earn the victory. Bruce Ruffin 
gained his 12th save. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 4, New York 1 -- Andy Ashby pitched a four-hitter and Tony Gwynn 
went three for four with three RBIs for Padres at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashby (4-6), who tied a career high with nine strikeouts, lowered his ERA to 
2.82, third best in the National League. He has pitched four complete games in 
his last seven starts after failing to go the distance in his first 48 major 
league starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashby, trying for his first career shutout, lost it with two out in the ninth 
when Rico Brogna hit his third homer in three games.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; NAGY KEEPS INDIANS' PITCHING STREAK ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Nagy pitched a five-hitter for Cleveland's third consecutive complete 
game and Albert Belle homered again Saturday as the Indians defeated the 
Minnesota Twins, 9-1, before the 15th consecutive sellout at Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle has homered in six of the last eight games and has hit safely in 18 of 
the last 19. His 24th home run, a two-run shot off Eddie Guardado (0-1), put 
Cleveland ahead to stay, 2-1, in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagy (7-4) retired 11 in a row from the second through the fifth innings and 
gave up only two hits, both singles, over the last seven innings. He struck out 
five and walked one in his second complete game of the season, which followed 
nine-inning performances by teammates Mark Clark and Jack Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Baerga had three hits and drove in three runs for the Indians, who have 
won three in a row and 22 of their last 26 home games. Minnesota has lost five 
of six overall and seven of its last eight on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 12, New York 6 -- Keith Mitchell's two-run single ignited an eight-run 
fifth inning at New York and the Mariners ended Jimmy Key's 11-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Key (12-2), who had not lost since April 9, gave up 10 hits and six runs 
before departing without retiring a Mariner in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr. failed to homer for the seventh consecutive game but went five 
for six with five singles. Dave Fleming (6-10) gave up nine hits and three runs 
in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 5, Milwaukee 0 -- Alex Fernandez (7-7) pitched a four-hitter and 
matched a career high with 10 strikeouts and Darrin Jackson drove in three runs 
to lead the White Sox at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson hit a two-run homer and drove in a run with a bases-loaded fielder's 
choice to help the White Sox win for the 11th time in their last 13 games. 
Julio Franco, who drove in five runs Friday night, knocked in two with a 
run-scoring single and an RBI double. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Eldred (9-8) lost for the first time in four starts, giving up nine hits 
in his fourth consecutive complete game. The Brewers have been shut out in 
three of their last four games, including back-to-back shutouts by Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 7, Kansas City 6 -- Ed Sprague's sacrifice fly in the eighth inning 
broke up reliever Rusty Meacham's club-record streak of 22 1/3 scoreless 
innings and gave the Blue Jays a victory at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Jays overcame 10 walks by their pitchers and three errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Meacham (0-1) had broken the Royals' record of scoreless innings by a reliever 
of 20 1/3 innings set by Dan Quisenberry in 1981. Tony Castillo (3-1) pitched 3 
1/3 innings for the win. Darren Hall got the last four outs for his sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 6, Texas 1 -- Mike Moore rebounded from the shortest outing of his 
major league career with a seven-hitter at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore (8-7), who lasted only one-third of an inning on June 26, shut down a 
Ranger lineup that banged out 18 runs and 23 hits in a doubleheader sweep of 
the Tigers Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore retired the first 10 Rangers before Jeff Frye got a one-out single in 
the fourth. Texas got a home run from Jose Canseco in the ninth, but the 
Rangers disappointed a crowd of 46,668, the largest in club history. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 10, Oakland 2 -- Tom Brunansky hit his seventh career grand slam and Mo 
Vaughn hit his 21st home run as the Red Sox ended the Athletics' eight-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunansky, who is batting .308 with four homers and 14 RBIs since he was 
traded back to Boston by Milwaukee on June 19, hit the first pitch from 
reliever Billy Taylor with two outs in the fifth for his fourth homer of the 
season to break open the game.

 Jerry Bailey's trip to California wasn't a waste of time after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Three races after Arcangues finished last in the Gold Cup, Bailey rode R Friar 
Tuck to a $47.20 upset in the $163,600 Affirmed Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding the 3-year-old gelding for the first time, Bailey sat off the pace 
early, moved up four-wide approaching the quarter-pole to join the leaders, 
then went on to win by three-quarters of a length over Pollock's Luck in 1:49 
for the 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bred in Utah by owner S. David Plummer, one of the country's leading breeders 
of quarter horses, R Friar Tuck showed nothing in his first four starts but has 
won three of his last five. 
</P>
<P>
 Wild Invader was third, a half-length behind Pollock's Luck and it was another 
four back to Argolid, the 9-10 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's other stakes race, the $108,400 Triple Bend Handicap, also provided 
some consolation for Arcangues' trainer, Richard Mandella. 
</P>
<P>
 Memo, one of the country's top sprinters, won by 2 3/4 lengths in a track 
record 1:20 2/5 for the seven furlongs. Fifty Six Ina Row set the old record of 
1:20 4/5 in 1985. 
</P>

<P>
 Hollywood Wildcat, who remained unbeaten on the turf with a victory in the 
Gamely Handicap on June 12, is the 7-5 morning-line favorite in the $323,400 
Beverly Hills Handicap at Hollywood Park today. 
</P>

LITTLE BOY IS THE SUBJECT OF BIG DEBATE; SCHOOLS: O.C.'S JIMMY PETERS CASE 
TESTS SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS' RIGHT TO 'MAINSTREAM' CLASSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Unlike most 6-year-olds, Jimmy Peters rarely smiles enough to show the space 
where his two front teeth should be. 
</P>
<P>
 When the teacher called roll in his kindergarten classroom at Circle View 
Elementary School last year, the youngster often did not respond to his own 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 While other children listened to stories or drew pictures, Jimmy sat to the 
side of his classroom monitored full-time by an aide. His classmates eventually 
grew inured to daily disruptions as Jimmy scampered around the room crying, 
anxiously clutching toys or waving his arms until an adult forced him back to 
his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the outbursts turned violent: Court records show Jimmy allegedly 
struck other students and staff, and bit his teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the year progressed, it became more and more difficult," said parent 
volunteer Judy Chan. "If he didn't want to do something, he couldn't sit there 
and just say 'No.' His way of protesting was just to cry and make noises rather 
loudly. They would have to separate him somewhat so in case he had a tantrum 
his kicking or his flailing would not injure other kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for him, actually." 
</P>
<P>
 Court documents, school records and interviews with family members, experts 
and people who know James Daniel Peters IV reveal him as a troubled child 
thrust into the center of a fierce conflict between the Ocean View School 
District and his zealous father, a tussle that has made him an unwitting symbol 
in the debate over special education. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy, who suffers from a communications disorder of disputed severity, gained 
national attention in May when the school district took the last-ditch step of 
going to court to oust him from his mainstream kindergarten class. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge sent him back to class -- ruling the district had not proved Jimmy was 
a serious danger to himself or others -- where he was greeted by sign-waving 
parents who said their children's education and safety were compromised by 
Jimmy's presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy is just one of about 10,000 special education students in Orange County, 
and 1 million nationwide, who spend most of their school hours in mainstream 
classrooms. As the popularity of this program, typically called "full 
inclusion," has grown over the past five years, schools have at times struggled 
to control the learning environment. 
</P>
<P>
 All students, whether they suffer from minor learning disabilities, severe 
mental retardation or serious physical problems, are candidates for inclusion. 
Legally, schools cannot transfer a special education student without parental 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 In a handful of similar cases across the country, courts have sided with 
parents who want their children mainstreamed over schools that have tried to 
remove them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes (inclusion) can work and sometimes it can't," said Justine Maloney 
of the Learning Disabilities Assn., a Pittsburgh-based parent support group 
with 60,000 members. "To say that all children belong in the regular classroom 
is as much a violation as it is to say that some children do not belong in a 
regular classroom. It's about the needs of an individual." 
</P>
<P>
 And so, the controversy over Jimmy turns on his needs -- and his behavior. The 
court documents, school records and interviews provide the most detailed 
portrait to date of the boy's short, difficult life and his wrangles with the 
school system. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy's father, Jim Peters, who contends the school system's action against 
his son is in retaliation for his activism on behalf of special-education 
students, declined to be interviewed at length for this story. In previous 
interviews, Peters and some parents of Jimmy's classmates have denied that his 
son presents a threat and said that, other than his communications difficulty, 
Jimmy is an ordinary kindergartner. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicki Astinas, whose son was in Jimmy's class last year, said in a declaration 
filed in connection with the district's lawsuit that she had "never seen Jimmy 
being aggressive or assaultive." And Deborah Hoops, who has worked with Peters 
on special-education issues, said she has "no fear of either of my children 
being with Jimmy." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has never thrown anything (other than a ball) in my presence," Hoops said 
in her court statement. "He has never bitten, spit at, or hit anyone in my 
presence." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters, Jimmy's grandfather and the boy's aunt said Jimmy's development 
problems first surfaced at about age 2, when he struggled to hear and did not 
speak. He has since had tubes surgically inserted in his ears but still relies 
largely on hand gestures rather than speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy spent 2 1/2 years in a preschool surrounded by other similarly disabled 
youngsters, then entered a mainstreamed kindergarten last fall as part of the 
full inclusion trend. 
</P>
<P>
 As the school year began, parents and specialists said, the chubby child was 
sweet and playful, if distant and easily distracted. But by springtime, 
according to interviews and court records, he had become uncontrollable and 
aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loves to eat, he loves to play. He's just a kid," sighed one of about a 
dozen people who have worked closely with Jimmy, speaking on the condition that 
she not be identified. "But when somebody is not in control and not following 
the norm and you know you can be hit and kicked . . . yeah, it's scary. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never knew from day to day what was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But Peters asserted in documents related to the federal court case that 
resulted in his child's reinstatement to the mainstream classroom that his 
son's behavior was not much different from that of other children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy is a very happy six year old. He is playful, often makes great sounds, 
giggles, and is very affectionate," Peters said in a declaration connected to 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many children wander around and look around the room," said Peters, who spent 
nearly every day this spring observing Davila's classroom. "The kindergarten 
class is generally noisy and active, with children frequently moving around and 
laughing as Jimmy does." 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of parents, some of whom also have special-needs children, have 
spoken out in support of Peters' quest to keep Jimmy in the mainstream class. 
Parents of others among Jimmy's classmates, though, have joined school 
officials in trying to persuade Peters to remove the child. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district's unsuccessful lawsuit focused on tantrums this spring 
that sent two staff members home on stress leave, but the records and 
interviews reveal that Jimmy's behavior has been deteriorating for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Many remember the school's winter pageant in December as a sign of growing 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed as one of four pieces of popcorn, Jimmy rolled his eyes skyward, 
flapping his hands and dancing by himself as his classmates hopped up and down, 
a performance videotaped by a parent. For the finale, the entire class sang 
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," but Jimmy -- who at 90 pounds was bigger than 
all his classmates -- hovered in front, skipping across the stage and then 
across the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other kids were doing their thing in the little play, and he was just 
running wild," recalled Barbara Brown, the mother of one of Jimmy's classmates. 
"The program would have gone a lot smoother and looked a lot better if he 
hadn't been doing that, but . . . they can't control him." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Las Vegas amid the stormy breakup of Jim Peters and Lilia A. 
Rodriguez, Jimmy has been shuttled among four cities and lived in about a dozen 
places, records show. He has not seen Rodriguez -- she and Peters never married 
-- in five years, although she recently revealed plans to seek custody and 
bring Jimmy to her home in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters' longtime wife, Renee Harris Peters, has refused to comment on his 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 From December until June, Jimmy and his father lived with another woman and 
her son. Peters, who said in court papers he has been unemployed since 1989 and 
receives government assistance, has refused to tell reporters where he lives 
now. School officials said they are trying to discover that themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View specialists say Jimmy has five of the seven characteristics of 
autism, a severe disorder that strikes about one of every 700 children before 
the age of 4, making it very difficult for them to interact socially, use 
language or tolerate change. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters, however, insists his son simply suffers from a speech delay that slows 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 In school and court records describing Jimmy's condition, experts said the 
child hates to be touched, can't keep his balance, repeats words over and over, 
and has a minuscule attention span. 
</P>
<P>
 School psychologist Linda Herrick wrote in a February, 1991, evaluation 
contained in court records that Jimmy had poor eye contact and was behind in 
cognitive development, social skills and speech, but doing well with gross 
motor skills and daily living tasks such as toilet training and dressing 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, however, special-education teacher Carolyn Hollingsworth wrote in a 
formal school evaluation of Jimmy that he had "severe problems" in listening, 
organizing, concentrating, thinking before acting, acknowledging mistakes and 
finishing tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Communication is limited to naming of objects and some single phrases, e.g., 
'I want,' " Hollingsworth wrote. "Jimmy does not . . . interact with other 
children. . . . Jimmy does not initiate verbal exchanges, initiate greetings or 
join in classroom verbal interactions on an ongoing basis." 
</P>
<P>
 When Jimmy entered local preschool programs as a toddler, Peters filed a legal 
action seeking more specialized care. But after 2 1/2 years in special classes, 
he asked last spring that Jimmy be placed in a mainstream kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy was monitored by a full-time aide while in the class; his 
school-sponsored educational plan also included special adaptive physical 
education and language sessions, and occupational therapy at a private 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report last December, occupational therapist Julie Turner noted Jimmy's 
"excellent progress" in working with beans, putty, brushes and toys, but said 
he had problems with balance. "Jimmy has learned to ride a hoppity horse," 
Turner wrote. But "after several feet of hoppity, Jimmy tends to lose his 
position and fall off." 
</P>
<P>
 After two-thirds of a year in Davila's class, Jimmy's report card showed that 
he was "secure" in writing his name, naming basic colors and exhibiting muscle 
coordination. But he had trouble with some mathematical concepts and could not 
cite his own age. 
</P>
<P>
 As his problems in school increased this spring, Jimmy had as many as three 
adults working exclusively with him at times, according to interviews and court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent most days isolated, working off to the side with his aide -- 
sometimes walled off behind a cubicle to prevent distractions, according to 
interviews. Many people described Jimmy as withdrawn and immature for his age. 
He is happiest when eating, they said, and has been scolded for grabbing jelly 
beans intended for a class project and for snatching an apple off his teacher's 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy has become overwhelmed and frustrated with even the minimal 
expectations required of him," resource specialist Laura Monge said in her 
court statement. "His peers ignore Jimmy and appear to be fearful of him 
because of his unpredictable behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the lawsuit focuses on half a dozen violent outbursts, the interviews 
chronicled a daily cycle of disruption. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he didn't want to do something, he didn't," said parent Tonya Antoski, who 
visited the class nearly every day. "There was one time where the aide was 
chasing him out of the classroom, trying to get ahold of him, and he was trying 
to hide behind me. . . . I don't think he was trying to hurt anybody, I just 
think he was scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hemsley, who oversees special education for Ocean View and four other 
local districts, watched one February day as Jimmy worked for a couple of 
minutes with his aide, then ran around his classroom, tossing anything he could 
get his hands on, according to Hemsley's court declaration. In about a half 
hour, Hemsley said, Jimmy jumped up and was forced back to his seat "four or 
five times." 
</P>
<P>
 Most observers agreed that the children learned early to ignore Jimmy's 
tantrums. 
</P>
<P>
 "When things happened, the kids would look up and see what was going on and 
then kind of go back about their business and tune him out," Chan said. "I 
think (they) knew that Jimmy was different." 
</P>
<P>
 Several times during the year, school personnel told Peters that Jimmy was not 
succeeding in Davila's class, but Peters refused to take him out. 
</P>
<P>
 In his court declaration, Peters pointed out that "one of Jimmy's little girl 
classmates (was) so fond of him that she kiss(ed) him regularly," and that two 
boys once scuffled over who would get to sit next to Jimmy. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some parents filed court statements asserting they had never seen any 
violent behavior from Jimmy, declarations from half a dozen school and district 
staff members indicate that Jimmy attempted to hit, kick and bite classmates 
throughout the spring, and that his personal aides received repeated blows from 
the child. 
</P>
<P>
 One day in April, Jimmy spat at a classmate, according to the court 
statements. Ten days later, he knocked over a desk after an adult took away a 
bag of popcorn, the statements show. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, "without provocation and without any prior warning, Jimmy 
approached (a) student and hit the student very hard in the back," 
instructional aide Brenda Solum said in her court statement. The following day, 
she added: "Jimmy pulled a chair out from under one of his classmates . . . 
then raised the chair in a threatening manner as if to throw it." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, May 18, Jimmy bit his teacher, sending her home on stress leave, Jimmy 
out of school on suspension and the entire matter into court. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the summer break interrupted the dispute, school officials are 
considering whether to file another lawsuit to keep Jimmy out of a mainstream 
classroom this fall.

<P>
 The government suppressed an attempted coup Sunday, arresting one of the 
leaders and forcing the other -- a son of King Norodom Sihanouk -- out of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Minister You Hockry said Sin Song was under house arrest and 
Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom Chakrapong, had been forced onto a Malaysian 
Airlines flight nine hours after the attempted takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 Sin Song and Chakrapong led a failed secessionist movement after their 
Cambodian People's Party lost U.N.-sponsored elections by a small margin in May 
1993. They initially fled to Malaysia and then quietly returned to Phnom Penh.

SPECIAL EDUCATION CAUSE IS FATHER'S FULL-TIME JOB; PROFILE: AN UNPARALLELED 
PARENTAL ACTIVIST, JIM PETERS FIGHTS FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN AS WELL AS HIS 
OWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jim Peters has been tangling with local school officials over his son's 
educational program for years. But he fights for other children too. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, Peters has filed legal complaints on behalf of some two 
dozen other special-education students, a level of parental activism school 
officials say is unprecedented in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployed since 1989, Peters works virtually full time on special-education 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to see parents in need," Peters, 38, said in an 
interview, "and I (try) to help them get some services." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters' 6-year-old son, Jimmy, suffers from a communications disorder whose 
severity is in dispute. After Peters repeatedly refused to remove Jimmy from a 
mainstream kindergarten class this spring, the Ocean View School District went 
to court in a last-ditch effort to oust the child. A judge, however, sent Jimmy 
back to class, prompting parents of some of his classmates to protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters contends that the school district lawsuit is simply retaliation for his 
own activism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I help a lot of parents, I think that has a lot to do with" the lawsuit, 
Peters said. "They're continually harassing Jimmy. There's just no letup here. 
The school district has been going after little Jimmy. . . . We're just about 
tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit came after years of squabbles between Peters and local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 From his seat on a special education advisory committee to five school 
districts in the Huntington Beach area over the past several years, Peters has 
galvanized other parents to fight for their children's rights. More recently, 
he founded his own parent support group, wrote a handbook on how to work with 
the educational system and began publishing a newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters has participated in Ocean View's task force on "full inclusion," the 
growing movement to place disabled youngsters in mainstream classes, and even 
tried in vain last fall to gain appointment to the district's school board when 
there was a vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Many school officials, parents and others who have worked with Peters describe 
him as a smooth talker who threatens legal action to achieve his goals. Critics 
call him "aggressive" and "tough;" some supporters say he single-handedly saved 
their children's futures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim was the fighter when it came to the kids, and it wasn't just his child. 
(Jim) wanted to make sure that all kids were served," said Susan Danner, the 
mother of a special-education student who recently moved to Arizona. "There are 
a lot of parents out there who got absolutely frustrated and didn't know where 
to turn. Jim would give you the information and you'd be all set." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters often accompanied other parents to meetings with district 
administrators to provide support and has helped write legal complaints for 
those unhappy with their children's educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hemsley, who oversees special-education programs for five school districts 
in the Huntington Beach area, said he has met or spoken with Peters about 100 
times this year in regard to two dozen children. On one day alone, Peters filed 
requests for due process hearings for seven different children. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemsley and other school administrators criticized Peters for perpetually 
arriving late or skipping scheduled meetings and clogging the system with 
paperwork without following through. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Mr. Peters, it's hard for me to tell what his final line is," Hemsley 
said, " . . but I think it's certainly to the detriment of the 
special-education children."

AREA REALTOR NAMES FUGITIVE AS HER KIDNAPER; CRIME: WOMAN WAS FOUND TIED UP AT 
AN ARIZONA MOTEL. SHE SAYS 'FAITH, HUMOR AND HOPE' GOT HER THROUGH THE 
THREE-DAY ORDEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Val Verde realtor who was abducted last week by a man posing as a 
prospective home-buyer identified her kidnaper Saturday through police mug 
shots and credited "faith, humor and hope" with getting her through the 
three-day ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Harrington, who was found Friday morning tied to a bed in a motel room 
in Gila Bend, a small town 68 miles southwest of here, said she had felt no 
fear while showing the man five houses in the Val Verde area Wednesday. But at 
the last house, she said, he turned on her. "The gun was in my face and I was 
on the floor tied up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington, 26, identified Timothy Daniel Shue, a fugitive with numerous 
aliases, as her abductor, said Jack Callahan, an FBI spokesman in the Phoenix 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue also is a suspect in a number of similar crimes that have occurred since 
he fled authorities last month in Grand Rapids, Mich., where he was wanted in a 
fraud case, Callahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities would not reveal details or the number of crimes but said Shue is 
suspected of abducting a Grand Rapids woman and later using her credit card. 
Federal agents, acting on an unlawful flight warrant issued June 10, had 
tracked Shue from Michigan to Oregon to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue is known to use several names, including Timothy Daniel Kriesel, Tim 
Thayer and Tim Trayer, Callahan said. He was last seen in Gila Bend between 
8:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some indication when he left that he would travel to the Grand 
Canyon or into Mexico," said Steve Chenoweth, the FBI agent handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Saturday afternoon press conference held after her interview and photo 
lineup with federal agents, Harrington appeared drained and pale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to be alive and have my family," she said, flanked by her husband, 
Chris Harrington, and other family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing matching purple and green shorts, Harrington spoke briefly about the 
ordeal, which began Wednesday afternoon when she accompanied Shue to view a 
number of houses in the Val Verde area, a tiny community hidden in the hills 
northwest of Santa Clarita. Authorities said he drove her to Arizona in a teal 
blue Jeep Cherokee, apparently the same vehicle the pair used to see the five 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers became suspicious and contacted the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department when the woman failed to return to her office after 6 p.m. 
Wednesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators suspected foul play when they checked out the 
residences that Harrington showed and found that the door to the last house was 
left wide open. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington was found in Gila Bend at the El Coronado Motel by a maid who heard 
her cries for help. About the same time, authorities said, a man called 
Harrington's real estate office in Val Verde and calmly said where she could be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents asked Harrington not to reveal details of the abduction, but she 
told relatives that Shue went through a number of "excited periods" during the 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's good with people," said Harrington's mother, Martha Franck of Orange 
County. "She gets them to talk and to listen. She told me that every time he 
got excited, she got calmer and calmer." 
</P>
<P>
 An FBI agent working the case said Harrington was composed after she was 
freed, but was visibly upset when she saw Shue's face in the photo lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's an emotional wreck now," Callahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the press conference, Harrington repeatedly embraced her mother, husband, 
brother-in-law Roy Harrington and her best friend, Kimberly Pepin, of Castaic, 
who rushed with family members to Phoenix when Harrington was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was her husband's 28th birthday, she said, and "all I could think 
about was what a horrible thing for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington's disappearance worried residents throughout the small town of Val 
Verde, population 1,500. Word quickly spread Friday that she had been found. "I 
want to thank my family and my neighbors and my community," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident has not soured her on her job or on living in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people still want to buy and sell houses with me after this, I'll keep 
doing it," Harrington said. "I love my career. Hopefully, it will be the same 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
 She said, however, she will pass up any more opportunities to show residences 
to single males in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she had any advice for real estate agents, she said, "I'm not blaming 
my office, but maybe offices should have a better policy. They knew my general 
location but maybe we should ask people for copies of their driver's licenses 
and post them on the bulletin board -- just be a little bit more cautious." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI would not describe the women in other assaults allegedly committed by 
Shue but said none involved real estate agents. Harrington warned anyone who 
might encounter Shue: "Don't take on the guy yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 As she hugged and leaned on family members who sat with her next to the pool 
at "The Pointe" hotel, Harrington appeared drawn but much more confident than 
she looked Friday when she was whisked away by FBI agents after she was found. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear there is all this food in our fridge and we're going to invite 
everybody over to eat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all downhill from here," her husband said. "I'm just thankful she was 
found."

RAPISTS TO REVEAL HIV STATUS UNDER NEW LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN and CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under a new law, convicted rapists will be forced to reveal their HIV status 
to their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, signed by Gov. Pete Wilson on Friday as the second bill of his 1994 
Crime Package, also requires prosecutors to refer sexual-assault victims to 
health professionals to receive the test results. HIV is the virus that causes 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) said she sponsored the bill after 
watching the plight of Monette Johnson's victims. Johnson, convicted in March 
of a string of sexual assaults in the San Fernando Valley in 1991 and 1992, was 
tested for the HIV virus as part of a court order. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the prison where he was held was entitled to the test results, 
his victims discovered that they were not because of confidentiality laws 
regarding HIV test results. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law brings California in line with the federal Crime Control Act of 
1990. The federal law threatened states with losing 10% of their 
anti-drug-abuse funding if they failed to adopt this type of legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the new law "affords the victims the right to know." 
</P>
<P>
 "It will enable victims of sex crimes to obtain timely medical attention," 
Wilson said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland said she was unsure if the law would be retroactive. 
</P>
<P>
 After Johnson's victims were attacked, several of his victims said they were 
notified that they might have been exposed to the HIV virus. But they were not 
told who was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the victims said in March they had tested negative for the 
AIDS-causing virus for more than a year, by which time HIV is usually 
detectable. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from AIDS Project Los Angeles and from the Lesbian and Gay 
Community Services Center in Hollywood reiterated their long-standing policies 
opposing mandatory HIV testing. They said the law will be used more often to 
discriminate against HIV-positive people than as a tool by victims and victims' 
rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a really difficult issue and fraught with emotion," said Mark Senak, 
planning director for AIDS Project Los Angeles. "The bottom line is that the 
only medical test that matters is your own." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also say that forcing a convicted sex offender to take an HIV test is 
not foolproof because the disease often is undetectable for six months. An 
attacker could test negative for the virus and still be a carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept is not even medically sane," said Kay Ostberg, the deputy 
director of the community group. "And how do you know you got it from the 
perpetrator? It could have been three months before the attack." 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, sexual-assault victims could get test results only if their 
attackers were convicted in a criminal court, if they petitioned the judge for 
an HIV test and then petitioned again for the results, Boland said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that she supports giving victims any relief possible, even if it 
threatens an attacker's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't care about his rights," Boland said. "This is a convicted 
criminal. Once they chose to break the law, they lost all their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who are we protecting if we don't disclose?"

TO MANY, CASTAIC IS AN ESCAPE; NEIGHBORS FEEL SAFE DESPITE NEARBY JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joni Micals lives across the freeway from a county jail where 44 inmates have 
escaped during the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign on her door reads "Beware of Dog" and a sticker on her front window 
promotes the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't be fooled into thinking Micals lives in fear. 
</P>
<P>
 The 39-year-old elementary school teacher said she has no concerns about 
living next to the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, a five-jail facility on the 
east side of Interstate 5 that houses about 10,000 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Micals said the "Beware of Dog" sign is mostly to remind visitors who come to 
her door not to let her beagles run out. The NRA sticker was already on the 
window when she moved into the house five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know there are escapes." But, she said, "The first thing they usually try 
to do is hitchhike out of here, so we know we're safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone who lives nearby feels that secure. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see police cars in the neighborhood, then I get scared," said Irma 
Sepulvda, 43, who lives on the same street as Micals. "That's when a lot of 
neighbors start calling each other." 
</P>
<P>
 A convicted car thief escaped from the minimum-security area of Pitchess on 
June 24 by crawling through a hole in a chain-link fence behind his dorm. 
Sheriff's officials said the escape was the county jail's 10th this year. Last 
year, 34 inmates escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Many inmates have escaped by sneaking away from outdoor work assignments, such 
as grounds keeping, said Errol Van Horne, operations lieutenant of Pitchess. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the 2,800 acres the Pitchess facility occupies consists of open fields 
surrounded by a razor-wire fence. Often, a single deputy is assigned to guard 
as many as 20 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Van Horne said most of the inmates who have escaped had been convicted of 
relatively minor, non-violent crimes. He added that those who try to flee 
usually have an underlying motive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, they've gotten a 'Dear John' letter from a girlfriend or wife," 
Van Horne said. "It's a personal thing. This is not a desperate criminal type 
of situation." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he couldn't recall any recent escapes from the jail's three 
highest-security facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Micals noted that over the years she and her husband have lived near the jail, 
they have been temporary foster parents for about 15 elementary school 
children. She said the county Department of Children's Services has never 
expressed any reservations about jailbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the DCS trusts us to have children across from the Honor Rancho, it's got 
to be safe," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend who moved to the neighborhood a year before Micals told her what to 
expect, Micals added. The neighbor had once seen a naked escapee being chased 
up and down the street by officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy had taken off his jail clothes, hoping to get into normal clothes," 
she said. "But he got caught halfway." 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents and employees of the unincorporated area north of Santa 
Clarita said they rarely hear about escapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning I used to think about it, but I don't anymore," said Vickie 
Jones, a cashier for three years at the Shell gas station on Parker Road, just 
north of Pitchess. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has never seen an escapee. But sheriff's deputies have come by the gas 
station after jailbreaks to ask employees to keep an eye on the restrooms 
outside "so the inmates don't clean up or change in there."  
</P>
<P>
 Half of the inmates who escape are captured before they make it off the jail's 
property, Van Horne said.  
</P>
<P>
 But one recent escape led to trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A 29-year-old inmate awaiting trial for robbery escaped April 29 from a 
medium-security Pitchess facility. It was the only escape this year that did 
not occur at the jail's minimum-security facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The inmate broke into a woman's house nearby, clad only in his underwear and 
carrying a club, and took off with the woman's jewelry and her car. Deputies 
recaptured the inmate the next day at a Palmdale motel. 
</P>
<P>
 That incident caused some discussion among residents and members of the 
Castaic Town Council, said Councilman Greg Ferrier. "Everyone said, 'Wait a 
minute, that's the first time anything has happened to a resident.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrier, a realtor, said most customers already know about the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make a point of saying, 'Hey, there are a lot of police officers who live 
up here and the reason they do is because it's safe.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any buyers who have not purchased because the Honor Rancho is 
up here," Ferrier added, but "I'm sure there have been a couple." 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic resident Belinda Bernal said she didn't know about the jail when she 
moved to the community five years ago. Her husband knew the jail was nearby, 
but didn't tell her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found out, I was like, 'What have you done?' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Bernal said she generally considers the freeway a safe buffer between 
Pitchess and her house. However, she is concerned about the potential for 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "What worries me is there's a lot of kids here whose parents work," she said. 
"There are no cars at home when their kids come home from school. What happens 
if something happens then?" 
</P>
<P>
 Security improvements at the jail aren't likely soon because of county budget 
cuts, Van Horne said.  
</P>
<P>
 Several Pitchess-area residents said they consider themselves better off than 
some people who live in the San Fernando Valley and other areas they left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather live where (inmates are) incarcerated than live down where 
they live," Ferrier said.

SCOTT HARRIS: QUAKE AS A POLITICAL MOVER AND SHAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The question may seem cynical, perhaps even rude. But in a conversation with 
John Emerson, it also seems appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson, a genial Clinton Administration official from Los Angeles, was 
sitting in his quarters in the Old Executive Office Building next door to the 
White House, discussing his role as the President's point man on the Northridge 
earthquake. The 40-year-old lawyer is proud of having helped funnel more than 
$10.3 billion in aid to the city he calls home. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson points out that $10.3 billion is triple the annual budget of the city 
of Los Angeles. It is so much money that some economists even cite it as a 
"spark" for California's nascent economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Now add that to the fact that Clinton, eyeing reelection in '96, covets 
California and its 54 electoral votes. The question becomes obvious: 
</P>
<P>
 Was the earthquake good for President Clinton? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson could see this one coming. If he hasn't heard the question before, he 
has surely entertained the notion. A former deputy to City Atty. James Hahn, 
Emerson is a canny political operator who played a key role in Sen. Gary Hart's 
1988 presidential campaign and later supported Sen. Bob Kerrey's presidential 
bid before joining the Clinton cause. Emerson, who narrowly lost in his own bid 
for a state Assembly seat in 1991, ran Clinton's California campaign and was 
rewarded with an appointment as deputy assistant to the President. Emerson 
handles personnel matters and special assignments. He's a political ambassador 
to California -- and, especially, an expert on all things Angeleno. 
</P>
<P>
 My interest in meeting Emerson was piqued in part by a provincial bit of 
reporting by the Los Angeles Daily News on Jan. 28, 11 days after the 
earthquake. "First Lady in L.A., Skips Valley," declared the banner headline. 
The implication, of course, is that the San Fernando Valley had been snubbed. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on the movements of Hillary Rodham Clinton seemed strange, given 
the fact that the quake already had prompted Valley visits from the President 
and several Cabinet members, and that the First Lady's visit had been scheduled 
long in advance -- to appear as guest of honor at an AIDS fund-raiser. Quake 
duties had simply been squeezed into her schedule. Yet for the sin of tending 
to Hollywood and the Southside, but not the Valley, the Daily News put Hillary 
in a pillory. 
</P>
<P>
 It also seemed strange, because my impression was that Bill Clinton, as both a 
candidate and as President, has cultivated the Valley. Long before the quake, 
this voter-rich region had served as Clinton's stage to discuss such issues as 
aerospace cutbacks and job retraining. Such decisions are not made by throwing 
darts at a map. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson confirmed the obvious. He is careful to emphasize that "the President 
has a special interest in California in general." But, he says, the White House 
"absolutely" sees the Valley as a distinctly valuable political entity. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people from Washington come to California, the Valley is often 
overlooked," Emerson explains. "They go to the Westside for fund-raising and 
South-Central or the Eastside for ethnic politics." 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Emerson points out, the Valley is home to a lot of middle-class voters 
-- "working families, small businesses, entrepreneurs." What's more, these are 
voters who already experienced an "economic earthquake" from factory closures, 
aerospace cuts and depressed real estate. And they are voters who don't 
routinely toe the party line. "In purely political terms," he says, "the San 
Fernando Valley is the swing region of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 All of this, plus the area's increasing ethnic diversity, prompts Emerson to 
describe the Valley as "California in a microcosm." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, not even a Valley columnist would suggest that, ipso facto, the key to 
winning California's 54 electoral votes -- and perhaps the White House! -- is 
the San Fernando Valley. But it wouldn't hurt. And it doesn't hurt President 
Clinton that most of that $10.3 billion is balm for the Valley's aches and 
pains. 
</P>
<P>
 To be crassly political, there are a couple of ways to look at this. One is 
that God is a Democrat. The other is that Clinton got lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson responds to the cynical question with mild-mannered aplomb. The 
billions in federal aid, he emphasizes, should be viewed "only in the nature of 
a silver lining to a very bad thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The President's man is secure in knowing that, despite some complaints 
concerning quake aid, the reviews are mostly positive. Rep. Howard (Buck) 
McKeon of Santa Clarita, for example, may be a Republican, but he is effusive 
in praising government response to a quake that caused much of its damage in 
his district. Emerson says his boss deserves credit for taking a personal 
interest in quake recovery. President Clinton could empathize with California's 
disaster victims, he says, because he had so much experience dealing with 
floods and tornadoes as governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He saw what the federal government can do to help," Emerson says. "And he saw 
what the federal government can do to screw up." 
</P>
<P>
 So will the earthquake help Clinton win California? 
</P>
<P>
 "My response to that is that nobody gets elected or reelected because they do 
well in a disaster," Emerson says. But if government doesn't respond well, he 
adds, "someone can sure be thrown out of office." 
</P>
<P>
 So the Clinton Administration wants everyone to know that it's on the job. 
That's why the press was invited when the Small Business Administration in 
April issued an $9.1-million loan to quake-damaged Devon Industries Inc. of 
Chatsworth, the largest disaster loan in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's no accident that the first installment was delivered, in person, by 
Hillary Rodham Clinton.

VALLEY BRIEFING: FOUNDING FATHERS; IN 1776, HISTORY WAS BEING MADE HERE, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 July is a time to remember how the Founding Fathers gathered in Philadelphia 
in 1776 to sign the Declaration of Independence. But what was going on in 
Southern California? From an East Coast perspective, not much. Still, the 1770s 
were an important decade in the history of the region, a time when Spanish 
explorers made some of their first expeditions in what eventually became Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Progress was gradual. Los Angeles wasn't founded until 1781, the same year the 
13 former colonies adopted the Articles of Confederation as their first 
constitution. The San Fernando Mission wasn't founded until 1797, nine years 
after the Articles were scrapped and replaced with the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in the 1770s, the San Fernando Valley's potential was apparent. 
Diarist Juan Crespi, part of the first Spanish expedition in the Valley, 
described it as "vastly lush." "All very good, very grassy soil, though most of 
it had been burnt off; many patches however had not been, where grass still 
showed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish gave the Valley two names: Santa Catalina de Bononia (St. 
Catherine of Bologna) and Los Encinos (the oaks.) Crespi estimated the Valley 
to be "over two leagues in breadth, north to south; its length, east to west, 
may perhaps be six or seven leagues" -- basically from Mission Hills to Sherman 
Oaks and from Burbank to Canoga Park. It would be, he predicted, a good 
location for a town. THE WORLD IN 1776

</P>
<P>
 While a new country was being formed on the East Coast, the San Fernando 
Valley was being explored by the Spanish. Some key events in early Valley 
exploration: 
</P>
<P>
 July 14, 1769: The Portola Expedition leaves San Diego for Monterey, two days 
before the founding of the mission of San Diego de Alcala. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 5, 1769: Juan Crespi and his group descend upon the San Fernando Valley 
via what is now Sepulveda Boulevard. The expedition continues north through the 
Valley to the Santa Clara River, making its way through Ventura County on the 
way to Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 15, 1770: The expedition returns to the Valley, having traveled from 
Ventura by way of Calabasas. They stop by a large pool of warm water at what is 
now Los Encinos State Historical Park, then travel through the Cahuenga Pass 
into what is now Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 8, 1771: San Gabriel Mission is founded. 
</P>
<P>
 February, 1776: Another expedition, lead by Juan Bautista de Anza, passes 
through the Las Virgenes area. 
</P>
<P>
 July 4, 1776: Declaration of Independence is adopted in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 4, 1781: Los Angeles is founded. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 8, 1797: San Fernando Mission is founded. NATIVE POPULATION  
</P>
<P>
 When the Spanish arrived in the 1700s, they encountered American Indians who 
gave the missionaries acorns and berries. Between 3,500 and 5,000 Indians lived 
in the Valley at the time, many of them making their home in what is now 
Encino. These Indians, later named the Fernandeno, helped build the San 
Fernando Mission. A separate and larger group, the Chumash, lived in Malibu, 
Agoura, Westlake Village and in Ventura County. PAST AND PRESENT

LIFEGUARDS AS PEACEKEEPERS; RECREATION: NOT EVERYONE GETS ALONG SWIMMINGLY AT 
LOCAL POOLS. THE EMPLOYEES KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR TROUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to defusing steaming tempers, Warren Mandigo's personal policy 
is to keep cool. 
</P>
<P>
 As a pool lifeguard at El Cariso Regional Park in Sylmar, Mandigo's job is 
part-time peacekeeper as well as lifesaver -- a fact made clear by the recent 
beating of a lifeguard in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always problems that come up with patrons," said Mandigo, echoing 
the sentiments of other San Fernando Valley lifeguards who know that they are 
not immune to similar violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems drowning the rest of society sometimes spill over into recreation 
areas intended as carefree spots to escape the heat. And lifeguards are left to 
rely on their wits to stay safe, since they are, literally, almost naked to 
defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandigo has heard stories of lifeguards being asked to hold guns while 
hooligans take a dip. A lifeguard friend once had to be escorted to her car by 
police because of threats from angry swimmers after she told them to behave. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of upsetting that people would do stuff like that," said Mandigo, 
who has told many "irate patrons" to play by the rules or pack it up. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, several lifeguards at the Will Rogers Park pool in Watts were 
injured in a melee that erupted after a lifeguard tried to restrain a swimmer 
who was roughhousing. Some of the swimmer's buddies hopped the fence, and a 
brawl broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Jones, manager of the public pool at Van Nuys-Sherman Oaks Park in Sherman 
Oaks, said similar incidents are more common than most people think, even if 
they involve only yelling and threats rather than physical violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, Jones recalled, a young lifeguard with whom he was working was shot 
and killed after the victim told a rowdy swimmer to behave. 
</P>
<P>
 "We deal with maladjusted behavior all the time," Jones said, adding that 
lifeguards should never let themselves get drawn into a confrontation with a 
swimmer. Those disputes are better handled by park rangers or police, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, local pools usually make for a safe outing. For the most part, Jones 
said, public pools are still places where large numbers of people enjoy 
themselves without problems. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 500 people a day can crowd the Sherman Oaks pool on a hot weekend. 
For senior lifeguards like Jones, the art of handling that many people has been 
honed over several decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But for rookie lifeguards, commanding respect from rowdy swimmers is sometimes 
more difficult. Heather Chowaniec said she sometimes sees rough-looking 
characters hanging around and occasionally has to tell them or their friends in 
the pool to behave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially since I'm a girl, they never listen to me," Chowaniec said. "But 
that's why we have the manager and the guy lifeguards. The only time I feel 
unsafe is when I'm leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 Tall and muscular with a shaved head, lifeguard Ed Akopyan said he almost 
never worries about his safety while on duty. "I have the haircut," he said. 
"It scares them away."

GLENDALE MAN DIES IN CUSTODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Glendale man, taken into custody by Burbank police for public drunkenness, 
died of a heart attack while being escorted to his cell, authorities said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Sarmiento Gil, 37, was arrested late Thursday night at the Hughes 
Market in the 1000 block of San Fernando Road, said Lt. Robert Giles of the 
Burbank police.Gil was brought to the jail for detoxification, Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
 "While being placed in his cell, he collapsed and officers noted he was having 
difficulty breathing," Giles said.  
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics transported the man to Thompson Memorial Hospital in Burbank, where 
he was pronounced dead. Toxicological tests are being conducted to determine 
the exact cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
 Giles said such a death was not unusual. "The most common cause of death in 
custody results from intoxication or some byproduct of being intoxicated," 
Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Nagasamudra Ashok, the hospital's emergency room director and the doctor 
who examined Gil on Friday, said the man's death appeared to be consistent with 
an alcohol-related heart problem.

JIM MURRAY: ALL OR NOTHING FOR THIS WILLIAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Babe Ruth is having a terrible year. So is Roger Maris. Hack Wilson must need 
a drink somewhere today. Jimmie Foxx and Hank Greenberg must be groaning. 
</P>
<P>
 It's about those home runs. You know, the 60-homer season -- like the 
four-minute mile and the 9.9 100 meters -- was supposed to be the most 
unattainable record in the books. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ruth hit his 60 home runs in 1927, the only guy in either league close to 
him was Lou Gehrig with 47. After that it was Tony Lazzeri with 18. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ruth hit 54 home runs in 1920, that was one-fifth of the total home runs 
hit by the National League, and only one team in all of baseball hit as many as 
the Babe that year. 
</P>
<P>
 When Roger Maris broke Ruth's record, by one, it was widely held to be a 
fluke. Maris had never hit more than 39 home runs and never hit more than 33 
after his Ruthian season, 1961.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, look at the grand old game. Home runs are flying out of ballparks like 
popcorn.  
</P>
<P>
 In his record-setting year, Ruth had hit 25 home runs by the end of June.  
</P>
<P>
 Care to guess how many guys were ahead of or even with his pace in this Year 
of Our Lord 1994? Four. A half-dozen more were within hailing distance. 
</P>
<P>
 If someone had told you back in time that a guy named Williams would be a 
threat to the great Bambino, you would have said, "Oh, sure. Ted Williams, 
right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nope. One of the biggest threats to the Babe -- and Maris -- is a Williams 
named Matt. Nobody ever called him "the Thumper," "the Splendid Splinter," 
"Teddy Ballgame." Unlike the other Williams, he's no threat to win the triple 
crown.  
</P>
<P>
 But Matthew Derrick Williams of the San Francisco Giants can hit home runs. 
Oh, can he hit home runs! 
</P>
<P>
 One of every four hits he has in his career has been a home run. This year, 
almost one in every two hits is a home run. Williams has 30 home runs among his 
77 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, part of the problem is, Williams doesn't hit much else. Sometimes, 
he doesn't hit anything. He has struck out 57 times already.  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Williams doesn't have to catch the Babe and Maris to get a rung up 
on the Hall of Fame. He has to catch Wilson. Hack was the hard-hitting -- and 
hard-drinking -- Chicago Cub who holds the National League record for homers, 
56, set in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is far ahead of Wilson's record pace. In fact, his 29 home runs at 
the end of June are the most hit by a National Leaguer by that date. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Ruth, Williams will not outslug every other team in the league and all 
but one in baseball. There were more than 1,000 homers hit in the National 
League by June's end. The teams have three months to surpass the 1,956 hit last 
year.  
</P>
<P>
 Ruth had a home run every fourth hit -- 2,873 hits, 714 of them homers -- but 
Ruth had batting averages of .393, .378, .376 and .342 lifetime. Williams' high 
mark was .294, last year. He is at .249 this year.  
</P>
<P>
 The damage he does with that modest number is significant, however. Before the 
weekend, he was fifth in the league in runs batted in with 58. And twice in his 
career, he has driven in more than 100 runs. He is, unaccountably, not given to 
being walked by the pitchers. He has been walked intentionally only four times 
this season -- compared to 14 for teammate Barry Bonds. Is he homer-happy? 
There have been instances of that phenomenon in other players. Dave Kingman, 
for instance, had 442 home runs -- 20th on the all-time list -- among his 1,575 
hits. But Kingman never came close to hitting .300 and once had an embarrassing 
.198 season. He was also hard to walk -- strolling only 45 times one year when 
he hit 48 home runs. Ruth used to walk 170 or so times a year, Matt Williams 
walked only 27 times last year.  
</P>
<P>
 But do you change a formula that seems to be making history? Williams agrees 
he would like to post better decimals. But do you do it at the expense of the 
longball?  
</P>
<P>
 Williams is not sure he wants to risk it. Does he actively try to hit home 
runs? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he says. "If you try to hit a home run, you won't. Home runs happen. 
They are not planned." 
</P>
<P>
 So, maybe Ruth didn't really call his shot in the World Series that day in 
'32. Williams doesn't believe you can call a home run. He should know.  
</P>
<P>
 Does Williams think he has this natural home run stroke, a la Maris? Maris was 
the master of the 325-foot homer, stroking the ball barely far enough to reach 
the friendly right-field porch in Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so," Williams says. "Nobody ever commented on it. I just try to 
hit the ball and have good bat speed. I don't know if it's a good stroke." 
</P>
<P>
 It must be. Williams is a strong man, like that homer hitter of the past, 
Harmon Killebrew. Killebrew finished with 573 homers and Williams so uncannily 
resembles him, they could be twins.  
</P>
<P>
 Does Williams hit tape-measure homers, a la Mickey Mantle?  
</P>
<P>
 "Naw!" he scoffs. "My home runs are just far enough. Of my home runs this 
year, I'd say 10 of them went to right and center field. The rest, I pulled." 
</P>
<P>
 Having said that, Williams went out that night and pulled a ball so far up the 
left field bleachers it came within a few feet of going out of the park 
altogether.  
</P>
<P>
 Does he stand there and watch his home runs go out the way Killebrew used to? 
</P>
<P>
 Williams shakes his head. "No. I hit the ball, I start to run." 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates scoff at the notion he has to run out his homers. "They orbit," 
they tell you. 
</P>
<P>
 The baseball world is aware of Ken Griffey Jr. and his quest for the homer 
title with an eye-popping 32 already. They watch Frank Thomas of the Chicago 
White Sox, who has 29. He also has a nickname, "the Big Hurt."  
</P>
<P>
 Williams is merely "M. Williams 3b" on the Giant lineup card. But he's in a 
great tradition. The homer lists are dotted with third basemen -- Mike Schmidt 
with 548; Eddie Mathews, 512; Graig Nettles, 390; Tony Perez, 379; Ron Santo, 
342.  
</P>
<P>
 "Third basemen can be big," Williams explains. "Shortstops and second basemen 
have to be small and quick. They have more ground to cover." 
</P>
<P>
 Is the ball souped up this year? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure," Williams says. "I hit 38 home runs last year and it certainly 
doesn't feel any different this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he's only 28, Williams could be pardoned for looking ahead at some 
possible Hall of Fame numbers. After all, 188 home runs in really only five 
seasons is an impressive start. It's a great career for most. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming 10 more years in uniform, the numbers project to 564 or more home 
runs. This puts Williams with Henry Aaron, Ruth, Willie Mays, Reggie Jackson 
and company. A goal, perhaps?  
</P>
<P>
 He shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to win home run derbies," he says. "I want to win pennants." 
</P>
<P>
 He did get in one World Series. He got one hit. You guessed it -- home run.  
</P>
<P>
 It has been 17 years since anyone hit more than 50 homers in a season in the 
National League. George Foster had 52 in 1977. You have to go back to 1947 to 
find a time when two National Leaguers hit 50 or more in a year -- Ralph Kiner 
and Johnny Mize.  
</P>
<P>
 In the American League, you have to go back to '61 to find a pair of 50-plus 
round-trippers -- Maris with his 61 and Mantle with 54. For a long time that 
season, it looked as though both of them might break the Babe's record. But 
before that, you have to reach back to 1938, when Hank Greenberg hit 58 and 
Foxx 50. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the 50-homer set may become a club. Williams has a chance to set a 
lot of baseball history this fall. Provided he does not fritter away his time 
hitting doubles and triples.  
</P>
<P>
 Given his past performances, he's not likely to.

WORLD CUP USA '94 ROUND OF 16; SPECIAL REPORT; COLOMBIA'S ESCOBAR MURDERED IN 
MEDELLIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andres Escobar made a mistake. He allowed a ball to bounce off his foot into 
the Colombian goal in a game June 22 against the United States.It cost Colombia 
the game. It cost Escobar his life. The talented Colombia midfielder was 
murdered Saturday in his hometown of Medellin. One gunman said, "Thanks for the 
auto-goal," before pumping 12 bullets into Escobar's body. After each shot the 
group of assailants shouted "goal." Now, a day after this shocking incident, a 
Times special report looks at the circumstances surrounding Escobar's death and 
how this incident fits into the specter of world competition.

MIKE DOWNEY: WORLD CUP USA '94 ROUND OF 16; KLOPAS CAN SCORE, BUT BORA STILL 
LOOKING FOR MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps you remember it. There's this song that goes: "Put me in, Coach. I'm 
ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Klopas gets your drift.  
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 He is the leading scorer for the 1994 U.S. World Cup soccer team, but he 
cannot get into a game. 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't injured.  
</P>
<P>
 He isn't suspended.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I could just get in there, just get a chance. . . . " Klopas says.  
</P>
<P>
 Then maybe he could score. This team is desperate for a scorer right about 
now. The American team has three goals in three games. One of them was 
accidentally kicked into the net by an opponent. If only someone could score 
against Brazil in Monday's game at Palo Alto, who knows what could happen? 
Maybe that someone could be Frank.  
</P>
<P>
 He joined the team Jan. 2. During a seven-game stretch between April 20 and 
May 28, the team scored 10 goals. Klopas got half of them.  
</P>
<P>
 He scored against Moldova, against Iceland, against Estonia, against Armenia, 
against his own native Greece. In three of those five games, Klopas' goal was 
the only one the team scored. In a "friendly" against German champion Bayern 
Munich in May, the Americans lost, 3-2. Klopas scored both of their goals.  
</P>
<P>
 And then the actual World Cup finals began.  
</P>
<P>
 And now he sits. And waits.  
</P>
<P>
 Even with midfielder John Harkes out serving a one-game suspension, Klopas has 
no indication his time has come.  
</P>
<P>
 After a practice Thursday at Mission Viejo, it was suggested that maybe Bora 
Milutinovic finally will toss the 27-year-old forward from Chicago into the 
mix.  
</P>
<P>
 Klopas shakes his head and says, "I don't know, because he had Cobi (Jones) on 
that side today. I'm not sure what he's thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 What the coach is thinking? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that what this player adds to an offense cannot overcome what he is 
lacking on defense? 
</P>
<P>
 For it was Milutinovic who said bluntly, "He can score, but what else?" 
</P>
<P>
 This is passed along to Klopas, whose disappointment is palpable.  
</P>
<P>
 "He said that? I don't know why he would feel that way. I can play wherever he 
needs me to play. This is the only time I've actually played striker. My five 
years in Greece, I played midfield and attacker. I'll play any position the 
team needs me to play. Where I am now, it's not my duty to defend." 
</P>
<P>
 " He can only score? " 
</P>
<P>
 What do they want a forward to do -- referee? 
</P>
<P>
 Klopas is sad, not angry. This has happened to him before. With the 1990 World 
Cup coming up, he was eager to contribute. He had been a member of the 1988 
U.S. Olympic squad. That same year, the Americans needed a victory over Jamaica 
to help qualify for the first World Cup appearance in 40 years. Klopas scored 
against Jamaica -- twice.  
</P>
<P>
 Then Bob Gansler, the U.S. coach, dropped him from the team.  
</P>
<P>
 The only benefit was that Klopas immediately got an offer to go to Greece. 
Gansler had accused him of not being in shape. Klopas signed with AEK Athens, a 
first-division Greek club. He became a big star, called simply "the American" 
by public and press. He already had 11 goals in the 1992 season when a ligament 
tore in his right knee.  
</P>
<P>
 Greece was a trip. Being recognized everywhere. Having every success toasted, 
every failure roasted.  
</P>
<P>
 The way Klopas recalls it, without regret, "It was amazingly stressful. You 
couldn't hide. Fans would be crying, coming over to your table, analyzing your 
play. They could criticize you in a way that was like they knew more about you 
than you did. Everybody's like a coach over there. The fans all think they're 
experts." 
</P>
<P>
 When his contract expired in December, Klopas came home. In Chicago, he had 
scored goals at an astounding clip for Mather High -- 70 in four years. Then he 
played for the Chicago Sting's 1984 championship team in the North American 
Soccer League. He tried indoor soccer too, scoring 39 times for the Sting in 
the 1987-88 season alone.  
</P>
<P>
 But now he sits. And waits.  
</P>
<P>
 His sister, Kathy, came all the way from Greece to see him play. She also is 
waiting.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready to go," he says. "I think I'm the kind of player who's got 
something to offer to this team. It's frustrating and it's hard to swallow. I 
guess a lot of people have written me off, but people forget easily. I'm ready 
to go in at any time. I respect the coach's decision and I'm here to support my 
teammates no matter what happens, but I want everyone to know, I'm ready. I've 
never been more ready in my life."

WORLD CUP USA '94 ROUND OF 16; COMMENTARY; NATION IS RIDING ON MEXICO'S CAPE

 " No matter how many times you have seen the entrance of the bullfighters, it 
is always a thrilling experience. They come out not in single file, for that 
would denigrate the fellow in last position, but side by side, as if all were 
equal, which is the case as the fight begins. " -- "MEXICO" By James Michener 
</P>
<P>
 So it will be Tuesday, in the late afternoon shadows of an American football 
stadiumin New Jersey, when the current matadors of Mexico enter side by side, 
as if they were equal, which will be the case as the fight begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Their names are Luis Garcia and Jorge Campos, and unlike the fictional 
Victoriano Leal and Juan Gomez of Michener's 1960s Mexico, their opponent will 
not be life-threatening or possess razor-sharp horns. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the World Cup soccer game that Garcia and Campos will play against 
Bulgaria, there will be many of the same elements of cultural passion that 
Michener threads through his story of two bullfighters. The people and the plot 
are fiction. The essence of the place, Mexico, is not. 
</P>
<P>
 From well before the start of this monthlong World Cup, to its current point 
in the round of 16, the path of Mexico's soccer team has been an emotional 
roller coaster. That's not just for the team, but for its country, which, as 
much as any soccer-mad place, ebbs and flows with its football failure and 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 4, Mexico came to the Rose Bowl to play the U.S. national team in "a 
friendly." That means the match doesn't matter in any sort of official 
qualifying, but is listed in the team record. 
</P>
<P>
 This one mattered greatly, no matter how it was labeled. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 91,123 turned out, and while that was the largest gathering ever to 
see the U.S. team play on U.S. soil, the crowd was clearly there to see the 
team the United States was playing. The Arroyo was a sea of green, orange and 
white; the colors of the Mexican flag, and the flag itself, dominated the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 With two weeks to the World Cup opener, it was a dress rehearsal for Mexico. 
It was the last full-makeup run-through before its return to the international 
soccer scene after an embarrassing eight-year absence caused by a 
disqualification from the 1990 World Cup. The Mexican Soccer Federation had 
sent a team to a junior tournament, and some of the team members weren't all 
that junior. The Mexicans had lied about some of the players' ages, and FIFA, 
the same international sanctioning group that fines coaches thousands of 
dollars for harmless arguments with referees and suspends players for not 
standing properly in line for free kicks, booted Mexico from the 1990 World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that Mexico was the soccer power of this section of the world. No 
matter that Mexico had been host to the World Cup in Mexico City only four 
years earlier and had run a generally successful event for FIFA after Colombia 
had backed out. With FIFA, history has made things like that clear: March at 
high noon with its officials and they will always draw first and step easily 
over the fallen body. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been a long road back to June 4 in the Rose Bowl, and one of the bumps 
along the way had been the replacement as coach of popular Luis Menotti with 
Miguel Mejia Baron. Baron was a former dentist and a protege of U.S. Coach Bora 
Milutinovic, Mexico's coach in the '86 Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The day was hot, the fans were torrid and the Mexican team was awful in a 1-0 
loss. Losing in soccer is one thing, even in a friendly. But losing to a 
country that has demonstrated success with its feet only on "American 
Bandstand" was reason for shame. The Mexican flags and their carriers slinked 
off into the sunset, unhappy and fearful of the important days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 19, Mexico played Norway in its first of three games in Group E that 
had quickly, upon its creation at the World Cup soccer draw in late December in 
Las Vegas, taken on the nickname "Group of Death." Besides Mexico and Norway, 
the group included soccer power Italy and dark horse Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 When the draw took place, Mexico had expected -- some said been assured -- 
that it would end up in a group headquartered in Dallas. That would put it very 
close to a huge friendly fan base. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Mexicans heard they were in a group with Ireland and Italy and would 
play their games along an Eastern seaboard much more heavily populated with 
Irish and Italian fans, their soccer contingent marched out of the Las Vegas 
Convention Center in a huff. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, after their 1-0 embarrassment in the Rose Bowl, they marched 
out again in a huff, exiting the Rose Bowl through a back door with nary a word 
to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 A team in a sulk played Norway June 19 and lost, 1-0. Aging Hugo Sanchez, one 
of only two Mexicans playing in Europe in the prestigious Spanish League, 
hadn't played against the United States on June 4, but faced Norway. Only weeks 
short of his 36th birthday, Sanchez looked slow and ineffective. The 
second-guessing of Mejia Baron was in full bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mexican fans arrived in force in Orlando on June 24 for the second game in 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
 On one of the many planes in, a stockbroker from Monterrey who had made his 
connection in Dallas, tried to think positively. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not think we will win, but I want us so much to, because soccer means so 
much to my country," said Mauricio Calderon. "My father planned this trip for 
so long, so we come, even after Norway." 
</P>
<P>
 At the game, there were fewer Mexican flags than in the Rose Bowl on June 4, 
but thousands of shirts and hats that read: "Confia en Mexico." Believe in 
Mexico. Have faith in Mexico, in our team. 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost a plea. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the 44th minute against Ireland, it all seemed to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, 11 years younger than Sanchez, was moved to the right-side forward 
position, from his normal striker spot. Sanchez was on the bench. Carlos 
Hermosillo, who hadn't played against Norway, shoveled a neat little pass just 
outside the penalty box and dead center to the goal. Garcia lashed the ball 
past Irish goalkeeper Pat Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico had gone from June 4 until the waning moments of the first half of the 
Ireland game 20 days later -- probably close to 240 minutes of play, including 
injury time -- with nary a goal. As players piled on Garcia in celebration, you 
could almost feel an entire country breathe a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia scored again in the second half. Mexico had a 2-1 lead and all the 
healing that a World Cup victory would bring was close at hand. But then Andy 
Townsend, Ireland's sandy-haired captain and midfielder, got an opening just 
outside the box and to the left of goal in the 81st minute. He sent a 
screaming, dipping shot that had a real chance until goalkeeper Campos darted 
left and directed the ball wide of the net. The 2-1 victory was preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, the fans went to Church Street Station in Orlando and celebrated 
well into the morning hours. Suddenly, there were more flags again and fewer of 
the "Confia en Mexico" hats and shirts. They believed again. They had lived 
another day in the Group of Death. Garcia and Campos had taken red capes and 
swords and subdued the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday, the day before Mexico was to play Italy in Washington in its last 
game of group play, a youngster headed for the metal detector in the Orlando 
airport. He was perhaps 10 years old, and he wore a sombrero with a huge rim. 
As he stepped through the metal detector, the hat was brushed off. He tried 
once, twice, then a third time. The sombrero was too wide. Undeterred, he tried 
a fourth time, tilting his head just enough and slipping through. His family, 
laughing as they watched, saluted his final success in bullfighting terms: 
"Ole! Ole! Pedro." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Italy, Garcia and Campos, now clearly the team's matadors, played 
beautifully, but Italy scored first. With Ireland and Norway playing 
simultaneously in Giants Stadium and heading for a 0-0 tie that would leave 
each with four points in the final group standings, a loss by Mexico would 
leave it with three points and Italy with six, meaning Mexico would be out. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Mexican fans were there in full force, believing in Mexico. As their 
team's short passing game got clicking, they greeted each movement with a 
rhythmic "Ole! Ole! Ole!" And suddenly Marcelino Bernal connected with a 
25-yard shot that not only brought the eventual 1-1 tie, but placed Mexico atop 
Group E's final standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Mexico can make history. Never has a Mexican soccer team advanced to 
the quarterfinals outside of the World Cups held in its country in 1970 and 
1986. The leaders, of course, will be Garcia and Campos, legends now from 
Cancun to Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
 In Michener's book, Victoriano Leal is the Spaniard, the finesse bullfighter 
with grace and careful style and the lighter complexion of his Basque roots; 
Juan Gomez is the Mexican Indian through and through, a rough-skinned rogue 
with strength and power and a thirst for the thrill and danger of living on the 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Garcia mirrors Michener's Leal, Jorge Campos mirrors Michener's Gomez. 
Whether the fight is with bulls or Bulgarians, Mexico worships its warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, in Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands of New Jersey, Garcia and Gomez 
will enter, side by side, as equals, the Spaniard and the Mexican Indian, their 
country's soccer matadors as the fight begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Ole! Mexico.

WORLD CUP USA '94 ROUND OF 16; COMMENTARY; THE REAL WINNERS FROM ROUND ONE: CUP 
ORGANIZERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY A. KISSINGER and ANTHONY DAY, Henry Kissinger is the unpaid honorary 
chairman of World Cup USA '94. Anthony Day is a Los Angeles Times senior 
correspondent. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first round of World Cup USA '94 fulfilled practically all the hopes of 
the organizers. It had the largest crowds in World Cup history, and they were 
enthusiastic and good-natured -- even in heat that ranged from searing to 
merely slow, moist baking. It had surprises, especially America's stunning 
defeat of Colombia. And it had spell-binding soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 The first round showed a more spirited kind of soccer than the host Italians 
-- and the world -- saw four years ago. There have been more goals, more 
playing to win, less playing to tie. The games have moved faster, with fewer 
histrionic injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is due, at least in part, to rule changes FIFA made to pull the first 
part of the tournament out of the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rule prohibiting the goalkeeper from picking up the ball if passed to 
him by his own teammates reduced the number of backward passes. It added some 
tension whenever the goalkeeper was obliged to act like another field player in 
playing the ball with his feet and clearly added fluidity to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Awarding the winning teams three points instead of the traditional two placed 
a premium on winning and enabled some teams -- such as Russia and Bulgaria -- 
that had seemed hopelessly out of contention for the round of 16 to compete for 
it until the last day of the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that only eight teams were eliminated in the first round and four 
third-place teams advanced caused some of the last games to encourage an 
excessively complicated mathematics. For example, when Mexico played Italy it 
knew that if it scored one goal it was likely to advance so long as it did not 
lose; Italy required two goals and a tie (of course, a victory would solve its 
problem). Mexico achieved its objective by tying, 1-1, and Italy was saved at 
the last minute by the collapse of Cameroon against Russia, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup '98, which will be played in France, will not have this problem. 
Instead of 24 teams, which must be whittled down by an elaborate point system 
to 16 for the second round, there will be 32 teams in the first round, playing 
in eight groups of four. The round of 16 will be composed of the two top teams 
in each group. 
</P>
<P>
 A few more rule changes would open up the game even more -- perhaps some 
modification of the offside rule. As of now, the low scores reflect not so much 
defensive tactics as the superb conditioning of the athletes. This enables all 
10 field players both to attack and to defend, thus at times producing a 
congestion in front of the mouth of the goal, leading too often to scores from 
defensive mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opening round, there was a marked contrast between the almost 
scientific European style and the more imaginative brand of soccer associated 
with Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, each group had a representative of that style. In addition to 
Brazil, Argentina and Mexico played fast and aggressively. Two African teams, 
Nigeria and Cameroon, applied the same style and played with tremendous verve, 
at least until the Cameroonians fell apart against Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The big and pleasant surprise was the style of Saudi Arabia and Morocco, which 
played a fluid and attractive game. Saudi Arabia deservedly advanced, and 
Morocco was not far from doing so, even though it won no games. A little more 
experience will put it over the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil, which to its grief experimented with the European style four years 
ago, has become its old exuberant self. Against Russia, against the unlucky 
Cameroonians, Brazil sent waves of successful attacks. It contented itself with 
the tie it needed against a dogged and muscular Sweden when Romario displayed 
his and Brazil's style at its best with a dazzling goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The favorite before the first round, Brazil still looks like one of the very 
best. Its principal weakness seems to be a tendency to exhaust itself in 
ballhandling and to forget that scoring is the ultimate purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina, the champion in 1986 and the runner-up in 1990, looked good, too. 
It played a most attractive game in the first round. But Diego Maradona's 
forced departure for a failed drug test will probably hurt his team, which will 
surely miss his pinpoint passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria seems not far behind. Judging by Cameroon in 1990 and Nigeria this 
year, African soccer shares qualities of Latin soccer: imagination, drive, a 
certain beauty. The prospect of more good African teams over the next years is 
a boost for the future of the game. In future World Cups, the African champion 
will, in all likelihood, be among the semifinalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The European style of soccer is sinking in stereotypes. You watch a team like 
Norway's for instance, with great sympathy for the players and their fans, but 
with impatience with such a defensive style that quickly becomes boring. 
</P>
<P>
 You cannot, however, readily call Germany boring, because Germany, as always, 
brings to the game discipline, thoroughness and skill. But in the first two 
games of the first round, it seemed much too hackneyed, perhaps because this is 
essentially the same team that played four years ago. The players do all the 
right things -- more than any other team they open up the entire field. They 
supply textbook lessons of "total soccer." But in the first round they lacked 
allure and conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first 30 minutes of the game against plucky South Korea, Germany, led 
by Juergen Klinsmann, put on a great show of aggressive soccer. But then it 
wilted in the face of a combination of heat and determined South Korean attacks 
and nearly blew a three-goal lead. You had to wonder if Germany was too spent 
to grind through the tournament to the end. But then in the first game of the 
second round, Germany revived with a handsome game and beat a determined 
Belgium, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy is a strange team. No team has better players man for man; they are 
surely the highest paid in the tournament. Their technical skills are 
extraordinary; no team controls the ball better or passes it more skillfully. 
</P>
<P>
 But Italy has lacked drive. Its attacks avoided contact, and it rarely 
dribbled the ball past opponents, perhaps because its leading player, Roberto 
Baggio, has a strained Achilles' tendon. In none of its games did Italy show 
the daring that all the fans of the Azzurri have come to associate with its 
great teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless it repeats its recovery of 1982, when after a poor first round it 
emerged as the class and champion of the tournament, it will not even get to 
the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland, Ireland, Romania, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Spain all 
went into the second round, as did Mexico -- back in the World Cup after its 
exclusion for infractions by the country's youth soccer program. Mexico tied 
Italy, 1-1, by playing with heart and determination. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the pleasant surprises was South Korea's courageous struggle against 
much stronger teams that have much more experience, Spain and Germany. Its 2-2 
tie with Spain and its 3-2 loss to Germany in the torrid Cotton Bowl gave the 
team much to be proud of as it left the tournament. South Korea's performance 
was a beacon for the future of Asian soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the disappointing surprises was Colombia's unhappy fizzle. The team was 
acclaimed as the new Brazil. No less an authority than Pele predicted that 
Colombia would win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in its last game, against Switzerland, which it beat 2-0, did Colombia 
show the drive and flair that had made it famous. But Romania ran over it, 3-1, 
and then the United States, the beginners, the kids without a soccer tradition, 
the almost certain fourth-place finishers in their group of four, stunned 
Colombia, themselves and the world by winning, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't just that the Colombians played badly; they did indeed. But the U.S. 
team played well, aggressively and intelligently. It deserved the victory it 
got. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a victory that, we hope, will make a lasting contribution to the future 
of soccer in the United States. It was a victory that we don't believe should 
be overshadowed by America's 1-0 loss to Romania in a game in which the 
predictions about U.S. inexperience came all too true. 
</P>
<P>
 To have come to the round of 16 is a great thing for the American team and 
American soccer. To have come this far, only to find yourself staring straight 
into the eyes of the great Brazil on the Fourth of July in Stanford Stadium -- 
well, it is the ultimate confirmation that America has reached the big leagues 
of soccer.

WORLD CUP USA '94 ROUND OF 16; COMMENTARY; WHEN IN L.A., IT'S NOT EASY TO DO AS 
ROMANIANS DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN CHAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Suddenly, the capital of Romania is Los Angeles. Romania 3, Colombia 1, at the 
Rose Bowl; Romania 1, United States 0, at the Rose Bowl. Now it's 
Romania-Argentina at the Rose Bowl today -- and with a victory, it's on to the 
quarterfinals at Stanford, and a victory there and Romania will be back in 
Pasadena for the semifinals and World Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 This is our team. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrescu. Popescu. Lupescu. Munteanu. Dumitrescu. Hagi. Belodedici. (Hey, it's 
got to be Vanna White's favorite team.) 
</P>
<P>
 So I figured somewhere in this Carpathian-crazed town, there were Romanian 
discos, Romanian bookstores, Romanian clothiers, Romanian boutiques, Romanian 
florists. 
</P>
<P>
 I figured wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Bucharest, this ain't. 
</P>
<P>
 About 24 million people live in Romania, and most of them have decided not to 
relocate to Los Angeles. Who can blame them? Only 2% of Romanians own an 
automobile, only 15% own a TV set. (Corresponding rates for L.A.: 106% and 
117%.) If you move here, you can't even get out of LAX without a car and you 
can't even find work without a TV script. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only 20,000 residents of Romanian descent in the Southland, with the 
greatest concentration in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 I went looking for them. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a Romanian Orthodox Church in Glendale, but they wouldn't convert me 
by game time. 
</P>
<P>
 There is world-famous Hollywood Boulevard, which is sort of Transylvania East. 
(Believe you me, ladies and gentlemen, if you stand on the corner of Hollywood 
and Highland long enough, you're bound to see folks dressed like Dracula.) 
</P>
<P>
 There is Greco's New York Pizzeria, a chain of L.A. pizzerias owned by the 
cousin of Romanian midfielder Gheorghe Hagi. I went to one of the two Greco's 
on Hollywood Boulevard and asked for Haji's cousin. The pizza man responded, 
"Haji who?" (For this I put a quarter in the meter?) 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, there is Mignon's Romanian restaurant on Vine in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 I went there Wednesday night for dinner but was turned away -- Mignon's had 
just hosted the Romanian soccer team and 100 of its supporters, who came by for 
a homesick meal before going off to Universal Studios. (Tcch. Tourists. Like 
the "Back to the Future" ride is any better than going down the Danube in a 
raft.) There would be no silverware -- or service -- for at least an hour, so I 
was advised to come back later. 
</P>
<P>
 I returned Thursday for lunch and talked with co-owner Daniel Popescu, 33. 
Popescu's family had fled communism in Romania in 1976 and asked for political 
asylum here. His family opened the restaurant in 1984, and Popescu and partner 
Mihai Istrate bought it from Popescu's aunt in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I ordered, I asked Popescu to characterize Romanian food. "We use a lot 
of garlic, some paprika," he said. "It's mostly beef, pork and chicken. It is a 
mixture of all the many people who have occupied Romania over the years -- 
there are Arabic influences, Hungarian influences, Austrian and German 
influences." 
</P>
<P>
 I then briefly considered the ciorba de burta (beef tripe soup) or the 
cashcaval pane (breaded cheese) or the mamaliguta cu brinza si smintina (hot 
corn meal with sour cream and feta cheese), but I settled for the mititei 
(skinless sausage) and french fries (french fries). Along with the matzo ball 
soup that came before the dish, it was a delicious bargain at $5.25. 
</P>
<P>
 I passed on dessert but asked the waitress about coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have regular and decaf -- and Romanian coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 "Romanian coffee?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Turkish coffee," she said. "It's kind of strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, and Machiavelli was kind of Machiavellian. I took one sip of this coffee 
and jolted back to childbirth -- it cleared my sinuses, cleared up my skin and 
wiped out five years of a bad marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving Mignon's, I was determined to find other Romanian delicacies to 
perhaps create my own Romanian feast at home. But Popescu had told me that 
would be difficult, that several Romanian restaurants and markets had closed in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 First I ventured to Chalet Gourmet on Sunset Boulevard. It had food items from 
more than 20 countries -- among them Greece, Portugal, Hungary, Jamaica, 
Morocco, even Texas ("fajitas marinade") -- but nothing from Romania. Chalet 
Gourmet did carry one Romanian wine: Premiat Pinot Noir, a soft and velvety red 
wine from the Dealul Mare region ("Chill Before Serving"). I grabbed it at 
$4.99. 
</P>
<P>
 I then made my way to Bucharest Grocery on Hollywood Boulevard, co-owned by 
Turkish emigres Diran Mutafyan and Kevoric Gulbenkian. They had bought the 
market from its original Romanian owner 20 years ago, and though they stocked 
smoked fish and homemade eggplant and Bulgarian and Hungarian cheeses, they, 
too, carried no food items from Romania. In fact, it was a bit disappointing to 
see Pringles and Nestle's Quik on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 (Incidentally, I asked Mutafyan, 67, if he had been watching the World Cup. He 
answered matter-of-factly, "Of course," and looked at me in a way as if to 
indicate that was the single stupidest question he had ever been asked. You 
know, I guess it was.) 
</P>
<P>
 This left me on a beeline for Bargain Circus on La Brea, a virtual culinary 
junkyard featuring canned, bottled and packaged items from the world over, 
including parts of which that haven't even been discovered. If it ain't in the 
Circus, it ain't circulating. And again, there were not any products from 
Romania. So I settled for Riga-smoked sprats from Latvia (69 cents), sea salt 
from Sicily ($1.49) and pineapple chunks from Thailand (69 cents) and figured 
I'd improvise. 
</P>
<P>
 I went home to improvise. 
</P>
<P>
 First I called 411 and asked for Nadia Comaneci -- I figured it would be nice 
to have a Romanian date for the evening -- but, naturally, she had an unlisted 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I closed my eyes and tried to visualize all the wonderful things I had 
seen on the Mignon menu -- Romanian stuffed cabbage, veal stew, herring salad, 
white caviar -- to inspire me. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I realized, I had absolutely no idea of what I was doing. My cooking 
expertise is limited to a microwave and Season-All. How was I going to create a 
gourmet Romanian meal? 
</P>
<P>
 I settled for a grilled cheese sandwich and the Premiat. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good thing I had chilled the wine.

WORLD CUP USA '94 ROUND OF 16; BLOOM IS OFF THE ROSE BOWL FOR BELEAGUERED 
ARGENTINA; TODAY'S GAME: PLIGHT OF MARADONA, CANIGGIA'S INJURY ON ARGENTINES' 
MINDS AS THEY PREPARE TO FACE HAGI-LED ROMANIA.

 The Diego-less days of July have not exactly been flying by for Argentina as 
it prepares for its round-of-16 game against Romania today at the Rose Bowl in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Diego Maradona, the brilliant yet seemingly star-crossed midfielder, might be 
out of sight but he hasn't been out of his teammates' minds since testing 
positive for using five banned stimulants and being kicked out of the World Cup 
on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 Maradona has had plenty to say from his New England hideout in Merrimack, N.H. 
-- mostly ripping FIFA, soccer's world governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates? 
</P>
<P>
 Nada.  
</P>
<P>
 Practice was closed Friday. The same was going to happen Saturday but there 
was a change of heart. But nobody was made available to the press after a light 
30-minute workout. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently the players were unhappy they even had to show up at the Rose Bowl 
to stretch. They wanted to stay at the team hotel and watch the final minutes 
of Spain's 3-0 victory over Switzerland. Finally, an appeal from the president 
of Argentina's soccer federation got the boys on the bus, according to FIFA 
spokesman Keith Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of Maradona hit the Argentines hard psychologically in their 2-0 loss 
to Bulgaria on Thursday in the final game of group play. And on top of that, 
the status of forward Claudio Caniggia is a growing concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Caniggia nor defender Roberto Sensini practiced Saturday. Sensini, 
whose injury was not disclosed, did not play against Bulgaria. Caniggia left 
the Bulgaria match in the 22nd minute, having re-injured his left big toe. 
</P>
<P>
 He originally suffered the injury during a pre-World Cup practice at Babson 
Park, Mass., when a teammate accidentally stomped on his foot. Caniggia, just 
coming off a 13-month suspension for cocaine use, said he had problems making 
sudden stops and kicking the ball.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though Caniggia has scored twice in three games, the toe has continued to 
bother him and he also hurt his hamstring because he has been favoring the leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he will play today is difficult to say. Some believe Caniggia was 
pulled from the Bulgarian match because Argentina was already assured of 
advancing. And he certainly wouldn't miss anything by not practicing. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania, in contrast to the Argentines, had a relatively quiet week. This 
isn't to say there was an absence of controversy among the Romanians. 
Midfielder Ion Vladoiu, a non-starter, was sent home for poor behavior on and 
off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 And Coach Anghel Iordanescu sparred with Romanian reporters at a spirited news 
conference during the week after being accused by them of playing favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am saddened by these accusations of using feelings toward the players," he 
said through a translator. "I have no feelings toward anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Romania is led by star midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, who has scored twice. 
However, it will be without high-scoring forward, Florin Raducioiu. He received 
his second yellow card of the first round in the 1-0 victory over the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Money and other perks are being dangled in front of the Romanians. Romania's 
starters already have earned as much as $22,000 for reaching the second round. 
And each starter was given a new Mercedes-Benz by a Romanian businessman before 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, Hagi would rather help Romania reach the quarterfinals, which would 
be its best World Cup performance ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more important to score a goal than to pick up a Mercedes," he said.

WORLD CUP USA '94 ROUND OF 16; VOELLER MAKES HIS TEAM TWICE AS TOUGH; GERMANY: 
VETERAN FORWARD PROVIDES SOME NEEDED HELP FOR KLINSMANN WITH TWO GOALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Talk about stealing the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 What Rudi Voeller did to Juergen Klinsmann at Soldier Field on Saturday 
bordered on grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Klinsmann, the dashing blond star of the German team, came into the game as 
the World Cup's second-leading scorer, having found the net four times. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored his fifth goal to the delight of many in the rain-drenched crowd of 
60,246 to take his total to five and leave him one shy of Russia's Oleg 
Salenko. 
</P>
<P>
 So what did Voeller do? He scored twice to power Germany to a 3-2 victory over 
Belgium and earn the praise of not only his own coach, Berti Vogts, but Belgium 
Coach Paul Van Himst. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a 34-year-old who retired from the national team two years ago and 
had to be persuaded by Vogts to come to America for one last hurrah. 
</P>
<P>
 Voeller is one of the great strikers in German history, ranking with such 
players as Gerd Muller and Karlheinz Rummenigge. In 85 appearances before his 
retirement after the 1992 European Championship in Sweden, he scored 44 goals, 
better than one every other game. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Klinsmann were the goal-scoring force behind West Germany's 1990 World 
Cup triumph, but few had expected him to even come to the United States, let 
alone shine here. 
</P>
<P>
 On a wet and windy Chicago afternoon, however, Voeller showed he has not lost 
the magic touch. His performance came like an answer to Vogts' prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not think I could last seven full games," Voeller said, assuming like 
the Germans always do that they will reach the championship game, "but I 
thought I could help my team." 
</P>
<P>
 That understatement came after a questioner had asked whether Voeller was 
frustrated at not having started any of Germany's first three games. He came on 
as a substitute late in the 1-1 tie with Spain, but did not play at all in the 
opener against Bolivia, a 1-0 German victory, or in the 3-2 victory over South 
Korea in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it appears he and Klinsmann have rekindled their successful partnership 
and Germany suddenly is a much more potent force. Its chances of winning the 
World Cup, in some doubt after earlier performances that were no more than 
average, rose considerably Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have known each other a long time," Voeller said of Klinsmann, "and we 
have played many games together for the national team, so each of us knows how 
the other is moving around and positioning himself. But today we must be fair 
and say that it was the whole team that defeated Belgium." 
</P>
<P>
 Voeller, who plays his club soccer for Olympique Marseille in France after 
several years with AS Roma in Italy, took less than six minutes to make an 
impact on the Belgians. A lofted pass found him level with two defenders, his 
speed carried him past them and his shot into the far corner gave goalkeeper 
Michel Preud'homme no chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two minutes later, he was at it again, but this time Preud'homme 
managed to grab Voeller's powerful header. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 11th minute, after Belgium had tied the score, Voeller and Klinsmann 
combined on a classic move. A back-heel pass from Klinsmann put Voeller clear, 
and his return pass to Klinsmann was rocketed into the net to restore Germany's 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of the half, the duo continued to plague the Belgian defense, and 
Voeller was rewarded with a second goal in the 40th minute when he leaped to 
head home a corner kick from Thomas Haessler. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when their moves did not result in a goal, Voeller and Klinsmann were a 
delight to watch -- Klinsmann the sprinter, flowing down the field with the 
ball at his feet; Voeller cutting the defense to shreds with darting runs from 
all positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he held his back and winced a couple of times during the postgame 
news conference, Voeller showed during the game he has lost none of his ability 
in the air, either. He was constantly outjumping Belgian defenders and was 
unlucky not to score at least one more goal. 
</P>
<P>
 A sharp, downward header by Voeller in the 77th minute was cleared off the 
goal line by Belgian captain Georges Grun. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes earlier, Germany put together perhaps its finest move of the 
game, and it was Voeller who initiated it. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding himself out on the left wing, Voeller drew a defender toward him, then 
back-heeled the ball to Haessler. Haessler immediately crossed it into the 
middle to the onrushing Matthias Sammer and Sammer passed the ball to 
Klinsmann, who was open on his right. Klinsmann raced into the penalty area, 
but Preud'homme was alert to the danger and came out to block the German 
striker's shot. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems certain, now, that Vogts will try to keep Voeller and Klinsmann as 
his two forwards for the remainder of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The warning has been sounded. Germany's deadly duo is back and the target is 
the World Cup.

WORLD CUP USA '94 ROUND OF 16; COMMENTARY; SO FAR, SOCCER HAS BASEBALL ON 
0-AND-2 COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The international and national pastimes are going head to head on the same 
soil for the first time -- their soccer vs. our baseball -- and, in an upset, 
the national pastime is getting kicked around a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 According to numbers released by ESPN this week, its telecast of the United 
States-Colombia World Cup game drew a rating of 4.5 -- better than twice the 
1.9 share the network has been averaging for its prime-time baseball telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 How is this possible, you ask? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, I can think of a reason or two, or 30. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 1. Soccer has Alexi Lalas, the wild-maned, orange-goateed, rock 
guitar-playing, cherry Slurpee-swilling, head-banging United States defender 
who is given to such off-kilter observations as, "We need the culture police in 
the stands, saying, 'Hey, it's culture, leave it alone.' So what if they're 
sacrificing a goat, let it go. It's the World Cup." Baseball has Tom Lawless. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Soccer players are paid huge sums of money for their unparalleled skill, 
agility, stamina, leg strength and midair acrobatics. Baseball players are paid 
huge sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Soccer players run virtually nonstop for 90 minutes despite searing 
temperatures that sometimes reach 120 degrees. Baseball players beat out an 
infield grounder and complain that there's no beer in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 4. With two 45-minute halves, a 15-minute intermission and two to five minutes 
of "injury time," most soccer games finish in less than two hours. After two 
hours, many baseball games aren't out of the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Soccer players play the ball off their shins, thighs, ankles, knees, 
chests, hips and heads. When he plays left field for the Phillies, so does Pete 
Incaviglia. 
</P>
<P>
 6. After soccer games, fans light fireworks and throw them in the air. After 
baseball games, players light fireworks and throw them at the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 7. When someone scores a goal on a Univision World Cup telecast, Andres Cantor 
notes the event with a frenzied, passionate, up-from-the-diaphragm exhortation 
of "GOOOOOOOOOOOL!" Baseball hasn't heard anything like it since "The Giants 
win the pennant!" and that was 43 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 8. No on-base percentage, slugging percentage, total average, total bases, 
quality starts, at-bats-to-home run ratio, at-bats-to-bench-clearing-brawl 
ratio and national-anthem-sung-on-artificial-turf-with-the-wind-blowing-out 
efficiency in soccer. Just goals. 
</P>
<P>
 9. That bicycle kick Marcelo Balboa almost put in against Colombia? Let's see 
Kent Hrbek try it. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Scoreboard watching: On the day the Netherlands defeated Morocco, 2-1, to 
clinch first place in Group F, the A's and the Angels played to a nil-nil draw 
before Scott Brosius' solo home run in the bottom of the ninth. That's the 
problem with baseball. Too many 1-0 games. 
</P>
<P>
 11. Marge Schott doesn't own a soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 12. Under baseball's drug-abuse policy, Diego Maradona would have six more 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 13. No Bebeto trading cards on the Home Shopping Network. 
</P>
<P>
 14. A Russian scoring five goals in a World Cup match against Cameroon is like 
Rex Hudler hitting five grand slams in Game 3 of the World Series. The 
difference is that in soccer, these things do happen. 
</P>
<P>
 15. A corner kick in soccer is a suspenseful and exciting play, often 
resulting in the ball being headed toward the net at an impossible angle and 
the goalkeeper leaping out of his socks to try to thwart it. A corner kick in 
baseball means Dean Palmer has booted another one. 
</P>
<P>
 16. In soccer's "group of death," Italy, Ireland, Mexico and Norway all 
finished with .500 records. In baseball's "group of death," the Rangers, 
Mariners, A's and Angels should be so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 17. When soccer players grab their crotches in public -- bracing for a free 
kick that will send the ball screaming toward their midsections at 90 to 100 
m.p.h. -- they do so for a very good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 18. George Will doesn't write about soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 19. Tony Meola, smart Jersey kid, was drafted by the New York Yankees, decided 
he'd rather play for the World Cup Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 20. In soccer, Bora is a coach. In baseball, Bora is an often-used descriptive 
term for the game in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 21. One-named soccer players such as Romario and Bebeto have an almost 
mystical, mythical air about them. If baseball tried the same thing, we'd be 
left with Chuck, Hal, Phil, George and Fred. 
</P>
<P>
 22. No rotisserie soccer leagues. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
 23. Group play in the World Cup -- where four teams play for two weeks to 
eliminate the weak sisters before moving onto the second round -- is a great 
idea baseball should adopt immediately. If baseball had group play, the Angels 
would be in Trinidad today, trying to qualify for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 24. International soccer writers have the right idea: Don't bother with 
postgame quotes, just rip away from atop the ivory tower. American baseball 
writers, meanwhile, waste the best years of their adult lives waiting alongside 
rank locker stalls so they fill their game reports with such pithy 
pronouncements as, "I was just looking for something to hit," and, "I been 
throwing a whole lot better since Marcel changed my arm angle." 
</P>
<P>
 25. In soccer, the Old Boys Club is a professional team in Argentina. In 
baseball, it's the managerial pool. 
</P>
<P>
 26. In soccer, players can't handle the ball with their hands. In baseball, 
neither can Jose Offerman. 
</P>
<P>
 27. At a Netherlands World Cup game, you can hear the fans humming the 
triumphal march from "Aida." At an Ireland World Cup game, you can hear the 
fans belting out the timeless standard "Molly Malone." At a Minnesota Twins' 
game, you can hear the fans singing along to John Denver's "Thank God I'm A 
Country Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 28. Soccer uniforms are cooler than baseball uniforms. That 
traffic-pylon-in-a-paint-fight number worn by Mexican goalie Jorge Campos has 
the Houston Astros eating their hearts out. 
</P>
<P>
 29. No one in baseball can tailgate like the Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
 30. In both soccer and baseball, strikers are expected to dominate the 
headlines this summer. Only in soccer, this is considered a good thing.

STRAWBERRY TALKS OF NINE YEARS OF ABUSE; BASEBALL: AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HELD BY 
THE GIANTS, FORMER DODGER STAR SAYS HE FINALLY IS FREE OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a somewhat different Darryl Strawberry who faced the media Saturday at 
Candlestick Park, the first time he has spoken publicly since he went AWOL from 
the Dodgers on Easter Sunday and entered the Betty Ford Center for treatment of 
drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry appeared to be more open than in the past, saying for the first 
time that he had been a consistent user of drugs and alcohol for all but the 
first two years of his 11 years in baseball. Flanked by his brother, Michael, 
and Manager Dusty Baker, Strawberry said he doesn't really know what he is 
capable of doing on the field free of alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am looking forward to walking on a baseball field for the first time with a 
clear mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy opening statement and the formalities of presenting Strawberry 
with a San Francisco Giant jersey -- he will wear No. 17 -- Strawberry said he 
had lived his baseball career "on the edge." 
</P>
<P>
 "I played baseball because I loved the game but I didn't focus on life, I 
focused on what the outside of life was -- nightclubs, drinking, partying, 
women, and it's a serious matter you have to deal with," he said. "The key for 
me was getting honest with Darryl. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . It was a very consistent abuse throughout the last nine years, and 
like I said, I was in denial. I really isolated myself from everybody the 
majority of the time. But I am out of it today, and now I can sit here and 
explain the abuse of alcohol and drugs over the years, but I'm lucky to be 
alive. I could be Len Bias or someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Strawberry's drug abuse began while he was with the New York Mets, he 
said it continued when he returned home to Los Angeles and signed with the 
Dodgers before the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was easier for me (in L.A.) , I grew up there and knew all the back 
streets," he said. "It was an unfortunate situation, but I don't take anything 
away from the Dodger organization, they gave me a great opportunity. But I took 
the wrong action and I had to pay a price for that. " 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry says he holds no grudge against Manager Tom Lasorda, who described 
Strawberry's substance-abuse problem as a weakness, not a disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy is a wonderful guy and he just has his opinion," Strawberry said. "I 
still love Tommy and always will." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry had completed a program for alcohol abuse in 1990, but said he 
didn't follow the aftercare program, believing he could do it himself. To help 
him this time, Strawberry's brother, Michael, will travel with him and make 
arrangements in each city for Strawberry to attend Alcoholic Anonymous 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't work the program, you are going to relapse," Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Strawberry's participation in the news conference ended abruptly, when, in 
an uncharacteristic public display, he broke down when asked when he first 
realized he was no longer in denial. 
</P>
<P>
 As he recalled going in front of his peers at the center, he began to cry and 
Baker took him away to the Giant clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry will begin a minor league stint at the club's triple-A team in 
Phoenix on Monday.

HOT WHEELS; MORENO GOING PLACES -- ON ROLLER SKATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter how far she travels, Jill Moreno can't duck the inevitable mix-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the other day a young man who probably should know better asked her which 
of the 37 Olympic Festival athletic events she was participating in. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roller skating, huh? You mean like this?" he said, jabbing with both his 
elbows. 
</P>
<P>
 This from another athlete no less. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think I do roller derby," said Moreno, a 17-year-old student at Rio 
Mesa High. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even close. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno is an artistic roller skater, which might evoke the image of a scantily 
clad tattooed person slaloming around gawkers at Venice Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Moreno's sport is similar to figure skating -- only without ice, 
large crowds and big money. 
</P>
<P>
 As in figure skating, the athletes are graded on appearance, flow, degree of 
difficulty and artistic impression as they perform routines to music. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike ice skaters, roller skaters train and compete in relative anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno, U.S. junior singles champion, is a household name only in her family's 
Oxnard residence. For that matter, fame also has eluded world champion Rachelle 
Hanson of Ontario, the favorite in today's Olympic Festival competition. 
</P>
<P>
 There are reasons for that, of course. Figure skating is faster, smoother and 
more graceful. However, it is no more demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Roller skaters perform routines similar in length, but their renditions 
include more jumps and longer combinations of jumps using equipment weighing 
three times more than ice skates. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno is a good figure skater and might have chosen to compete in that sport 
were she more dedicated and if her family was able to afford the 
$20,000-$30,000 per year cost of training. 
</P>
<P>
 She started roller skating seven years ago at the urging of a friend who was 
starting up the competitive ranks. It wasn't long before Moreno was the better 
of the two skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was doing this for fun," Moreno said. "Then all of a sudden it turned into 
this big thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Even she seems a bit oblivious as to exactly how big. 
</P>
<P>
 In a battle between love of sport and the temptations of adolescence, roller 
skating may be losing out. 
</P>
<P>
 If she does not qualify for the world championships in Italy by finishing in 
the top three at the national championships in August, Moreno said she might 
quit the sport and devote her time to being a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 Her situation is a classic paradox. Moreno's goal is to compete in the world 
championships, yet she is not sure she is willing to commit the time that might 
take. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, she believes her chances of a top finish in her first 
nationals against top competition are not very good. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're a newcomer the judges usually don't even consider you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are offering a more optimistic view. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watching her today, she has the content to challenge the top guns," said 
Adolph Wacker, manager of the U.S. national team and its former coach. "She's 
going to compete for a medal here, possibly even a gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Wacker agreed that Moreno faces an uphill climb in her effort to qualify for 
the world championships, but he does not entirely count her out. 
</P>
<P>
 "That third spot is sometimes used -- in ice skating too -- for a newcomer to 
get a taste of it," Wacker said. "That's where she might fit in." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two years ago, Moreno temporarily quit the sport when she felt that 
training was cramping her social life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could say I was into boys," Moreno said. "I wanted to go on dates 
and talk on the phone instead of practice." 
</P>
<P>
 That time, she couldn't stay away. In June last year, three weeks before the 
junior regional, Moreno resumed training. 
</P>
<P>
 She won the regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks later, she was national junior champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Being away from skating, she said, was "fun at first. But then it got boring." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Moreno has been training more than ever -- sometimes four or five 
hours a day -- with her coach, Karin Miller, owner of a rink in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who became a U.S. citizen last week, is a former German gymnastics 
champion who Moreno says is "like a second mother." 
</P>
<P>
 The motherly side of Miller understands Moreno's predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's her senior year," Miller said. "She's looking around, trying to figure 
out what she wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But the coach in Miller would like for Moreno to continue. "She has the 
ability, the natural talent," Miller said of the young woman she calls her 
"prize possession." 
</P>
<P>
 Wacker agrees. "When she gets a little more experience, in another year or two 
maybe, she'll be our next champion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno isn't so sure. She would like to party with her friends. She would like 
to go dancing. She would like to begin studying to become a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 In roller skating, there are no career dividends. The top three performers at 
nationals receive money for training costs. That's it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the mounting pressure which she places on herself. 
</P>
<P>
 In the overall scheme of things, the Olympic Festival is only a tuneup for 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be fun," Moreno said. "But for me there is pressure because the 
people here are so good. When I see that, I get nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 If butterflies are a problem, it didn't show while she was working out 
Saturday. Moreno seemed at ease during a particularly strong practice program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her double axel is very good, better than anybody in this event, except for 
maybe one," Wacker said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to Hanson, who accomplished a skating hat trick last year by 
winning Olympic festival, national and world titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno is capable of going a turn further in practice, but she has not 
attempted a triple jump in competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Others do, Miller said, "But they cheat, sometimes three-quarters or at least 
a half a turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Triples will not become a part of Moreno's routine until they are perfected. 
Her choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's right that people cheat them," she said. "It just doesn't 
look good. Until I get mine right, I won't let anyone see them."

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; PARMENTER GETS GRIP ON GOLD OF HER OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years ago, when the Olympic Festival was in Los Angeles, Jennifer 
Parmenter helped hand out the medals. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she has one to keep. 
</P>
<P>
 Parmenter, 13, the youngest swimmer in the competition, won a gold medal 
Saturday in the 200-meter backstroke. "I hoped I would win one this time," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parmenter, of Granada Hills, finished in a time of 2 minutes 18.39 seconds, 
ahead of Erin Schatz of Agoura Hills, who won the silver medal in 2:19.09. "I 
was tired, but the last 50 (meters) I gave it my all," Parmenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Beck of Ventura finished in 2:20.63 for fifth, one place ahead of her 
former Buena High teammate, Mandy Walz of Ventura, whose time was 2:21.31. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Parmenter was fifth in the 100-meter freestyle with a time 
of 58.94. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Gilman, 14, from Ventura, won a bronze medal in the 800-meter 
freestyle in 8:57.18. 
</P>
<P>
 In tennis, Ania Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks continued to win. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded player in women's singles, Bleszynski, 17, cruised to a 6-1, 
6-3 decision over Kristen Sanderson of Pinellas Park, Fla., in the opening 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stanford-bound former Harvard-Westlake High standout will meet hometown 
favorite Laura Guidon in the second round today. 
</P>
<P>
 Guidon, of St. Louis, drew enthusiastic support from an overflow crowd during 
her 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (9-7) decision over Katy Propstra of Paradise Island, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 In mixed doubles, Bleszynski teamed with Mark Loughrin from Greendale, Wis., 
to down David Sutton of San Juan, P.R., and Mary Carlisle-White of Spartanburg, 
S.C., 6-4, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory Monday will put Bleszynski and Loughrin in Wednesday's gold medal 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 In canoeing, Joe Harper and David Spaulding of Ventura won a silver medal in 
the 1,000-meter race in a time of 4:16.97. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Werland of Ventura teamed with David Serafin of San Diego to place sixth 
in 4:44.12. 
</P>
<P>
 In archery, Mark Hainline and Justin Huish, both from Simi Valley, qualified 
for Monday's elimination round. Teri Chang of Northridge failed to make the cut 
in the women's competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Janik of Simi Valley was ousted in the semifinal round of one-meter 
springboard diving. 
</P>
<P>
 In team handball, the West defeated the North, 23-17, behind four first-half 
goals by Jim Hop of Camarillo and six second-half goals by Mike Hurdle of 
Reseda.

SAUGUS SPEEDWAY; MINTEY ANGRY AFTER LOSING TO WOODSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON STAPP, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tempers flared following the Sportsman main event Saturday night at Saugus 
Speedway and as a result defending track champion Pat Mintey Jr. of Quartz Hill 
has vowed not to return to the one-third of a mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
 Things heated up following the 30-lap feature race won by Sean Woodside of 
Saugus over a controversial pass on the 14th lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not coming back," said Mintey, who led Woodside by 15 points before the 
race. "We'll find somewhere else to race." 
</P>
<P>
 Mintey lost the lead to Woodside after the two made contact coming out of turn 
two. Mintey finished seventh and was upset that Woodside was not penalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodside had a different view. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got underneath him once before . . . that's what this is from," Woodside 
said, pointing to a black mark on the front spoiler of his car. "I got under 
him again and he tried to cut down on me and he lost it." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodside held off a strong challenge from former champion Gary Sigman of 
Carson to register his second victory and eighth top five finish in 10 starts 
this season.

CRESPI YOUNGSTERS GROWING UP IN SUMMER; LEGION BASEBALL: ENCINO, COMPOSED OF 
CELT PLAYERS, RALLIES, 8-7. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Muckey just keeps churning them out. 
</P>
<P>
 And if his Encino American Legion team is any indication, Muckey is building 
yet another strong high school aggregation. Encino, composed entirely of 
players who will return to Crespi High, beat Westlake-Royal, 8-7, Saturday in 
an interdistrict game at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a good sophomore group," said Muckey, who conveniently coaches both 
the Encino Legion and Crespi High teams. "That's not a secret." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those youngsters is Chris Hebert, who drove in the tying run with a 
triple in the top of the ninth then scored the winning run on a sacrifice fly. 
Then he pitched the bottom of the ninth, picking up his first save. 
</P>
<P>
 Muckey uses only players who are returning to Crespi. Most of the Encino 
players this summer will be juniors. The team is 12-1, 11-1 in District 20 
play. This victory was significant because Westlake-Royal (14-3-1) is the top 
team in District 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real happy with how we hit the ball," Muckey said. "They were pitching 
their (second-string) guys, but they were still probably the best pitchers 
we've seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal Coach Mike McClure was saving his top pitchers for a 
doubleheader today against Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Devine started for Westlake-Royal but was taken out in the fourth inning. 
Bill Treese then pitched 4 1/3 strong innings, leaving the game with a 7-6 
lead. David Vicari (0-1) came on but couldn't hold off Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Beamon walked with one out in the ninth, and scored on Hebert's triple 
into the left-center field gap. Chris Crawley hit a fly ball to shallow center 
and Hebert scored ahead of the throw to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert, who was wild, had trouble holding the lead in the bottom of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 After a walk and consecutive forceouts at second, he threw a wild pitch and 
balked, putting the tying run at third. He hit Matt Riordan, but Tim Carr 
popped up to the shortstop to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino's Jon Cuccias (3-0), who pitched the bottom of the eighth, picked up 
the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Farlow had two doubles, and Brett Niles, Jessie Slade and Ray Munoz each 
had two hits for Encino. Charlie Hirsh hit a solo home run for Westlake-Royal.

ROOKIE CATCHER LIEBERTHAL GOES FROM BOX SEATS TO PHILLIES' BOX SCORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Lieberthal was standing no more than 75 yards from a spot where he had 
spent hundreds of evenings as a kid. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had come a long way. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberthal, a graduate of Westlake Village Westlake, was on the field at 
Dodger Stadium at about 4 p.m. Thursday, when Philadelphia Phillie shortstop 
Kevin Stocker gave him the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're in there tonight," Stocker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberthal, 22, in only his second day in the major leagues, was starting at 
catcher for the Phillies that night. Not only was it his major league debut, 
but in a stadium he'd dreamed about since he started coming with his family's 
field-level season tickets 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nervous?" Stocker asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not yet," Lieberthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes you are," Stocker replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't blame Lieberthal for the butterflies. He was, after all, preparing to 
start his major league career with dozens of friends and family members 
watching from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 About six hours later, though, the butterflies were gone and the baseball 
Lieberthal had lined for his first major league hit was tucked safely inside 
one of his shoes in his clubhouse cubicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the Phillies lost, 4-3, on a three-run double in the bottom of the 
ninth by Dodger second baseman Delino DeShields, Lieberthal was still smiling 
in the clubhouse after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have been really excited to get that win," Lieberthal said, "but now 
there's tomorrow and we've got a whole new game. Now I've gotten (the first 
game) over with." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberthal's debut was the culmination of 50 hours he'll never forget. THE 
JOURNEY 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberthal walked into the visitors' clubhouse in Rochester, N.Y., at about 11 
p.m. EDT, on Tuesday, just after he had played a doubleheader for the triple-A 
Scranton-Wilkes Barre (Pa.) Red Barons. At that point, the major leagues 
probably seemed too distant to think about. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, though, the Phillies were just a foul-tip away. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier that night in Philadelphia, Phillie catcher Darren Daulton was hit by 
two foul-tips, breaking his right collarbone. Dr. Phillip Marone, team 
physician, said it will be at least six weeks before Daulton will be back. 
</P>
<P>
 Scranton Manager Mike Quade called Lieberthal into his office after the game 
and told him he was on his way to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberthal called home just after he heard the news, and he told his mother, 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was kidding me," she said, "because we were getting ready to 
leave on Sunday for Scranton. I had everything done from the last detail. I was 
even packed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lieberthal's father, Dennis, a scout for the Detroit Tigers, was in Santa 
Maria coaching a scout league game Tuesday night and he couldn't be reached 
with news of Mike's promotion. So a friend of the Lieberthals' got the idea 
that Dennis had to know, no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
 So he called the Santa Maria Police Dept. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two police officers showed up at the field at about 9 and they told me to 
call home," Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frightening? A message from the police to call home? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Dennis said. "I would say so." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dennis heard the good news when he called home and he finally reached Mike 
at about 11 p.m. PDT. It was about 2 a.m. in Rochester, where Lieberthal wasn't 
sleeping too well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only got about two hours sleep that night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived in Philadelphia about 7:45 a.m. Wednesday and went straight to 
Veterans Stadium because, "I had no place else to go," he said. "I got there 
before the clubhouse guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberthal was in a daze through the Phillies-Marlins game that day, he said. 
He never got in the game and only left the dugout to go down to the bullpen in 
the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the game ended, he boarded a flight to Los Angeles, where the 
Phillies were starting an 11-game trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies' charter finally arrived in Los Angeles about 10 p.m. PDT. 
Lieberthal went directly to the hotel and "crashed," he said. THE PREGAME 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberthal slept late Thursday and went straight to Dodger Stadium, arriving 
about 1:30 p.m., 5 1/2 hours before the game.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Lieberthal had been coming to Dodger games since he was 7, sitting in 
his family's field box seats behind home plate, this was his first time on the 
field. He had one other opportunity, when he was scheduled to be recognized 
before a Dodger game in 1990 as the Southern Section 5-A player of the year, 
but he missed that because he had already left town to play minor league 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in a hurry to get (to the majors)," Dennis Lieberthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberthal, who signed for $250,000 the day the Phillies made him the third 
pick in the draft, played 416 minor league games before major league game No. 1 
on Thursday. A career .269 hitter in the minor leagues, Lieberthal is more 
advanced as a catcher than a hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 He was named the best defensive catcher in the double-A Eastern League in 1992 
and he threw out 47% of would-be base stealers last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillie Manager Jim Fregosi, who, as a special assistant to General Manager 
Lee Thomas, scouted Lieberthal before the Phillies drafted him, said he is 
impressed with how the 6-foot, 180-pound catcher has come along since he was a 
skinny high school kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put him next to most catchers in the majors," Fregosi said, "and he's as 
big or bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi decided to put Lieberthal in the lineup Thursday because, he said, 
it's important that rookies play as soon as possible after their first call-up, 
so they can work out the nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Thursday's game approached, Lieberthal's stomach was still churning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks nervous now," Dennis Lieberthal said from the stands, watching his 
son interviewed by another reporter about an hour before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 As Lieberthal jogged down into the right field corner for his final pregame 
stretches, the Dodgers honored Fernando Valenzuela, returning to Dodger Stadium 
with the Phillies. The stadium's video screen showed highlights of Valenzuela's 
career, including his debut in 1981, when Lieberthal was a 9-year-old with a 
ticket. THE GAME 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberthal was comfortable working with Phillie starter Bobby Munoz on 
Thursday night because they had worked together in Scranton. He seemed at ease 
behind the plate.  
</P>
<P>
 He gave up only one stolen base in the game, and he didn't even make a throw 
on that one. With runners at first and third and two outs in the bottom of the 
seventh, Brett Butler took off for second base, probably hoping to induce the 
rookie to throw so the Dodgers could steal home, but Lieberthal didn't bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberthal didn't have any first-game gaffes that will make funny stories to 
tell his grandchildren, except for the time he turned to flip the ball to home 
plate umpire Jerry Layne, who wasn't looking. The ball dribbled away into foul 
territory and Lieberthal had to chase it down. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, catching was no problem for Lieberthal, but he said he was 
nervous until his first at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
 It came in second inning, with two outs and nobody on base against Pedro 
Astacio. He jumped at the first pitch he saw in the major leagues, hitting a 
towering popup that Butler caught without moving a step in center field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just missed that one," Lieberthal said. "That pitch was right there and I 
just got under it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberthal came up again in the fourth, with two outs and Tony Longmire at 
first base. He took an Astacio fastball for a strike, then lined the next pitch 
over shortstop Rafael Bournigal's head into left field, for a single. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt great to get it over with," Lieberthal said. "I was just really 
excited." 
</P>
<P>
 As Lieberthal stood at first base, his picture was flashed on the stadium 
video screen above the graphic: "First major league hit." Lieberthal admitted 
he peeked up to look at himself on the screen. He then cracked a smile as the 
ball was retrieved and sent into the dugout for safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd congratulated him with polite applause, including one screaming 
woman. The voice seemed to be coming from the area where Lieberthal's mother 
was sitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was probably her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his remaining two trips to the plate, Lieberthal fouled out to left field 
on a 3-1 pitch in the seventh and he laid down a perfect sacrifice bunt in the 
ninth, setting up the Phillies' insurance run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies could have used a couple more runs, though. DeShields ruined 
Lieberthal's debut when he lined a bases-loaded double into the gap in 
left-center field. Lieberthal stood in front of home plate as three Dodgers 
crossed the plate, winning the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillie clubhouse was quiet after the game. A few reporters wandered in to 
talk to relief pitcher Doug Jones, who had given up the runs and was staring 
blankly into space, and a few more approached Lieberthal, who was upset about 
the loss, but still not too far from a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a lot better now," he said. "I was pretty nervous before the game 
started." THE FUTURE 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi said before Thursday's game that Lieberthal will play about three 
times a week, with Todd Pratt catching the other games, while Daulton is on the 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to give him the opportunity to play," Fregosi said. "I'm not going 
to bury him. I'm going to play him according to how well he does." 
</P>
<P>
 His chances for becoming an everyday major league catcher with the Phillies, 
though, seem to hinge on Daulton's health. Daulton, 32, is one of the National 
League's best catchers, but he has been plagued by injuries throughout his 
career and he recently commented that he wouldn't mind moving to another 
position to alleviate the stress on his knees. 
</P>
<P>
 The next six weeks might be Lieberthal's chance to audition for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't like to come up because someone gets hurt," he said, "but I'll try 
to do the best I can while I'm here."

LOUISVILLE'S YOUNG NOT QUITE READY TO SETTLE FOR TRIPLE-A RATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gerald Young's baseball resume, post-1992, can hardly be classified as 
glowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut by the Houston Astros after 4 1/2 years in the major leagues, Young spent 
about equal parts of 1993 with the Colorado Rockies, the triple-A Indianapolis 
Indians, the triple-A Calgary Cannons and, well, with no one -- he spent a 
month and a half last summer at his Houston home, unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Young, a 1982 Santa Ana Valley graduate, is with his fourth 
organization in a year -- the triple-A Louisville Redbirds -- praying that his 
name is not used in the same sentence as that nastiest of baseball terms -- 
journeyman . 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to spend my waning years in triple-A," said Young, who is 
batting .300 with an American Assn.-leading 29 doubles. "I know I have some 
good baseball left in me. I'm not ready to be Crash Davis (of the movie 'Bull 
Durham') yet." 
</P>
<P>
 If not for a few too many collisions with outfield walls and the effect of 
artificial turf on his legs, this 29-year-old outfielder might not be on a 
Crash course. 
</P>
<P>
 Young was once the scourge of National League basepaths, a leadoff hitter who 
set a team record with 65 stolen bases and hit .257 for the Astros in 1988. He 
also ranked third in the league in triples (nine) and led the club with 66 
walks and 79 runs that season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Young ran into unpadded fences twice in 1989, once in the Houston 
Astrodome and once in Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium, injuring and then 
re-injuring his right knee. The constant pounding of playing on artificial turf 
only made things worse. 
</P>
<P>
 His knee was not so severely injured that it required surgery, but occasional 
swelling forced him to have fluid drained from it about three times a year. 
Young, whose explosive first step allowed him to accelerate to full speed 
almost immediately, began to lose that which was most responsible for him 
reaching the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 His stolen base totals at Houston dropped from 65 in 1988 to 34 in '89, six in 
'90, 16 in '91 and 13 in '92. Young also spent a considerable amount of time 
from 1990-92 at triple-A Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The running, the stealing, the pounding on the turf over the years took its 
toll," Young said by telephone from Louisville. "It's like someone taking 200 
to 300 golf swings. After a while, you get a little sore." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Young's baseball swings been improving, perhaps the Astros could have 
overlooked his decreasing speed. But Young's average slipped to .175 in 1990, 
.218 in '91 and .184 in '92. 
</P>
<P>
 Having been reduced to a defensive replacement by the end of the 1992 season, 
Young finished the year in the minor leagues and signed as a free agent with 
Colorado, hoping for a fresh start with the expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a false start. 
</P>
<P>
 Young batted .340 in spring training and made the major league roster, but 
when the Rockies acquired power-hitting outfielder Dale Murphy in the first 
week of the 1993 season, there wasn't much need for a slap-hitting outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Young had only one hit in 19 at-bats in two months. The Rockies tried to 
option him to the minor leagues, but Young, who had a guaranteed major league 
contract, declined that assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado's response? It declined to keep Young in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 After his release, Young spent about six weeks at home, waiting for the phone 
to ring. The Cincinnati Reds finally called and offered him a spot at triple-A 
Indianapolis, where Young hit .301 with seven stolen bases in 32 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't tell me when I signed that I was a stop-gap player," Young said. 
"They had a couple injuries, but when their guys came back, they released me." 
</P>
<P>
 Young finished the season at Calgary, Seattle's triple-A team, batting .298 
with seven stolen bases in 25 games, but the Mariners decided not to retain the 
switch-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a good 1993, to say the least," Young said, "but I never lost 
confidence in my ability to play at the big league level." 
</P>
<P>
 Young brought that determination to the St. Louis Cardinals this season, and 
when the 6-foot-2, 185-pounder hit .333 in spring training, he thought he had 
earned a major league roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cardinal Manager Joe Torre elected to keep four outfielders (most teams 
have five) and 11 pitchers (most have 10), so Young again wound up in triple A, 
where he seems to be making the best of what at least is a more stable 
situation than his whirlwind tour in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Young is batting leadoff for a 47-37 team that is in the thick of the American 
Assn. race. He has scored 52 runs, knocked in 29 runs and has provided 
consistent defense in center field. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's played hard, worked hard, and done an outstanding job," Louisville 
Manager Joe Pettini said. "One thing I like about him is he has experience. He 
put up some good big-league numbers. We have a lot of kids in triple-A for the 
first time, and when they see a guy playing as hard as he has, they get the 
idea that they better bust their butts, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Pettini does have one complaint when it comes to Young, though. He'd like to 
see him run more often. Pettini has given Young the green light -- he can run 
any time he wants -- but Young treats it more like a yellow light. He has only 
10 stolen bases and has been caught stealing nine times. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a smart player -- we have a short right-field fence and he knows guys 
behind him can hit the ball out of the park, so he doesn't run as much," 
Pettini said. "But I told him that the one thing that will get him noticed (by 
major league teams) is stolen bases. I don't know if he's having problems with 
his knee or something, but he can still run." 
</P>
<P>
 Young doesn't have the explosive first step he had in 1988, but once he gets 
moving, he feels his speed is good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I've lost that much," Young said. "I still feel pretty fast. My 
legs weren't feeling all that great at the beginning of the year, but they're 
starting to feel stronger. I think my stolen base totals will rise." 
</P>
<P>
 A few more quick steps could mean a giant leap toward the major leagues for 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still only a step away," Young said. "There are guys who haven't been to 
the big leagues for a long time -- a friend of mine, Chuck Jackson, is with the 
Rangers now and he hadn't been up since 1988. If he can be that persistent, so 
can I."

LAURIE, BULLFROGS STOP SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Goalie Rob Laurie made 64 saves to lead the Bullfrogs to a 9-6 victory over 
the San Diego Barracudas in a Roller Hockey International game Saturday night 
at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs, who lost to the Barracudas a week ago, quickly posted a 3-0 
lead midway through the second quarter on two goals by Victor Gervais and one 
by Darren Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barracudas battled back with goals by Marc Savard and Danny Gravelle in a 
65-second span. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs made it 4-2 at halftime on Jim Brown's power-play goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barracudas stormed back in the third quarter to tie it, 5-5. San Diego 
took its first lead when Darcy Norton scored at 1 minute 15 seconds of the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bullfrogs scored the final four goals, including Brown's game-winner 
on a power play at 4:44 of the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs improve to 8-1-0; San Diego dropped to 6-4-1.

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; SWIMMER STILL IS RECOVERING FROM UCLA'S DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Kannegeisser still can't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being one of the top swimmers at the Olympic Festival, Kannegeisser 
was speaking of betrayal and abandonment before practice on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kannegeisser said "anything can happen," he didn't mean that it was 
necessarily good. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two months ago, Kannegeisser didn't know if his swimming career was over. 
Not because of an injury -- that would be easier to accept. 
</P>
<P>
 It was because of UCLA's decision to drop men's swimming after the 1994 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it when I read about it in the paper. It was a total 
shock," Kannegeisser said. "In fact, I thought it must have been a misprint in 
our local (Sacramento) paper, so I called the coach and he told me it was 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 What really got to Kannegeisser was the timing of the news. Not that news like 
that ever comes at a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kannegeisser, 18, had learned in April of 1993 that he would receive a 
scholarship to swim for UCLA. He read the news in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was already August, so I really was going to go to UCLA for my freshman 
year no matter if it was the last year of the program or not. I guess I could 
have tried to go somewhere else, but I didn't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Then things got worse. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in his life, hard work did not pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working harder than I ever had in my life and I didn't improve on my 
times," said Kannegeisser, who swims freestyle sprints. "I just had a bad year. 
I mean, after Pac-10s, I wasn't sure what I was going to do. I was kind of 
stuck." 
</P>
<P>
 Not improving his times meant there was little chance of another school 
offering him a full scholarship. More than a few swimmers have peaked in high 
school and coaches know that. 
</P>
<P>
 So Kannegeisser wasn't sure where he could go. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, he liked going to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought about giving up swimming and staying at UCLA because his 
scholarship would be honored for another four years. 
</P>
<P>
 His roommate, Nick Shackell, was also on the swim team but wasn't going to go 
under with the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started calling schools and we even went to visit New Mexico, Berkeley and 
Auburn after the season," Kannegeisser said.  
</P>
<P>
 He liked Auburn the best, and fortunately, they offered him the most financial 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what really impressed me the most? Their commitment to swimming," 
Kannegeisser said. "They just built an $11.5-million swim facility, so you know 
they aren't going to drop the program -- at least not right away. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his year at UCLA was only average, Kannegeisser bounced back 
afterward by qualifying for the Olympic Festival team. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kannegeisser still is wary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, they took something away that I worked all my life for. But I'm 
hopeful." Festival Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Parmenter of Granada Hills won a gold medal for the South team in the 
200-meter backstroke in 2:18.39 She is expected to try the 400 individual 
medley today. . . . . Julie Varozza of Los Gatos won a gold in the 800-meter 
freestyle in 8:50.93.

VICTORY WILL BE SERVED IN SAMPRAS, IVANISEVIC DUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They come into today's men's final with similar serves (fluorescent fuzzy 
blurs), similar results (each has lost only one set during the fortnight) and 
similar ambitions (each thinks he belongs here). 
</P>
<P>
 But how they got to Centre Court, how Pete Sampras and Goran Ivanisevic 
reached the last singles match of 1994 Wimbledon, is an altogether different 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, the American, was groomed for Wimbledon success. Ivanisevic, the 
Croatian, stormed, pouted and then, after finally putting his legendary temper 
on hold, smiled his way here. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, the right-hander, is seeded No. 1 and ranked No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic, the left-hander, is seeded No. 4 and ranked No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras has won twice as much as Ivanisevic, four times the number of Grand 
Slam titles, including the one that counts most -- Wimbledon, in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic has beaten Sampras five of eight times, including the one that 
might mean something, their 1992 meeting in the Wimbledon semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is it," Sampras said. "It's the biggest match of the year so far for me. 
I hope I can get through it. It's going to be tough either way. It's going to 
be a lot of big serving, not a lot of rallies." 
</P>
<P>
 Boris Becker, the three-time Wimbledon champion who was beaten by Ivanisevic 
in the semifinals, predicted that the first one with 40 aces would win. 
</P>
<P>
 He was kidding. Or so everyone thinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic, who had little trouble with Becker, doesn't seem particularly 
worried about Sampras. The serve and his overall record against Sampras might 
have something to do with it. But so does his attitude adjustment, a Wimbledon 
twist for Ivanisevic. 
</P>
<P>
 He had Andre Agassi on the ropes back in the 1992 Wimbledon final, but let it 
slip away. This time he feels more calm, more confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's surprising me sometimes, I'm so quiet," he said. "Just last year I had 
bad memories here (he lost in the third round). I was very nervous and if 
you're very nervous here you can't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 But after the victory over Becker, Ivanisevic looked anything but nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if I play like this in the final -- and I hope I play like this in 
the final -- the chances are very good," he said.

U.S.-CANADIAN 'PASTA WAR' HAS BOTH SIDES IN BOIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG and CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what was known as Defense Scheme No. 1, Canada once planned to respond to a 
U.S. invasion by seizing Albany, N.Y., and Minot, N.D. Its bizarre plan was 
prepared more than 60 years ago by an equally unlikely figure: a Canadian army 
colonel who, wearing civilian clothes, crossed the border in his private car 
and scouted potential military targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Times have changed. The United States and Canada now face each other across 
the world's longest undefended border. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a war of sorts is being waged even now in lush Midwestern fields of durum 
wheat. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is pasta. Canada has elbowed its way into the U.S. macaroni market. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced that Canada is selling its durum wheat -- the stuff of bow-tie 
noodles, angel hair, common spaghetti and just about every other pasta -- at 
below-market prices in the United States, U.S. farmers are in a boil. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadians reply that Americans talk loudly about free trade while trying to 
keep the competition out. Alanna Koch, executive director of the Western 
Canadian Wheat Growers Assn. in Regina, Saskatchewan, said that an otherwise 
neighborly trading relationship will reach a flash point if the United States 
tries to limit the importing of Canadian grain. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's atmosphere of cutthroat international economic competition, even 
the best of friends can find themselves on opposite sides. If the United States 
and Canada can wage economic war over wheat, how much more difficult will it be 
for the United States and Japan to resolve their disputes? 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny weather on the plains coupled with adequate rain have farmers on both 
sides of the U.S.-Canadian border talking optimistically about bountiful crops 
this year. But they have bumped up against the reality of the global trend 
toward open borders and free trade, brought home first by the 1988 U.S.-Canada 
Free Trade Agreement and now by the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the mirror images presented by Gregory D. Downs, who raises wheat in the 
dark, rich soil near the Red River of the North in North Dakota, and Warren 
Jolly, who does the same near the Saskatchewan town of Mossbank, 50 miles 
southwest of Moose Jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are fourth-generation farmers. Downs is 42 years old; Jolly is 43. Each 
has two daughters and a son. Each has sunk hundreds of thousands of dollars 
into combines and tractors. Now, to save money, each is buying used equipment. 
Each has an academic degree in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Downs works 2,700 acres, which he seeded this year with hard spring wheat for 
bakers, sunflowers to produce edible seeds, white bulbous beets that put sugar 
on America's kitchen tables -- and durum wheat. Jolly plants durum over roughly 
3,500 acres, an area about as large as Beverly Hills. The two men this year 
probably will raise about 142,000 bushels of durum -- enough to feed a plate of 
penne to every person in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 And each admits that if he were in the other's mud-clogged boots, he would 
have done just as the other has, taking advantage of trading opportunities when 
they presented themselves and fighting them when they became a threat. 
</P>
<P>
 But their similarities, down to a preference for aviator glasses and 
Western-style work shirts with mother-of-pearl buttons, do little to mask the 
concern and confusion that have built up over the impact that free trade -- or 
at least a cross-border trading system in which the rules have been rewritten 
with unpredictable results -- is having on their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a story being told all along the 5,500-mile border, from the Pacific, 
where the two nations are arguing over salmon fishing, to the Atlantic, where 
the efforts of farmers in Maine to sell poultry, eggs and dairy products in 
Quebec are being challenged. Canadians, meanwhile, are pushing south, trying to 
sell their peanut butter, sugar and, increasingly, barley in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In an angry speech that shook up international traders, Roy MacLaren, the 
Canadian trade minister, warned in Washington in May of "a growing list of 
disputes -- from pork to beer to steel -- that, if allowed to escalate, risk 
creating a trade and investment chill between our countries."

<P>
 "We've moved out of a very calm period into one that has gotten testier, with 
a longer list of issues to deal with," said Joseph J. Jockel, director of 
Canadian affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was in office, President Ronald Reagan established a camaraderie with 
then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, a fellow conservative, and President George 
Bush slipped so comfortably into the relationship that Mulroney was a frequent 
guest at Bush's oceanside home in Kennebunkport, Me. 
</P>
<P>
 But President Clinton and Jean Chretien, Liberal Party prime minister since 
October, have encountered each other only once. Each has focused on domestic 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 That has left plenty of room for trade disputes. U.S. poultry sales in Quebec 
play into the much more difficult question of whether the province will break 
away from the rest of Canada. Canadian wheat sales in the upper Midwest 
influence the economic recovery there, which in turn can affect congressional 
elections this year and the presidential election in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 President Dwight D. Eisenhower was said to have once remarked, "If you can't 
get along with Canada, who can you get along with?" 
</P>
<P>
 But the history of U.S.-Canadian relations is replete with examples of 
contentious disputes that, while not forcing Canada to activate Defense Scheme 
No. 1, nonetheless have soured the neighborly relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The kernel of the conflict over durum wheat is whether Canadians engage in 
unfair practices in selling their crop in the United States, because the sales 
are based on monopoly pricing and government subsidies that cut the cost of 
transporting the crop to grain elevators and mills. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. International Trade Commission is expected to complete an 
investigation, requested by the White House, on Friday. It could call for 
quotas or tariffs on U.S. purchases of Canadian wheat, a decision to be made by 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the Canadians have captured as 
much as 40% of the U.S. durum wheat market by using unfair practices. The chief 
economist of the U.S. Department of Agriculture testified before the commission 
in April that Canadian sales had reduced U.S. farm income so much over the last 
three years that the government has had to pay an additional $682 million in 
price supports. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little certainty about the price Canada is getting for its grain 
because the Canadian Wheat Board, the only legal seller of Canadian wheat in 
bulk, is not required to disclose such information. 
</P>
<P>
 But while U.S. farmers may not know the actual price Canada is getting for its 
wheat, they see the huge tractor-trailers hauling the golden Canadian crop to 
grain elevators scattered across the upper Midwest. They see the elevators 
filling up with cheaper imported grain. They see a diminishing market for the 
U.S. crop. And it adds up to this: lower prices being paid to farmers for wheat 
raised on U.S. farms. 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, U.S. production has dropped steadily from 3.3 million metric 
tons in the 12-month period ending June 30, 1991, to a current level of about 2 
million metric tons. American farmers blame the increased competition from 
Canada, and particularly the government subsidy for transportation costs. 
</P>
<P>
 They suspect that Canada is undercutting U.S. prices by roughly 10 cents a 
bushel -- a difference too small to show up on grocery shelves but big enough 
to make a difference to the farmers who sell the wheat and the millers who turn 
it into pasta. But some agriculture economists wonder whether there really is 
any undercutting at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what the North Dakota producers allege, but it hasn't been borne out 
by much evidence," said Demcey Johnson, an assistant professor of agriculture 
economics at North Dakota State University in Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
 As seen in Canada, the issue is one driven by "regional and local political 
considerations in the United States rather than by any real trade issue," a 
Canadian government official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, dismissed talk of 
transportation subsidies and complaints about the Wheat Board as "red 
herrings." U.S. quotas on Canadian wheat sales, he said, could bring 
retaliation "across a broad range of products in the agriculture area." For 
instance, Canada could impose quotas on California wine or on the amount of 
finished pasta that it would accept from U.S. factories. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian officials and farmers also criticize U.S. subsidies to farmers who 
sell wheat overseas. The subsidies are mainly in retaliation for similar 
European export subsidies, but the Canadians argue that Canada's growing wheat 
sales in the United States are merely filling the void created when American 
farmers take advantage of their own subsidies for wheat exports. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like extortion," said Daniel Schwanen, a senior policy analyst at 
C.D. Howe Institute, a Toronto-based economic policy research organization that 
generally endorses free trade. "What (U.S.) wheat farmers want is a higher 
price at the expense of everyone else. The U.S. can't argue that we're dumping 
wheat or we're subsidizing our wheat. It's just that we're selling too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Try telling all this to Gregory Downs, mild-mannered, lanky and ready at the 
drop of an ever-present baseball cap to quietly lay out his case. 
</P>
<P>
 While the price of wheat fluctuates from month to month and last year averaged 
$4.35 a bushel in North Dakota, the National Assn. of Wheat Growers is 
expecting an average price this year of $3.20 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
 By Downs' figuring, it costs him at least $3.11 to raise a bushel of durum, a 
figure that includes such costs as seed and fertilizer, but not such indirect 
costs as renting his land, paying his $5,300 annual health insurance premium 
and transporting his wheat 100 miles to a mill in Carrington, N.D., where it is 
made into penne and rotini and other pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimates that a crop that otherwise might sell at $3.50 a bushel might 
fetch only $3 when the market is flooded with Canadian wheat. "That's what will 
kill us -- if they drive the price below the operating expenses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So over the years, Downs has cut back consistently on the durum he has planted 
from a high of 1,200 acres to his current 450 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the border, the picture is quite different. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Jolly is optimistic about this year's crop and the cash it will bring. 
Prices are up. And subsidies for European farmers, which had made it difficult 
for Canadians to compete, have been limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Jolly admits to some "pretty heated" discussions with U.S. farmers. He is 
reluctant to criticize his competitors in the wheat fields across the border, 
although he is less restrained in his view of their government. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys have a protectionist government down there now and they are just 
going to take advantage of it and I don't blame them a bit," he said. "If I was 
down there I'd do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, Jolly, a director of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Assn., is 
none too happy with the government Wheat Board, to which he must sell all his 
crop at a non-negotiable price. A U.S. miller offered him $10 for each bushel 
of top-quality grain, he says, but Canadian law requires him to sell his crop 
to the government at roughly $4.38 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see a continental market where I could deal any place in the 
continent, even Mexico . . ," he said. "That should happen. It eventually will 
happen, but it may be my son who's farming then." 
</P>
<P>
 For Downs, the prospects looked just as good last year at this time as they do 
now. Then a cool July nurtured a fungus that drove down the quality and price 
of North Dakota durum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating being a farmer, and then you get the Canadians coming in and 
it's just another sore point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That reminded him of a story about a giant fish caught off Cuba that was 
devoured by sharks, bite by bite, before the fisherman could bring it home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you ever read Hemingway's 'The Old Man and the Sea?' " Downs asked. "The 
Canadians are just one more shark taking a bite out of our bottom line."

ARMSTRONG MIGHT NEVER HAVE LANDED ON THE MOON. THE OBSCURE BUT FIERY FLIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Of the sounds humanity has made on Earth, only a nuclear explosion is louder 
than the unthrottled thunder of the Saturn rockets that carried men to the 
moon. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 16, 1969, when a Saturn lifted the Apollo 11 capsule free of Earth on 
its historic journey to the moon, one man hundreds of miles from the launch pad 
in Florida felt its apocalyptic energy reverberate in his marrow: NASA Flight 
Director Gene Kranz, on the edge of his seat in the windowless "trench" of 
NASA's Mission Control in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Armstrong, the Apollo 11 commander, was the first human to walk on the 
moon. Kranz was the man who guided him the last miles onto its dusty, 
pockmarked surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Of America's secular heroes, few stir the spirit as deeply as the astronauts 
who a generation ago left the first footsteps on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 But few ever knew the names or the stories of the faceless, can-do engineers 
who directed them there safely. 
</P>
<P>
 If Armstrong -- the Apollo astronaut whose features were masked by his 
mirrored helmet -- was the public image of American space prowess, Kranz -- the 
hard-charging flight director -- was its private face. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong was a paragon of Protestant test pilot cool: terse, aloof, 
unknowable. He was a blue-eyed Eagle Scout with a hesitant, lopsided grin, so 
shy that there are almost no clear pictures of him standing on the moon's 
surface, only photographs of his footprints and his shadow. He declined to be 
interviewed for this story, as he declines almost all interview requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz was unabashedly sentimental, a fierce agency loyalist who played Sousa 
marches in his office to pump up his adrenaline. He relished his in-house 
reputation as a relentless taskmaster who earned the nickname "General Savage." 
</P>
<P>
 Today -- 25 years after the moon landing -- Armstrong is still a national folk 
hero. Kranz is virtually unknown outside an inner circle of NASA veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 What they share is the stuff of history -- a journey given only once to the 
human race. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were born in small Ohio towns barely 100 miles apart at the bottom of 
the Depression. Both were fighter pilots in the 1950s. They never met until 
they joined NASA. They never spoke directly during the moon mission. They 
almost never speak now. 
</P>
<P>
 They were never so close as when they were farthest apart -- when Armstrong, 
240,000 miles from Earth, was searching for a safe landing site only a few 
miles above the moon, with capsule emergency alarms flashing, the on-board 
computer on the verge of a breakdown, and only scant minutes left before the 
landing fuel ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 For those 13 minutes of the lunar descent, half a billion people held their 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts of 300,000 technicians, the labor of eight years at a cost of $25 
billion, a Cold War rivalry, and a murdered President's promise hung in the 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
 When Armstrong set the lunar lander down safely, the national victory was so 
complete that for decades the Soviet government would officially deny that 
there had even been a race to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Kranz -- in a locked control room with a dozen young engineers relaying 
data buzzing in the earphones of his headset -- who decided to override the 
alarms and give Armstrong the chance to land the spacecraft on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Kranz had a style all his own. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the frown, of course. Human nature gave him that. His voice had a 
flat Midwestern edge that, even at its friendliest, retained a hard edge of 
reflexive command. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was that blond bristle of a crew cut, shaved so close you could see 
the muscles tighten at the back of his skull when he concentrated. He owed the 
style to the Air Force and the close trim to a barber in Clear Lake, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the most emotional of the flight directors," Kranz, 61, said in a 
recent interview. "Space really got me all honked up." 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz has the kind of mind that seems happiest when it is running a dozen 
trains of thought along parallel tracks -- the sort of fellow, friends say, who 
relaxes by working on a full-scale aerobatic biplane in his garage, pruning 
prize roses and baking bread all in one afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 As the flight director for the Apollo 11 landing -- and head of NASA's entire 
flight control operations branch -- he made $21,432 a year. That was enough to 
raise six children. Five work in the space program. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the vests his wife made that set him off from everybody else in 
mission operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Before each mission, Marta Kranz scoured the fabric shops of Houston for a 
bold swatch of material to sew into one of his special flight vests. They 
became as much a part of the early space program as splashdown cigars and 
ticker tape parades. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Kranz still has 15 vests in an upstairs closet of the modest home the 
couple moved to when NASA set up operations in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 He proudly lays them out on the sofa for a visitor: Paisley brocades. Silver 
and gold lame. Carnival stripes. Velvet. 
</P>
<P>
 The simplest -- a plain white silk twill vest yellowed now to ivory -- is what 
he wore for Apollo 11. 
</P>
<P>
 White was the color reserved for the leader of the White Flight, as his flight 
director's shift was known within mission operations. 
</P>
<P>
 White Flight was in charge of the lunar landing. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kranz retired this year, NASA also retired the color. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a boy in Toledo, Ohio, Kranz never cared much about rocket ships or 
spaceflight. But as a military pilot in the Pacific in 1957, he was impressed 
by the way the launch of the Russian Sputnik galvanized people around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years after he was discharged -- working as a test engineer at Holloman 
Air Force Base in New Mexico -- he saw an ad in Aviation Week magazine. The 
government wanted engineers for a fledgling space task group being organized at 
the federal flight research facility in Langley, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt that space was the next thing coming in aviation," he said. "It 
was higher, faster. It had the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he knew exactly what was happening, he found himself on a plane headed 
for Cape Canaveral, Fla., with orders to prepare for the first unmanned test of 
the Mercury Redstone rocket that would later carry the first American -- Alan 
B. Shepard -- into space. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Go down to the Cape and write us a countdown.' They put me on an 
airplane. I had never written a countdown," Kranz said, referring to the 
complex engineering procedures that lead up to a rocket launch. "I landed at 
Patrick Air Force Base and didn't even know which way the Cape was. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a guy there in a Chevy Malibu with a surfboard in the back. He 
says: 'What are you looking for?' I said: 'I got to go out to the Cape.' He 
said: 'Hop in.' So boom, off we go. I didn't even bother to ask who he was. 
</P>
<P>
 "About two-thirds of the way out there I found out it was Mercury astronaut 
Gordon Cooper. That was my introduction to the original seven astronauts," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the moment for liftoff came, the Redstone rocket died on the launch pad. 
</P>
<P>
 That was his introduction to spaceflight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Kranz signed up for the space race, he was 27 years old. NASA was still 
in the making. There was no organized civilian space program to speak of. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no such thing as Mission Control. People like Kranz, his mentor -- a 
short, icy engineer named Christopher Columbus Kraft, the agency's first flight 
director -- and operations chief Walt Williams built it from the raw material 
of their own personalities and engineering styles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the apex of the structure they created through trial and error stood the 
flight director -- a single person with absolute authority over operations 
during a space mission. 
</P>
<P>
 He had ultimate control when a manned space capsule was in orbit -- and 
ultimate responsibility if a technical mishap resulted in the death of an 
astronaut crew. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it was the flight director's decision to abort a mission -- or to 
proceed in the face of engineering uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Flight Director may, after analysis of the flight, take any necessary 
action required for the successful completion of the mission," the mission 
rules stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Any error was unforgivable. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the 1960s and early 1970s -- the years of Apollo -- Gene Kranz thought 
there was no better job in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz became so obsessed with the engineering discipline of mission operations 
that in the months before Apollo 11 he filled a brown notebook 3 1/2 inches 
thick with personal notes on how to orchestrate every second of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be intensely aware of . . . pulling this ballet together that 
involved everybody doing the right thing at the right time under a constantly 
changing set of circumstances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But any misgivings, confusion or uncertainty he kept under control and out of 
view. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way can you ever, ever, ever evidence confusion, concern, lack of 
understanding," he said. "You have to be in charge. You are the guy. You have 
to be cooler than cool, smarter than smart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did everything by the numbers. I had checklists upon checklists. If I 
wasn't ahead of everybody on my team, I didn't feel I was doing my job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was constantly testing myself: What am I going to do if. . . ?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, something of Gene Kranz became a permanent part of manned 
spaceflight. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Johnson Space Center in Houston, the Mission Control room Kranz and his 
colleagues used for Apollo has changed only slightly since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as NASA juggles space shuttle missions and prepares to operate a manned 
space station, its vocabulary and work habits mimic the obsessive attention to 
detail and studious nonchalance of flight operations engineers like Kranz and 
his Apollo colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent technical rehearsal of an upcoming shuttle flight, loose-leaf 
binders and foam coffee cups littered the beige and gray flight consoles. The 
half-light from computer monitors provided much of the illumination. 
</P>
<P>
 The faces were young and, in the shadows, energized. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprawling at their consoles, the new generation of NASA engineers flirted with 
simulated disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 They were rehearsing landing emergencies with the crew of the upcoming shuttle 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 They handled each crisis in cryptic murmurs, a language of nods, glances and 
engineering acronyms. The movements were exaggeratedly casual, the tension so 
internalized as to be invisible. The calmer things appeared, the worse they 
must be. 
</P>
<P>
 Milt Heflin, lead flight director for the shuttle mission expected to begin 
Wednesday, watched the exercise from an unused console, patched into the 
conversations by a frayed headset cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Heflin, selected as a flight director by Kranz 11 years ago, called the job 
"one of the last bastions of common sense." He has handled 19 shuttle flights, 
including the Hubble Space Telescope repair mission in December -- hailed as 
the most complex space operation since the moon landings. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the Apollo 11 mission, Heflin was a junior NASA technician 
fresh out of college. Kranz was 36 and had, for the purposes of flight 
operations, become common sense personified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With just 10 minutes remaining before Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were scheduled 
to swing back around from behind the moon and begin their descent to the lunar 
surface, Kranz did the one thing no flight director was allowed to do. 
</P>
<P>
 He went off the loop. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA was so concerned with capturing every aspect of the Apollo missions that 
all communications -- every "loop" -- in the control room were to be officially 
monitored and recorded. History wanted to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kranz had set up a private circuit where he could talk to his flight 
controllers out of official earshot, and now he called them together for a 
confidential "pulse check." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen G. Bales, then a 26-year-old, $7,000-a-year engineer from Iowa, manned 
the guidance console for the lunar descent. Twenty-five years later, he sat 
down at the same gray console and recalled Kranz's words as best he could:  
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting ready to do something no one else has ever done. You are 
trained. You are prepared. We will do well. No matter how it turns out, when we 
walk out of this room, I will walk out with you. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz ordered the doors of Mission Control locked. "Battle short," he sang out 
curtly, ordering the circuit breakers locked down so no power failure could 
interfere with the landing operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, aboard the Eagle, as the lunar lander was named, Armstrong and Aldrin 
emerged from the radio silence caused by orbiting behind the moon. Alone aboard 
the orbiting command capsule, astronaut Michael Collins waited for them to 
start the descent. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the problems started. 
</P>
<P>
 Communications were unusually distorted and static-filled. Could they get 
enough data to allow the flight to continue? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Go, Kranz ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 Then static drowned out all critical data for 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 When the signals picked up again, radar readings revealed the craft was moving 
too fast. If it continued to accelerate, it might overshoot the landing zone 
and Kranz would have to order an abort, Bales recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz stood at the flight director's console, his palms so damp they left 
perfect prints on his notebook when he leaned forward. Whispering in his ears 
were a dozen voices from six communications loops and the air-to-ground 
communications channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on board the spacecraft, a power meter failed. No sooner had the ground 
team responded to that problem than a computer program alarm flashed in the 
capsule and on the meters in Mission Control. That signaled that the on-board 
computer was getting overloaded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear a very innocuous call from the crew: A program alarm," Kranz recalled. 
"About that time, Steve Bales echoes it. Then it echoes in the back room. 
Program alarm. Program alarm. Program alarm." 
</P>
<P>
 Would they have to abort? 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at the guidance console he occupied when the alarm came through, Bales 
remembers his controlled panic. "I was still almost in overflow from the first 
problem. I could not remember what I was supposed to do for the life of me for 
a second." The alarm kept on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're go on that alarm?" Kranz said, asking if he could let the landing 
proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bales hesitated. Voices on four or five loops dissected the problem in a 
knowledgeable gabble in his ear. Within seconds, he determined, the problem 
could be safely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz grunted acknowledgment. The descent would continue. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer alarm went off again. "We're go," Bales told Kranz, more 
confidently. Again the alarm came. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hang tight, everybody," Kranz said over the flight director's loop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eagle, you're looking great. You're go," said capsule communicator Charles 
Duke, relaying Kranz's assent. Duke was the only one in Mission Control allowed 
to talk directly to the crew in flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Once given the go-ahead, Armstrong proceeded as planned and took manual 
control at 2,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 His flying skills were so formidable that three times -- nursing a crippled 
jet onto the deck of the carrier Essex, at the controls of an X-15, and then in 
a Gemini space capsule -- he turned near-disaster into triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 Aboard the lunar lander, he steered the craft back and forth, seeking a safe 
spot in the boulder-strewn landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 In Houston, a flight controller announced on the loop how much longer the 
lander could fly as descent fuel levels dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the static, Aldrin reported seeing dust from the surface, blown up by 
the engine exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, engine stop," Aldrin radioed. 
</P>
<P>
 When he realized the spacecraft had touched down, Kranz froze. 
</P>
<P>
 "Houston, Tranquillity Base here," Armstrong radioed. "The Eagle has landed." 
</P>
<P>
 It was 3:18 p.m. Houston time, July 20, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 The muffled cheers and applause from the spectators rumbled through the 
double-paned glass observation windows into the control room. 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz couldn't talk or will himself to move. "The reality hit. It stopped 
being a simulation in that moment and started being a real event," Kranz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elation was the one thing he had not rehearsed. 
</P>
<P>
 To break the spell, Kranz slammed his arm down on his console as hard as he 
could. The pain allowed him to breathe again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want quiet in this room," he ordered. The mission clock was running. 
</P>

 Armstrong resigned from NASA within 18 months of his return to Earth and 
withdrew into the privacy of a small farm outside Lebanon, Ohio, shunning 
publicity. There would be no autobiography, political campaigns or commercial 
endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1979, Armstrong taught aerospace engineering at the University of 
Cincinnati, then confined his public activities to a few corporate boards and 
chairmanship of AIL Systems, a small high-technology engineering firm on Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz gave the rest of his working life to Mission Control. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, when an on-board explosion threatened the lives of the Apollo 13 
astronauts halfway to the moon, Kranz was at the flight director's console and 
helped save them. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Kranz -- still in the mission director's chair -- had no way to avert 
disaster as an explosion destroyed the space shuttle Challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 And last winter, as space shuttle astronauts repaired the Hubble Space 
Telescope, Kranz oversaw the entire Mission Operations Directorate from the 
same chair. 
</P>
<P>
 He retired in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-floor control room, from which he orchestrated the moon landing, is 
on the National Register of Historic Places. NASA plans to make it a museum 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Kranz, reflecting on Armstrong's distaste for public attention or adulation, 
pronounced his own judgment on the Apollo 11 astronaut and, in doing so, 
unconsciously announced his own epitaph: 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to do something, rather than be something," Kranz said. "And he did 
it."

SUPREME COURT ENDS TERM WITH SOUTER LEADING WAY; JUDICIARY: HE HELPS STEER A 
MODERATE-TO-LIBERAL COURSE. CONSERVATIVES USUALLY FIND THEMSELVES IN DISSENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter, nearing the end of his court opinion 
that struck down a New York law carving out a separate school district for a 
Hasidic sect, paused to reply to a ferocious dissent filed by his more 
conservative colleague, Antonin Scalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice (Benjamin N.) Cardozo once cast the dissenter as 'the gladiator 
making a last stand against the lions.' Justice Scalia's dissent is certainly 
the work of a gladiator, but he thrusts at lions of his own imagining," Souter 
said dryly. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be hard to imagine the soft-spoken New Hampshire jurist as a 
lion-tamer, but perhaps the most significant trend in the court term that ended 
last week was Souter's rise to challenge the hard-charging conservatives on his 
right and his success in pushing them aside in most of the key cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a court increasingly likely to fashion moderate-to-liberal 
rulings, with Souter quietly emerging as its new leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers on both sides of the ideological spectrum point to Souter as a growing 
force, a surprise for a little-known judge who was derided as the "stealth 
candidate" when then-President George Bush nominated him in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Souter is emerging as the liberal leader in the post-Blackmun era," said 
Clint Bolick, counsel to the conservative Institute of Justice, referring to 
Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who retired after 24 years on the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 "His stature, competence and confidence seems to grow from term to term. He is 
becoming a real leader," said Steven R. Shapiro, national legal director for 
the American Civil Liberties Union. Thanks in large part to Souter, the 
just-completed term was a "surprisingly successful" one for civil liberties, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 In the term that ended last Thursday, the justices interpreted the 
Constitution to say that religious groups may not be given political power, 
that potential jurors may not be excluded because of their gender, that the 
government cannot seize a home in a drug case without a hearing, that cities 
cannot bar a homeowner's display of a protest sign and that prison officials 
can be forced to pay damages if they deliberately ignore a clear risk to the 
health of their inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 In cases involving federal laws, the justices made it easier for victims of 
sexual harassment to win damages from their employers, said abortion protesters 
who use violence can be sued under an anti-racketeering law and ruled that the 
Civil Rights Act of 1991 does not apply to cases that were pending before it 
was enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 For conservatives, the biggest victories came in the area of property rights. 
The Constitution does not allow officials to demand a piece of property in 
exchange for a building permit, the court said on a 5-4 vote, unless they can 
prove this exaction is closely linked to the burden imposed by the expanded 
development. In addition, the court insisted that state judges examine a jury's 
punitive-damage award to make sure the amount is not excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 Souter's growing strength may be especially important as the court undergoes 
transition. Thursday marked the last day for the 85-year-old Blackmun. If all 
goes as expected, he will be replaced in October by President Clinton's second 
nominee, Judge Stephen G. Breyer of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler boasted that Breyer had the 
experience and skill to be a coalition builder on the high court. But 
privately, some Administration attorneys admit that Souter is likely to be a 
stronger, more effective voice in behalf of civil rights and individual 
liberties. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first term, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg followed a moderate-to-liberal 
approach similar to Souter's. Along with Breyer and veteran John Paul Stevens, 
the four could form a solid coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few years ago, it looked as though the rapid succession of new 
conservative appointees could push the high court sharply to the right. 
Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush said they wanted to see the court reject the 
right to abortion, permit prayer in schools and cut back on the rights of 
criminal defendants. In William H. Rehnquist, they had a chief justice 
committed to those goals. 
</P>
<P>
 But several Reagan-Bush appointees have disappointed conservatives: Souter in 
particular and Anthony M. Kennedy to some degree. In June, 1992, they stunned 
their conservative colleagues by joining with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to 
strongly reaffirm the Roe vs. Wade ruling on abortion rights and to strike down 
a public school graduation prayer that was led by a cleric. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the court has steered a mostly center course, if anything moving 
slightly left. More often than not, the strict conservatives -- Scalia, 
Rehnquist and Clarence Thomas -- find themselves in dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 Scalia, 58, has only one real follower: Thomas, who turned 46 last week. They 
vote together in nearly every significant case. Lacking a following, Scalia 
revels in firing off vitriolic dissents that deride the majority opinion as 
being illogical and unfaithful to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Scalia is fond of writing long, historical opinions that bolster his 
conservative stands, Souter counters with equally detailed historical 
examinations, but with a different conclusion. In the past two years, for 
example, he has authored opinions citing 18th-Century history to show that the 
framers of the Constitution did indeed seek a separation of church and state, 
not just a ban on official state churches, as Scalia and Rehnquist maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's ruling in the Hasidic case renewed the fight. In dissent, Scalia 
devoted 23 pages to slamming Souter's majority opinion: his "manipulation" of 
the facts, his "steamrolling" of key distinctions, his "facile conclusions" and 
his ultimate judgment "disfavoring religion." 
</P>
<P>
 In two pages, Souter rebutted him with a deft touch. Scalia's stand would be 
easier to accept, he said, if his "position had prevailed with the framers and 
with this court over the years." Calling Scalia "blind to history as well to 
precedent," Souter said the court will continue to insist that "singling out a 
particular sect for special treatment" violates the Constitution. Scalia had 
the votes of Thomas and Rehnquist, while Souter spoke for the six-member 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, most predicted Souter would join the conservatives. Not only 
was he a Bush appointee, but he had been recommended highly by Bush's 
conservative Chief of Staff John H. Sununu, a former New Hampshire governor. 
</P>
<P>
 But ex-clerks and friends note that Souter takes seriously his role as 
replacing Justice William J. Brennan, the longtime champion of the Bill of 
Rights who retired in 1990. The two lunch together often, friends say. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Souter is no Brennan-style liberal. Where Brennan opposed capital 
punishment as flatly unconstitutional, Souter usually votes to uphold death 
sentences so long as the rules were followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Souter, unlike Brennan, also favors carefully nuanced decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, faced with a lawsuit filed by a transsexual prisoner who had been 
sexually assaulted behind bars, Souter rejected both the liberal and 
conservative approaches and then set forth a middle-ground standard. Wardens 
cannot be responsible every time an inmate gets hurt, he said, but neither can 
they be absolutely immune from liability when they knowingly and deliberately 
place an inmate in grave danger. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, he authored an opinion for the court that balanced the rights of a 
copyright holder against those of an artist who wrote a parody of a popular 
song. Adopting a step-by-step approach, Souter explained the four factors that 
determine when a work is a "fair use" and when it goes too far and violates a 
copyright. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no sounds bites in a typical Souter opinion. He can be turgid 
writer, and sometimes both sides claim victory after reading his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But his careful approach also draws the support and respect of his fellow 
justices. Only Thomas dissented in the prisoner's case, and the opinion in the 
copyright case was signed by all nine members. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after he arrived in the fall of 1990, Souter seemed overwhelmed by the 
job. But as a bachelor with few social friends in Washington, he was able to 
plunge wholeheartedly into the work of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 While not exactly a young bachelor at 55, Souter is just coming into his prime 
years on the court. But already, he has proven to be far more than first 
advertised. Says Carter Phillips, a Washington attorney who practices before 
the court: "This was a guy who came in as an unknown from nowhere. But 
ultimately, I think he will prove to the most important one up there." Key

KEY SENATE PANEL, IN BLOW TO CLINTON, OKS ITS HEALTH BILL; LEGISLATION: PLAN 
DOESN'T ENSURE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE, DROPS OTHER CONTENTIOUS ITEMS CONTAINED IN 
PRESIDENT'S VERSION. DEBATE NOW SHIFTS TO FLOORS OF CONGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate Finance Committee on Saturday dealt a serious setback to President 
Clinton's campaign to assure health coverage to everyone, approving a health 
care bill that falls short of that goal and rejects the most controversial 
elements of the Administration's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finance Committee was the last of five congressional committees to act on 
the health care issue, and its vote sets the stage for a debate on the floors 
of both houses that will consume the rest of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's version is widely regarded as the most important indicator of 
the shape of any eventual health care reform package. Its legislation is far 
more conservative -- and more at variance with the Clinton plan -- than those 
approved by the other committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting 12 to 8, the committee passed a bill to set a goal for coverage -- 95% 
of the population by the year 2002 -- but relies only on a combination of 
economic incentives, changes in insurance law and government subsidies to get 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 If voluntary efforts to expand the number of insured people missed the target, 
a commission would come up with a plan for making up the difference, and 
Congress would be compelled to accept, reject or modify it. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill had been shaped by a group within the committee consisting at various 
times of six to eight conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans. They had 
effectively seized control from Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), 
whose ability and willingness to steer the Administration's health care package 
through the panel had been in question. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation "represents the type of health care reform that can pass this 
Congress and ultimately be signed into law by the President," said Sen. John B. 
Breaux (D-La.), a leader of the bipartisan group. His comment swept aside 
Clinton's vow to veto any bill that does not guarantee universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the President's allies on the committee supported the legislation, but 
they did so after recognizing that their only other option was to send no bill 
to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's reaction reflected similar ambivalence. He lauded the panel's action 
as "another step closer to final passage." 
</P>
<P>
 But the President also noted: "I remain firmly committed to guaranteed health 
coverage for every American that can never be taken away. . . . I am confident 
that we will achieve the goal of guaranteed coverage for everyone this year, 
and I look forward to the debate in the full House and Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 Two committees in the House and two in the Senate have passed health care 
bills, while one House committee has thrown in the towel. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), a supporter of the 
President's plan, hopes to recoup Saturday's loss as he crafts a single piece 
of legislation from the Finance Committee version and one passed earlier by the 
Labor and Human Resources Committee. He insisted that the bill he produces for 
consideration by the full Senate "will have the central objectives -- health 
insurance for all Americans, and cost containment." 
</P>
<P>
 Suggesting that his best hope now may lie in "innovation," Mitchell described 
the job before him as "an effort to meld the pending bills in a way that, 
first, makes sense for the country, and second, can gather sufficient political 
support." 
</P>
<P>
 In early votes last week, the committee defeated even a watered-down version 
of Clinton's proposal to require employers to pay 80% of their workers' health 
benefits. That element had been the President's chief means of achieving 
universal coverage and was also the most contentious item in his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, in dealing with the second most controversial issue -- how to 
contain health care costs -- the Finance Committee rejected caps on health 
insurance premiums, even in a weaker form proposed by Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, if health care costs rise more quickly under a reformed system than 
they would otherwise have done, the Finance Committee bill requires the 
government to make up the difference three ways: scaling back subsidies to help 
lower-income people buy health coverage, trimming tax breaks for the 
self-employed and raising the amounts that people in government-financed health 
care programs pay out-of-pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 But such measures would be so unpopular that many fear Congress would choose 
another unpleasant alternative: cut Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (Va.) noted that concern but suggested he 
was hemmed in by political reality. "I strongly oppose this, and I will vote 
for it, because it seems this is the only way we're going to get to the floor," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, foreshadowing what could be a bitter fight in the House and 
Senate, was also the first to significantly alter Clinton's proposal that 
abortion be included in the bill's basic package of benefits. It inserted a 
"conscience clause" allowing employers to offer plans that do not include 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 The chaotic race to pass the bill before Congress' July 4 recess stood in 
marked contrast to the committee's deliberations over the past few months, 
which proceeded at an excruciatingly slow pace. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, amid a flurry of papers and the back-and-forth rush of Senate 
staffers to copy machines, Moynihan was asked the cost of a particular 
amendment, which was later defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe we have the least idea," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's general approach is to make health insurance more affordable by 
pooling smaller purchasers -- individuals and firms with few workers -- into 
large, voluntary purchasing groups. It also would broaden tax breaks for 
individuals buying coverage and extend subsidies to people earning less than 
double the poverty level, which is now $14,764 in annual income for a family of 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the legislation also would end widely condemned insurance-writing 
practices that have made it difficult for people with known illnesses to buy 
coverage and for people changing jobs to take their old policy with them while 
awaiting coverage under their new employer's health plan. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how far such measures would go toward providing coverage for the 
15% of the population that is now uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), leader of the Finance Committee rump group that 
shaped the legislation, predicted that it would extend coverage to at least 20 
million of the estimated 39 million Americans who now lack it. 
</P>
<P>
 However, that calculation assumes tens of billions of dollars a year would be 
available for subsidies to help buy insurance for people whose incomes are less 
than double the poverty level. The prospect of finding that money was called 
into question by a series of committee votes that added benefits, reduced the 
proposed cigarette tax, eliminated a 1% payroll tax on large firms and rejected 
an increase in the tax on handgun ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 The handgun ammunition tax had been one of Moynihan's most cherished 
provisions, and his committee's 15-5 rejection of it marked an act of 
insubordination considered almost unthinkable under his recent predecessors as 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 To many on Capitol Hill, the vote underscored the degree to which Moynihan had 
lost control of the panel to the bipartisan group of committee members who 
called themselves the "Mainstream Coalition." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) repeatedly expressed his disdain for 
the bloc by referring to it as "the midstream group," and on one occasion, the 
"mid-crisis group." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am disappointed with the outcome of the committee's work, and doubt that 
the bill can pass in its present form," Dole said in a statement released after 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In another display of escalating political tension over health care, Dole and 
Clinton exchanged testy remarks Saturday over a health care proposal released 
by Dole last week, which is similar to the Finance Committee bill in many ways. 
The Dole plan claims no new taxes and rejects the idea of providing a single 
package of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dole bill could play a significant role in the Senate debate because it 
has 39 GOP co-sponsors, just two short of the number needed to launch a 
filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Saturday radio address, Clinton condemned the Dole bill as "politics as 
usual." 
</P>
<P>
 "It requires no contribution from the interest groups that are making a great 
deal of money out of the health care system now, and no contribution from those 
who are not paying anything now into the system," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole countered: "The President seems more concerned about politics than he is 
about finding a true bipartisan solution to health care reform." Another 
Prescription for Reform 
</P>
<P>
 Major features of the health care bill approved by the Senate Finance 
Committee: 
</P>
<P>
 COVERAGE 
</P>
<P>
 * No employer or individual would be forced to buy insurance although 
universal coverage is a national goal. 
</P>
<P>
 * If insurance reforms, subsidies and other measures fail to cover 95% of 
Americans by 2002, a national health commission would recommend action. 
Congress would have to consider its recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 * A six-month limit on pre-existing condition exclusions. No exclusion if a 
person had been insured recently by another health plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * A one-time amnesty for people with pre-existing medical conditions to sign 
up for private insurance without any restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Guaranteed coverage regardless of illness or change of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Annual open enrollment periods for health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Community rating of insurance for individuals and those working for 
companies with fewer than 100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Insurers could adjust premiums only by the rate in each community (250,000 
people and larger), by family size and by age. Older workers could be charged 
up to twice younger workers' rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Companies with 100 or more workers could self-insure. 
</P>
<P>
 * All private plans in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program would 
have to offer coverage to anyone in their local market area, at local community 
rates, not federal workers' rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * The elderly would not get prescription drug coverage unless they joined or 
stayed in a health maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
 SUBSIDIES 
</P>
<P>
 * Subsidies starting in 1997 to help the poor buy private insurance, including 
those now on Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 100% tax deduction for the self-employed and workers who pay their own 
premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 * But a pay-as-you-go mechanism would automatically curb the subsidies and tax 
breaks if they threatened to drive up the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 BENEFITS 
</P>
<P>
 * Health plans would offer a standard benefit package comparable to a Blue 
Cross-Blue Shield standard family plan now available to federal workers, 
covering a broad range of services from hospital stays to prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consumers would get a choice between at least two standard plans, one with 
higher cost-sharing and/or fewer covered services. 
</P>
<P>
 * A catastrophic plan -- paying only bills that exceed $5,000 per individual 
and $10,000 per family -- would be available. 
</P>
<P>
 * Standard plans would include abortion, but any employer or health plan could 
refuse to buy or offer abortion coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 FINANCING 
</P>
<P>
 * Cigarette taxes would be raised by $1 a pack in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new tax on high-cost plans to raise $17 billion over 10 years. The most 
costly 40% of plans would pay a 25% tax on the difference between their 
premiums and the average premium in their area. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 1.75% tax on health insurance premiums and self-insured plans to help fund 
academic health centers and graduate medical education. 
</P>
<P>
 * Higher Medicare premiums for upper-income retirees (over $90,000 single, 
$115,000 couples). 
</P>
<P>
 * Make Medicare beneficiaries pay 20% co-payments for clinical laboratory 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lower future Medicare increases in payments to physicians and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Repeal the tax break for so-called cafeteria plans that allow workers to 
avoid paying income taxes on premiums deducted from their wages.

ARAFAT EXHORTS OPPONENTS TO JOIN IN LIFTING 'BURDEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat rode Saturday into this sweltering refugee camp 
that was the birthplace of the Palestinian uprising, calling on his opponents 
to "come and lift the burden with me" in the struggle for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Venturing into the most dangerous territory yet in his rendezvous with an 
anxious and impoverished homeland, Arafat defended the peace pact with Israel 
that has spawned a furious opposition campaign by the dozen or more political 
fronts that operate out of Jabaliya. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us talk honestly now," Arafat told the thousands gathered in a Jabaliya 
schoolyard. "Maybe the agreement we made doesn't really suit us. But you have 
to understand it was the best possible agreement we could make under the 
circumstances of a desperate Arab situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call on Hamas, on Islamic Jihad, on the Popular Front . . ." Arafat said, 
naming each of his opponents, "and I ask them to come and lift the burden with 
me. The burden is very heavy. Come and share it with me. The process is very 
long and hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal almost had a ring of fatigue in an otherwise boisterous address, 
delivered under heavy security, with police sharpshooters standing along 
rooftops and eyeing the enthusiastic crowd below. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestine Liberation Organization leader crossed into Gaza from Egypt on 
Friday, ending a 27-year exile. Officials said that before his visit ends 
Tuesday, he will visit Jericho, the West Bank enclave that, along with Gaza, is 
under Palestinian self-rule. Arafat will swear in a 24-member governing 
authority during the Jericho trip, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat has previously expressed concern about coming to the turbulent Gaza 
Strip before his security forces asserted complete control, but he decided to 
take the gamble Saturday when he ventured into Jabaliya, a camp of about 
110,000 Palestinians displaced from Israel since 1948 and the site of some of 
the intifada 's most furious street conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 With its thick sand streets, tightly lined with ramshackle homes of concrete 
block, asbestos and corrugated aluminum, Jabaliya is one of the most densely 
populated areas on Earth. It is the poorest of Gaza's refugee camps, and its 
residents, who in 1987 began the daily shower of stones on Israeli soldiers 
that ultimately ate away at their will to remain, have lived as refugees for 46 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 They have only the distant hope of a new economic prosperity under Palestinian 
self-rule in Gaza to salve the realization that Arafat's peace plan means they 
will likely never leave Jabaliya's pungent streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've stolen everything," Riyadh Awkal said of the Israelis as he waited 
for Arafat's motorcade to pass by. "We grew up under the occupation. They 
robbed me of everything essential, the way occupation usually does. It has 
stolen my freedom, my sense of security, the capacity to lead a normal life." 
</P>
<P>
 Awkal, a 38-year-old day laborer who grew up in Jabaliya, spoke quietly and 
without inflection as he surveyed the squalid neighborhood around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a single aim I've wanted in my life that I have managed to 
achieve, be it education or building a family or, on a more general level, 
building a proper nation," he said. "It's important for Arafat to come here, to 
see the situation of this camp . . . to see the reality of the people and see 
how they really live in suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours before the PLO chairman's visit, the doctors in one of Jabaliya's 
two functioning clinics erupted into an argument in the clinic courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement he made is nothing! . . . We achieve nothing with this 
solution!" one doctor grumbled as a colleague of his grinned, put his arm 
around him and pulled him back inside the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is that he's coming. He's coming to live in his 
country. He's coming with his respect intact, and he's going to be like a 
sultan," said the colleague, a Fatah physician. 
</P>
<P>
 The other doctor still shook his head in disgust. "He arrived yesterday, and 
he went straight to the legislative building (in downtown Gaza). That wasn't 
where he was supposed to go. He was supposed to come to Jabaliya. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the ones who left our imprint on the intifada. We sacrificed the 
largest number of people, we have the largest number of deportees, the largest 
number of prisoners. He should have come here first." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, security risks or no, there was no way Arafat could have avoided 
Jabaliya and its landscape of misery. But some dramatic changes greeted the 
chairman's motorcade: 
</P>
<P>
 * The huge watchtower that was the Israeli army's dominating eye over Jabaliya 
throughout the occupation now has a Palestinian flag atop it, raised after the 
Israeli withdrawal a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * The barrel-and-concrete barriers that formerly sealed off the camp's main 
square as a measure of protection for Israeli soldiers now lie in ruins -- 
Jabaliya's version of the Berlin Wall torn down in an enthusiastic frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 * The fact that the clinic courtyard was empty except for a group of 
quarreling physicians was important in itself: Two years ago, during a 
particularly violent intifada weekend, 400 wounded were stretched out on the 
concrete floor. 
</P>
<P>
 To one and all in the past two days, Arafat's message has been one of 
self-reliance, urging Palestinians not to wait until the international 
community comes to their aid. 
</P>
<P>
 At dinner Friday night in a comfortable seaside hotel, Arafat insisted on 
locally produced watermelon and cheese for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat is frustrated by the slow trickle of international donations to finance 
Palestinian self-rule. In Jabaliya on Saturday, he lashed out at the World 
Bank's attempts to place restrictions on financial aid and sought support for 
his insistence on Palestinian jurisdiction over the funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't accept that they will control the Palestinian economy, because we 
didn't finish the military occupation to go to financial occupation," he said 
to the cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Koran says there have been strong people in this land since the time of 
Moses," Arafat said. "In our hunger, from our sweat and our deep belief, the 
Koran says that 'you are the highest believers, and if you are believers, you 
will prevail.' "

GUNMEN KILL SOCCER PLAYER IN COLOMBIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN AMBRUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angry at Colombia's elimination from the World Cup soccer tournament, gunmen 
Saturday shot and killed Andres Escobar, the player who accidentally scored a 
goal against his own side in a match with the United States and helped seal the 
team's fate, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar, 27, was shot to death outside a restaurant in Medellin barely 48 
hours after returning home from Los Angeles, where Colombia fell 2-1 to the 
United States on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified gunmen confronted Escobar around 3 a.m., and one said, 
"Thanks for the auto-goal," a witness told local radio stations. Then, the men 
opened fire, shooting Escobar 12 times as the group shouted "goal" after each 
shot. The gunmen then fled in two vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug traffickers reportedly lost millions of dollars in bets on the Colombian 
team, which went into the World Cup a favorite but performed miserably. Police 
said they suspected disgruntled bettors may have ordered Escobar's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 One group of bettors is said to have lost $10 million on Colombia's upset loss 
to the U.S. team, and an anonymous group called the television news program QAP 
last week threatening revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colombian team also received death threats during the World Cup, forcing 
Coach Francisco Maturana to change his lineup minutes before the U.S. match at 
the Rose Bowl last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a loss that plunges Colombia into mourning and fills us with pain," 
President Cesar Gaviria said in a nationally broadcast address. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities announced a reward of more than $60,000 for information leading to 
the capture of the killers. Additional bodyguards were assigned to each member 
of the Colombian team. Because of the threats, players already had protection, 
but it was not known if Escobar's guards had accompanied him to the restaurant 
where he was slain. 
</P>
<P>
 Two suspects, including the alleged driver of one of the getaway cars, were 
arrested later Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The young defenseman's body lay Saturday in the sports coliseum of Medellin, 
his hometown city 150 miles northwest of Bogota, and a funeral was scheduled 
for today. Escobar was to marry in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of mourners crowded the stadium while police set up barricades in an 
effort to trap Escobar's killers. 
</P>
<P>
 The subdued crowd filed past Escobar's open casket, flanked by dozens of 
bright bouquets and a dozen police standing at attention, and gazed at 
Escobar's pale face under his mop of dark, curly hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice!" someone in the crowd shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombian soccer has long been connected to drug traffickers. Pablo Escobar, 
the most ruthless of the cocaine barons until his death in a shootout with 
police last December, was a major contributor to Medellin's professional team, 
Atletico Nacional, for which Andres Escobar played. The two Escobars were not 
related. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country accustomed to brutal drug wars that have claimed the lives of 
presidential candidates, journalists and hundreds of innocents watching from 
the sidelines, Colombians were nevertheless shocked by Escobar's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The national team, none of whose members is believed to have direct links to 
drug trafficking, was considered by experts to have a shot at winning the World 
Cup, thanks in part to its grace and precise style. And players had expressed 
hope in interviews before the tournament that their athletic virtuosity would 
cleanse Colombia's image and win honor for it on the international stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer is only a game, and there is no justification for Andres to have been 
killed for having committed an auto-goal," Coach Maturana said. 
</P>
<P>
 From Dallas, headquarters of the World Cup, Andreas Herren, spokesman for 
soccer's international governing body, FIFA, said, "Everybody at FIFA is deeply 
shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar's mistake was an "auto-goal" -- he accidentally knocked the ball into 
his own team's net, scoring the opening goal for opponent United States. Many 
Colombians blamed the mistake for rattling the team so badly that it never 
recovered and went on to lose. That, combined with an earlier loss to Romania, 
eliminated Colombia from the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 But Escobar sought to deal with his error, which he called the worst moment in 
his sports career. In an open letter to his country, published in a Bogota 
newspaper, he asked fans to "maintain decency." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "Please tell everybody that (playing in the World Cup) was the most 
rare, phenomenal opportunity and experience I have ever had, so see you soon, 
because life doesn't end here." 
</P>

DREAMS OF BETTER DAYS DIED THAT NIGHT; NICOLE SIMPSON: A STRONG WOMAN, SHE WAS 
ON A QUEST TO FIND HER IDENTITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the beginning, she didn't even recognize him, that's how unworldly she was. 
"That's O.J. Simpson!" her boss at the nightclub exclaimed. She had never heard 
of the guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, friends and relatives would recount the episode and shake their heads. 
It wasn't just the naivete. By the time she married him seven years later at 
the age of 25, it seemed there had never been a time when the larger-than-life 
celebrity had not dominated her existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Their home was his mansion. Their friends were his friends. Her relatives were 
his employees. When she decided to take up interior decorating, her only 
clients were Simpson and his pals. Friends said that if he did not like what 
she was wearing, she would change clothes to please him. Later she would tell 
friends that she felt so overwhelmed, not even her words felt to her like her 
own. In a divorce court deposition, she would later confess: "I've always told 
O.J. what he wants to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the man who so shaped the life of Nicole Brown Simpson has come to 
dominate the story of her death as well. Charged with murdering her and her 
friend Ronald Lyle Goldman, it is O.J. Simpson who has captivated the nation's 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson, meanwhile, has been reduced to the size of a poster child, her 
friends and relatives say bitterly: Murder victim; battered wife. Nothing like 
the strong, fun-loving woman they knew. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all O.J., O.J. right now," said Rolf Baur, 46, a first cousin who was 
raised by Nicole Simpson's parents and whom she and her sisters considered a 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia (Cici) Shahian, 39, a Beverly Hills friend, said: "I feel that Nicole 
has gotten lost in all this." 
</P>
<P>
 Their Nicole, they say, was a 35-year-old wife and mother who had never felt 
free to be just herself. Half her life had been consumed in the tempestuous 
tit-for-tat that had been her celebrity marriage. In what would be her final 
days, she had resolved to finally find her identity. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a wrenching endeavor. The relationship was a monstrous edifice, 
friends and relatives say, a dark house of passion, manipulation, money, love 
and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Her quest, they believe, cost her her marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say it cost her her life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Brown Simpson was born May 19, 1959, near Frankfurt, Germany, her 
mother's homeland. Lou Brown, a native of Kansas, had met and married Juditha 
Baur of the small town of Rollwald, where he was serving with the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first two daughters, Denise and Nicole, were born in Germany, while Lou 
Brown worked at Stars and Stripes, the American military newspaper; later, he 
started an insurance company for members of the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the United States when the girls were toddlers, the Browns lived 
first in Long Beach, then bought a large home with a tennis court, a 
16-foot-deep pool and a three-acre back yard in the Royal Palm Estates section 
of Garden Grove. Two more daughters, Dominique and Tanya, were born. Nicole and 
Denise started high school there, at Rancho Alamitos High School, before the 
family moved to the gated Orange County beach community of Monarch Bay in the 
mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dana Hills High School, what people remembered first about the Brown girls 
was how good-looking they were. Nicole -- they called her "Nick" -- was named 
homecoming princess by the football team in 1976; the year before, Denise had 
been homecoming queen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nicole was bubbly, always happy and smiling," said Bill Prestridge, one of 
her teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, she was "more mature than other students," he said. 
"You almost got the idea that she was ready to get out of high school and go on 
to bigger and better things." 
</P>
<P>
 Interested in modeling and photography, Nicole enrolled briefly at Saddleback 
College in Mission Viejo, where high school friend Chris Valdivia occasionally 
saw her around campus. By that time, he said, everyone knew she was dating 
Simpson but her romance with the football superstar didn't seem to have changed 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was just always really down-to-earth, really friendly," Valdivia said. 
'Volatile . . . Relationship' 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole was barely 18 and just out of high school when she met Simpson. After a 
two-week stint as a salesclerk in a boutique -- during which she made not a 
single sale, according to her divorce papers -- she started work as a waitress 
at the Daisy, a trendy Beverly Hills club where Simpson was a regular. 
</P>
<P>
 The football legend, then 30, whose first marriage to high school classmate 
Marguerite Whitley was faltering, began courting Nicole almost immediately, 
Baur said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Hanson, a Dana Hills High School home economics teacher, remembers Nicole 
coming back to proudly usher Simpson around to meet her and sign autographs for 
those in the class one day. "You know teen-agers," she said. "They like someone 
older and more sophisticated and she certainly did. He was everybody's idol, of 
course, then." 
</P>
<P>
 Within months, she had moved in with him, dropping out of community college 
because Simpson "required that she be with him," according to the brief her 
divorce lawyer filed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very passionate, a very volatile, a very obsessive relationship. On 
both sides," said actress Cathy Lee Crosby, a friend of the couple who has 
known O.J. Simpson for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 One source close to the family said that even before they were married, they 
had fights. During one, Nicole holed up in the bathroom and telephoned her 
mother, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were times, the source said, when she would move out and other times 
when he would throw her out, tossing her clothes after her. Then she would go 
home to her parents in Monarch Bay, but within days a contrite Simpson would 
call and apologize, she would return and for a time they would be loving again. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had many, many happy days together," the source said. "It just seemed 
like something snapped sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was physically powerful, "she fought him back with words. She's a 
strong person," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 She did not feel strong, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only attended junior college for a very short time, because (Simpson) 
wanted me to be available to travel with him whenever his career required him 
to go to a new location, even if it was for a short period of time," she said 
in an affidavit filed during her divorce. "I have no other college education, 
and I hold no degrees." 
</P>
<P>
 But with Simpson's money and growing fame, who needed a career? And her 
emotional contributions did not go unrecognized. Six months after their wedding 
in 1985, when he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Simpson 
thanked his new -- and pregnant -- wife for helping ease his departure from 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Gazing down at his wife from the podium, he said she "came into my life at 
what is probably the most difficult time for an athlete, at the end of my 
career . . . (and) turned those years into some of the best I have had in my 
life, babes." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months after that, their first child was born, a baby daughter. By that 
time, Simpson had become a national spokesman for Hertz and several other 
companies, earning an estimated $1 million a year. They moved to a $5-million 
Brentwood mansion on Rockingham Avenue. They had his-and-hers Ferraris. A 
$1.9-million Laguna Beach house. A New York pied-a-terre. Her pocket money 
allowance was $5,000 a month or more. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, divorce records show, Simpson was supporting his mother and two 
grown children from his first marriage; he was equally generous with his 
in-laws. He hired Baur, first as the gardener at their estate, then as the 
manager of his two Pioneer Chicken restaurants in Los Angeles. At the same 
time, Baur's wife, Maria, worked as the Simpsons' housekeeper three days a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's father-in-law Lou worked for him as well, running his Hertz car 
rental franchise at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel. "O.J. practically gave it 
to him," Baur said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Simpson also paid for Nicole's sister Dominique to attend USC. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an old-fashioned marriage in which she minded the baby and he paid the 
bills. Every Easter, they gave an elaborate shindig at the Rockingham mansion 
for all the relatives. The couple were a magnetic presence at all the family 
gatherings. Baur has videotape, shot and narrated by Simpson, of the day Baur 
brought his newborn son home from the hospital. (As the family parades into 
Baur's small Long Beach apartment, Simpson can be heard teasing his 
brother-in-law about whether he has "cleaned up for the boss.") 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the Simpsons had a second child, a son. By all appearances, friends 
said, they seemed to have a perfect life. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they had parties at Rockingham, we had the best times. We would play 
games -- scavenger hunt, truth or consequences," said Cora Fischman, who lived 
down the street from the Simpson home. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischman was a doctor's wife with three children, and through the youngsters, 
she and Nicole Simpson became close friends and confidantes. Her daughter 
attended private school with the Simpsons' little girl and her youngest child 
went to the same preschool as their son. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Nicole Simpson was a talented hostess and a conscientious mother, she 
was also notable among her contemporaries for her guardedness. 
</P>
<P>
 That caution extended even to Baur's wife, who worked in the Simpson house 
three days a week for almost three years. "She was the type of person who would 
not say to me what her problems were," said Maria Baur, who said she often 
heard the couple exchange screaming, angry words behind the closed door of the 
home's office. "She wouldn't talk." 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, no one really knew her during her marriage," said one woman who 
had been friends with her since both were in their early 20s. "She was never 
free to be herself or have friends. She wasn't available for that kind of 
intimacy." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only much later, the friend added, that she began to suspect there was 
more to Nicole Simpson's guardedness than met the eye, that there was something 
very wrong about her tendency toward sudden cancellations and no-shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would have these horrible cramps. That's what O.J. would tell us. 'Nicole 
has horrible menstrual cramps.' Supposedly they kept her in bed for days," the 
friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, however, the violent and jealous facets of the Simpson marriage 
became common -- if closely held -- knowledge in their small circle of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Young, daughter of Gig and Elaine Young, the late actor and the 
Beverly Hills real estate agent, recalls bumping into Simpson one day at La 
Scala in Beverly Hills while waiting to be seated for lunch. Graciously, she 
said, he asked her and her girlfriend to join him, and they did. 
</P>
<P>
 But when they left the restaurant, she said, Nicole Simpson roared up in a 
black Mercedes, her blond hair in a bun, her face contorted with rage. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was screaming at the top of her lungs in the middle of Rodeo Drive," 
Young said. "She was, like, 'If you're f------ going to cheat on me, why don't 
you pick somebody f------ pretty?' " 
</P>
<P>
 It was that sort of conflict, her friends said, that touched off their most 
serious fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd cheat. She'd find out. She'd get angry. She'd confront him. She's a 
strong girl and she'd confront him. And they would fight," said one longtime 
friend. New Year's Day Assault 
</P>
<P>
 This, friends say, was the backdrop on New Year's Day, 1989, when the 
now-infamous beating occurred. According to police reports, as officers arrived 
at the Simpson estate at 3:30 a.m., Nicole Simpson burst from the hedges, 
rushed across the lawn in her sweat pants and bra and collapsed against the 
gate-release button. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to kill me, he's going to kill me," she cried, according to the 
report. "You never do anything about him. You talk to him and then leave." Her 
eye was black. Her lip was split. His handprint was still on her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want that woman sleeping in my bed anymore!" Simpson shouted, 
according to the report. "I got two women, and I don't want that woman in my 
bed anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson -- who later pleaded no contest to spousal battery -- has since said 
the incident was an isolated one, and that he took the blame to head off bad 
publicity for him and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, outsiders would wonder why Nicole Simpson did not end the marriage 
then. But to their friends and relatives, it seemed that by that time their 
entanglement was so powerful it could never be sundered. 
</P>
<P>
 Baur said she stayed "because she loved him. And he loved her so much." And 
there were her hopes, friends said, that her children would have a stable home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said all she wanted was to be a good mom like her mom," Fischman said. 
"All she wanted was a simple life." 
</P>
<P>
 But "she was afraid that if she left, a lot of people would be left out in the 
cold," one intimate said, referring to her relatives' financial connections to 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, however, in early 1992, Nicole Simpson filed for divorce. By that 
time, her father was no longer working for Simpson. The car franchise, Baur 
said, had never been profitable, and Simpson had finally sold it. Lou Brown, 
whose other business ventures had included commercial real estate investing and 
carwash ownership, went into semi-retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Baur, too, found himself out of a job, although according to court documents 
his loss was a function of local events. In divorce records, Simpson reported 
that the Los Angeles riots destroyed his one profitable Pioneer Chicken 
franchise, forcing the shutdown of the other as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Baur, while confirming the financial connections between his relatives and 
Simpson, said he does not believe that Nicole Simpson felt compelled to prolong 
her troubled marriage because of any family dependence on her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that's fair," Baur said, "because not everybody was on his 
payroll and we all worked hard for our money. He had jobs to do and we did 
them." Other family members declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The divorce left Nicole Simpson single again for the first time since her 
teens. She was awarded $433,750 and $10,000 a month child support. She moved 
into a rented house five minutes from the mansion, then bought a nearby 
condominium. Friends said she was as dutiful a mother as ever, handling the 
car-pool, showing up at all the school functions, shuttling her little son to 
karate lessons and her daughter to dance class. 
</P>
<P>
 But suddenly, they said, a freer, lighter Nicole Simpson also began to emerge. 
The transformation in her, friends said, was palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 "She became Nicole Brown , her own person," Fischman said. "She started all 
over again." 
</P>
<P>
 She got friendlier with old acquaintances, developing a cadre of perhaps half 
a dozen women friends -- Fischman, Shahian, Westside socialite Faye Resnick, 
actress Robin Greer, and Chris Jenner (wife of athlete Bruce Jenner), among 
others. They were a stunning crew ("We're all pretty cute," laughed one 
Westside divorcee who developed a close bond with her on a trip to Cabo San 
Lucas. "When we went out to dance, we had to dance with each other to keep the 
wolves away.") 
</P>
<P>
 She threw potluck dinners by candlelight. She would drop the children at 
school and go jogging -- six, nine, 10 miles at a clip -- in skintight workout 
clothes. She would tuck the children into bed at night, recite the Lord's 
Prayer with them in German, and then leave them with a sitter while she went 
out dancing till last call. Bartenders would watch, mesmerized, as she hit the 
dance floor, dripping sweat, in her tank top and strategically ripped jeans, 
slapping down her platinum American Express for another round of Patron 
tequila. 
</P>
<P>
 Other nights, she would don a black mini-dress and meet her new girlfriends 
for dinner at Brentwood's Toscana restaurant, splurging on $150 bottles of 
Cristal champagne. Even so, what people remembered was her down-to-earth 
disposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was totally a real person," said an acting teacher who ran into her 
intermittently over the years. "She had nice things, but she treated her 
Ferrari the way other people treat their Volkswagen. She was such a no-attitude 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend Shahian added: "She was just so generous -- with her money, 
herself. She'd have six, seven kids over there at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the legacy of the marriage cast its shadow. She couldn't help it. It 
was the standard against which she defined herself. Simpson detested smoking; 
she would sneak cigarettes. He was fastidious; she boasted about what a mess 
her new home was. During their marriage, he encouraged her to wear only the 
finest of clothes, deluging her with French Fogal stockings at $60 a pair. On 
her own, friends said, she had to be prodded to go shopping and showed up at 
black-tie dinners barelegged. 
</P>
<P>
 And Simpson, friends said, was ubiquitous. Affluence notwithstanding, 
Brentwood is a small town. Gossip echoes from every iron gate and grocery 
aisle. A five-minute drive could tell him if a stranger was parked in his 
ex-wife's drive. She could flip on the TV and see who was sitting next to him 
in the stands at a football game. 
</P>
<P>
 She dated, friends said, although the dates were few and far between. There 
was Keith Zlomsowitch, a restaurateur she had met in Aspen and later at 
Mezzaluna, a trattoria-style Brentwood watering hole. Friends said he doted on 
her, but she was not ready for a serious relationship. One night, they said, 
Simpson drove past her house and through the front window saw Zlomsowitch on 
the couch with her; she stopped dating him very soon thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 (Zlomsowitch could not be reached for comment. His parents confirmed that he 
had once been briefly involved with Nicole Simpson and had been a pallbearer at 
her funeral.) 
</P>
<P>
 There were two other men as well, the friends said -- an aspiring actor with 
whom she had a brief fling, and later, a tentative, six-month romance with a 
24-year-old law clerk she had met in her divorce lawyer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But about 18 months after leaving Simpson, she began seeing a counselor, one 
friend said, a man they had all heard about in Aspen who specialized in group 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all went for a couple of months," the friend said, "and then Nicole went 
for the intensive, which was about $4,000, where she would go every day for, 
like, a month." 
</P>
<P>
 When she emerged, the friend said, she announced that she had made a decision: 
"She called me up and said, 'I want my husband back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "She called O.J. up," the friend said. He refused to take the call, "so she 
drove over there in just her zoris and a little summer shift." He told her he 
was doing fine without her, but when she got home, he called to say he had 
changed his mind and wanted to reconcile. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, their relationship was tempestuous again. "He broke the back door 
down to get in," she pleads on a widely aired 911 tape from Oct. 25, 1993. 
"He's f------ going nuts. . . . He's going to beat the s--- out of me." 
</P>
<P>
 On the tape, she tells the operator that Simpson had been leafing through her 
photo albums and had come across a picture of an ex-boyfriend (friends said it 
was Zlomsowitch). On and Off Reconciliation 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the reconciliation continued, on again, off again, friends said. Now 
they were living at Rockingham; now she had bought a condo of her own. Now the 
relationship was doomed; now they were together for Christmas. Now she had had 
enough; now it was her birthday, and he had given her a platinum bracelet 
studded with sapphires and rubies and diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But a week after her birthday, Baur said, she gave back the bracelet and told 
Simpson that there would be no reconciliation and no hope of one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nicole wanted to be free of him, she wanted to live her life with the 
children and raise them away from all this fiasco of the marriage," he said. 
"She wanted to have a happier, more peaceful life. . . . This time it was 
different. She really meant it and he knew it." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he said, she seemed relieved. In a matter of days, Simpson was 
being seen with model Paula Barbieri, whom he had dated right after the 
divorce. Donna Estes, a writer and film producer who has known the Simpsons for 
the last six years, said she saw him with Barbieri at a Memorial Day golf 
outing, but that before dinner, Barbieri suddenly left. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Estes said, Simpson confided that they had gotten into an argument when 
he confessed that he still loved Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the night before Nicole died, Simpson showed up at a black-tie event 
with Barbieri on his arm. Friends said Nicole was relieved when she found out: 
"She was happier than hell about it," said a woman who spoke to her on the 
night she died. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the next day, at their daughter's dance recital, her friends said, 
Simpson and Nicole scarcely looked at each other. A friend who was there said 
she made it clear he would not be invited to the family dinner afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, their friends said, they made a stunning pair, she in her backless 
black dress, he in silk shirt and jeans. Three folding chairs, wide as a 
demilitarized zone, marked the chasm between them as their little girl danced. 
In less than six hours, Nicole Brown Simpson was dead.

DREAMS OF BETTER DAYS DIED THAT NIGHT; RONALD GOLDMAN: A YOUNG MAN WAS FINDING 
HIS WAY THROUGH THE MAZE OF L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL and GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it's Hollywood's fault or maybe it's our own, but when a murder involves 
the rich or famous, everyone has a scenario. And we think we recognize the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder, then, that so many jumped to conclusions about Ronald Lyle Goldman 
as soon as the body of the handsome 25-year-old was discovered near that of 
Nicole Brown Simpson early one morning last month outside her Brentwood 
condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a waiter and sometime model. His driver's license photo showed his head 
cocked back, a bandanna swathed around his head. Now here he was, deep in the 
night, dead on her walkway. 
</P>
<P>
 Images sprang. Rumors spread. In an instant, the world had created its own Ron 
Goldman -- a smooth-talking, golden-skinned Westside gadabout. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real story bears no resemblance to the fiction, the image conjured. 
</P>
<P>
 At 25, Goldman was still finding his way through the maze of dreams that Los 
Angeles seems to offer. He longed for a serious girlfriend, but didn't have 
one. He wanted to open his own restaurant but that dream was years away from 
becoming a reality. In the meantime, he waited on tables at Mezzaluna, a 
casually chic trattoria, a short walk from his $750-a-month Brentwood 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Ron's philosophy was to shoot for the stars," said his friend Michael 
Davis. "I think we're all dreamers." 'He Was Trying to Get His Life Together' 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman and his fellow dreamers were the good-looking, weightlifting affable 
young men who easily make friends walking through Brentwood Gardens, a local 
shopping mall, or lingering over coffee at the Starbucks on San Vicente 
Boulevard. Like them, he embraced the mythologized Los Angeles lifestyle -- he 
played volleyball on the beach, he surfed, he Rollerbladed, he appeared on 
"Studs," the now-defunct game show that featured saucy young men and women 
sparring and flirting with one another. "Girls will love him," the talent 
coordinator wrote after his audition. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Brentwood that Goldman crossed paths with Nicole Simpson. They met 
two months ago, maybe three, when his neighbor introduced them at Starbucks, 
where a mix of local residents with their gym-toned bodies, their newspapers 
and their dogs linger over caffe lattes and fruit muffins. 
</P>
<P>
 She was as chatty as his friends, and any encounters between Goldman and 
Nicole Simpson seemed as breezy and innocent as the balmy ocean wind that 
ruffles the coral trees on San Vicente. That he was good-looking and 
disarmingly personable seems undeniable. That he was the other man in Nicole 
Simpson's life seems unlikely. Plain untrue, his friends insist. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter, Goldman -- who would have been 26 Saturday -- was already 
distracted by a job he found reasonably satisfying, a wide circle of friends 
and the constant challenge of wrestling Los Angeles into the shape of his 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying to get his life together," said Carly Kostrubanic, a friend who 
dated him for about a month. "He was working really hard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He made friends effortlessly. In Brentwood, while working at the California 
Pizza Kitchen, Goldman forged a friendship with Michael Davis when the young 
actor came to pick up a takeout order. 
</P>
<P>
 Jodi Kahn, a staffer at the trendy Theodore clothing boutique in Brentwood 
Gardens, recalls him visiting the store several times a week. "Ron would come 
in here and sit in that chair and hang out," Kahn said in the boutique, a few 
days after Goldman's death. "He never had a bad word to say about anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last months of his life, after finishing work at Mezzaluna, he would 
drop in on his friend and neighbor Gail Evertz, once announcing his presence by 
playfully tossing a tennis ball through her ground-floor terrace windows. He 
would come bearing pasta from the restaurant -- or a reminder to lock her 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would help anyone," Evertz said. "He was the kind of guy who just gave 
unconditionally." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to describe his personality on his 1991 application to appear on 
"Studs," Goldman wrote: "outgoing, cocky, adventurous, relaxed and athletic." 
</P>
<P>
 He basked in the warmth of the climate and the outdoor lifestyle. He wore 
jeans, oversized shirts and Doc Martens. "He became a real California kid," 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 His death might have him remembered for his quirky appearance on a flashy game 
show, his likeness in a clothing boutique ad and his relationship with a 
beautiful blonde. But, in essence, Goldman seemed not much different from the 
sweet, endearing prankster recalled by his childhood neighbors and high school 
friends in Buffalo Grove, Ill., where he was raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly he had changed both in looks and lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have seen the recent photos of a tall, muscled young man who 
sometimes modeled can hardly believe it was the same short, wiry teen-ager they 
knew at Stevenson High. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's night and day," said Jeffrey James Greenbury, a classmate whose locker 
was next to Goldman's. "It's like when he crossed the border (to California), 
he changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Many found it hard to believe he had blossomed from a sweet nebbish of a boy 
to a sleek, self-assured habitue of the gyms, coffee shops and clubs of L.A.'s 
trendy Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 They were stunned at how his life had evolved. "I would have thought he would 
have grown up and lived in the suburbs . . . like the rest of us," said Sheryl 
Steines, 25. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goldman's transformation may have been little more than a change of 
costume and scenery. Friends in Buffalo Grove speak of him in eerily similar 
ways to his more recent friends in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "In high school, he was quiet but friendly. The kind of guy you'd like to be 
around once you got to know him," said Dan Argentar, 23, who grew up around the 
corner from Goldman. He wasn't the golden boy, but he mixed so easily that he 
got invited to all the parties anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a really nice guy, down to earth," said Marla Koza, 25, who was Marla 
Edelheit when Goldman took her to the senior prom. "He was very excited about 
it. My brother reminded me that after I said I'd go with him, he brought over 
roses." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman's father and mother divorced in 1974 and after a brief time in his 
mother's custody, Goldman grew up with his father and a younger sister, Kim, 
who remembers him doting on her. His mother, Sharon Rufo of St. Louis, has not 
spoken about him except to say she last saw him seven years ago and last spoke 
to him two years ago. She learned of his death, Rufo said, from her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Old friends watching news accounts were stung by the anonymous handle now 
bestowed upon him. "When they say on the news 'Nicole Simpson and a male 
friend,' I scream at the TV: 'He has a name. It's Ron Goldman! ' " said 
neighbor Kris DeBolt, who trusted him enough as a teen-age boy to baby-sit her 
young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 He was no more a standout at Stevenson than he was in Los Angeles. He 
energetically played soccer, swam, and skied -- but he was never good enough to 
earn the varsity letters that his friends won. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was definitely a joker," said Jeffrey James Greenbury, 25. "The problem 
was that his position on the social ladder, if that's what you'd call it, 
didn't give him the attention he wanted. He was really funny, but was not in 
the 'in crowd.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And if his California image conveyed something flashy, Goldman was anything 
but in high school. "He was so far from a ladies' man, I can't tell you," 
recalled classmate Greenbury. Plunging Into the L.A. Scene 
</P>
<P>
 Average Joe or not, Goldman seemed to make the transition from the Chicago 
suburbs to Los Angeles without much difficulty. Maybe it was the fact that he 
grew up in an affluent northwest suburb with families ranging from middle class 
to upper crust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, when you go to a friend's home, you may see a big stream running 
through an atrium off the living room. And three Mercedes-Benzes in the 
garage," Stevenson's Associate Principal Dan Galloway said of the area's 
wealth. "So the kids grow up with it." 
</P>
<P>
 At 18, Goldman left Illinois State University after one year, abandoning a 
planned major in psychology, to be with his family in Southern California. He 
wasn't following a dream, but soon he would be immersed in a community where 
people do nothing but. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman plunged into the Los Angeles scene -- even though he lived miles away 
with his family in the Oak Park community near Agoura Hills. What he didn't 
know -- surfing -- he learned. What he knew -- tennis -- he taught. 
</P>
<P>
 In his California life, Goldman would have a string of waiter jobs. He met 
Craig Clark when they both worked at the Pierview restaurant in Malibu. They 
forged a long friendship, playing volleyball on sultry afternoons and sampling 
the clubs at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anywhere that was hot, everywhere that was hot," said Clark, laughing. "We 
always got in free, because he always knew people at the clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 At one of those clubs, Clark recalled, Goldman met a pretty, slender blond 
woman named Jacqui Bell. In 1992, Bell and Goldman began an intense on-again, 
off-again relationship. At first they lived together in her Westside apartment 
and then in a first-floor garden apartment they found near Gorham and 
Barrington avenues in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 He got a job as a waiter at the California Pizza Kitchen in the airy 
white-walled Brentwood Gardens mall. His life revolved around Bell and his 
widening circle of friends in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The place captures the sun-dappled image of Los Angeles. It has wide, quiet 
streets, expensive boutiques, yogurt shops and two restaurants specializing in 
state-of-the-art health food and fat-free cuisine a mere mile apart. It is 
fabulously wealthy and relatively affordable -- if two people share a 
two-bedroom apartment. And it is where aspiring stars can brush up against 
instantly recognizable celebrities -- super-agent Michael Ovitz, perhaps the 
most powerful man in Hollywood, lives hardly more than a mile from Goldman's 
struggling actor friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Free of the frenzy of beachside Santa Monica and Venice, it's still just a 
three-mile trip on Rollerblades down San Vicente Boulevard to the ocean. "He 
loved it because there was a sense of community, a sense of belonging, a sense 
of family," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, friends remember, very rarely drank, was never seen taking drugs, and 
consulted Davis -- also a trainer at The Gym -- for low-fat diets. 
</P>
<P>
 Women found him warm and affectionate. Far from being a heartbreaker, he 
seemed the one more likely to have his heart broken. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard waking up in the morning knowing one of the few wonderful 
people in the world is gone," said Bell, his former girlfriend, who ended their 
relationship four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted a commitment. I'm not very good with commitments. Maybe if I'd 
given him the commitment he wanted he'd still be here," said Bell, her voice 
filled with anguish. "He was a very sweet, honest faithful guy when we were 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 When they were together, she said, they were the quietest of couples -- dining 
in and watching videos. Goldman bought her a Belgian sheep dog named Audrey. 
"It's the only thing I have left of him." 
</P>
<P>
 But their 1 1/2-year relationship was marked by stormy moments and sporadic 
separations. Once, when Bell left for St. Louis, Goldman flew there to persuade 
her to return to their Brentwood home. "For a guy who doesn't have a car or a 
dime, this was really quite wonderful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell moved out for good in February. A month later, she recalls, Goldman 
showed up in tears at the tony Westside boutique where she works. "He wanted me 
back, he missed me," she said. But it was not meant to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, he struggled with the breakup of his relationship and grew 
miserable at "CPK" -- as the California Pizza Kitchen chain is known among some 
of its clientele. "He wanted his own restaurant. How would you feel about being 
a waiter? He was frustrated. He wanted his life to go on," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
 He left the restaurant in March. He quickly found a job at Mezzaluna, earning 
better tips and meeting more people. "He was so proud that he'd found a job in 
only a few days," said Kostrubanic, a sometimes model and actress. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman was comfortable at Mezzaluna. With its buttery soft lighting and 
expansive picture windows, the low-key restaurant buzzes with the chatter of 
the eclectic Westside crowd it draws. "It was a scene," Kostrubanic said. "He 
loved that." 
</P>
<P>
 His ambitions still seemed vague. He fell into his modeling jobs for Barry 
Zeldes, owner of Z90049 -- the store next to the California Pizza Kitchen in 
Brentwood Gardens. "My model backed out. I thought he'd be good," Zeldes said. 
Goldman quizzed Michael Davis on his acting jobs and left Davis with the 
impression that he wanted to be a working actor. "He said, 'Man, I really want 
to do that. I want to be on a show,' " Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one can even recall seeing a head shot -- the basic calling card of any 
actor, working or aspiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "One philosophy we all spoke of was networking," said Jeff Keller, the 
roommate of Michael Davis. "We have to meet people." 
</P>
<P>
 At that, Goldman excelled. In the last few months of his life, he worked 
occasionally as a promoter at dance clubs on nights when club managers turn 
over the club to outside groups who promote a special theme or kind of music. 
(The promoters often get the gate; the club management gets the profits from 
the bar.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was not an insatiable club-goer -- friends insist he only went two 
or three times a month -- he seemed to have the perfect skills for being a club 
promoter: a gregarious personality and an endless list of friends to invite. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to know all aspects of the restaurant and bar business," Jeff 
Keller said. Goldman was part of a group of promoters who ran a party on 
Memorial Day weekend at Renaissance, the club and restaurant on the Santa 
Monica Promenade. "He was definitely a social person," said Philip Cummins, the 
managing owner. In fact, Cummins noted, he would have been promoting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 But the club scene could be wearing for Goldman. So could the relentless 
preening and posturing of the denizens of young L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 He told Davis he envied his friend's quiet times with his girlfriend: "He 
would say . . . 'I really miss that -- having someone to talk to, you don't 
have to go out, you can avoid all the craziness out there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was something alluring for Goldman about the night life 
epitomized by restaurants such as Mezzaluna. In his mind, he sketched out his 
plans for his future restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was going to have big metal doors," recalled Jeff Keller. "There wouldn't 
be a name but a symbol -- an ankh." It is the ancient Egyptian symbol of life 
and it matched the tattoo on his shoulder. Friendship With Nicole 
</P>
<P>
 The missing ingredient, of course, was money. Goldman got by on the basics -- 
an apartment, a wardrobe of fashionable casual clothes, and friends who let him 
borrow their cars. He walked to work. He and his friends got by on little and 
spoke longingly of the days when they would be financially successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, on his way to work, he stopped by the apartment that Keller and 
Davis shared and they all went for coffee at Starbucks. It was there they 
occasionally ran into Nicole Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 She often stopped for coffee after her daily run or with her Akita in tow. She 
would sit in the sun on the low concrete wall that borders the coffee shop and 
chat with Goldman's pals. Like them, she too had once been a waitress, a woman 
just pondering her goals when she was swept up into O.J. Simpson's world. Like 
them, she made friends easily. Davis said he met her in passing at Brentwood 
Gardens. "I don't even know what transpired," he recalled. "We just got to 
talking." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the coffee bar Simpson and the guys exchanged tidbits -- plans for the 
day, her children, their acting auditions. Goldman appeared no closer to her 
than the rest of them -- except that he got an occasional chance to drive her 
white convertible Ferrari. He looked happy as a boy with a new toy the spring 
night that she let him drive her and Keller to Locanda Veneta in Beverly Hills. 
"She was a young kid, too," said Keller, who got to drive home. "She knew she 
had a great car." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends say the relationship was innocent and casual. "If he was having a 
relationship with her, he would have told us," Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Evertz, with whom he often talked about his relationships, confronted him 
in early June: "I said, 'What's going on?' I was teasing him -- only because 
the guys had said, 'Oh, Nicole really likes him.' He said, 'Absolutely nothing. 
She likes all the guys. I'm not special.' I even asked him if he slept with 
her. He said, 'Absolutely not.' " In fact, Evertz said, Goldman speculated that 
Simpson was interested in one of their other friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simpson's good looks -- blond and beautiful was definitely his type -- and 
her great car were irresistible -- if virtually unattainable. He once showed up 
in her car for a lunch date at Cafe Montana with his old friend Craig Clark. "I 
said, 'Hey, we're styling,' " recalled Clark, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friday before his death, Goldman told another friend that he had gone with 
Simpson to the Gate, a popular West Hollywood club. He reveled in the moment 
that they pulled up to the entrance and caused everyone to stare. "I said, 
'Ron, when you show up at the Gate with O.J. Simpson's wife, driving her 
Ferrari, you're asking for trouble,' " said the friend, who asked not to be 
identified. Goldman reassured him there was little to it. "He said, 'Don't 
worry about it. We're just friends.' " His Last Weekend 
</P>
<P>
 The last weekend of his life was not that different from other weekends. 
Friday night, he went to dinner with Tiffany Starr, a cocktail waitress at 
Renaissance and a model. It was their second dinner date. On their first date, 
he had told her about his restaurant plans and even pointed out an ankh to her 
in a store where they were browsing. On their second date, they were still 
getting to know each other. "He was telling me how he wanted to get married in 
the next two years and he wanted to have children," Starr said. "He wanted a 
son." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Starr went to work and Goldman showed up with friends at the club but 
left around midnight. "He said he wasn't having any fun; he was tired," recalls 
his friend Tracy Katzer, who ran into him that night. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, he played volleyball on the beach with Keller and that night he 
went to the club, Tripp's, with two women friends. On Sunday, he played 
softball with friends at a park off Barrington and then he went to work at 
Mezzaluna. Nicole Simpson ate there that night, but Goldman didn't wait on her 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 He had after-work plans with his friend, Stewart Tanner, the bartender. "He 
was going to go home and change and then we were going to go out," Tanner said. 
Before Goldman finished work, the restaurant got a call from Nicole Simpson -- 
a pair of glasses had been left behind. Goldman punched out at 9:33 p.m. and 
stayed another 15 minutes to have a bottled water at the bar. Then he left -- 
still in his uniform, black pants and white shirt, his tie shed. He carried the 
glasses that Simpson wanted returned to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll see you later," he called to Tanner as he walked out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the days since his death, Goldman's friends here and where he grew up have 
searched for mementos of the young man they loved. 
</P>
<P>
 In Buffalo Grove, Kris DeBolt found an old photograph that shows a 10-year-old 
Goldman at a birthday party for her youngest daughter, Tiffaney. "Some days, 
I'm angry," DeBolt said. "Some days, I'm just hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Out here, Tiffany Starr, who had barely begun to date Goldman, knew what would 
make her feel better. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of his funeral, she went to the store they visited on their first 
date and found the ankh he had pointed out to her. 
</P>
<P>
 She bought it.

JETLINER CRASHES IN N. CAROLINA; 19 DEAD, 31 HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A USAir jetliner feeling its way through a thunderstorm Saturday at the 
Charlotte-Douglas International Airport tried at the last moment to turn and 
climb but crashed instead into a house and burned, killing at least 19 of the 
55 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials said at least two people inside the home were injured and 
that one person driving past was hurt by flying debris. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11:20 p.m. EDT, Jerry Orr, the airport aviation director, said 19 
passengers aboard Flight 1016, en route from Columbia, S.C., were dead. An 
additional 31 people were taken to hospitals in the Charlotte area, he said, 
including the pilot, co-pilot and all three flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
 He said five people were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness said one man ran from the wreckage screaming: "Help me! Help me! I'm 
on fire!" 
</P>
<P>
 One woman at the scene told reporters that she saw several people who were 
burnedand that some had suffered broken bones. Some said they had seen others 
inside the wreckage who were also on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Some victims were hysterical, the woman said. She said they were trying to 
find their loved ones and that some were crying out their names. 
</P>
<P>
 In Atlanta, Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation 
Administration, said the jet, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, crashed at about 6:50 
p.m. EDT while "executing a missed approach procedure." 
</P>
<P>
 "It came in, attempted to land, wasn't able to do so and was pulling up, which 
is a normal type of procedure," she said, "except in this case unfortunately it 
did not make it." 
</P>
<P>
 A team of investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board left 
Washington late Saturday for Charlotte to determine what caused the missed 
approach. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena was expected to fly to the 
crash site today. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, airport officials said, a thunderstorm had reduced visibility to 
about a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said the last radio message from the cockpit about 6:40 p.m. 
informed the airport tower that the pilot would try a second approach to the 
runway. Normally, these officials said, that meant turning to the right, 
climbing and circling once. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the plane veered out of control, Orr said. He said it sheared off the 
tops of some telephone poles, fell onto a field, slid into some woods and then 
careened across a road. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane broke into three large pieces, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the rear section of the aircraft came to rest on part of the house and 
caused it to burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Robinson, a minister who lives near the airport, was watching planes 
take off and land when he saw the jet crash. 
</P>
<P>
 It fell about 200 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson told the Associated Press that heavy rain made the visibility so poor 
that he could not see the airport tower. 
</P>
<P>
 When the wreckage finally skidded to a halt, Robinson said, a man in a 
military uniform ran from the plane with his clothing in flames. Robinson said 
the man screamed: "Help me! Help me! I'm on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said he was too far away to be of any immediate assistance. He said 
he and others nearby shouted at the man to roll on the ground until the fire 
was out. 
</P>
<P>
 Another witness, Connie Abrams, told NBC News that she saw survivors from the 
plane who were very badly burned. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was blood everywhere. Some of them were trying to find their loved 
ones. They were running, they were screaming. They couldn't think clearly," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the survivors fled, helicopters hovered over the crash site, trying to find 
victims in the woods and the surrounding area. Officials told Reuters News 
Service that the choppers were equipped with special equipment sensitive to 
body heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopters took the most seriously injured survivors to the Carolinas 
Medical Center in Charlotte, where Brenda Street, a spokeswoman, said 14 people 
were being treated. 
</P>
<P>
 She said three were members of the flight crew, two were from the house that 
was hit and nine were passengers from the plane. Street said the injured 
suffered burns, inhalation problems, broken bones and chest and abdominal 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a couple that are very critical, but everybody is in pretty serious 
condition," she said. "No one will be leaving for home tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Walker, a spokeswoman at Presbyterian Hospital, said it was treating 
seven injured people. She said two were flight attendants and four were 
passengers from the plane. The seventh, Walter said, was driving on the street 
where pieces of the jet came to rest and was hit by flying debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the passengers at Presbyterian Hospital were a 2-year-old and a mother, 
Walker said, and a third was a 13-year-old who had been traveling on the plane 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other injured were two passengers taken to Mercy Hospital, according 
to Kim Richwood, a spokeswoman. He said both had broken bones, lacerations and 
burns. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, one firefighter was taken to Mercy Hospital suffering from heat 
exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 Another motorist narrowly escaped harm. Sheila Torrence said she was driving 
down Wallace Neel Road, where the some of the wreckage of the plane ended up, 
when she was startled to find flames shooting around her car. She said 
telephone wires fell from poles along the road and wrapped the car completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrence said she was unable to get the driver's door open and fled through 
the passenger door. 
</P>
<P>
 The cockpit of the plane was found intact in the front yard of the house, 
which is located about half a mile from the airport runway. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt reported from Charlotte and Stanley reported from Atlanta. Times staff 
writer Richard E. Meyer contributed to this story from New York.

MEDICINE / MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS; DRUG SEEMS TO HALT CHRONIC MS IN TEST; AMONG 24 
PATIENTS IN THE TRIAL, ONLY ONE GOT WORSE. BUT SOME EXPERTS CAUTION THAT THE 
STUDY WAS FOR A SHORT PERIOD AND THAT CLADRIBINE IS HIGHLY TOXIC. 
</P>

<P>
 An anti-leukemia drug developed at the Scripps Research Institute appears to 
halt the advancement of the chronic, progressive form of multiple sclerosis, a 
form for which there is currently no treatment, San Diego researchers reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among 24 patients in a test group who received the drug cladribine, only one 
got worse after a year, while the condition of four others improved 
significantly. In contrast, seven of 28 test participants who received a 
placebo got significantly worse and only one improved, Dr. Ernest Beutler and 
his colleagues at Scripps reported Saturday in the international medical 
journal The Lancet. 
</P>
<P>
 MS affects an estimated 300,000 Americans, half of whom have the chronic, 
progressive form. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question in my mind that this is the first really effective 
treatment for this type of this disorder," Beutler said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society cautioned patients 
against getting their hopes up because cladribine has been tested for only a 
short period and is highly toxic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If future clinical trials show it (cladribine) to be useful and safe, it will 
be an important finding," said Dr. Stephen C. Reingold, vice president of the 
society. "But the results are not important if the drug cannot be used safely." 
</P>
<P>
 Beutler said the toxic side effects can be significantly reduced by using 
lower doses of cladribine, which preliminary testing has also suggested will be 
effective in treating the disease. Such reduced doses will be used in a new 
multicenter clinical trial of the drug that will enroll 400 patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Multiple sclerosis is a progressive, often disabling disease of the central 
nervous system. It occurs when, for reasons that are unknown, the body's immune 
system attacks the protective myelin sheaths surrounding nerve fibers. The 
process is much like scraping the insulation off an electrical wire, 
short-circuiting the transmission of nerve impulses that control muscle 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients can suffer loss of balance and muscle coordination, blurred vision, 
slurred speech, difficulties in walking and -- in severe cases -- paralysis. MS 
affects twice as many women as men, and two-thirds of all cases develop when 
the victim is between ages 20 and 40. 
</P>
<P>
 The only treatment for MS is a drug called beta-interferon, and it has proved 
useful only for treating patients with the so-called exacerbating-remitting 
form of the disease, which affects about 30% of victims. In this form, MS 
symptoms subside partially or totally after a flare-up, often re-erupting 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no approved treatment for the chronic, progressive form of the 
disease, in which neural deterioration proceeds at a relatively steady rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Because MS results from an inappropriate attack on the body by the immune 
system, researchers have long speculated that drugs that suppress immune 
function could impede its progress. A large clinical trial in the 1980s showed 
that the drug cyclosporine, widely used to prevent rejection of transplants, 
could slow the course of MS. But kidney damage and increases in blood pressure 
caused by the drug outweighed its beneficial effects, and its use was 
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar results have been reported with other drugs that impair immune 
function, but all have had disabling side effects, Reingold said. Promising 
reports appeared this year saying that the anti-cancer drug methotrexate -- 
which is inexpensive and has few side effects -- can also slow the disease. But 
the reported effects of this and other drugs were significantly less dramatic 
than those reported by Beutler's team, Reingold said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beutler infused cladribine directly into patients' veins twice a month for 
four months, then observed them for another eight months. The drug treatment 
apparently halted the progression of the disease in most patients, as measured 
by clinical symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging of damage to the brain and the 
presence of characteristic proteins in spinal fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were so dramatic, Beutler said, that the trial was halted 
prematurely and the patients who had been receiving a placebo were treated with 
the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the treated patients died from a previously contracted hepatitis 
infection. That death was not directly linked to the drug, Reingold said, but a 
hepatitis victim whose immune system was not suppressed might have been better 
able to fight it off. There were also several cases of herpes zoster 
(shingles), which is unusual in such a young population unless their immune 
systems are strongly compromised, he noted. That suggests the patients would be 
vulnerable to a variety of infectious diseases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reingold and Beutler cautioned physicians against prescribing cladribine for 
MS patients until more trials have been conducted. "We are dealing with a drug 
that is potentially very dangerous and that could cause lots of complications," 
Reingold said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beutler added that the long-term effects of cladribine have not been studied, 
and "it could cause cancer or leukemia five or 10 years down the road like many 
other anti-cancer drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 MS patients who would like to enroll in the trials should call 1-800-SCRIPPS 
for information.

TAPPING INTO THE HEARTLAND; SAN JOAQUIN FARM'S DEAL TO SELL LIQUID ASSETS TO 
SOUTHLAND RAISES FEARS OF ANOTHER WATER GRAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 This is where Southern California has come to quench its unquenchable thirst 
-- 300 miles north of Los Angeles, straight over the Tehachapis and up the gut 
of the San Joaquin Valley to the dairy farm of John, Jess and Rusty Areias. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first of many water transfers from north to south under a 1992 federal 
reform law, the Metropolitan Water District has secured historic San Joaquin 
River rights from the Areias Dairy -- 32,000 acre-feet over the next 15 years, 
enough water to sustain 17,000 customers from Ventura to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5.6-million deal -- a windfall for Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San Jose) 
and his father, John, and uncle Jess -- has stirred passions in this heartland, 
leaving many to cry "water grab" and "traitors among us." 
</P>
<P>
 Once Southern California plants its spigot here, critics say, it is only a 
matter of time before more farmers and irrigation districts sell their water, 
and tumbleweeds and gopher snakes reclaim the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "MWD has swaggered in with their cash and political power and told us it's 
either their way or the highway," said Dee Swearingen, executive director of 
the San Joaquin River exchange contractors, of which Areias Dairy is a member. 
"They're going to suck this valley dry so Los Angeles can grow more suburbs and 
swimming pools and golf courses all the way out to Palm Springs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Areias deal has pitted cousin against cousin and farmer against farmer and 
raised the specter of the Owens Valley plunder -- Los Angeles' 
turn-of-the-century water grab that milked dry the fruit orchards of a distant 
plain and turned a cabal of San Fernando Valley developers into very rich men. 
</P>
<P>
 MWD officials confirm that the Areias transfer, which is expected to receive 
federal approval later this year, is the first of many water sales that they 
are negotiating in the Central Valley. The MWD needs a dozen similar transfers 
to reach its 15-year, 400,000-acre-foot goal for drought years and has 
committed $80 million for such purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Since word broke this year of the Areias Dairy selling its $8-an-acre-foot 
water for $175 an acre-foot, the phone has not stopped ringing at the MWD. 
Farmers and water districts are lining up for a piece of the pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, this is no replay of history, MWD officials argue. For one, the 1992 
Central Valley Project Improvement Act, which paved the way for water 
marketing, prohibits wholesale transfers from one region to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not another Owens Valley," said Ed Thornhill, the MWD's official in 
charge of buying agricultural water. "We're looking for a modest swing supply 
during drought years. We don't want to own the Central Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Beard, head of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which must authorize the 
Areias transfer, supports water marketing as a way to add flexibility to a 
fixed state supply. But even he is concerned that water transfers could harm 
the economy of the Central Valley and promote more urban sprawl in Los Angeles 
that burdens the infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are issues that (we) struggled with at the time the (Central Valley 
Project) reform was written," said Beard, a former congressional staffer who 
shaped much of the 1992 law. "There was a sense of unease and a feeling that 
'well, let's see how water marketing works.' If it gets out of hand, we'll put 
on the brakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard feelings over divvying up California water were inevitable, perhaps. 
South of the Tehachapis it is argued that farmers hog 80% of the state's 
developed water, much of it wasted on marginal land sprouting subsidized crops. 
North of the divide, growers argue that a farm economy responsible for one out 
of every 10 state jobs has been given short shrift. Because the valley sits 
exiled between Los Angeles and San Francisco, urban dwellers tend to forget 
where their food comes from. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Valley Project reform was intended to fallow the marginal, salty 
farmland on the San Joaquin Valley's vast westside and distribute the water 
savings to fish, wildlife and cities. It was a clear victory for Southern 
California. So much so that when the law was signed by President George Bush in 
November, 1992, Carl Boronkay, the MWD's then-general manager, called 
farm-to-city water transfers a new reservoir for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new source of water," he gushed. "We haven't seen anything like it for 
a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 It has taken nearly two years to complete the first transfer under the new 
law, which Areias, as a state legislator, had opposed. "When George Bush signed 
the bill, which came as a complete surprise to all of us, I took off my public 
policy hat and put on my family hat," Areias said. "Milk prices have dropped 
30% and it's been darn tough for our family dairy the last three years." 
</P>
<P>
 A 25% cut in the water supply because of drought did not help matters, Areias 
said, forcing the dairy to lay off 20 seasonal employees. One option was to 
sell the farm, which had been in the family for 70 years. In the end, Areias 
said, they decided to sell the water rights instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The water, instead of being delivered to the Areias Dairy, will be conveyed by 
the State Water Project to the MWD. Areias has received a $560,000 down payment 
from the MWD with the balance coming on delivery next year and in subsequent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this transfer has ruffled some feathers," he said. "But we're going to 
use a lot of the money to construct a new dairy. This will keep my family in 
business. This will keep dollars in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Sloan, who farms 3,000 acres nearby, is another grower who is talking to 
the MWD. Although he does not foresee selling anywhere near his entire supply 
to the big city, he favors small transfers during drought years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can share some with the urban interests, but a lot of my fellow 
farmers don't see it that way. You could get me killed saying I am meeting with 
MWD," he chuckled. "You've heard the old adage -- whiskey is for drinking and 
water is for fighting over." 
</P>
<P>
 What irks some farmers, tractor dealers and agricultural chemical salesmen is 
the perception that the MWD has engaged in a divide-and-conquer campaign -- the 
same tactics Los Angeles used 90 years ago in Owens Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than bargain upfront with the irrigation districts, they charge, the 
MWD negotiated with the Areias family and other farmers experiencing tough 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "MWD knows the irrigation districts aren't desperate to sell and can keep a 
throttle on the situation," said John Fawcett, a farmer who sits on the board 
of the Central California Irrigation District. "So they go around our backs and 
pick off the weak and those who are going broke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Farmers are no different than anybody else. The almighty dollar speaks: 
'Geez, if I can make a buck like Areias, why not cash in.' Once a few break 
from the pack, it's over. We've lost control." 
</P>
<P>
 The MWD's Thornhill said the irrigation districts were unwilling to deal with 
him until the Areias transfer became known. In recent months he has met with 
Central California Irrigation District officials and other districts to 
negotiate 20% transfers from the entire district supply rather than from 
individual farmers selling out 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to target the weak. 'Hi, we understand you're having a tough 
time. Do you want to sell your water?,' " he said. "That's not the way we 
operate. We're waiting for people to come to us." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the concerns over the Areias transfer is that the dairy and 1,800 acres 
of surrounding cotton and alfalfa fields are good land -- not the marginal kind 
targeted by the reform law. 
</P>
<P>
 Areias plans to continue growing crops by pumping ground water. Critics say 
this will speed up the depletion of the aquifer, which took centuries of 
snowmelt to build. And it will add deadly salts to the land because the water 
beneath the Areias Dairy is much saltier than the Central Valley Project river 
water he is selling to the MWD. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, according to irrigation districts, scores of wells have been 
drilled in the valley by farmers hoping to sell water to the MWD and other 
urban interests. Irrigation district officials believe that the farmers may be 
trying to circumvent a provision in the new law that prohibits selling Central 
Valley Project river water and then using ground water to make up the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The law allows farmers selling surface water to irrigate crops with only the 
amount of ground water they have taken in years past. By punching new wells and 
pumping furiously over the next year or two, these farmers are inflating their 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Banos dairy farmer David Silva, a distant cousin of Areias, said he and 
other farmers opposed to the transfer will be watching closely to make sure 
that Areias and other farmers do not deplete the aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neighbors will be spying on neighbors and cousins on cousins. I know it 
sounds crazy, but that's what MWD has forced us to do." 
</P>
<P>
 MWD's Thornhill said such fear is unwarranted. "We're going to put together a 
ground water monitoring plan. . . . We will not allow an overdraft." 
</P>
<P>
 How much water will be transferred in the end is anyone's guess. Although the 
law seems to set a 20% cap on the amount of water that can be sold from a 
single irrigation district's supply, the ceiling is soft. The law states that 
no more than 20% of the district's water supply can be sold by individual 
farmers without the district's approval. But the 20% figure is not a ceiling 
because a district can agree to sell its entire supply. At least one district 
is negotiating with the MWD to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 And the MWD is not the only hungry buyer beating tracks to the San Joaquin 
Valley. Northern California cities have been here to negotiate their own 
drought-year transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to sell to the city, but we've been confronted by a situation 
that's outside our control," said Mike Porter, general manager of the Central 
California Irrigation District. "So we've decided to meet with MWD and others 
and bargain on behalf of our farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way, we can keep a big farmer from selling out his entire supply. The 
farmer still gets the money. But we as a district decide how much he sells and 
where it should end." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Cotta, head of the local dairymen's cooperative, understands this 
logic, but he still wants the water to stay here. If agricultural water must go 
to urban interests, he said, why not cities within the San Joaquin Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens is the region with the biggest checkbook -- and not the biggest 
need -- ends up with the water," Cotta said. "And right now, no one has a 
bigger checkbook than MWD."

ASSEMBLY APPROVES A LARGELY GOP STATE BUDGET; LEGISLATURE: THE SPENDING PLAN 
CUTS WELFARE PAYMENTS AND BOOSTS FUNDING FOR PRISONS AND HIGHER EDUCATION. IT 
IS EXPECTED TO PASS THE SENATE ON MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Assembly, its members eager to begin a holiday weekend, passed the state 
budget Saturday and sent it to the Senate, which is expected to approve it on 
the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
 Displaying little of the partisan rancor that has marked past budget 
deliberations, lawmakers also approved about half a dozen other measures that 
are needed to make the budget work. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative leaders said there was something in the recession-squeezed budget 
for everyone to hate, with cuts in various programs such as welfare and aid to 
the aged, blind and disabled. There were also increases in spending for prisons 
and higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 The document was shaped largely by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and his GOP 
allies in the Legislature, who can stop any budget they do not like by 
withholding their votes and depriving the Democratic majority of the two-thirds 
margin needed to enact a spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a great budget," said Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco). "It is the governor's budget and it meets the state's needs for the 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in a statement released by his office, said the final product was the 
result of compromise on all sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the end result provides a spending plan that keeps California 
living within its means," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $57.3-billion budget is part of a two-year deficit spending plan that will 
require $7 billion in borrowing. The entire plan is balanced on the assumption 
that the federal government will come through with $2.8 billion in new money 
the year after next to reimburse the state for the cost of serving illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 If that money does not materialize, separate legislation demanded by the banks 
that will finance the debt could trigger deep, across-the-board reductions in 
all state-supported programs except education. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson signed that measure, unprecedented in the state's history, late Friday 
after it was overwhelmingly approved in both houses of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget cuts welfare grants 2.3% to $593 per month -- the minimum allowed 
by federal law -- and denies extra aid to women who conceive additional 
children after they are on the welfare rolls. It bans welfare assistance to 
legal immigrants for five years if they entered the country with the help of a 
sponsor who promised to look after their financial needs, a provision that 
could affect 15,000 recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Pregnant illegal immigrants no longer will receive state-funded prenatal care, 
but the budget gives a boost to a parallel program for the working poor who are 
legal residents of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also cuts aid to the aged, blind and disabled 2.3% and reduces funds 
for county hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 It provides enough money to allow public schools in kindergarten through 12th 
grade to keep pace with rising enrollments but not to keep pace with inflation, 
and gives the prisons enough to house an increasing number of inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no new taxes. Reinstatement of the renters tax credit, which was 
suspended a year ago, was postponed for two more years. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal Democrats complained that the measure was too harsh on the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was once proud to be a citizen of this state and now I am embarrassed," 
said Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, the veteran Santa Clara Democrat who chairs 
the budget-writing Ways and Means Committee. "If we continue to maraud the poor 
and protect the rich, California will become a tragic state instead of a Golden 
State." 
</P>
<P>
 The budget bill passed on a 55-21 vote, with 39 Democrats and 16 Republicans 
voting in favor. Eighteen Republicans and three Democrats voted against the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have sent a clear message to the citizens of this state that their 
representatives understand that partisan differences must be set aside to work 
for the common good," Wilson said in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We have demonstrated to the investment community that we can avoid 
the kind of political gridlock that could have put the state's financial 
standing in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the budget will be four or five days late by the time it is enacted, 
the agreement came soon enough to prevent another embarrassing round of IOUs, 
which the state was forced to use to pay its bills during a 63-day budget 
stalemate in 1992.

ON CALIFORNIA: MEANWHILE, IN ANOTHER COURTHOUSE . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lea Purwin D'Agostino spent last Thursday in her office. It is a small office 
without windows, buried deep within the second floor of the satellite county 
courthouse in Van Nuys. A deputy district attorney, D'Agostino was editing 
transcripts from a recent murder case. It would not ring many bells. It was not 
that kind of case. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the afternoon, D'Agostino walked down the hall. Several of her 
colleagues were crowded inside a conference room, watching the Simpson hearing 
on television. She ducked inside the door. Another prosecutor told her what 
she'd missed: A store owner had testified that in May he'd sold Simpson a 
knife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow," D'Agostino said. "I didn't know about that." 
</P>
<P>
 And why would she? O.J. Simpson is not her case. She already had her turn as a 
player in one of the trials of the century, which seem to occur in Los Angeles 
about every year. She prosecuted the so-called "Twilight Zone" case. She lost. 
Seven years later, she has yet to try another high-profile case. This is how 
the system works. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 17 years as a prosecutor," D'Agostino said, "I won every case, but one." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The "Twilight Zone" trial, once so riveting, once so all-important, by now is 
remembered only in incomplete pieces. A Vietnam movie. The actor Vic Morrow. 
Two little children. A helicopter crash. D'Agostino, though, can recall every 
detail, every inconsistency in defense testimony, every moment of legal theater 
both inside and outside the courtroom. She can recite the names of Hollywood 
people who came to show support for director John Landis. She can remember the 
kisses and embraces between jurors and defendants after the acquittals were 
announced. "A love fest," she snarled, still unable, seven years later, to 
contain her disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day of the 'Twilight Zone' verdicts," she said evenly, "was the worst day 
of my life." It changed everything. Before the defeat, D'Agostino said, she 
rushed to work each day. Before the defeat, she "was a rising star. My career 
in this office, which had been wonderful, rising, did a complete 180." 
</P>
<P>
 Did someone say outright: Lea, you are finished? "No," she said, picking words 
carefully, "one doesn't have to say it. You know. . . . One no longer gets 
major cases to handle." She paused. "One gets transferred out. It's not a 
pleasant experience." She paused again. "You don't get any plum assignments 
thereafter. Lose one case, that's it." Paused. "This district attorney's office 
has not been known for standing behind deputies who have lost major cases." 
</P>
<P>
 She could form a club. After "Twilight" came McMartin, Rodney King, Menendez, 
among others. For every one of these high-profile defeats, there is an L.A. 
County deputy district attorney whose career prospects no longer look quite so 
bright. They are scattered to suburban outposts. Whatever they learned about 
big cases -- and doesn't defeat usually teach more than victory? -- is wasted 
knowledge. No one solicits their opinions. They walk hallways filled with 
backbiting colleagues. They are, in one prosecutor's word, "tainted." They are, 
in another's analysis, "scarred." They are, in D'Agostino's own phrase, 
"chopped liver." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she added, "don't make it sound like I am bitter." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles legal community is thick with theories about why the district 
attorney's office no longer can win the big ones. Outgunned prosecutors. 
Overzealous filings. Star-struck juries. Political interference. Incompetence. 
In the end, though, what does it matter? High-profile cases such as "Twilight 
Zone" and Simpson are but salacious side dishes. Fascinating exceptions. Most 
cases don't attract cameras. Most defendants can't afford F. Lee Bailey. And 
most defendants lose. It's not even close. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutors notch their convictions and move on. There always is plenty of 
criminal work in this county. Even D'Agostino's desk is piled with paper. She 
toils in Van Nuys as a "calendar deputy." It is not quite as boring as it 
sounds. She negotiates pleas, files pretrial motions, completes paperwork -- 
"the bread and butter," she said, gamely enough. Sometimes, though, she is 
allowed to take prosecutions all the way through trial, and she eagerly 
described three active cases. 
</P>
<P>
 All involved domestic violence. A husband who ambushed his wife. A 4-year-old 
beaten to the brink of death. A mother who told investigators she has been 
assaulted by her husband "14,000 times." Routine horror. Bread and butter. But 
no football stars, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," D'Agostino said, "and no movie stars either. No celebrities. And when we 
convict, it might be a line in the paper. And it might not." She doesn't get 
the Court TV cases anymore. She had her turn at center stage. It was seven 
years ago. She lost.

NORTH, SOUTH KOREA AGREE ON RULES FOR FIRST SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 North and South Korean negotiators hammered out an agreement Saturday on the 
ground rules for their first summit meeting after resolving the thorny issue of 
visits by South Korean advance teams to help ensure security in North Korea's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days of talks in the village of Panmunjom on the border between 
North and South, the two sides agreed that South Korean President Kim Young Sam 
and a 180-member entourage would travel by road July 25 from Seoul to 
Pyongyang. There, Kim would hold two rounds of talks with Kim Il Sung, 82, the 
leader of the Communist North, during a three-day visit. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no mention of a proposed return visit by Kim Il Sung to Seoul or 
of any plans for talks with the aging dictator's son and designated successor, 
Kim Chong Il, 54. The younger Kim is in charge of internal security, the armed 
forces and, according to North Korea experts and defectors, most day-to-day 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit, the first since the Korean peninsula was divided 49 years ago at 
the end of World War II, is seen as a potential key to resolving a dispute over 
Pyongyang's suspected nuclear program and easing tensions between the booming, 
capitalist South and the hermitic, Stalinist North. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of a peace treaty since a 1953 truce was signed after three 
years of fighting, the two Koreas are still bitter enemies. Their border is the 
most heavily militarized in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In an indication of continuing hostilities, the South Korean intelligence 
agency Saturday announced the arrest of 23 alleged North Korean agents who it 
said were involved in efforts to infiltrate labor unions and foment strikes. 
The National Security Planning Agency said the 23 had been working throughout 
the country since January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday's 14-point deal, which followed a broad accord Tuesday on holding 
a summit meeting in Pyongyang, the two sides agreed that Kim Young Sam and his 
100-member delegation, plus 80 reporters, would drive to Panmunjom, where they 
would transfer to North Korean vehicles for the rest of the road trip to 
Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 They also agreed that South Korean advance teams would visit Pyongyang twice 
before the summit to work out security, protocol, communications and other 
arrangements. They pledged not to play their respective national anthems or 
raise their flags at the summit, because neither yet recognizes the other as a 
legitimate sovereign state.

ALBANIAN LEADER ALIA SENTENCED ON RIGHTS VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This nation's last Communist ruler, Ramiz Alia, was convicted Saturday and 
sentenced to nine years in prison for violating the rights of citizens while he 
was in power. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-judge panel reached the verdict partly on the testimony of former 
political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Alia, 68, said the verdict against him "shows that revenge is still very 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
 The former president said the charges against him were political. None of the 
testimony during the trial, which began May 21, linked him directly to any 
crimes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the initial charges, Alia could have been sentenced to 25 years in 
prison. But the prosecution dropped a charge of misappropriation of state funds 
midway through the trial for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ordered Alia to repay the equivalent of $117,000 in state funds 
spent for personal services while he was president. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine other former officials on trial with Alia got lesser sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Alia was hand-picked by Enver Hoxha, the longtime Stalinist ruler who died in 
1985, and ran the impoverished Balkan state until the advent of multi-party 
democracy in early 1991. He briefly remained president after the country's 
first free elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Alia was the latest of several top figures from the Communist regime sentenced 
to prison terms for corruption or similar charges.

EUROPEAN FILM INDUSTRY BIDS TO TAKE ON HOLLYWOOD; ENTERTAINMENT: LEADERS MEET 
IN BRUSSELS AND BACK SWEEPING CHANGES -- INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN SUBSIDIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Using words like "watershed" and "historic turning point," the leaders of 
Europe's beleaguered motion picture and television industry gave their backing 
Saturday to a series of sweeping changes that they believe will enable them to 
compete effectively with Hollywood in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Those changes include a reduction of subsidies, a commitment to restructure 
the industry to stress marketing and commercial viability, and a new effort to 
move beyond individual domestic markets and to exploit the European market as a 
whole -- something only the Americans have managed to do so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strong political will and vision is required -- now," warned Joao de Deus 
Pinheiro, the European Union's cultural affairs commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 In one respect, the gathering of about 300 film and television executives for 
a three-day European Audio Visual Conference here was merely a consultative 
affair -- a meeting that allowed senior EU officials to hear industry views 
before finalizing a policy for the industry later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the views expressed and the consensus that seemed to emerge from the 
meeting reflected the enormous change that has occurred in Europe in the months 
since bitterly fought world trade talks ended in December. 
</P>
<P>
 In those negotiations, the EU managed to override stiff U.S. opposition and 
win an exclusion of the audiovisual sector from sweeping free trade provisions 
on grounds the industry was more cultural than commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, EU officials have warned that the victory was only 
temporary and that Europe's audiovisual sector would die if it continued to 
ignore market demands, cede its home markets to U.S. imports and rely on a life 
support of more than $500 million a year in government subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 While there were no votes to convey the exact sentiments of those attending 
the Brussels conference, industry leaders appeared to abandon the idea that 
Europe's audiovisual sector could not survive without long-term subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a sea change in thinking," said British film producer David 
Puttnam, former head of Columbia Pictures. "(The audiovisual sector) was always 
seen as a culturally led industry with commercial dimensions. Now, it is being 
viewed as a commercially driven industry with cultural dimensions. When you've 
got people like (German filmmaker) Wim Wenders backing this, you know the 
change is there." 
</P>
<P>
 Former French Minister of Cultural Affairs Jack Lang declared, "This meeting 
will be seen as a landmark; it is an historical turning point for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, the European audiovisual sector has grown at a brisk 6% 
per year, but U.S. imports account for virtually all of this growth and movie 
theater audiences for European films have actually declined in their home 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the United States exported $3.6 billion worth of film and television 
programming compared to a little more than $100 million that Europe exported to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the shift of mood this weekend, few were calling for an immediate end 
either to government backing or to restrictions imposed on the import of U.S. 
products.

<P>
 Indeed, sums ranging from $800 million to $2.2 billion in government money 
were mentioned as necessary to help the industry restructure. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference following the convention, Pinheiro said he is firmly 
against subsidies but indicated that considerable government money could come 
in the form of matching funds linked to private sector backing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this money is for good projects that have a real chance, then I'm for it, 
but we are no longer in the game of financing dreams," Pinheiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also apparent that a controversial provision that requires all EU-based 
broadcasters to reserve at least half their transmission time for European 
works "where practicable" is likely to be strengthened later this year when 
legislation governing EU television content comes under review. 
</P>
<P>
 Many called for the removal of the "where practicable" loophole and urged that 
the quota also be strictly applied to prime-time programs.

 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno is ready to ask for the appointment of an independent 
counsel to take over the inquiry into Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy's links 
to an Arkansas-based poultry producer, a newspaper reported.But a Justice 
Department official called the New York Times report "a matter of speculation 
at this point." The Justice Department has been looking into whether Espy 
violated the 1907 Meat Inspection Act by accepting football tickets and an 
airplane trip from Tyson Foods. Espy said he expects to be cleared because he 
reimbursed Tyson for all costs.

 The Coast Guard reported the largest single boatload of Cubans fleeing their 
island since 1980.The 140 men, women and children made the 90-mile voyage in a 
rusty fishing boat. The passengers arrived Friday and were taken to a Miami 
facility that aids refugees. Driven by a deteriorating economy at home, Cubans 
have been coming to the United States this year at the highest rate since the 
1980 Mariel boat lift, when Fidel Castro let thousands of prisoners and others 
emigrate.

ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY PREPARING TO OUST AIDS CZAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials are taking the first steps toward ousting 
Kristine M. Gebbie as the country's AIDS policy coordinator, sources said 
Saturday, drawing up a "short list" of candidates to succeed her. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration sources warned that there is "significant tension" within 
the White House over whether the next AIDS czar should be a charismatic voice 
who can better sell the program to the public, someone better able to work with 
Congress, or even whether the post should be abandoned in favor of a special 
staff position under Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
 And until these issues are settled, the sources said, no official announcement 
about Gebbie's fate will be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "The White House is determined to get it right this time," said an 
Administration source who asked not to be identified. The apparent decision to 
oust the Oregon nurse has come amid mounting discontent from the AIDS community 
and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news briefing Friday, White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers was asked 
whether the President had plans to replace Gebbie. Myers said only that Gebbie 
"continues to be the AIDS coordinator. The President has confidence in her. He 
thinks it's important to have an Administration AIDS coordinator." 
</P>
<P>
 Gebbie was unavailable for comment, but aide John Paul Gurrola dismissed word 
of such a White House move as rumor-spreading by Gebbie's critics. 
</P>
<P>
 The position of AIDS policy coordinator was created as a result of strong 
pressure from both activists and public health advocates. Clinton embraced the 
concept during his campaign and vowed to fill the post upon taking office. 
</P>
<P>
 Gebbie, 50, a nurse who had run state health departments in Oregon and the 
state of Washington, took office Aug. 2. But rather than report to the 
President, as some had thought she would, the job was set up to report to 
Clinton domestic policy adviser Carol Rasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Gebbie had been on the job barely a month when criticism, at first discreet 
and now quite blatant, showered upon her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't project an image of leadership in the AIDS crisis," AIDS activist 
Mark Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Washington insiders criticized Gebbie's alleged ineptitude. An 
often-cited example involved Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), who received 
a phone call from Gebbie offering full support for efforts to gain passage of 
1995 AIDS appropriations. The appropriation bill had been passed the previous 
day.

GATHERING STORM ON GULF COAST PROMPTS HURRICANE WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forecasters warned Gulf Coast residents from Mississippi to Florida to brace 
for a minimal hurricane as Tropical Storm Alberto headed for land today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put up the hurricane warning because we're expecting it to become a 
hurricane overnight," forecaster Jerry Jarrell said late Saturday at the 
National Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm's sustained winds grew from 45 m.p.h. to near 60 m.p.h. during the 
day. By the time Alberto reaches land, winds will likely reach hurricane 
strength of at least 74 m.p.h., National Hurricane Center specialist Lixion 
Avila said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurricane warnings were issued for areas from Gulfport, Miss., to Cedar Key, 
Fla. Landfall was projected at midday, probably between Pensacola and Panama 
City in northwestern Florida, Avila said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials ordered evacuations of barrier islands in the hurricane warning 
area, including Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key near the Florida-Alabama 
border. Shopkeepers reported brisk sales of water and candles in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles urged Gulf Coast residents to monitor news 
broadcasts about the storm's progress and prepare for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm developed last Thursday off Cuba, where it dumped 10 inches of rain. 
The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through November.

12-YEAR-OLD GIRL TAKEN FROM HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 12-year-old girl was kidnaped by a stranger from her home Saturday night, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Romenek was at home with a friend when a man wearing blue shorts and no 
shirt entered the home, Chief Larry Hansen said.Katie's 16-year-old sister 
returned home from an errand and found the man in the home. The suspect tied up 
the friend and sister and fled with Katie in the family's car, which was found 
25 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said there were no signs of forced entry into the house. The house has 
a "for sale" sign in the front and the suspect gained entry by saying he wanted 
to see the home, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident had similarities to the Polly Klaas kidnaping in October. The 
12-year-old Petaluma girl was snatched from a slumber party at her home and 
later killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie's parents were in Michigan, Hansen said. She was described as 4 feet 8 
inches tall, 85 pounds, with brown shoulder-length hair and brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was described as a white male in his 30s, 6 feet tall, medium 
build, sandy blond shoulder-length hair, beard and tattoos.

WOMAN IDENTIFIES KIDNAPING SUSPECT; CRIME: VICTIM SAYS 'FAITH, HUMOR AND HOPE' 
HELPED HER SURVIVE ABDUCTION. FBI IS SEEKING MICHIGAN FUGITIVE. 
</P>

<P>
 A Val Verde real estate agent who was abducted last week by a man posing as a 
prospective home buyer identified her kidnaper Saturday through police mug 
shots and credited "faith, humor and hope" with getting her through the 
three-day ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Harrington was found tied up Friday morning in a Gila Bend motel room, 
68 miles southwest of Phoenix. She said she had felt no fear while showing the 
man five homes in the Val Verde area Wednesday. But at the last house, he 
turned on her. "The gun was in my face and I was on the floor tied up," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington, 26, identified Timothy Daniel Shue, a fugitive with numerous 
aliases, as her abductor, said Jack Callahan, an FBI spokesman in the Phoenix 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue also is a suspect in similar incidents that have taken place since he 
fled authorities last month in Grand Rapids, Mich., where he was wanted in a 
fraud case, Callahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities would not reveal details or the number of crimes but said Shue is 
suspected of abducting a Grand Rapids woman and using her credit card. Federal 
agents, acting on an unlawful flight warrant issued June 10, had tracked Shue 
from Michigan to Oregon to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue is known to use several names, including Timothy Daniel Kriesel, Tim 
Thayer and Tim Trayer, Callahan said. He was last seen in Gila Bend between 
8:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some indication when he left that he would travel to the Grand 
Canyon or into Mexico," said Steve Chenoweth, the FBI agent handling the case. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Saturday afternoon news conference held after her interview and photo 
lineup with federal agents, Harrington appeared drained and pale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to be alive and have my family," she said, flanked by her husband, 
Chris, and other family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Harrington spoke briefly about the ordeal, which began Wednesday when 
she accompanied the suspect to view homes in the Val Verde area, a tiny 
community in the hills northwest of Santa Clarita. Authorities said he drove 
her to Arizona in a blue Jeep Cherokee.

WORLD CUP USA '94; UNFORGIVABLE; THE MURDER OF COLOMBIA'S ANDRES ESCOBAR AFTER 
HIS OWN GOAL AGAINST THE UNITED STATES UNDERLINES THE FACT THAT SOCCER FANS CAN 
BE DEADLY SERIOUS ABOUT THEIR GAME; PLAYERS STUNNED AS PALL SETTLES OVER 
SOCCER'S SHOWCASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Andres Escobar could have been here this weekend instead of in his violent 
hometown of Medellin, Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular soccer player, who was murdered early Saturday, was asked to be a 
color commentator for Carcol radio, Colombia's premier network, after his team 
failed to advance to the second round of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar would have been in Carcol's cramped quarters at the International 
Broadcast Center in Dallas, where thousands of commentators are covering the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We invited him to stay," said Gusta Pombo, a network executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar considered the assignment but decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'No, I want to go back home,' " Pombo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar, who deflected the ball into his goal in a 2-1 loss to the United 
States on June 22 at the Rose Bowl, was shot 12 times outside a restaurant in 
Medellin in retribution for the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Escobar, 27, left America, his parents stayed on to vacation in the 
southwest. They were in Nevada when the incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar's death was the latest episode to cast a pall over the first World Cup 
in the United States. Two days earlier, Diego Maradona, one of the sport's top 
stars, was suspended by the Argentina Football Federation after testing 
positive for banned stimulants. 
</P>
<P>
 What was an almost universal celebration of soccer for the past two weeks 
became a day of mourning as the second round began in Chicago and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of Escobar's murder filtered through the RFK Stadium crowd and the locker 
rooms, intensifying in an official moment of silence before the 
Spain-Switzerland game. 
</P>
<P>
 A Colombian television crew abandoned its gear and wandered aimlessly through 
the press center outside the stadium, its appetite for soccer suddenly gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just found out and I am speechless," producer Marden David said. "He was 27 
and we were friends since he was 19. Andres was the nicest, most decent man on 
the team, and the most disciplined; the last one you'd think could be. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Blatter, general secretary of FIFA, soccer's governing body, said it 
was the saddest day he has seen in soccer, beyond violence in the stands or 
hooliganism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The popularity of our game has two faces," he said. "The first face produces 
joy and enthusiasm and brings people together as we have witnessed at the World 
Cup here. On the other face, the game mirrors our life. It has violence, tears, 
corruption. Like life, it has all its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murders happen everywhere, every hour of the day. It is a reality." 
</P>
<P>
 But the timing has made it doubly difficult for FIFA officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like somebody does not like the success of the World Cup," Blatter said. 
"I don't know who to blame. But the two cases we have had in 48 hours -- it's 
hard to digest for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The incidents also have been an emotional drain for World Cup organizers from 
the United States. After piquing the American public's interest beyond their 
wildest imaginations, the organizers were disheartened by Saturday's news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a blatant criminal act," said Jim Trecker, World Cup USA spokesman. 
"It's deplorable." 
</P>
<P>
 But he does not believe Escobar's murder and Maradona's departure will take 
away from the tournament, which ends July 17 at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people are clearly smitten with soccer," Trecker said. "It's a 
pity some off-the-field tragedies . . . can divert interest in this event for a 
minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Those involved in the game spoke out against the violence in Colombia that has 
affected its soccer team, including a death threat sent to midfielder Gabriel 
Gomez in Fullerton during the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland Coach Jack Charlton said he might give Escobar's family the money 
collected by Irish fans to help pay a fine assessed against him for sideline 
outbursts during a match against Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who wants to play international football if you get assassinated doing it?" 
he asked. "It's a dreadful thing, just dreadful." 
</P>
<P>
 Players and coaches said soccer's atmosphere, the passion that is often 
associated with the sport, has its limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible to have someone killed because of a game," Swiss goalkeeper 
Marco Pascolo said after his team's 3-0 loss. "Even for us it's going to be 
tough to go home. There are a lot of regrets," 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer violence is common in countries where it is the dominant sport, but 
usually as collective acts by packs of fans against one another or property. 
</P>
<P>
 Attacks against individual players are rare, but all players know to keep 
clear of outraged fans, and Escobar's murder left some players pensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is despicable, an outrage; people should realize it is only a game," 
Spanish player Abelardo Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brazil's coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira: "We've got to start 
understanding that this is a game, not a war, and that all these crazy 
nationalistic feelings, while fine up to a point, have gone too far." 
</P>
<P>
 An own goal like the one Escobar scored is every defender's worst nightmare -- 
but sooner or later it happens to every defender. 
</P>
<P>
 "The murder has had a very profound impact on all of us," Spanish defender 
Francisco Camarasa said. "We are still in shock. We didn't know Escobar 
personally, but he was of our world. His loss hurts us all." 
</P>
<P>
 Blatter said FIFA is helpless to stop such situations. When asked recently 
about the death threats against Gomez, Blatter said it was not up to FIFA to 
respond, but rather to local police. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jorge Solari, an Argentine who coaches Saudi Arabia, called on FIFA to to 
ensure such tragedies are stopped. He said an organization is needed to address 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get upset during the game, but after the game, it's over," he said. "It's 
impossible for me to understand that a guy was killed because of a defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew Escobar said he was nice man, who was respected for his fair 
play. He had a middle-class upbringing in Medellin, and was well known 
throughout the country because of soccer and television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no American parallel to the vitriol, and Switzerland Coach Roy 
Hodgson, a transplanted Englishman, believes that the media must bear part of 
the blame if verbal violence escalated tragically into the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed at the murder but not surprised. Maybe it will make 
journalists stop and think about what they write," Hodgson said. "Swiss 
journalists destroyed the career of one of our players because of an own goal. 
Killing a career and killing a person. . . . Maybe the next time journalists 
will stop and think before they write things like: 'He disgraced his country. . 
. . He should be shot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The murder pierces the heart of Colombians, who hoped an extraordinary World 
Cup performance would erase some of the negative perceptions of a country 
struggling with drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole country pays for it," said Pombo, the radio executive. "It's a 
great shock. Nobody could imagine this." 
</P>
<P>
 Some could. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Colombia, anything can happen," Blatter said. 
</P>

MIKE DOWNEY: WORLD CUP USA '94; UNFORGIVABLE; THE NURDER OF COLOMBIA'S ANDRES 
ESCOBAR AFTER HIS OWN GOAL AGAINST THE UNITED STATES UNDERLINES THE FACT THAT 
SOCCER FANS CAN BE DEADLY SERIOUS ABOUT THEIR GAME; THE BLAME GAME BECOMES 
DEADLY 
</P>

 The name Escobar had become in Colombia synonymous with corruption, avarice 
and evil by the time drug lord Pablo Escobar's pallbearers carried him to the 
Jardines Monte Sacro cemetery last December, a corpse honeycombed by a special 
security force's bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 The name Escobar bears a new significance now, not only in Colombia but 
throughout the World Cup's world beyond. Forever it will symbolize martyrdom in 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 It represents an unprecedented grotesquery -- the killing of a scapegoat -- 
that brings a new element of terror to a growing fear over athletes being held 
responsible for the public's satisfaction, a bloodthirst as primordial and 
frightening as when gladiators staked their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres Escobar -- no relation -- is dead, same as Pablo Escobar, likewise 
ambushed by a hail of gunfire, likewise a casualty of the malevolent, 
paved-with-coke streets of Medellin. Andres was not as notorious as Pablo, not 
as feared and, sadly, not even as popular. But he too paid for a sin. He was a 
soccer player, 27, whose failing was that he accidentally misdirected an 
opponent's shot into his own side's net. 
</P>
<P>
 It cost his team a game. It cost him his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, general secretary of FIFA, soccer's governing body, 
called Saturday "the saddest day I've ever witnessed, in football or any other 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
 But not only sad. 
</P>
<P>
 Frightful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who wants to play international football if you get assassinated doing it?" 
was the outraged reaction of Jack Charlton, Ireland's national coach, who 
spoke, whether he realized it or not, for athletic figures everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 For this isn't merely football. This is tennis player Monica Seles, stabbed 
with a knife by a deranged spectator, simply because she posed a professional 
threat to his favorite player. This is baseball player Bill Buckner, compelled 
to leave New England with his family, reeling from years of verbal abuse from 
Boston Red Sox fans over misplaying a ball during the 1986 World Series. This 
is pitcher Mitch Williams, returning home to death threats in Philadelphia 
after yielding a home run that ended the 1993 Series. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the price of fame. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the price of blame. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder of Andres Escobar is a new low in an increasingly uncivilized 
world. Killed over a soccer match? Killed over a human error? It sends chills 
down the spine of one of the U.S. players, team captain Tony Meola, who said: 
"This doesn't belong in sports. Unfortunately, some people don't realize that 
ultimately what we do, even though there is a lot of passion and pride 
involved, it's only a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet try explaining this to Colombians who responded five years ago to a poll 
taken by the magazine Credencial, asked to anoint the most important story of 
1989. By far the winner, with 34.9% of the vote, was Colombia's qualification 
for the next summer's World Cup in Italy. In second place was the assassination 
of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan. 
</P>
<P>
 How apt, then, when another U.S. player, Alexi Lalas, offered his opinion on 
the death of a brother athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows a complete lack of respect for life," Lalassaid. 
</P>
<P>
 By some, not all. 
</P>
<P>
 But some can be enough. At 3:30 Saturday morning, several thugs confronted 
young Escobar outside the Restaurante El Indio and followed him to his car. 
Preliminary reports had one of the suspects speaking menacingly to Escobar, 
saying something on the order of "Gracias por el auto gol," thanking him 
sarcastically for the own goal that he scored for the United States. Within 
seconds, Escobar was dead, riddled with as many as a dozen gun shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Police mobilized to do two things -- search for the killers and protect the 
victim's teammates. In Medellin, approximately 150 miles northeast of Bogota, 
hearts were broken. The team had lost and returned home in shame. A teammate of 
Escobar's had received a death threat before the U.S. game and was withdrawn 
from the lineup by the coach. The coach, Francisco Maturana, also had been 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Maturana who before the tournament had recognized Colombia's link with 
drug-trafficking, acknowledged that he too had been an acquaintance of Pablo 
Escobar and others who subsidized teams with their drug money and became heroes 
to some. It was also Maturana, a dentist by trade, who said at the time, "This 
country has suffered a lot. Soccer helps relieve the pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Or causes more.

WORLD CUP USA '94; COMMENTARY; IT'S A TRAGEDY WHEN SPORTS BECOME MORE THAN A 
GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe I'll stop apologizing to all these English guys about not knowing much 
about soccer. Maybe I don't want to know all that much about a sport that seems 
to foster hooligans and murderers. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe Andres Escobar's murder had little to do with soccer. This isn't 
sport. This is insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 It strikes me that we in the United States, as sickeningly violent as some 
elements of our society have become, have no clue about something like 
Escobar's death. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bill Buckner let that ground ball go through his legs in Game 6 of the 
1986 World Series, did we expect him to be a gunman's target? How about when 
Chris Webber called that timeout when Michigan didn't have one, or when Marty 
McSorley tried to get away with the illegal stick in the Stanley Cup finals? 
</P>
<P>
 Did we talk about increased security for these guys? Did we send somebody else 
out to start their cars? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course not. We take our sports very seriously here, but they are still, 
after all, sports. Perhaps we figure our sports heroes who make bonehead plays 
suffer enough having to face the press afterward. We bury 'em in print, not in 
caskets. 
</P>
<P>
 I went back and reviewed some of the things written after the U.S. soccer team 
upset Colombia in the Rose Bowl on June 22, in the game in which middle 
defender Escobar, trying to kick away John Harkes' cross to Ernie Stewart, had 
the ball ricochet off his foot and into his goal. From Bogota, Colombia, Times 
staffer Tracy Wilkinson quickly captured the mood in her opening, and it was 
serious. She wrote: "Perhaps it was the silence that was most telling." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the story, she wrote of the death threat to team member Gabriel Jaime 
Gomez: If Gomez played against the United States, his home would be blown up in 
Colombia. Gomez didn't play. 
</P>
<P>
 She also quoted a fan, Carlos Rios, as saying, before the game: "The team has 
to win. If they don't, they won't be able to come back. They'll have to look 
for work in a factory over there (in Los Angeles)." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson also wrote that the government had banned the sale of alcohol and 
the carrying of guns, measures aimed at "cutting down on murders and traffic 
deaths that routinely occur after Colombia's games -- especially after the 
victories." Note the word "routinely." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson lives and works in El Salvador and visits Colombia frequently. She 
knew this stuff was more than just guys kicking soccer balls into nets while 
wearing the jerseys of their respective countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Others didn't know, didn't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes was quoted after the own goal as joking about how he actually had set 
that goal up and planned just how he would ricochet the ball off Escobar's 
heel. 
</P>
<P>
 I wrote a line a few days later about the losing ways of the Colombian team in 
which I speculated that goalkeeper Oscar Cordoba, who had made a series of 
mistakes in goal, might actually be the first person ever to look forward to 
moving to New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 There were lots of jokes like this, and they obviously were based on the 
knowledge that Colombia, and its drug lords, and its generally hot temperament, 
is not exactly a convent. Indeed, the murder rate there is eight times as high 
as it is in the United States, and we aren't exactly a country of Mother 
Teresas. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, what are throw-away lines for us are real-life situations for 
Colombians. 
</P>
<P>
 My conclusions are easy. Shooting somebody over a mistake in a soccer game is 
stupid. Caring that much about anything in any game is stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned about Escobar's death from a wide-eyed 10-year-old boy Saturday 
morning. He stopped by some tennis courts to find somebody to tell. He was 
Latino. Perhaps he was Colombian. I was too stunned to ask him. 
</P>
<P>
 But I watched his reaction and realized that, as a big soccer fan, he had 
learned very early in his life that the sport he loves might be a sport, but it 
is also something that can get you killed if you mess up. 
</P>
<P>
 That's more than stupid. That's tragic.

WORLD CUP USA '94; FALLEN STAR HAPPIEST AT HOME IN MEDELLIN; PROFILE: ESCOBAR 
TURNED DOWN OFFERS FROM EUROPEAN TEAMS TO STAY IN COLOMBIAN CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Andres Escobar, regarded as one of the top soccer players Colombia has ever 
produced, was murdered outside a restaurant on the streets of Medellin, 
Colombia, where he grew up, found fame and ultimately his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar, 27, might have turned fans into enemies by inadvertently scoring for 
the United States in a World Cup game on June 22 at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Medellin police said Escobar died after he was shot in what might have been an 
argument about the goal he mistakenly scored in the 2-1 Colombia loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar had said he had trouble sleeping for many days after the incident for 
which he was ridiculed and scorned. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an ending no one could have expected for Escobar, a left-footed defender 
playing in his second World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Born to a middle-class family in Medellin, Escobar played for the local 
Atletico Nacional club for all of his career. Noted for scoring with headers, 
Escobar turned professional in 1988 at 21. He made his debut for Colombia 
within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 He was on the Atletico Nacional team that in 1989 became the first Colombian 
team to win the South American Libertadores Cup. Colombia defeated Olimpia of 
Paraguay in a shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he made his World Cup debut. Colombia reached the second round in 
Italy. In 1991, Escobar won the Colombian title with his club, but he had 
trouble in 1993 when he was sidelined because of a knee injury and missed the 
Copa America and World Cup qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, without Escobar, Colombia had its best result in history -- a 5-0 
victory over highly regarded Argentina in Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar won back his position from Alexis Mendoza earlier this year when 
Colombia became one of the favorites in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Colombia lost its opener to Romania, 3-1, then lost to the United 
States. A 2-0 victory over Switzerland on June 26 was not enough to get 
Colombia into the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 All that was left for Escobar and the rest of the Colombians was to return 
home. For Escobar, that meant his beloved Medellin, a star-crossed South 
American city. 
</P>
<P>
 Medellin is home to one of the world's deadliest drug cartels, but it also is 
a prospering industrial center and where Escobar, no relation to slain drug 
lord Pablo Escobar, always said he was accorded star treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before Colombia lost. That was before Escobar scored for the 
other team. That was before Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar said many times that he had considered signing with a European team 
for a larger contract, but even if he did, he said he always would return to 
Medellin as soon as he could. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar said he would never actually leave Colombia for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he will be buried in Medellin.

WORLD CUP USA '94; THREATS NOT RARE, BUT DEATHS ARE; VIOLENCE: MURDER OF 
ESCOBAR GOES AGAINST THE NORM, BUT SOCCER NOT ONLY SPORT TOUCHED BY TRAGEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Saturday murder of Colombian soccer player Andres Escobar is virtually 
without precedent in modern sports history. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, Escobar was murdered by Colombians infuriated that he had 
accidentally scored a goal for the United States on June 22 in a World Cup 
match that resulted in a 2-1 U.S. victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Colombia, a pre-World Cup favorite, was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 20th Century, athletes have often been threatened with death, 
but rare is the case in which an athlete has been murdered for reasons directly 
related to athletic performance. 
</P>
<P>
 But it isn't rare for soccer to be the cause of people dying. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a sport that once sparked a war between Honduras and El Salvador, 
wherein thousands died. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports officials have often been the target of misdirected sports passions. In 
fact, Escobar's murder is only the most recent in a series of chilling 
incidents involving Colombian soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1988, referee Armando Perez was kidnaped for 24 hours and told officials 
who made "wrong decisions" in championship playoffs would be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1989, soccer referee Alvaro Ortega was killed by two men after calling a 
match in Medellin. Later, an anonymous caller said he and his bosses "had lost 
a lot of money" as a result of Ortega's calls. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In January, 1990, German Gomez Garcia, president of Bogota's Millionarios 
club, was driving when he was shot and wounded by two passing gunmen on a 
motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1983, Colombia's justice minister, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, claimed several 
prominent Colombian teams were run by drug traffickers. A few months later, he 
was assassinated. The government blamed drug barons. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the violence associated with Colombian soccer is believed related to 
drug and gambling cartels. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. sports haven't been entirely immune from either. 
</P>
<P>
 In the famed "Black Sox" scandal, Chicago White Sox pitcher Claude (Lefty) 
Williams testified he threw a game in the 1919 World Series because gamblers 
had threatened to murder his wife if he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's simple madness, which isn't confined to geopolitical boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, during a tennis match at Hamburg, Germany, a man came out of the 
stands and plunged a serrated knife into the back of Monica Seles, ranked No. 1 
in the world at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seles case brought into question athletes' security at sports venues, and 
it chilled athletes in all sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does this mean I should no longer approach a group of people asking for my 
autograph?" said one prominent athlete, in the Seles case aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 In America, threats have been race-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Black heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson was so routinely threatened 
with death during his championship reign (1908-1915), he eventually came to 
ignore them. 
</P>
<P>
 The same happened to Hank Aaron in the 1970s, as he came closer to Babe Ruth's 
career home run record . . . and with Jackie Robinson, who broke baseball's 
color barrier in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Even youth baseball isn't exempt from violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Antonio Messina, 19, from San Lorenzo, Calif., drew a 12-year 
sentence for killing a teen-age spectator with a bat, after the spectator had 
heckled him during a game. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, an East St. Louis, Ill., Little League coach, infuriated when an 
umpire called a 9-year-old out at the plate, fired several shots at the umpire 
but missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Often in America's sports history, the passions of the playing field erupted 
after games, in neighborhood bars. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1930s, a Brooklyn postal worker named Robert Joyce was drinking in 
a bar, trying to drown the sorrows of a one-sided defeat he had just seen his 
Dodgers take against their hated rivals, the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 He found himself surrounded by Giants fans, who taunted him. Joyce left, but 
returned with two revolvers and shot two of his tormentors, killing one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Two 1970s Southern California boxing murders are still unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Manager Howie Steindler, 72, was kidnaped in front of his Encino home in 
1977, and his body was later found on the back seat of his car, parked on a 
Ventura Freeway off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1979, agent Vic Weiss, 51, was found dead in the back seat of his car, 
which was parked in a North Hollywood hotel parking structure. His hands were 
bound and he had been shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss had been last seen alive days before at a Beverly Hills meeting with 
Jack Kent Cooke and Jerry Buss, when Buss was negotiating to buy the Lakers 
from Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes have often been swept up in the fortunes of regional hatreds, 
politics and even war. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the morning of Sept. 5, 1972, Arab commandos disguised as athletes 
slipped into the Munich Olympic athletes' village. 
</P>
<P>
 They killed two members of the Israeli Olympic team at the outset of a 23-hour 
hostage drama. The commandos, demanding the release of 200 Israeli-held 
commandos, all perished with nine more Israeli athletes in an airport gun 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, 19 Afghan field hockey players were abducted and an unknown number 
were later killed by rebel bandits as the team was returning by bus from a 
match in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was linked with U.S. President Jimmy Carter's boycott of the 1980 
Moscow Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the worst-ever case of soccer violence: The 1969 El 
Salvador-Honduras war. 
</P>
<P>
 There were violent clashes involving fans after the neighboring countries met 
in two World Cup qualifying matches. 
</P>
<P>
 El Salvador declared a state of siege and called up reservists. The Honduran 
government accused El Salvador of "the rape of our women, insults, automobiles 
destroyed and mocking the Honduran flag." 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomatic relations were severed and border clashes followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Several thousand people died in the weeklong war, which wasn't really resolved 
until 1992, when the International Court of Justice settled border disputes 
between the two nations.

WORLD CUP USA '94; ANALYSIS; SOMETHING NEVER SEEMED RIGHT; CONSPIRACY: 
COLOMBIA'S PLAY DIDN'T COME ANYWHERE NEAR EXPECTATIONS. WHAT HAPPENED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The conspiracy theories abound and grow in strength from day to day. There is 
little that can be done to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 They begin as nagging questions in the minds of international soccer writers 
who have covered the sport for decades. They quickly grow into serious doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 And when those doubts about the legitimacy of a team's commitment are 
reinforced by that team's poor performance, a flag is raised in the writers' 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Something is amiss. Is the game being decided on the field or elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
 Throw in a death threat that completely undermines that same team's morale on 
the day of a crucial game and the suspicions become more real. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the team in question is beaten by an opponent all logic says it 
should overwhelm, those suspicions turn into theories. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory being flashed around the world by some writers covering the 1994 
World Cup is that Colombia never had a chance to win this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder of defender Andres Escobar outside a Medellin restaurant on 
Saturday has only confirmed the suspicions of many that the Colombian national 
team was merely a puppet being controlled by the drug barons back home. 
</P>
<P>
 The fix was in from the start, the theorists claim, and the outcome of 
Colombia's games against Romania, the United States and Switzerland had less to 
do with what the players did on the field than with what the drug cartels that 
run and ruin Colombian society did off it. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Escobar scored an own goal that helped the United States defeat 
Colombia at the Rose Bowl is viewed by some as the reason for his murder. But 
this apparently was not a casual act of violence, not merely another random 
shooting in a country that is controlled by the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Several bullets is the sign of serious intent. To the conspiracy theorists, 
the shooting was not the result of an argument over the own goal, as has been 
suggested, but rather a deliberate act to silence Escobar for what he might 
have known. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory is that the drug cartels stood to lose vast amounts of money if 
Colombia won the World Cup. They had bet against their own country, the 
theorists say, and when it became clear that Colombia indeed did have a chance 
to win the tournament, they stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 Were it any nation but Colombia, such theories would be laughed at, but 
Colombian soccer has been controlled by the cartels for years. The murder of 
referees and threats against players are nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the trail of tragedy that has followed Colombia since it 
qualified for World Cup '94 last year with that astonishing 5-0 victory over 
Argentina in Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 Two players, Freddy Rincon and Luis Herrera, both lost brothers in traffic 
accidents. Those "accidents" surely must now be looked at in a different light 
in wake of Escobar's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the death threat against midfielder Gabriel Gomez's family that 
was sent by facsimile to the Colombian team's headquarters in Fullerton on the 
eve of the game against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the murder in Medellin. Was Escobar instructed to put the ball in his 
own net if he got a chance? Were some or all of the Colombian players purposely 
throwing the game in order to save their lives or the lives of their families? 
Was the United States' greatest victory scored against a team that never was 
going to win the game anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 Such questions are being asked, but they are the type of questions that will 
never be answered. The theories will continue, but the only substantive 
information that can be obtained is to look at the Colombian team itself and 
ask whether it really had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 If you discount the conspiracy theories completely, then one question remains: 
Why did Colombia fail when it was expected to do so well? 
</P>
<P>
 Was it nerves? Unlikely. The 5-0 drubbing of Argentina was achieved in the 
caldron of Buenos Aires, for example, not at home in Bogota. The Colombian team 
had experienced World Cup players from 1990 in its squad. The team had taken 
part in the 1993 Copa America tournament in Ecuador and had done well. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it could not have been nerves. These were players who were tried and 
tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it ability? Were the Colombians overrated as players? Were they simply 
outmatched when they came up against World Cup caliber opposition? 
</P>
<P>
 Again, this is unlikely. Midfielder Carlos Valderrama is a two-time South 
American player of the year for good reason. He is one of the best in the world 
at his position. Forwards Faustino Asprilla and Adolfo Valencia play on 
championship-winning teams in Europe -- Asprilla for Parma in Italy and 
Valencia for Bayern Munich in Germany. They are considered world-class players. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true for others on the team, including Rincon, so the idea that 
the Colombians did not match up on the field is ludicrous, especially against 
the Romanians, Americans and Swiss. These weren't the Germans or Brazilians 
they were facing. They should have won easily. 
</P>
<P>
 So if it was not nerves and it was not lack of ability, what could have led to 
Colombia's downfall? 
</P>
<P>
 It appears more and more likely that there were forces at work beyond the 
control of Coach Francisco Maturana. Threats against players and their families 
were made and had the desired effect of undermining confidence. Of that there 
is no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer is a team sport that relies on the ability of 11 individuals to become 
one on the field, to function as a unit, to think and react in unison. It takes 
only two or three players to be distracted or to play badly, purposely or 
otherwise, to ruin any game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 And Colombia certainly had players who did not play well. Goalkeeper Oscar 
Cordoba was a disaster. His positioning was bad and attempted saves were feeble 
efforts. But he had not played that way before. In fact, he had been praised 
for the confidence of his approach and the sureness of his handling. He was the 
team's first-choice goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 And Asprilla, who was supposed to be the next big world star, almost 
disappeared. He had little or no influence on Colombia's attack at a time when 
he should have been leading it. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Valderrama, his play never reached the heights of which he is capable. 
But the same could be said of all the Colombian players. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that the opening game loss to Romania shattered the team's 
morale and self-belief. But there was nothing to suggest the Colombians' 
confidence was that fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 No, there was something more at play here, something uglier and more devious. 
Something evil. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only a theory.

WORLD CUP USA '94; A DEADLY TWIST TO FAMILIAR THEME; VIOLENCE: IT HAS LONG BEEN 
A FACTOR AMONG FANS OF THE SPORT, BUT A MURDER ADDS A CHILLING DIMENSION TO THE 
PROBLEM.

 The debate about soccer violence will no doubt begin anew. What the murder of 
Andres Escobar does is change the pitch of the discussion. Violence in the name 
of soccer has been turned inward, with fans killing themselves after losses. 
Soccer violence has been turned outward in the form of rampages and rioting. 
</P>
<P>
 This is different. This is not about hooligans. Hooligans have little to do 
with the game of soccer and often care not if the team they are supporting has 
won or lost; they care about smashing a beer bottle over someone's head. A 
soccer match merely provides the venue. 
</P>
<P>
 A line has been crossed. Some inviolable border had been breached when fans 
attack players and take out their frustrations in a pound of flesh. What can 
drive people to harm themselves and others because a soccer team has lost a 
game? It is an ineffable passion. 
</P>
<P>
 The general secretary of FIFA observed Saturday that the game has two faces. 
Indeed, it does. One, that FIFA shows to the world and that is showcased in the 
World Cup. That face bears a joyous smile. Soccer has the facility to raise the 
life of a fan. It gives something to a person who has nothing. If my team wins, 
I win. I am elevated.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the emotion behind the ecstasy of victory. The sometimes suffocating 
identification of fans with teams and players can produce euphoria, and it can 
also, increasingly, engender outrage and brutal lashing out. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the other face, of soccer and sport. 
</P>
<P>
 In some countries, soccer serves to fill the gaping chasm between the haves 
and the never-haves. Soccer, the people's sport, is accessible and identifiable 
and very much belongs to the underclasses of these places. Because they have 
nothing else, the soccer victories carry more emotional weight, they affect 
fans in a way that cannot be comprehended by a person whose life includes the 
daily victory of a home and a job and available food. 
</P>
<P>
 Three soccer fans died of "shock" in Nigeria after that country beat Angola in 
a World Cup qualifying match in 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 If a victory is imbued with such import, what can a loss mean? To many 
Bolivian fans, their team's exit in the first round of this World Cup was 
affirmation that in the eyes of the world they are a small landlocked country 
that supplies the raw material for the Colombian drug trade. Nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
 What made a soccer fan in Tegucigalpa shoot himself in the head after 
Yugoslavia scored the winning goal that eliminated Honduras from the 1982 World 
Cup? Why did a woman kill herself after Cameroon was knocked out of the 1990 
World Cup? Why do fans jump out of buildings and swallow pills and suffer so? 
</P>
<P>
 Nationalism plays a part. A country's writers and poets and scientists and 
artists and actors are available on the international scene, but they don't 
compete. They don't represent their nations when they achieve, they represent 
themselves. Only athletes are followed around by a flag, like so much 
diplomatic baggage. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take long to accumulate an overflowing file filled with accounts of 
soccer violence. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Police use tear gas to disperse 200 fans who are rioting at the training 
site of the Italian club, AS Roma, after the team 's sixth loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A fight between rival fans at a soccer match in Turkey leaves 10 dead and 
200 injured. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Lima, Peru, fans riot over a disallowed goal during an Olympic 
qualifying match. In the aftermath, 320 people are dead, more than 1,000 are 
injured and martial law is declared for 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Nanchong, China, a riot breaks out at a club match in protest over a 
referee's call. Home fans stone police and visiting players. Fans loot a hotel 
and the police station. There are 135 injured. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fans rampage after West Germany defeats England in the semifinal of the 
1990 World Cup. Fighting breaks out in 29 cities in England. In Brighton, 
English youths chase German students and tourists. More than 300 students are 
locked in a nightclub by authorities for their safety. In London, German-made 
cars are damaged. In Turin, a 23-year-old German is stabbed in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which caused an Italian police captain to say: "I've been in Milan for 
four years and I've never seen such violence. I can understand political 
violence and demonstrations against specific causes, but we just can't 
understand this sort of senseless fighting."

WORLD CUP USA '94; A HARD LESSON IN SOCCER REALITY; U.S. TEAM: ESCOBAR'S MURDER 
SHOWS THE TYPE OF STRAIN PLAYERS FROM OTHER NATIONS ARE UNDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Locked into what they have frequently referred to as a "life-and-death 
situation" -- playing Brazil on Monday in the knockout round of the World Cup 
-- the players on the U.S. team were sobered by the news of a far more brutal 
reality, the murder of Colombian defender Andres Escobar. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Escobar's sliding attempt to stop John Harkes' pass that knocked the 
ball into his own goal, the mistake that somehow placed the responsibility of 
the 2-1 loss to the United States and even Colombia's failure to advance from 
the first round heavily on Escobar. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team understands it operates under only a fragment of the pressure 
that other World Cup teams face daily. As they practiced in Mission Viejo on 
Saturday morning, the players talked about the news of Escobar's murder, with 
details just filtering in. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the team arrived here to prepare for Monday's game, the shock had 
settled in. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Thomas Dooley: My first thought was, "Maybe better we lose the game 
against Colombia than he loses his life." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Soccer Federation on Saturday faxed condolences to the Colombian 
federation and to Escobar's family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grieve for his family," U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic said. "I feel for his 
team. Our entire team felt the impact this morning. We feel very sad for what 
has happened. Sometimes, we just want to think that soccer is just a game." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it usually is for the U.S. team. But the events in Colombia 
brought home to the American players how seriously a World Cup loss is viewed 
in some parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very, very unfortunate situation that doesn't belong in sports," 
goalkeeper Tony Meola said. "Unfortunately, some people don't realize that 
ultimately what we do, even though there is a lot of passion and pride 
involved, it's only a game. People who think like that are only crazy to take 
this further than the game." 
</P>
<P>
 For Harkes, it will be difficult to view the first World Cup goal of which he 
was a part in the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's a lot harder to think good thoughts (about the goal)," Harkes 
said. "You're talking about someone's life here, you're talking about three 
points in a World Cup game. There will be another World Cup in 1998 and Cups 
will happen every four years, but for him and his family, it won't. We're all 
very sad right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes had taken the ball up the left side of the field and looked to his 
right, where Ernie Stewart was rushing into the penalty area. Stewart's run 
forced Colombian goalkeeper Oscar Cordoba to move to his left, leaving the net 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes crossed the ball in Stewart's direction but Escobar blocked the shot 
and, sliding, knocked it in off his right foot. Escobar collapsed and covered 
his face with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Own goals are a horrible fact of life for a defender, but the loss, coupled 
with Colombia's 3-1 loss to Romania in the opening match, meant the team that 
many had predicted would make it to the championship game would instead go 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar and other Colombian players already had received death threats before 
the game against the United States, but after the own goal Escobar became the 
lightning rod for criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of the pressure that Escobar and the Colombians endured made itself 
evident with Saturday's murder. After glimpsing the deadly seriousness that 
some fans bring to the game, the U.S. players spoke with renewed respect for 
the Colombian team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys qualify for the World Cup and they are heroes in their country," 
Marcelo Balboa said. "And then something like this happens. It's incredible. I 
feel sorry for the Colombian team, because they are a great team. They just 
didn't have a great tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Alexi Lalas: "It's terribly disappointing and disturbing and I know that 
all of our hearts go out to his family and everybody who loved him. It shows a 
complete lack of respect for life."

WORLD CUP USA '94; COMMENTARY; 'A DREADFUL MISTAKE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am watching the tape again, replaying the 34th minute over and over, the 
same way I did that night after returning home from the Rose Bowl and United 
States 2, Colombia 1. 
</P>
<P>
 I never thought I'd be watching it again this soon, or for this reason -- 
searching for the motive in a murder. 
</P>
<P>
 John Harkes, the U.S. midfielder, appears on the bottom of the screen, lugging 
the ball down the left flank, dribbling into a phalanx of three Colombian 
defenders. Teammate Paul Caligiuri circles behind Harkes and sprints toward the 
left corner flag, drawing one defender, Luis Fernando Herrera, with him. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of the screen, U.S. striker Ernie Stewart is sprinting into the 
penalty area, a step and a half ahead of a beaten yellow shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 And drifting back into the penalty arc is hapless Andres Escobar, aware of the 
defensive collapse to his left but keeping his eyes on the ball and Harkes' 
left foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes plants outside the left corner of the area and delivers a hard cross 
for Stewart. The ball skids across the grass, like an overplayed putt on a 
slick green, moving too fast, it appears, for Stewart to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar, however, has his back turned to Stewart. He has no way to know if the 
ball is long, or about to be delivered right on stride. 
</P>
<P>
 All he sees is a blue blur slicing through the area, with no defender behind 
him, and he can only assume the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar reacts instinctively -- and desperately. He slides, feet first, at the 
ball, meeting it just to the left of the penalty spot. He tries to block the 
ball with his right foot, but is only able to graze it. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar's inner arch acts like a billiards bumper, and a ball moving 
diagonally is abruptly redirected. 
</P>
<P>
 All . . . . the . . . . way . . . . into . . . . the . . . . Colombian . . . . 
net.  
</P>
<P>
 ESPN's broadcast team is absolutely ambushed by the play. Roger Twibell, the 
play-by-play man, is chatting idly about another game, the just-completed 
Romania-Switzerland match, expecting nothing extraordinary as Harkes sets up 
and fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Twibell: "Harkes now . . . with Caligiuri overlapping on the far side . . . 
sends it in front. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "AN OWN GOAL!  
</P>
<P>
 "THE USA GETS THE SCORE! 
</P>
<P>
 "ESCOBAR ON THE OWN GOAL AND THE UNITED STATES LEADS COLOMBIA, 1-0!" 
</P>
<P>
 As the replay flashes across the screen, Twibell turns to analyst Seamus Malin 
and muses, "You will take them, Seamus, any way you can get them." 
</P>
<P>
 Malin: "A tremendous drive by Harkes . . . and a dreadful mistake by Escobar." 
</P>
<P>
 The replay winds down. Escobar is flat on his back. Oscar Cordoba, the 
Colombian goalkeeper, thrusts both hands to his head and crumbles to the ground 
in anguish. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera zooms in for a tight angle on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 It is lodged in the back webbing of the net and it is spinning, and spinning, 
and spinning, for an inordinate amount of time. It's an inflammatory image. The 
ball seems to be thumbing its nose at 22 Colombian soccer players and 35 
million Colombian soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
 My first view of the goal was from the press area in the Rose Bowl. Seated in 
the row behind me was Cal State Fullerton soccer Coach Al Mistri. 
</P>
<P>
 "Escobar messed up," he flatly assessed. "He misjudged the speed of the ball 
and he opened up his foot too wide. The keeper comes out to guard the post 
against Stewart and the guy deflects it into his net." 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't happen," he said. "But it does." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal eventually proved the difference in what has been roundly described 
as the greatest upset in the history of the World Cup and afterward in the 
press center, gallows humor abounded. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when is Escobar defecting? Wonder if Escobar can get a job here as a 
factory worker. Might be a good time for Escobar to change his identity. The 
laughter stopped Saturday morning with the news of Escobar taking 12 bullets 
outside a restaurant in Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
 I rerun the tape one more time. Escobar hits the deck again, wrong-foots the 
ball and sends it trickling into the net behind Cordoba's back. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the nightmare continues for Oscar Cordoba," Twibell intones. 
</P>
<P>
 No one in the booth dares say what it might mean for Andres Escobar.

 Colombia's fall from widespread consideration as one of the favorites to win 
the World Cup to being one of eight teams that failed to qualify for the second 
round was typified by a misplay in the 34th minute against the United States on 
June 22 at the Rose Bowl. HOW THE PLAY UNFOLDED 
</P>
<P>
 1) U.S. midfielder John Harkes, after taking a pass from Mike Sorber 10 yards 
inside the Colombian side of the field, dribbles up the left sideline and spots 
U.S. striker Ernie Stewart on the right wing. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Harkes curls a pass toward Stewart, who had beaten a defender, and 
Colombian goalkeeper Oscar Cordoba moves from his right to far left in an 
attempt to cut down Stewart's shooting angle. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Midfielder Escobar attempts to make a sliding clear of the ball, but the 
ball ricochets off his leg and heads toward the net. 
</P>
<P>
 4) By now in position to seal off the left post from Stewart, Cordoba can only 
watch as the ball goes into an open net.

A FEAST FOR BASKETBALL GOURMETS; SUMMER CAMPS OFFER A LOOK AT SOME OF THE 
COUNTRY'S MOST TALENTED YOUNG PLAYERS 
</P>

<P>
 With the NBA Championship more than two weeks over, some basketball fans may 
be experiencing hoop withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who hunger for a steady diet of jump shots and slam dunks, the 
summertime offers a complete menu. From nationwide summer camps to regional 
high school tournaments, the summer holds an array of delicacies for the 
serious roundball junkie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nike All-American All-Star Camp in Deerfield, Ill., which runs through 
Tuesday, will showcase many of the nation's best high school seniors for 
college recruiters, including the nation's top prospect, Kevin Garnett, a 
6-foot-10 center from Mauldin (S.C.) High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "Garnett is the most gifted all-around big man I've seen in 20 years," said 
Bob Gibbons, publisher for Lenoir, N.C.-based All Star Sports Publications. "He 
is an amazing shot blocker, has an excellent feel for the game and does 
instinctive things on the court that can't be taught." 
</P>
<P>
 Garnett will be joined in the Windy City by blue-chip prospects such as 
forward Ron Mercer of Madison (Tenn.) High; forward Luther Clay of Maine 
Central Institute in Pittsfield, Me; center Robert Traylor of Murray-Wright 
High in Detroit; guard Vincent Carter Mainland High, Daytona Beach (Fla.); 
forward Terrance Roberson of Buena Vista High, Saginaw, Mich.; center Taymon 
Domzalski of Lovington (N.M.) High, and guard Melvin Levett of St. Joseph High 
in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephon Marbury, a 6-3 point guard from Brooklyn (N.Y.) Lincoln High, will 
headline the list of talent at the Adidas ABCD at Teaneck, N.J., Tuesday 
through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marbury is better than Kenny Anderson was at that stage," said Clark Francis, 
editor and publisher of the Hoop Scoop magazine said about the New Jersey Nets 
guard. "He is a pure point guard and makes his teammates better." 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood shooting sensation Paul Pierce will be competing against Marbury at 
ABCD. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Pierce, a 6-7 forward who shoots well from outside, will be point 
guard Arthur Lee of North Hollywood High and forward Shareef Abdur-Raheem of 
Marietta (Ga.) Wheeler High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Krieder Basketball Camp in Cincinnati will showcase the nation's top 
underclassmen. The University of Cincinnati will host the camp July 10-14. 
While the Nike and ABCD camps are free to players who are invited, the Krieder 
Camp charges $330 a player. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Krieder Basketball Camp gives a lot of underclassmen exposure who 
otherwise wouldn't be recognized," Krieder associate director Sharon Kaplan 
said. "We take kids from small towns who often get overshadowed by kids from 
big cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Murphy Jr., son of former NBA star Calvin Murphy, of Houston Pius X 
High; Mike Bibby, son of former NBA player Henry Bibby, of Phoenix Shadow 
Mountain High; and center Lamont Barnes of Hopkinsville (Ky.) University 
Heights High will be in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California offers a host of basketball appetizers for basketball fans 
within driving distance and admission is free. The Slam 'N Jam Spring/Summer 
Development League runs Wednesday through Saturday at Carson High. Compton's 
Dominguez High will be the top seed in a 16-team tournament, which includes 
Inglewood, Long Beach Poly, Inglewood Morningside and Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez is led by 6-5 guard Tommy Prince, who is recognized as one of 
Southern California's top three players, along with Pierce and 6-9 center 
Jelani McCoy of San Diego St. Augustine. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, a good inside-outside player, averaged 20 points in leading his Dons 
to their second consecutive championship in last month's Watts Summer Games. He 
scored his average on 9-of-20 shooting in the 92-58 championship game win over 
Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other standouts in the four-day tournament will be Pierce, Mater 
Dei's sophomore Schea Cotton, Santa Ana Valley junior Olujimi Mann and the 
Westchester duo of senior Ben Sanders and highly touted junior Danny Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pump Discovery Shootout, Tuesday and Wednesday at Cal State Dominguez 
Hills, provides area fans the best opportunity to see the future stars of the 
upcoming Central City basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola's Moose Bailey, the 6-1 guard and younger brother of former Cub 
standout and UCLA recruit Toby Bailey, and 5-10 guard Clem Breedlove of L.A. 
Jordan, a City Times All-Star second-team selection in 1993, are among the top 
area players scheduled to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the list are Fremont guard Donnie Wilcher, Manual Arts guard Darwin 
Carter, Verbum Dei guard Ivory Burris and Dorsey forward Will O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Dominguez Hills will also host the West Coast All-Stars. The 
Saturday-July 12 event, like the Pump Discover Shootout, will be run by the 
Pump twins, David and Dana. SUMMER HOT SHOTS

 On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon -- the first time any 
human had walked on the surface of another celestial body. The journey took 
420,000 technicians eight years and $25 billion to achieve. More than 500 
million people worldwide watched Armstrong on television. Saturn V Launch

</P>
<P>
 The Apollo 11 manned mission to the moon set the standard for space 
exploration. Here is a step-by-step look at the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Key: Ascent / Descent 
</P>
<P>
 Orbit / Flight path Flying to the Moon 
</P>
<P>
 1) Saturn launch pad 
</P>
<P>
 After a 28-hour countdown, the 363-foot Saturn V rocket lifted three 
astronauts and their equipment flawlessly off the pad in one thunderous burst 
and they were headed for the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Command and service module code name: Columbia 
</P>
<P>
 Lunar module code name: Eagle 
</P>
<P>
 2) Columbia / Eagle 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia mates with Eagle lunar module and continues to moon. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Columbia module is separated from lunar module. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Columbia continues orbiting the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Eagle begins descent. 
</P>
<P>
 6) Landing site Freeze Frame: Descent 
</P>
<P>
 On final approach looking out his windows, Armstrong sees that the 
computer-chosen landing site is a large crater covered with large rocks. He 
takes control and picks a new landing site. 
</P>
<P>
 Planned flight path 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong takes manual control of Eagle 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong's new flight path Freeze Frame: 'The Giant Leap' 
</P>
<P>
 The craft settles down with a jolt almost like that of a jet landing on a 
runway. Armstrong immediately radios Mission Control: "The Eagle has landed." 
Later Armstrong moves down the ladder and halts on the last step, then puts his 
left foot on the moon and radios, "That's one small step for man, one giant 
leap for mankind."

 Armstrong and Aldrin explored the moon's surface for two hours and 56 minutes, 
never straying more than 200 feet from the lunar lander. 
</P>
<P>
 With no atmosphere to carry a wind to disturb them, the footprints the 
astronauts left in the lunar dust should be visible for half a million years or 
more. Freeze Frame: Ascent 
</P>
<P>
 Using the descent stage as a launch pad, ascent engines thrust the Eagle 
upward at 80 feet per second into lunar orbit. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

 2) Eagle blast back into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Eagle: The Eagle crew transfers to command module and leaves the rest of 
lunar module behind. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Columbia: After orbiting, command module is separated from lunar module. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Columbia with all crew onboard fires its engines and heads fpr Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 6) Crew in command module separates from service module and begins re-entry. 
</P>
<P>
 They reenter and splash down in Pacific Ocean. Freeze Frame: Splashdown 
</P>
<P>
 After Eagle is jettisoned the Columbia begins the long journey home. Columbia 
splashes down 825 nautical miles from Honolulu and is recovered by the Navy 
ship Hornet. Items Left Behind 
</P>
<P>
 * The 12 astronauts who explored the moon left behind more than their 
footprints. 
</P>
<P>
 * They also left their boots. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the Sea of Tranquility and the Ocean of Storms, they left $517 million 
worth of equipment, momentos and junk. 
</P>

RECESSION FADING FOR O.C. JOBLESS; ECONOMY: WITH UNEMPLOYMENT AT A 29-MONTH 
LOW, PEOPLE OUT OF WORK FOR YEARS ARE BACK ON A PAYROLL. BUT MANY TAKE A CUT IN 
WAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Virginia Barnes' recession started in December, 1991, when she was laid off 
from an electronics assembly job at Rockwell International Corp.'s defense 
plant in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have ended last Tuesday, when she started work at an expanding Anaheim 
electronics manufacturer, QLP Laminates Inc. "It was a real struggle," Barnes 
says. "I'm so happy that it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes is one of the more than 4,000 people who were added to Orange County 
employers' payrolls in May, bringing the county's unemployment rate down to 
5.3% -- the lowest rate in 29 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists say the burst of hiring in May, the latest month for which data is 
available, reflects the beginning of a recovery after four grueling years of 
recession, which officially began in the United States in July, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "It still has a ways to go, but the job market has definitely picked up," says 
Tony Chow, a Laguna Niguel consultant who works with struggling companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chow and others see a downside. The latest employment growth appears 
lopsided, favoring entry-level job seekers in the service industry over those 
who are looking for management positions or high-paying manufacturing 
positions. As such, many of the newly hired people seem to be making far less 
in wages today than they did in the glory days of the aerospace and real estate 
industries in Orange County during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, for example, says she's now making only half of the $14 an hour she 
was paid at Rockwell. But she isn't complaining. This new electronics assembly 
job beats standing at a freeway off-ramp with a "Will Work for Food" sign, she 
says in all seriousness. And not everyone who has landed a new job in Orange 
County recently has had to take a pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Neeltje Mack, an industrial hygienist, says the $70,000-plus salary she now 
receives in the growing environmental clean-up unit of Holmes & Narver in 
Orange represents a "nice" increase from her previous salary at TRW Corp.'s 
shrinking space and electronics division in Redondo Beach. She's among those 
who are able to take advantage of the recovery to improve her job status. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are still thousands of jobless workers in Orange County, and 
county employment remains woefully short of pre-recession levels: The recently 
revised count by the state Employment Development Department shows that there 
were 54,600 fewer full- and part-time jobs in Orange County in May than in May, 
1990, just before the recession began. 
</P>
<P>
 But signs of local economic recovery are increasingly there for those who look 
for them, such as Kim Megonigal, owner of Kimco Services Inc., an Irvine-based 
employment agency with four offices in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Megonigal says his business this year is up 65% from a year earlier. One 
indicator of a recovery, he notes, is that employers are converting temporary 
positions to regular full-time jobs, reflecting greater confidence in the 
economy. "We're seeing a dramatic turn of events." 
</P>
<P>
 James Doti, president of Chapman University in Orange and the private school's 
chief economic forecaster, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Doti's annual Orange County forecast -- a report used by hundreds 
of business leaders in the county for corporate planning -- said that 1994 
would be a sluggish period with minimal job growth. 
</P>
<P>
 But just 10 days ago, in his midyear update, Doti revised his outlook. Now, he 
predicts, the county will end 1994 with 10,000 additional jobs than at the end 
of 1993 -- the first growth year of this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's recovery, he said, finally has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, then, are some faces of the recovery: stories of Orange County people 
who have found new hope at the start of the economic comeback.

MIDYEAR INVESTMENT REVIEW AND OUTLOOK; A GLOBAL QUEST FOR CASH; GROWTH: IS 
THERE ENOUGH CAPITAL TO GO AROUND? SOME THINK NOT -- AND SAY A LOOMING SHORTAGE 
EXPLAINS A GREAT DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before so much of the world decided to go capitalist, someone should have 
asked a simple question: Is there enough capital to go around? 
</P>
<P>
 With 1994 half over, financial markets are already fixated on next year. And 
the global economy that some investors now envision in 1995 is one that will be 
trying to fire on all cylinders, only to find that the necessary fuel -- 
capital -- is in woefully short supply. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of a planet full of eager entrepreneurs and 
road-and-bridge-building governments all bidding for scarce resources -- 
including money -- to realize their dreams of growth is the dark cloud 
overhanging world financial markets today, these analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 A looming capital shortage, this school argues, explains why long-term 
interest rates remain absurdly high relative to current low inflation. It also 
explains why prices of "hard" resources (in the form of many commodities) are 
rising, and why investors are fleeing the currencies of some of the most 
capital-needy countries, such as the United States, which could be most 
vulnerable in a time of short funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is not so much whether money and resources will be available to fund 
a global economic expansion in 1995, these experts say, but at what price , and 
therefore with what consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any given price (for capital) will clear the market, but it's not at 'any 
price' that economies can grow," warns Kenneth S. Courtis, senior economist for 
Deutsche Bank Capital Markets in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 If too many would-be capital users are priced out of the market, the great 
promise of the post-Cold War world -- that free markets would raise living 
standards for all -- may vaporize. 
</P>
<P>
 More important for the average American, a global capital shortage could 
finally bring home the painful cost of the nation's towering budget and trade 
deficits -- and significantly change the outlook for investing here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a global capital shortage first surfaced when the Berlin Wall fell 
in 1989, heralding the breakup of the Soviet Union and the beginning of the end 
of rigid communism worldwide. Some economists wondered aloud about the cost of 
suddenly integrating the so-called First, Second and Third worlds under the 
capitalist-consumerist banner. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the world economy could lift off in the new era -- and with it, the 
worldwide demand for money -- Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsequent Gulf War, coupled with a bursting of the real estate and 
financial bubbles in Japan and a massive corporate restructuring campaign by 
American companies, produced recessions so deep and long lasting in the United 
States, Europe and Japan that the developed world's need for capital was 
significantly muted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, for example, private credit demand dwindled so markedly 
that the Federal Reserve Board was able to cut short-term interest rates to 
30-year lows by last year, pulling long-term rates down as well. Those lower 
rates, in turn, helped businesses and consumers rebuild their balance sheets 
and set the stage for a new economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that expansion is in full swing in the United States. And to the surprise 
of many economists, Europe too is rebounding, and Japan appears ready to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the bulk of the developing world -- China, India, Southeast 
Asia and Latin America -- has been growing at a brisk pace since 1991 and is 
counting on new growth in the industrialized nations to further its own 
economic advance. Even in troubled Africa, the emergence of a free South Africa 
is expected to provide a catalyst for economic improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hale, economist at Kemper Corp. in Chicago, points out that the world's 
capitalists have waited 80 years for this. "For the first time since 1914, 
practically all of the nations on this planet have market-oriented economic 
systems," he says. And in 1995, virtually all of those individual economies 
should be growing synchronously for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Or trying. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hence the capital-shortage conundrum: A planet swarming with capitalists will 
require money and resources at a level never before witnessed. Some of that 
increased demand is already visible; much is admittedly theoretical, if quite 
logical: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the United States, outstanding commercial and industrial loans at banks, 
which plunged from $640 billion in early 1991 to $585 billion by the end of 
1993 as businesses paid down debt, have been rising almost nonstop this year. 
With corporate borrowers again stepping up to the window, the loan total has 
already climbed back to $609 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Privatization of state-owned enterprises -- through stock offerings that 
suck up available capital -- continues in full swing in China, the former 
Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and Latin America. And those developing nations 
now have been joined by capital-short Western governments struggling to 
streamline their own economies. 
</P>
<P>
 France, for example, is in the midst of a five-year plan to raise $78 billion 
through stock offerings in state-owned firms such as drug giant Rhone-Poulenc. 
A privatization program is also under way in Italy, where the government raised 
$3.1 billion just last week by selling a 51% stake in insurance company INA to 
public investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * In East Asia, the money needed to develop the fast-growing region's 
inadequate infrastructure alone could total a stunning $1 trillion over the 
next six years, according to John Lonski, economist at Moody's Investors 
Service in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Taiwan is in dire need of more power plants, Lonski says. 
"Electric power now must be rationed during the summer months because of 
(power-generating) reserve margins that border on the anorexic" -- typically, a 
mere 5% over normal usage, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * In one of the biggest market surprises this year, the prices of many 
commodities have surged as rising demand from growing economies has suddenly 
revealed relative shortages of worldwide staples such as coffee and cocoa. 
</P>
<P>
 William Gross, managing director of Pacific Investment Management Co. in 
Newport Beach, sees the commodity revival as a byproduct of the developing 
world's rapid ascendance as an economic force. 
</P>
<P>
 "The developing world was known in previous decades as the provider of 
commodities for Japan, Europe and the United States," Gross says. "Now they 
will be using an increasing amount for their own growth, and prices will have 
upward momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is that accelerating competition between the developed world and the 
developing world that is the root cause of the coming capital shortage, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The mature economies of the Western world should be at a stage where they are 
supplying capital to the developing world, where growth is faster -- and where, 
therefore, investment returns should be higher. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the West has exported vast amounts of capital to developing 
countries. In the 1970s, for example, there was massive (and ultimately 
disastrous) lending to Latin America by U.S. banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Western investment in developing countries is booming again, and this 
time it is more direct, often in the form of equity. Nowhere was that more 
evident than in the frenzy U.S. investors demonstrated for "emerging market" 
foreign stocks last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12 months ended March 31, assets in the emerging-market category of 
stock mutual funds skyrocketed from $918 million to $6.7 billion, according to 
fund tracker Lipper Analytical Services in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 While the West was growing slowly or not at all between 1990 and 1993, capital 
exports to the developing world were no great concern, and even were 
encouraged. Now, however, the question increasingly being asked is whether the 
West can retain enough capital to finance its own needs in 1995, as the United 
States, Europe and Japan grow. 
</P>
<P>
 What troubles many experts is that the West's propensity to generate savings 
and investment capital is dwindling, even as the demand for money within its 
own economies -- let alone those of the developing world -- is set to soar. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutsche Bank's Courtis, who has lectured extensively on global capital flows, 
calculates that the so-called G-6 Western economies (those of the United 
States, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada) saved a net 13.8% of their 
gross domestic product during the 1960s. The G-6 savings rate fell to 12.7% in 
the '70s, 8.1% in the '80s and now is 7.8%, Courtis says. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a chorus of critics say, the West has been spending too 
much. The monuments to that imbalance, of course, have been America's twin 
deficits -- budget and trade -- which have ballooned for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 So far in the '90s, Germany and Japan, among other developed nations, have 
also found themselves increasingly preoccupied with burdensome internal 
spending issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, the absorption of the former East Germany caused the federal 
government to run a budget deficit equal to 4.8% of GDP last year, compared to 
a 0.1% surplus in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan -- long the world's most important net capital exporter -- the 
bursting of the bubble economy has forced many institutions to repatriate 
foreign-held wealth in order to deal with a liquidity squeeze at home. In 
effect, the plunge in Japanese real estate and stock values has acted as a 
giant margin call. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine a global economic expansion in 1995 with a declining Western savings 
rate and unprecedented financial needs in the capitalist developing world, 
Courtis argues, and the result is likely to be "sharply increased tensions in 
world financial markets."

<P>
 The first tangible sign of those tensions may have appeared on Feb. 4, when 
the Federal Reserve Board began to tighten credit for the first time in five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostensibly, the Fed has raised short-term interest rates to slow the U.S. 
economy and thus keep inflation under control. What higher short-term interest 
rates also do, however, is encourage Americans to keep more of their money at 
home instead of sending it abroad -- and to keep it in short-term savings 
accounts rather than in true long-term investment vehicles such as stocks and 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the Fed deliberately wanted to husband liquidity that would be readily 
available to fund a growing U.S. economy, it could make no better move than to 
raise short rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, global stock and bond markets have been in turmoil ever 
since the Fed acted. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest shock to markets worldwide has been the rise in "real" 
interest rates, as measured by long-term bond yields. In the United States, the 
yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond has soared to 7.6% from 6.35% on 
Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the prospects for inflation, which theoretically determine long yields, 
have remained tame by virtually all accounts; U.S. consumer prices are expected 
to rise only about 3% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the after-inflation yield on long-term bonds now is about 4.5%, a 
historically gigantic premium. 
</P>
<P>
 What is causing such high real interest rates? The unwinding of excessive 
speculation in bonds last year is part of the answer, many analysts say; 
speculators who had bought bonds with borrowed money last year, betting on a 
continuing slide in yields, have been forced to bail out of their bets this 
year. That has increased the supply of bonds for sale, forcing prices down (and 
thus yields up). 
</P>
<P>
 But some experts see something more fundamental at work: The markets, they 
say, are recognizing that demand for money will be rising powerfully worldwide 
in 1995, so the price of that "commodity" is going up. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Investment Management's Gross, among others, has been warning his 
clients that the world economic outlook "suggests a higher level of real 
interest rates (ahead) than in prior decades." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Leamer, professor of economics at UCLA's Anderson business school, 
cautions against viewing the concept of a global capital shortage as an 
instantaneous event, but he nevertheless draws the same long-term conclusion as 
Gross: "I see a slow, general increasing trend in real interest rates," he 
says, as more borrowers compete for scarce dollars -- or yen or marks or pesos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the idea of a global capital shortage is hard to grasp, the pain of high 
real interest rates is not. Should long-term yields stay high worldwide, the 
effect will be similar for the home buyer in Anaheim, the entrepreneur in 
Bangkok and the multinational corporation in Berlin: All will have to work 
harder to meet debt payments and make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 High real rates also change the equation for world stock markets -- which is a 
large part of what is troubling the markets this year, many analysts say. 
Higher interest rates are a natural depressant on stock prices and inevitably 
make investors far choosier about the stocks they will buy, because expected 
returns must be high enough to compete with better yields on bonds and bank 
CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically for the West, increased discretion on the part of its well-heeled 
investors may exacerbate the impact of any capital shortage in the developed 
world, for a simple reason: If the developing world continues to grow at a 
faster pace, investment returns there should follow, which should keep money 
flowing into those markets. That's an argument for American investors to own 
more emerging-market stocks in the '90s, not fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the most surprising aspect of a global capital shortage in the '90s 
may be who wins and who loses -- that is, which countries wind up less short 
than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutsche Bank's Courtis contends that the clear winner will be East Asia, for 
a very simple reason: If capital creation becomes paramount, the countries that 
have the highest savings rates and the lowest labor costs will find it easier 
to fund their own growth. And no countries generate more internal savings than 
the nations of East Asia, including China, Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: In 1981, just 14% of global central bank reserves were in Asia, 
including Japan, according to Courtis. By 1992, that figure had reached 43%. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the United States -- with its dismally low savings rate and 
monolithic deficits -- is in increasing danger of losing its post-World War II 
ability to dictate the terms of its growth, and the world's, Courtis warns. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest battle to prop up the dollar, he and other economists say, is 
merely a symptom of a larger problem, which is that America is already beholden 
to too many foreign creditors. Foreign and increasingly powerful creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 The inevitable result of the '90s capital shortage, Courtis contends, is that 
"the money that North America and Europe need will increasingly be set on terms 
and conditions determined in Asia. I think this is going to be the story in the 
markets over the next few years." The Case for a Capital Shortage 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts say a shortage of capital -- the result of economies growing on 
almost every continent -- explains much of what is ailing financial markets 
worldwide. That includes stubbornly high interest rates, soaring commodities 
prices and the weak U.S. dollar.

MIDYEAR INVESTMENT REVIEW AND OUTLOOK; FUND INVESTORS SEEING RED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans are likely to find it hard to correlate their increasingly joyous 
economic mood with their sinking stock portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 Markets worldwide have been battered this year, as the apparent acceleration 
of the global economy has pushed interest rates up and diverted more money away 
from financial investment and into real things -- houses, cars, appliances, 
etc. 
</P>
<P>
 For the typical stock mutual fund investor, whose ranks have swelled to record 
levels over the past three years, the first two quarters of 1994 saw the 
biggest back-to-back quarterly losses in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The average general U.S. stock fund fell 2.7% in the second quarter after 
falling 3.3% in the first quarter, for a year-to-date decline of nearly 6%, 
according to fund tracker Lipper Analytical Services Inc. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 While that hardly rates as an earth-shaking loss, it has nonetheless fueled 
widespread fear that a bear market in stocks is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed, Americans may be taking the bear market talk to heart. Inflows 
into stock mutual funds, which continued to run strong in winter and spring 
even as markets sputtered, appear to have declined significantly in June, many 
fund companies say. 
</P>
<P>
 What may be troubling to many fund investors isn't the size of the first-half 
losses, but the slow, painful way they occurred: Stocks were never able to find 
their feet again after the Federal Reserve Board raised short-term interest 
rates on Feb. 4 for the first time in five years, in an attempt to moderate the 
economy's growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average reached its all-time high of 3,978.36 on Jan. 
31, and it closed on Friday at 3,646.65, for a decline of 331.71 points, or 
8.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Phillips, publisher of fund newsletter Morningstar Mutual Funds in 
Chicago, says investors have been taken aback not only by the markets' steady 
decline but also by the large, unexpected losses in certain types of 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's been so cruel about the first half is that many of those investments 
that promised greater stability got hit hardest," Phillips says. 
</P>
<P>
 Utility stock funds, for example, plunged 10% on average in the first half, 
according to Lipper, as rising bond yields made utility dividends less 
attractive (and as states began to move to increase competition in the electric 
utility business). 
</P>
<P>
 "Balanced" funds, which own a mix of stocks and bonds and are generally 
considered conservative investments, dropped 4.5% on average in the half, which 
was worse than the 3.6% loss of funds that buy only blue chip stocks in the 
Standard & Poor's 500 index. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many pure bond mutual funds endured bigger percentage losses for the 
half than did stock funds, as higher interest rates devalued older bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, losses in most overseas stock markets were a blow to U.S. investors 
who had jumped into the foreign-investing game last year, partly on the 
expectation that other world markets could continue to boom even if U.S. stocks 
stumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, except for the Japanese market and a handful of others, most world 
markets fell with the U.S. market in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock funds that specialize in Latin American markets dropped 10.6% on average 
in the second quarter and 13.2% in the half. Diversified international funds 
ended the half with a minor 0.1% loss, but that was only because the weak 
dollar offset much of the decline that occurred in most European markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The few big winners among stock fund categories included Japanese funds, up 
28.6% in the half as that market rallied out of a four-year bear phase, and 
financial services funds, which gained 6% in the second quarter and 2.8% for 
the half as bank stocks rebounded from a selloff that hit last fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for those categories, however, 21 of the 23 other stock fund categories 
tracked by Lipper all finished in the red for the half. 
</P>
<P>
 For many fund investors, the great worry isn't over what they may have lost in 
the first half, but whether much larger losses lie ahead. History shows that 
bear market declines of 15% or more can strike Wall Street even as the economy 
advances. In other words, it doesn't take a recession to cause a market slump 
-- it just requires that stocks have gotten ahead of themselves and that people 
begin to find other investments (or uses for their cash) more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mean it's time to sell out of stock funds? Naturally, most fund 
experts advise against wholesale dumping of funds, for a simple reason: If you 
bought stocks for the long haul, trying to time major bull and bear swings 
isn't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 And besides, most people would get it wrong, says John Markese, director of 
the American Assn. of Individual Investors in Chicago. "Every bear market ends 
when people least expect it," he says, and most timers fail to get back into 
the market in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are ways to reduce your risk of loss in a bear market, and to 
reduce the risk that you'll panic and bail out completely even when your heart 
tells you to stay .  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Stolper, a San Diego investment adviser, says people who have been 
invested in stock funds for a long time, but now can't sleep for fear of 
further losses, ought to take a chunk of their profits out -- perhaps 30% -- 
while leaving the bulk intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who feel they should be buying into this decline -- but who also worry 
that they don't have enough of a cash cushion in place to offset a major bear 
market loss -- might consider deferring new investment in stocks until they 
build up a decent cash hoard again. 
</P>
<P>
 And while he's generally against the idea of trying to "hedge" a stock 
portfolio with investments in gold or other hard assets, Stolper says buying a 
hedge now with 5% to 10% of your portfolio may have value if it makes you feel 
more diversified and thus stops you from panicking later should the market 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's enormous value in the placebo effect" of hedges, Stolper concedes.

VIEW FROM WASHINGTON / JAMES RISEN; INSIGHT; WITH CLINTON HEALTH PLAN ON THE 
OUTS, CONGRESS PLAYS 52 PICKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, JAMES RISEN writes about the economy from The Times' Washington 
bureau. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That dull thud you just heard coming from Washington was the sound of the 
Clinton health care plan being dropped into the congressional dustbin. 
</P>
<P>
 The end came quietly for the most ambitious and detailed piece of social 
legislation to emerge from the White House in at least a generation. In a 
private White House meeting in mid-June, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), 
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and his sidekick, ranking committee 
Republican Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), told the President that Clinton-style 
reform couldn't pass either their committee or the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Progress in other congressional panels, notably in the more liberal House, was 
only masking the trouble that awaited down the road in the Senate, the senators 
warned. The intricate plan crafted by White House health care guru Ira 
Magaziner and his team simply wouldn't fly. It was time, they said, for 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't mourn health care reform. Rather, think of the death of the Clinton 
plan as just the end of the beginning for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a fresh political and legislative process is under way, one over which 
the White House has far less control. That process may prove so slow that 
President Clinton is disappointed in his bid to win passage of a broad health 
care plan this year. But the momentum for some kind of change is strong, and so 
Clinton still may get a chance to declare some kind of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Next comes the really hard and ugly part -- the jockeying, wheeling and 
dealing, in which the Clinton Administration and Congress have to sort through 
the morass of competing health care proposals floating around Washington in 
order to strike a deal. In all likelihood, that deal will acknowledge 
Republican and business opposition to a mandate that corporations provide their 
workers with health coverage while still trying to accommodate -- in some form 
-- Clinton's demand that reform include universal health care coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the health care news from Capitol Hill is maddeningly 
incremental, terribly confusing and can be easily misleading. (Don't tell my 
editors, but here is a bit of heretical advice: You can skip the daily health 
care stories for several weeks until the smoke clears.) 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Washington Post editorial had it about right: "On alternate days for 
the next few weeks -- sometimes the same day -- you're going to read that 
health care reform is hopelessly bogged down or finally making some progress; 
that the Democrats -- or was it the Republicans? -- are newly united/in 
disarray; that the President or chairman of the Senate Finance Committee or Bob 
Dole, or someone, is getting either good or bad marks. . . . It will all be 
true. . . . You need to preserve a sense of detachment for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
 So what will the health care plan that emerges look like? That, of course, is 
the $64 question in Washington these days; even the outlines of a possible 
compromise are only dimly visible. Still, it seems timely to speculate on where 
this summer's grind-it-out congressional action ultimately may lead. 
</P>
<P>
 If agreement does come, look for it first in the arena of insurance industry 
reforms. Generally, both Republicans and Democrats are willing to demand more 
of the nation's health insurers. A bipartisan agreement might be reached to 
impose such new rules as requiring that insurers not turn away people with 
pre-existing conditions or that the industry accept so-called "community 
rating," under which insurance premiums are evened out across an entire 
community, reducing or eliminating disparities between premiums paid by the 
healthy and those paid by the seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Such reforms could address at least some of the most serious and heart-rending 
problems faced by American families today -- without requiring a big new 
federal presence in the health care industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Some new compromise that could give Clinton at least the appearance of having 
achieved universal coverage also may be possible. Clearly, an immediate move to 
an employer mandate for health care coverage -- which the Administration 
initially saw as critical to achieving universal coverage -- seems unlikely. 
Clinton simply never won over enough business support for the mandate to have a 
good shot in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 One helpful move might be for Clinton to back away from his insistence on 
universal coverage. Would coverage for 90% to 95% of Americans -- up from 
today's 85% -- be good enough? That is not a trivial question. If the President 
shows flexibility on this score, he may be able to achieve his goal of enacting 
meaningful health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of the latest compromise idea now on Capitol Hill -- the so-called 
employer-mandate "triggers?" With a trigger, an employer mandate would kick in 
at some future date only if more modest insurance industry reforms failed to 
achieve universal access. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans and business groups remain solidly opposed to a trigger. But a 
very "soft trigger" that went into effect only under very tightly controlled 
conditions might be negotiable. Another alternative -- a modified form of 
mandate on individuals rather than businesses -- also might be acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a bipartisan group led by Sen. John Chafee (R-R.I.) in the Senate 
Finance Committee -- the most critical congressional choke point for health 
care reform -- has worked hard in recent days to forge a plan that would meld 
several strains of compromise. The notion: A mechanism that would trigger 
individual mandates if coverage for 95% of Americans is not achieved soon after 
the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chafee compromise failed in its first go-round in the Finance Committee in 
late June, but it nonetheless seemed to offer the elements that a future 
compromise might build upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.), one of the thorns in Clinton's side 
on health care and a key member of the panel, seemed to like the Chafee 
approach. His support signaled, perhaps, that gridlock might be avoided. Boren 
noted that he liked the idea that the compromise involved "minimal amount of 
government intrusion," adding that phased-in reforms were the way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of us has the confidence. . . . that the government has all 
the answers to move now in a way that would lock us into only one possible 
course of action," Boren declared. 
</P>
<P>
 If Boren's gradualist vision becomes reality, the grand irony of health care 
reform will be this: 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton will have to decide whether to take credit for the kind of 
incremental change George Bush proposed -- and candidate Clinton ran against in 
1992.

 George Vanderheiden 
</P>
<P>
 Fund: Fidelity Destiny I, Boston 
</P>
<P>
 Category: Growth 
</P>
<P>
 First-half return: +0.7% 
</P>
<P>
 Avg. growth fund return: -6.0% 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Despite the broad market's slump, Fidelity's George Vanderheiden has managed 
to keep his Destiny I (and clone Destiny II) funds in positive return territory 
so far this year, thanks to some nimble trading moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he's betting on rebounds in classic big-name growth stocks -- and a drop 
in bond yields -- to make better money for his shareholders in the near-term. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that the market was nearing a speculative peak last winter, 
Vanderheiden says he began to weed his $4.5-billion portfolio of high-flyers, 
including auto stocks and other so-called consumer-cyclical issues that were 
riding Americans' new spending boom. 
</P>
<P>
 In their place he loaded up on what he calls "a lot of dull stocks" -- bank, 
energy, tobacco and utility issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of those groups, banking and energy, have been among the few strong stock 
categories since February -- a performance that has helped the Destiny funds 
buck the market slide. Electric utilities, however, were a disaster, 
Vanderheiden concedes; the double-whammy of rising interest rates and surprise 
dividend cuts this year has crushed the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Vanderheiden believes long-term interest rates are ready to come down 
again, because he expects the U.S. economy to slow. So he has about 10% of the 
Destiny portfolios in long-term bonds . 
</P>
<P>
 The other beneficiaries of a slower economy, he says, should be classic 
consumer growth stocks like Wal-Mart, Toys R Us, Philip Morris and Pfizer, all 
of which he has been adding to his portfolios.  
</P>
<P>
 Many classic growth issues have been out of favor for two years, as investors 
have chased cyclical industrial issues whose earnings were gradually improving 
with the recovering economy. But if he's right about the economy slowing, 
Vanderheiden says, "People will start thinking about assured earnings growth 
again, rather than cyclical earnings." Hence, he sees a return to the old 
standby growth stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, he says, the plunge in growth stocks' prices since 1991 has 
cut the risk in owning them. "You're seeing some good blue-chip companies whose 
stocks are pretty decimated," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He also likes the "story" in some of the technology stocks that have been 
zapped since spring, including computer networker Cabletron Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Vanderheiden hasn't given up on all industrial issues. He still owns 
Alcoa, for example, betting on a rebound in aluminum prices. But he isn't 
interested in playing the Big Three auto stocks for more than a short-term 
bounce, because he can't see a big new up cycle in them. The autos "are cheap," 
he says, "but where's the earnings surprise if the industry is already running 
at 100% of capacity?"

 Avg. flexible fund return: -4.2% 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Flexible funds were designed for relatively conservative investors who want to 
own a mix of stocks and bonds, but who also want to leave the specific mix up 
to a professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for most of those professionals, picking among stocks and bonds 
in the first half of '94 proved to be a thankless task. Rising interest rates 
devalued bonds and whacked most stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Huson, manager of the Crabbe Huson Asset Allocation fund, had to 
settle for a 3.3% loss on his $110-million portfolio in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the problem of how to make up for that loss and get back in the 
black in the second half, Huson has decided to make a stand in the bond market: 
He's betting that long-term bond yields are near their peaks and will soon 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 He has raised the fund's bond holdings to 40% of the portfolio from 32% 
earlier in the year, and doubled his bond stake's average maturity, to 11 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 He figures the Federal Reserve Board's steps to tighten credit this year have 
been enough to guarantee a mild slowdown in the economy. And that pending 
slowdown, he believes, will allow bond yields to come down enough to make 
bonds' second-half total returns "serious competition" for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 With 45% of the portfolio now in stocks and the remaining 15% in cash, Huson 
says he's willing to make bonds as much as 45% of the fund if yields go any 
higher -- and then wait for them to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market, on the other hand, may not yet have reached its bottom in 
this down phase, Huson says, even if long-term interest rates fall from here. 
After a three-year bull run, "I think the stock market is tired," Huson says. 
But the shakeout shouldn't last into 1995, he adds; by then, he expects stocks 
to again hold significantly more promise than bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the stocks he has picked for the fund constitute an eclectic 
mix of what he believes are solid "value" stories and potential turnarounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund owns long-unloved Occidental Petroleum, for example, as a bet on 
rising oil prices and increasing demand for its chemicals (like caustic soda) 
as the world economy gains steam. Stakes in Apple Computer and IBM are wagers 
that their jointly developed PowerPC computer chip, a potential rival to 
Intel's daunting chip franchise, will be an eventual success. 
</P>
<P>
 Huson also believes that real estate investment trusts, or REITs, remain an 
attractive way to invest in revitalized markets for commercial, apartment and 
industrial property, while also earning high dividend yields. The fund's REITs 
include Spieker Properties, which mainly owns industrial properties, and 
DeBartolo Realty, a nationwide shopping center REIT.

 Andrew Williams 
</P>
<P>
 Fund: Glenmede International, Philadelphia 
</P>
<P>
 Category: International 
</P>
<P>
 First-half return: +4.5% 
</P>
<P>
 Avg. intl. fund return: -0.1% 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. investors in foreign stock funds have learned to curse in many languages 
this year, as market after market has tumbled in the wake of 1993's stellar 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
 To steer the Glenmede International fund to a positive first-half return of 
4.5%, manager Andrew Williams used a big bet on Japanese stocks to offset 
weakness in most European markets. He also stayed mostly clear of Hong Kong, 
which has taken one of the hardest hits this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams sees the first half's setbacks in world stocks as part of an 
unavoidable market transition. Instead of being driven by falling interest 
rates, which have fueled stocks' gains since 1991, global markets will now be 
driven by corporate earnings, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to focus on the next stage of the cycle, which is earnings 
growth," he says. For that reason, Williams says, he shifted substantial assets 
into depressed Japanese stocks early this year, in time to catch the market 
surge there. Japanese issues now constitute 30% of the fund's $260 million in 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he concedes that he's worried about the effects of the strengthening 
yen, "the earnings outlook in Japan is really very good," Williams says, as 
that country emerges from its long economic slump and demand for its exports 
rises worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also playing an expected domestic demand rebound in Japan. One of his 
favorite issues is Nippon Denso, a major auto parts supplier to Toyota. 
"There's a whole auto-replacement cycle in Japan that's going to be kicking in 
over the next few years," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully 50% of the Glenmede fund's portfolio is in European stocks, another bet 
on a business recovery. Williams' European holdings are skewed toward 
cheaper-priced stocks in countries such as Spain and Italy (he owns clothing 
giant Benetton, for example), and toward major oil companies such as Royal 
Dutch Petroleum and British Petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
 The oils in particular reflect his search for businesses that have "exposure 
to a better pricing situation" as the economy picks up, Williams says: "The 
stocks are relatively cheap, the balance sheets are good, and the commodity's 
price is going up." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Williams is taking a go-slow approach with emerging markets, given 
the painful learning curve many new investors have ridden there this year. He 
prefers to view developing-world stocks as spice for the portfolio. He has 
small stock stakes in Singapore, Malaysia and Mexico. But Hong Kong still 
worries him, even after its 26% dive this year. It's a good bet that China will 
clamp down further on its own growth to control inflation, he says, and "any 
slowdown in growth in China naturally will hurt Hong Kong."

 Kevin Wenck 
</P>
<P>
 Fund: GT America Growth, 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 
</P>
<P>
 Category: Small company 
</P>
<P>
 First-half return: +8.2% 
</P>
<P>
 Avg. small-co. fund return: -8.5% 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Wenck toiled in one of Wall Street's killing fields in the first half of 
this year: the market for smaller-company stocks. Yet Wenck's GT America Growth 
fund produced a gain of 8.2% for shareholders in the half, while the average 
small-company stock fund lost 8.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 His secret, Wenck says, isn't much of a secret. "I don't think I did anything 
notable," he says of the first half. Rather, his philosophy -- which has helped 
make the GT America fund one of the top 100 stock funds (of 2,100 total) in 
performance over the past five years -- is simply "to invest in growth stocks, 
but only if they're selling for very inexpensive prices" relative to earnings, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 That keeps him away from highly speculative small issues that can triple or 
quadruple overnight in wild bull markets. But it also means he avoids the 
devastation those stocks can suffer in down markets. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike many stock fund managers, Wenck also is willing to sit with a huge 
chunk of cash in his $155-million fund if he can't find issues that fit his 
specifications. Hence, his fund was 40% in cash as of March 1. As the market 
has tumbled since, Wenck has jumped back in, whittling cash down to 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately he has been buying technology stocks such as semiconductor-controller 
maker Cirrus Logic and IBM software writer BMC Software, both of which have 
plunged 40% in the recent tech stock selloff. The market is focusing on a 
potential near-term slowdown in computer sales, but Wenck is looking ahead to 
later this year, when he expects new price cuts in semiconductors to fuel a 
fresh boom in computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he likes to root around in technology, Wenck says a more typical GT 
America stock is Haggar, the maker of low-priced mens' clothing. The stock, 
too, is low-priced, Wenck says; it sells for about 12 times the firm's most 
recent four quarters' earnings per share, even though earnings grew 15% last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional growth-stock wisdom is that a stock's price-to-earnings (P-E) 
multiple should at least equal its growth rate. That's wrong, Wenck says. "You 
don't want to pay the growth rate -- you want to pay something less," he 
argues. 
</P>
<P>
 His portfolio, which also includes such names as computer disk-drive maker 
Seagate Technology and medical device firm Nellcor, carries an average P-E of 
about 15 now, he says. Yet he figures that the average earnings growth of his 
companies is 23%. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important as knowing when to buy is knowing when to sell, Wenck says. 
If a stock rises to a level that he feels is plainly unjustified, he doesn't 
stick around: "As soon as you cross the line to speculation, if you're 
responsible you have to get out."

MIDYEAR INVESTMENT REVIEW AND OUTLOOK; BOND OWNERS FACE DECISIONS AS LOSSES 
MOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a simple test for bond market investors who are still shellshocked from 
their experiences of the last six months: 
</P>
<P>
 * How much money did you lose, on paper? 
</P>
<P>
 * Would it bother you to lose that much again during the next six months? 
</P>
<P>
 If the answer to the second question is "absolutely not!" then you may have 
reached your psychological limit as a bondholder. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem in the bond market during the first half of this year wasn't so 
much what occurred -- i.e., rising market interest rates -- but that investors 
who thought they were prepared for it really weren't, some Wall Streeters say. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this year, most bond owners had made great money in the market every 
year since 1988. That was because interest rates had been in a general 
downtrend through that entire period, so older, higher-yielding bonds kept 
appreciating in value. Investors got a capital gain "bonus" on top of their 
annual interest earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond pros often talked about what would happen when market interest rates 
would rise again, but people began to forget that rates moved in both 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now rates have soared across the board, pushed up by the Federal Reserve Board 
and the economy's strength. The result is that the share values of many 
long-term bond mutual funds lost a stunning 8% to 12% in the first half, as 
older bonds depreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because the funds' bonds kept earning interest in that period, shareholders' 
total return -- principal loss offset by interest income -- is in the negative 
4% to 8% range for many long-term funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Even short-term bond funds, which their owners viewed as relatively secure, 
came out of the first half with 2% or so negative total returns -- testimony to 
the broad surge in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens next, of course, depends on a host of factors, mainly economic. 
Slower economic growth could mean that interest rates will fall back for a 
while, recouping some of bonds' principal losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Prudential Securities economist Richard Rippe concedes that all bond 
owners have to face the reality that the world economy is inexorably getting 
better and that that means the easy-money days of bonds are over. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look out over the next 18 months to two years, I think interest rates 
are going to be higher," Rippe says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secular bull market in bonds is over," agrees Richard Hoey, economist at 
Dreyfus Corp. But he notes that interest rate changes from year to year could 
be so modest that bondholders will experience neither appreciation nor 
depreciation of principal; they may just earn their interest, which is what 
most are in for anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you're in bonds because you need income, there are easy ways to make 
yourself feel less vulnerable to principal losses, experts say. One simple idea 
is to split your money evenly among short-, intermediate- and long-term bond 
funds, rather than keeping it all in long-term funds (which most people have 
done because the yields are highest there; they forget the risk to principal is 
highest as well). 
</P>
<P>
 Another idea: Get out of funds and build a "laddered" portfolio of individual 
U.S. Treasury securities or other bonds, with some maturing every two years 
for, say 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 That way, you'll have money rolling over periodically, and you won't face the 
constant worry of the fund owner: that, because a fund is open-ended (and thus 
never matures) you can never be sure of getting your original principal back in 
a long bond bear market. Bonds: How Much Worse Can It Get? 
</P>
<P>
 As long-term interest rates have jumped this year, investors who have stayed 
in bonds have seen the bonds' value erode. Here's how the principal value of 
four types of bonds would change over the next year under two different 
interest rate scenarios. 04,20,09,18,17 *2*Principal change over next year 
Current *2*if market interest rates: Treasury bond term yield RISE 1 point FALL 
1 point 2-year 6.17% -0.8% +1.2% 5-year 6.95 -3.2 +3.7 10-year 7.32 -5.9 +6.8

MIDYEAR INVESTMENT REVIEW AND OUTLOOK; 'HARD' ASSET BUYERS MAY BE RIGHT, BUT 
EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investing in "hard" assets became a hot concept in the first half, but the end 
results were fairly soft. 
</P>
<P>
 The new raves for tangible investments, such as gold, basic commodities and 
real estate, were fueled largely by expectations of faster economic growth -- 
and thus higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 By definition, rising inflation means prices of tangible things go up. And the 
flip side is that intangible investments, such as stocks and bonds, usually 
suffer in times of higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 So some investors either switched significant sums from stocks and bonds into 
hard assets in the first half, or added small amounts of gold or other tangible 
investments to their stock and bond portfolios as a "hedge." 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff for being inflation-wary? 
</P>
<P>
 * Nothing in gold. Bullion's price, $390.80 at Jan. 1, finished the half at 
$385.80. Most gold mining stocks fared much worse, diving after rocketing in 
'93. 
</P>
<P>
 * Basic commodities were mixed. Coffee futures leaped 165% for the half, to 
$1.90 a pound, as shortages developed, and crude oil futures surged 37%, buoyed 
by the improving world economy. But lumber futures plunged 28% as home building 
slowed; grain prices melted with spring rains. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the Knight-Ridder/Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 key 
commodities finished up just 1.8% for the half. 
</P>
<P>
 * In real estate, prices have clearly firmed on many types of properties and 
in many regions. But real estate mutual funds gave up a meager 2.3% gain as of 
June 16 to end the half down 1.1%, on average. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for all of these inflation hedges is that there is no serious U.S. 
inflation to speak of, at least not yet. "The evidence suggests that the 
commodity bulls may be right, but they are too early," argues David Shulman, 
investment strategist at Salomon Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees prices rising later in the decade, driven by increasing consumption in 
the developing world. But the process will be gradual, and in the meantime many 
basic commodities remain in excess supply, Shulman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, as the accompanying chart shows, commodity prices overall appear to 
be in a cyclical upswing. The CRB index is up 15% from mid-1992; the last major 
commodity bull run, from 1986 to 1988, saw the CRB index rise about 30% before 
topping out. 
</P>
<P>
 Realistically, however, most investors aren't going to play commodities 
directly. There is no CRB mutual fund, and individual futures contracts are 
among the riskiest investments around, suitable only for speculators. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are some relatively easy ways to add hard assets to a small 
portfolio, if you want to bet on inflation, or partially hedge a stock-bond 
portfolio against damage from a surprise inflation surge: 
</P>
<P>
 * Natural resources mutual funds. These generally own stocks of commodity 
producers -- companies operating in such businesses as energy, lumber and 
mining. This fund category had an average first-half loss of 0.1%, which while 
disappointing still was far better than the 5.9% loss on the typical stock 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest natural resources fund is the Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price New 
Era fund, which inched up 0.5% in the first half after rising 15.3% last year. 
Among funds focused on energy, the Vanguard Group's Specialized Energy fund is 
up 4.8% this year after a 26.5% rise last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold funds. The average gold stock fund sank 11.4% in the half, after 
soaring 81% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Stephens, whose San Francisco-based Robertson Stephens Contrarian fund is 
25%-invested in gold stocks, says the mining stocks need bullion to move 
decisively through $400 to restart their rally. 
</P>
<P>
 That may take time, but it will happen, Stephens contends. As the world 
economy grows, inflation will naturally shift from financial assets to real 
assets, he argues. 
</P>
<P>
 * Real estate funds. Craig Litman, whose San Francisco-based firm 
Litman/Gregory designs mutual fund portfolios for individuals, isn't enamored 
of most hedging ideas. But he likes real estate mutual funds, such as Fidelity 
Real Estate, as diversification tools for traditional stock and bond 
portfolios. The Fidelity fund rose 2.5% in the first half. Another, New 
York-based Cohen & Steers Realty, was up 7.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Real-estate mutual funds generally own real estate investment trust stocks, or 
REITs, which own property directly. Litman expects demand for REITs from small- 
and mid-sized pension funds to surge, because the funds increasingly are 
seeking to diversify into property, but only via liquid securities. Riding the 
Commodities Market 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of many commodities have risen this year as the world economy has 
picked up steam. But the Knight-Ridder/Commodity Research Bureau futures index 
of 21 key commodities remains far below its peak level of the 1980s. K-R/CRB 
index, quarterly closes except latest: 1994: 230.03

MIDYEAR INVESTMENT REVIEW AND OUTLOOK; SAVERS' YIELDS RISE, AND THERE'S MORE TO 
COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Americans who are more savers than investors, revenge has been sweet this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board's decision to begin boosting short-term interest 
rates on Feb. 4 has substantially raised returns on most savings vehicles, 
while wrecking stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The average seven-day compound yield on money market mutual funds is 3.71% 
now, up one full percentage point from year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Though that yield still is relatively low, you'll earn 36% more interest at 
today's money fund yield than at the year-end yield. 
</P>
<P>
 Savers dependent on bank certificates of deposit haven't benefited as much, 
because banks have been slow to raise CD yields. The national average yield on 
six-month CDs, now 3.33%, is up 20% this year, according to Bank Rate Monitor 
newsletter in North Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 How much more can money fund and CD rates rise? Most money fund yields have 
caught up with the Fed's last rate hike (in late May), experts say. So "if the 
Fed does nothing else to rates, we're at the top" for now in fund yields, says 
Edward Wiese, manager of the T. Rowe Price Prime Reserve money fund in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks could boost CD rates more, depending on how much they need deposits. But 
any increases in the near term are likely to be minor, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean the saver is doomed to scrape by with these still-low yields 
forever. If the global economy expands as expected in the second half of this 
year and into 1995, many Wall Streeters see short rates rising again. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiese expects the Fed to further tighten credit later in the second half, 
which should translate into money fund yields above 4% by the end of the year, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 A continuing weak dollar could force the Fed's hand sooner, maybe even this 
week. But most experts think the most the Fed will do for the dollar is boost 
the official "discount rate." That would be symbolic, though: When the Fed is 
serious about pushing rates, it uses the "federal funds" rate, which is what 
banks charge each other for short-term loans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As happy as savers may be with rising short rates, keep perspective. After 
taxes and inflation, you're earning little or nothing. That's why, in the long 
run, everyone needs some form of true investment (like stocks); short-term 
accounts are for your cash "cushion" and money you just can't lose. 
</P>
<P>
 One idea for yield-hungry savers: Lock in the current 5.5% yield on one-year 
U.S. Treasury bills. One-year bank CDs pay far less, and money fund yields 
would have to rise more than 1.8 points over the next 12 months to beat the 
T-bill return. Most Wall Streeters doubt the Fed will have to be that 
aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The odds of money funds yielding more than 5.5% a year from now are very 
low," says Walter Frank, chief investment officer for money-fund tracker 
IBC/Donoghue in Ashland, Mass. More Bang for Short-Term Bucks

 A look at some of the new and ongoing market trends that could affect your 
investment portfolio:

<P>
 Stock 'Supply' May Soon Dry Up: One of the stock market's ongoing "problems" 
since 1992 has been an avalanche of stock offerings by newly public companies 
and by established companies. With those shares pouring into the market and 
soaking up investors' dollars, there has been less free capital available to 
chase existing stock. That's at least a partial explanation of why major stock 
market indexes have risen so slowly over the past two years, some analysts say. 
The blue chip Standard & Poor's 500 index, for example, rose just 4.5% in 1992, 
then 7.1% last year. So far in this year's market pullback, the S&P is down 
4.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, a record 626 companies made initial public offerings (IPOs), raising 
$40.8 billion, which also was a record, according to data tracker Securities 
Data Co. In addition, secondary stock offerings, or sales of additional shares 
by already public companies, raised a record $48.4 billion last year in 735 
separate offerings, Securities Data says. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, as the stock market has turned dicier, the pace of IPO and 
secondary offerings has naturally slowed -- but perhaps not as much as some 
Wall Streeters might have expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Securities Data says 303 companies made IPOs in the first half, which was 
actually higher than the 248 that went public in the first half of 1993. But 
because the average deal was smaller in this year's first half, the dollars 
raised in IPOs totaled $16.5 billion, down from $18 billion in the 1993 first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondary offerings dropped more sharply this year: Only 242 made it to market 
in the first half, raising $17.7 billion, compared to 344 offerings that raised 
$21.7 billion in the first half of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the argument that new stock issues are a problem for the market is 
relative. Stock issuance transfers capital directly to companies from 
investors, giving the businesses the wherewithal to expand, pay off debt or 
otherwise improve their financial positions. Fresh capital used wisely by a 
business eventually contributes to economic growth, which is good for the stock 
market in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as new stocks crowd onto the market, they naturally absorb dollars that 
might have chased existing shares and bid prices higher. And as IPO deals get 
smaller in size -- as they have this year -- that's usually a sign that riskier 
companies are in the market, trying to raise capital. Indeed, Securities Data 
says 69 of the second quarter's 149 IPOs ended up going to market at per-share 
prices below their initial targets.  
</P>
<P>
 "What that says is that many of these companies were willing to compromise 
just to get their deals done," Securities Data analyst Robert Liu says. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the public was pushing record amounts of new money into stock 
mutual funds, the IPO and secondary share offerings had willing buyers in the 
fund managers -- many of whom were eager for IPOs, in particular, for the 
chance of a fast gain in a hot new issue. But most mutual fund companies report 
that public inflows dwindled in June; that could signal the end of the new 
stock wave -- which in turn might provide some better, if eventual, support for 
the broad market. Slowing Supply 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market's lousy performance in the first half meant fewer companies 
could sell new stock. Chart shows dollar volume of initial public offerings and 
secondary stock offerings:

 Why Market Volatility May Worsen: It became convenient in the first half to 
blame those multibillion-dollar "hedge" funds, run by quick-fingered global 
traders, for everything but cancer. Even so, some Wall Street veterans believe 
the markets are indeed being riled by hedge fund activity to a degree that 
could help drive more already-frustrated individual investors from stocks and 
bonds. Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard & Poor's Corp.'s Outlook investment 
newsletter in New York, notes that hedge funds "anticipate trends in markets, 
then sell on the news -- they're quick to grab their profits" and move on to 
something else. That is quite different from the actions of true investors, 
Kaufman notes, and different even from the somewhat predictable actions of the 
computerized "program" traders who were vilified in the '80s for causing wild 
market swings. Because the hedge funds have grown so large in recent years -- 
they're increasingly attracting money from wealthy investors -- Kaufman worries 
about their ability to promote greater volatility. "They have a major influence 
at the margin," Kaufman says, and it's at the margin that markets are made or 
broken.

 Echoes of Bears Past: James Stack, who pens the InvesTech Market Analyst 
newsletter from Whitefish, Mont., and who is an unrelenting bear on stocks 
today, recently unearthed a market story published in the Nov. 11, 1968, issue 
of U.S. News and World Report. At that point, enthusiasm for Wall Street was 
running high; little did most investors know that stocks were one month away 
from beginning a bear market decline that would take the Dow Jones industrials 
from about 1,000 to 650 over 18 months -- a 35% plunge. What Stack found 
ominous about the U.S. News story was that it included many of the same 
arguments often given today by the bulls who see a glorious decade for stocks 
ahead. Among the story's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * "There is likely to be a wide and continuing gap between demand for and 
supply of equities in the next 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 * "There has been a marked change in where people have been putting their 
savings. In recent years, the trend has been away from bank deposits and life 
insurance. . . . Stocks have clearly become the most important savings vehicle 
for the consumer." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Banks in many instances are trying to get legal permission to offer mutual 
funds. Life insurance companies (also) are entering the mutual fund industry." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Stock prices on average may more than double in the next 10 years. Behind 
the expected surge: growth in the U.S. economy and in business profits and, 
even more important, soaring demand for common stocks by individuals, 
institutions and other investors." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Stack notes, the Dow was actually lower in late 1978 than it had been 
10 years earlier, when the story was written. A buyer of the Dow stocks in 1968 
had to wait nearly 20 years just to see their value double. 
</P>
<P>

</P>

 Corporate Insiders Are Bullish: If a bear market is looming, it isn't 
registering with many corporate executives. They are buying their own stocks at 
a pace not seen in two years, according to the Insiders newsletter in Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla. The newsletter's Insider Indicator, which tracks the 
percentage of corporate insiders buying stock in their own companies over the 
prior five weeks compared to the percentage selling, has reached 50% buyers -- 
the highest since mid-1992. The index measures only open-market trades (not 
stock-option-related purchases), so any time there are at least 50% buyers, it 
is a solidly bullish indicator, the newsletter says. Reason: More insider 
sellers than buyers is the norm, because while stock often is acquired in 
option transactions, it is generally only disposed of on the open market. When 
insiders are buying heavily on the open market -- using their own money to buy 
at the same price the public would pay -- it suggests the executives believe 
their own shares are bargains. TOM PETRUNO

MIDYEAR STOCK MUTUAL FUND REVIEW; THE FLOW OF CASH INTO AND OUT OF FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The flow of money into mutual funds remains spotty, creating doubts about 
whether the stock and bond markets can do better in the second half of 1994 
than they have through the first months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a monthly report issued June 29, the Investment Company Institute said net 
cash flow into stock and bond funds combined was $9.5 billion, compared with 
$6.5 billion in April and $19.4 in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors still showed little enthusiasm for bond funds, which have been hit 
especially hard by rising interest rates since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The ICI, a Washington-based mutual fund trade group, reported that May 1994 
net cash flow into stock funds was $11.8 billion. Bond funds had a net outflow 
of $2.2 billion, on the heels of a $4.8 billion drain in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute defines net cash flow as sales of new fund shares, minus shares 
redeemed by investors, plus net money that comes into the funds through 
reinvestment of dividends and exchanges from one fund to another. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bond market has experienced a virtual evaporation of public demand for 
bond mutual funds," says Michael Metz, a chief investment strategist at the 
Wall Street firm of Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Metz observes in a report on potential market influences through 
the rest of the year, "equities have continued to benefit from the fact that 
flows into mutual funds are holding at high, although under-peak levels."

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: MIDYEAR INVESTMENT REVIEW AND OUTLOOK; 
REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS COULD SAVE YOU MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Delores G. had a sizable fortune after her husband died in the early 1980s. 
But within 10 years, more than half her $500,000 cash estate had been lost in a 
series of speculative investments and financial cons. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than blame the con men and promoters, Delores blames her losses on 
unreasonable expectations. She says she was a walking mark because she didn't 
know that "safe" investments don't promise double-digit returns in times of 
modest inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Delores fell into a common trap. There are millions of people like her who 
simply don't understand how to gauge realistic investment expectations, experts 
say. But gauging what's reasonable is easy. And it can save investors from 
costly mistakes and protect them from financial cons. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as many investors take a midyear look at their investments, they would be 
wise to consider whether their investment expectations are realistic in today's 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, you can gauge expectations by looking at rates paid on Treasury 
securities, says Mark W. Riepe, vice president of Ibbotson Associates, a 
Chicago-based investment consulting and data products firm. If your time frame 
is two years, consider what two-year Treasuries pay. Every percentage point 
above the Treasury yield is a step up in risk, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, if someone is promising a 20% return at a time when Treasuries 
are yielding 5%, you're taking a huge risk. However, if Treasuries are yielding 
15%, a promise of a 20% return might not be inherently dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 However, investors in stock and bond markets should realize that return 
expectations are long-term by nature. Those who expect to need their money in 
less than two years should either keep their investments in cash equivalents -- 
such as certificates of deposit and Treasury securities -- or recognize that 
they're speculating, says Neal Litvack, executive vice president of Fidelity 
Investments in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Over short periods, the only thing you can reasonably expect of stock or 
bond returns is that they'll fluctuate. Often they'll fluctuate wildly. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1981 and 1990, for example, the variation between the best and worst 
years in these markets was 37% for stocks and 44% for bonds, according to T. 
Rowe Price, a mutual fund company headquartered in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, if your time horizon is short, you should expect to earn 
modest returns -- a few percentage points over the rate of inflation -- in safe 
investments. Or, you can speculate, in which case you could make or lose a 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably, many investors have forgotten that it is risky to invest in these 
markets with a short-term horizon because the markets were unusually calm for 
more than a decade, says Richard Bernstein, manager of quantitative analysis at 
Merrill Lynch in New York. However, now the markets are "reverting to a more 
normal risk-reward relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: "If you want unusually high returns, you're going to have to give 
up sleeping at night," Bernstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're investing in bonds, you need to have at least a two-year time 
horizon, says Litvack. If you're investing in stocks, you should be committed 
to stick with it for at least five years, he says. Those with a long time frame 
can take a look at that investment category's history to determine what a 
reasonable rate of return should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1926, big-company stocks have earned an average compounded rate of 
return equal to 10.33%, according to Ibbotson. Over the same period, small 
company stocks gained 12.36%. Long-term government bonds earned 5.02%, Treasury 
bills averaged a 3.69% return, and inflation averaged 3.13%. 
</P>
<P>
 Because this period included such economically earth-shattering events as the 
Great Depression, World War II, the peak period for U.S. inflation and the "oil 
crisis," not to mention the Korean, Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars and periods 
of recession and expansion, it's safe to assume that these returns are 
reasonable through thick and thin. If there's a global nuclear war, of course, 
all bets are off. Otherwise, long-term investors can reasonably expect about a 
10% return in stocks and at least a 5% return on government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, to put it another way, you can expect to earn 7% to 8% over the rate of 
inflation when investing in stocks, and you can expect to earn 2% to 3% over 
the inflation rate when investing in U.S. government bonds, Riepe says. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics on international investing don't go back quite as far. However, 
Ibbotson has tracked global returns since the mid-1970s. Between 1975 and 1993, 
a diversified portfolio of international stocks returned 15.75%. A diversified 
portfolio of international bonds returned 12.48%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth noting, however, that U.S. inflation -- and U.S. investment returns 
-- were higher over this fairly short period than they were in the nearly 70 
years noted above. Since 1975, U.S. inflation averaged 5.53%, large-company 
stock returns averaged 14.21% and returns on U.S. government bonds averaged 
10.48%. 
</P>
<P>
 As for other investment categories: Tax-favored municipal bonds earned an 
average of 3.71% pretax over a 44-year period, according to T. Rowe Price. 
However, because U.S. tax rates dropped in the mid-1980s, returns on municipal 
bonds rose. During the 15-year period ended Dec. 31, municipal bond yields 
averaged 8.39%. 
</P>
<P>
 (Muni bond yields naturally go in the opposite direction of tax rates because 
investors buy them on the basis of after-tax returns. A 5% municipal bond has 
an after-tax return of roughly 7.1% when you're in the 30% tax bracket. 
However, when you're in the 70% tax bracket, the same bond boasts a 16.6% 
after-tax return. That's the amount you would have to earn on a taxable 
investment to have the same amount in your pocket from the tax-free 
investment.) 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate investment trusts, meanwhile, returned between 8.7% and 15.3% over 
the past 20 years, depending on the type of REIT.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: YOUR MONEY; OBEY IRS AND 'WASH SALE' CAN WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Q: I have invested a substantial amount in utility stocks, some of which are 
now selling for less than I paid for them. May I sell them, take the loss and 
then repurchase shares in the same company to restore my portfolio? Despite 
their current prices, I believe in their long-term outlook and like the 
dividends they pay. -- B.J.L .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your strategy can work if you obey the strict rules the Internal Revenue 
Service has established to regulate so-called wash sales. If you sell shares at 
a loss, the IRS requires that you not purchase new shares in that company 
within 30 days of the sale, before or after. If you do, the IRS will disallow 
your loss deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can live with the IRS rules, your plan can be a sound one. However, 
before you sell, be sure that the shares you want to repurchase are likely to 
be selling in the price range you want. Clearly, utility stocks have remained 
at or near their 52-week lows in recent months largely because they are 
interest-rate-sensitive and will drop at the first hint that rates are rising. 
If you think you have a 30-day window ahead, you can sell now and repurchase 
next month. As with most tax-avoidance schemes, this strategy works best for 
those in the highest tax brackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, remember that capital losses may offset capital gains up to just $3,000 
of ordinary income per year. Finally, before proceeding with your plan, pencil 
it all out -- including the brokerage commissions you will have to pay to buy 
and repurchase your shares. You should be absolutely sure that your plan is 
worth the effort. Take on Mother's Mortgage Payments 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My mother owns a house valued at $230,000 with a mortgage balance of about 
$100,000. She earns about $20,000 a year. I am single and earn about $50,000 a 
year, most of which ends up in Uncle Sam's pockets. My mother would like to 
give me the house and let me pay the mortgage and claim the deduction. She 
would continue to live there. Can this strategy work? -- B.W.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: You are not legally entitled to claim the mortgage interest deduction from 
your mother's home unless paying the mortgage is your responsibility. So the 
question is how to put the house in your name without triggering undesirable 
tax consequences for either of you. In addition, you must make sure that once 
you are paying the mortgage, you treat your interest in the home in such a 
fashion that the mortgage interest qualifies as a legitimate tax deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Gordon, a Palm Springs certified public accountant, suggests that your 
mother sell you half the home for $115,000. As payment, you would give your 
mother $15,000 and assume the $100,000 mortgage. If you move into the house, 
your mortgage interest would qualify as a deduction since the home is your 
primary residence. If you do not move in, you should consider the home your 
second residence because mortgage interest on second homes is also deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 Your mother would be liable for taxes on the gain from the sale of half the 
home, which would be computed by deducting her taxable basis from the $115,000 
she realized from the sale. However, if she is eligible and so desires, she 
could use her onetime, $125,000 exclusion on the sale profit, thus wiping out 
any tax obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, your mother could simply give you the house as a gift. But Gordon 
doesn't recommend this strategy for a variety of reasons. For starters, if it 
were simply given to you, the home would carry its original tax basis and thus 
expose you to a considerable tax obligation upon its sale. In addition, 
depending on the extent of your mother's assets, the gift could complicate your 
mother's estate planning efforts. Enrolling to Reinvest Your Stock Dividends 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I own shares in American Telephone & Telegraph that are held by my broker. 
May I participate in AT&T's dividend reinvestment program? If so, how do I go 
about enrolling? -- A.R.R . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your first step should be to contact your broker and have your shares 
issued directly to you. Unless the shares are held in your name, you cannot 
enroll in the dividend reinvestment plan. Once you have received your 
certificate of ownership, contact AT&T's transfer agent, First Chicago Trust, 
at (800) 348-8288. Representatives there will be able to help you enroll in the 
reinvestment program. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you join, your quarterly dividends will automatically be used to purchase 
additional shares of AT&T's stock at the stock's market price at the time of 
the dividend payment. Although you do not receive any cash, those dividend 
"payments" are considered taxable income to you and must be reported on your 
income tax filing.  
</P>
<P>
 The price at which your shares are purchased through the plan becomes your tax 
basis in the stock. The shares purchased through the plan are held by the 
company and may be sold by notifying the company of your intent.  
</P>
<P>
 By the way, if you choose, you may also purchase additional shares in AT&T, 
the nation's most widely held stock, directly from the company once the initial 
shares are issued in your name. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers who want to join a dividend reinvestment program with other companies 
-- or find out if a company offers one -- should contact the company's investor 
relations department for enrollment information.  
</P>
<P>
 For a full listing of companies offering dividend reinvestment plans, as well 
as a list of those offering discounts and optional cash purchases, consult the 
"Directory of Companies Offering Dividend Reinvestment Plans." This book might 
be available in your local library or from your stockbroker. Or you may 
purchase it directly from the publisher: Evergreen Enterprises, P.O. Box 763, 
Laurel, MD 20725-0763. The price is $30.95 with postage and handling.

 In her darkest moments last year, after getting laid off from a job as human 
resources administrator for Endevco Corp. in July, Susie Lewis often walked up 
and down the Laguna beach, trying to fight despair. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't easy. When she lost the job she had held for 4 1/2 years, Lewis also 
was on the verge of losing her 83-year-old mother in Denver to cancer. Lewis 
made five trips in her '89 Oldsmobile to Colorado to visit her mother last 
year. In between, she sent out nearly a dozen resumes and job letters each 
month. What she got back wasn't very encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like employers were just collecting resumes," said Lewis, who lives in 
Laguna Hills with her husband, an employee of a commercial real estate 
contracting firm in Irvine. "They weren't that serious." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Lewis resumed her job search this January, after a month off 
following her mother's death, she noticed a dramatic change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely saw an increase in job ads, and employers were more serious 
about interviewing," she said. "I got calls right away. I was quite surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 For each job, Lewis sent out detailed cover letters that started out with 
"Good Morning!" instead of the usual "Dear Sir or Dear Gentlemen." Lewis, who 
will only say that she is in her "mid-40s," listed her personal traits -- 
saying she was diligent and a good listener -- and she made sure there were no 
spelling errors. 
</P>
<P>
 In early March, Lewis got her break. She answered a newspaper ad seeking a 
human resources assistant at Viking Components Inc., a growing Laguna Hills 
maker of memory components for computers. After two interviews, Viking offered 
her the job. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening, Lewis says, she took her husband out to dinner at a fine 
restaurant on the Dana Point waterfront -- something she hadn't done in recent 
memory. The next day she went shopping for clothes for the new job. "Oh, yes! 
It felt great," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis says her starting salary at Viking is slightly less than the $33,000 she 
made at Endevco, an aerospace parts company in San Juan Capistrano. But she 
said the pay doesn't matter. "I knew when I interviewed that I wanted to be 
here," she said. "I'm with a company that's young and growing." 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's a new beginning. I feel like I've started over again." DON LEE

RECESSION FADING FOR O.C. JOBLESS; ECONOMY: MANY OF THE NEWLY HIRED ARE MAKING

HAZARDOUS WASTE CLEANUP TO CONTEND WITH.'

 Neeltje Mack didn't have to see a pink slip to know that her days were 
numbered -- she had been watching the ranks thin at TRW's space and electronics 
group in Redondo Beach for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd started laying off in my department," said the certified industrial 
hygienist, "so I knew it was just a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of waiting for the recession to push her onto the jobless rolls, Mack, 
37, decided to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 She took a personal inventory and decided that her background and training -- 
including graduate degrees in public health and occupational health and safety 
-- made her eminently marketable. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she assessed her profession and determined that numerous manufacturing 
companies were thinning their ranks and turning to outside consultants to 
provide their industrial health and safety needs, such as designing workplace 
safety programs and monitoring the workplace for toxic or hazardous materials. 
The growth, she decided, was in the environmental field. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the military base closures and federally mandated environmental 
cleanup programs, the military and other government agencies are looking 
actively at environmental remediation before they can turn their facilities 
over to the public," she said. "And on the commercial side, the aerospace 
industry downsizing means that lots of companies are closing facilities and 
have hazardous waste cleanup to contend with." 
</P>
<P>
 So, Mack says, she figured that "there are lots of projects out there, and 
lots of (job) prospects." 
</P>
<P>
 As is typical in white-collar circles, Mack's approach to job hunting was to 
"network" -- letting friends and acquaintances in her field know that she was 
interested in changing jobs and by attending seminars, meetings and workshops 
on environmental health and safety to meet new people and spread the word that 
she was looking. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack said she spent six months on an active job search and received leads on 
four prospective employers. She filed applications with two companies outside 
of California, but didn't look forward to relocating: her children are young 
enough to handle moving from Southern California without too much upset -- son 
Collin is 2 and daughter Marieke (the Dutch names stay on the distaff side of 
the family tree) is 5 -- but husband Jeffrey works as an aerospace industry 
manager in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack also applied at one other California company before landing an interview 
in March at Holmes & Narver, an Orange-based international engineering and 
construction services company that is expanding its environmental cleanup unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The company and Mack were an ideal fit, she says -- Holmes & Narver is going 
after the kind of work Mack is interested in, and her background and interests 
filed the company's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 So the industrial health and safety specialist turned in her resignation to 
TRW and on April 11 began as the certified industrial hygienist at Holmes & 
Narver. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the security of working in a growth industry for a change, Mack said 
her new job also boosted her salary -- she now makes "more than $70,000 a year" 
-- to reflect the higher level of work she's doing. JOHN O'DELL

 In the past few weeks, Gayle Gomez has hired 10 new employees at QLP Laminates 
Inc., a growing Orange County electronic components maker. 
</P>
<P>
 And she says she will soon be hiring a few more.While the local economy is 
just beginning to struggle out of a four-year recession, Anaheim-based QLP -- 
like many other Orange County businesses -- is gearing up to serve clients in 
other parts of the country: companies that began growing with the upturn in the 
national economy last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez herself is a beneficiary of QLP's expansion; she was hired by the 
company in November, a month after joining the ranks of Orange County's 
unemployed when she decided not to follow her previous employer when it moved 
to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I declined the opportunity to relocate," said Gomez, a Placentia resident 
whose husband is plant manager for a major electronic controls maker in Long 
Beach, "and we agreed that Oct. 15 would be my last day." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of her separation package, Gomez took a course to develop job-seeking 
skills. That knowledge helped her negotiate improved benefits with her new 
employer.

 With help from Catholic Charities, Binh Nguyen took a job last week packing 
containers of medicine into boxes at Merical Distributors in Anaheim, thus 
returning to the work force for the first time since he was laid off from 
McDonnell Douglas Aircraft in July, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, 46, says he's glad to be working again, especially since he recently 
exhausted his state unemployment benefits. "This is survival," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nguyen is hardly celebrating. Like other displaced union workers in 
manufacturing, he has had to accept much less than the $15 an hour he received 
as an electrician for McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new job, Nguyen earns $5 an hour and works a grueling 10-hour, four-day 
shift that brings him back to his Fountain Valley home well past 3 a.m. "I 
stand on my feet all night," he said, but with no resentment in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 The last two years have been an ordeal, Nguyen says, but he has not lost hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Through union-sponsored and federal retraining programs, Nguyen recently 
finished a seven-month course learning skills in graphic design and desktop 
publishing at Platt Collge in Newport Beach. He hopes soon to turn those skills 
into a new career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned fine art in Vietnam," Nguyen says. "I have creative skills," he 
adds, showing a black portfolio of restaurant menus, business pamphlets and 
other designs and sketches. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, his wife and their 19-year-old son came to California in 1985 from Ho 
Chi Minh City. In 1990, he was hired by McDonnell Douglas, where he was trained 
to be an aircraft electrician. But with low seniority, Nguyen was one of the 
first to be laid off when the aircraft maker cut back two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For a full year after the layoff, Nguyen searched for a high-paying job but 
could find nothing, he says. "First I looked for a job in the same position, 
but there were no more jobs in aerospace. I made a lot of calls, I went in 
person, I sent out resumes. I couldn't find anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen said he thinks companies are now hiring more workers. And he has new 
skills to offer. "If I have luck," he says, "maybe I can find a job in graphic 
design." DON LEE

RECESSION FADING FOR O.C. JOBLESS; ECONOMY: MANY OF THE NEWLY HIRED ARE MAKING

 When Anaheim-based QLP Laminates started expanding its payroll last month, one 
of the people hired was Virginia Barnes. The 42-year-old former aerospace 
worker says the job didn't come a moment too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd gotten so desperate I'd gone down and applied at the local Del Taco three 
weeks earlier," she said, "and they didn't call me back, either." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, who was making $14.42 an hour as a senior electronics assembler at 
Rockwell International Corp.'s defense plant in Anaheim when she was laid off 2 
1/2 years ago, said she has been struggling with rejection ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't help but think there's discrimination out there against people from 
aerospace because we made such good money," she says. "I think that when they 
saw my old pay on the application, it went right to the bottom of the stack, 
and that's not fair. I always put down that I was open about pay, I didn't 
expect to get $14 an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 The job she started on Tuesday -- running a machine that imprints circuit 
patterns on material used in the manufacture of circuit boards -- doesn't come 
close. "I get $7.20 an hour," Barnes said, "but it's better than standing on 
the freeway with a sign" pleading for food or money. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Buena Park resident, who moved with her husband and children to 
Riverside when he took a job at an aerospace plant there five years ago, said 
she drew $232 a week in unemployment benefits for the first six months after 
she was laid off. She also registered with several temporary agencies that sent 
her out as a minimum-wage replacement worker for one- and two-day jobs at 
assembly plants throughout the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Things got really tough in mid-1992 when her husband, Robert, was laid off, 
too.  
</P>
<P>
 Now he picks up an occasional day job through the same temporary agencies and 
spends the rest of the time poring over the "help wanted" sections of several 
newspapers looking for jobs that don't seem to be there yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes said she and her husband have managed to pay the $575 rent every month 
for their four-bedroom house in Riverside, and keep enough food on the table 
for themselves and the two children -- 14-year-old Jason and 15-year-old Tina 
-- who still live at home. (Two adult children -- Sherry, 23, and Robert Jr., 
21 -- have their own homes and families.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Virginia Barnes' car and Robert Barnes' pickup both are 16 years old "and 
we don't buy much new clothes or anything that isn't absolutely needed," she 
said. More than two years of unemployment, she said, has drained the family's 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes figures she filled out more than 70 job applications after being laid 
off and said that she was spending $100 a month or more on long-distance 
telephone calls as she followed up her applications with calls to personnel 
offices all over Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 From all that, she said, she was asked to come in to three interviews. "I 
never got a feeling for why they didn't want me, they never said, but I never 
got called back," Barnes said. "I just think it was because of my aerospace 
pay." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a week after applying at her neighborhood fast food place that Barnes 
saw QLP's ad for assembly workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drove into Anaheim that morning and filled out an application," she said. 
"And they called me three weeks later for an interview." 
</P>
<P>
 The phone rang again two days after that -- QLP calling to ask Barnes to come 
in for a physical. She was offered a job the next day, June 23, and started 
work last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real struggle," Barnes says. "I'm so happy that it's over. And I 
think it's starting to pick up for others, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that several friends who were laid off from Rockwell about the same 
time I was are finally going back to work, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Not in aerospace, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Barnes said. "In manufacturing, at a lot less pay, just like me." JOHN 
O'DELL

RECESSION FADING FOR O.C. JOBLESS; ECONOMY: MANY OF THE NEWLY HIRED ARE MAKING

 Travel agent Stephanie Pullen had one special reason for changing jobs last 
week: a big boost in pay. 
</P>
<P>
 For people like Pullen, the beginning of the economic recovery has opened 
doors to advance careers -- and salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Pullen, 28, began a job last week as an agent at Corporate Travel Unlimited in 
Dana Point. By changing jobs, Pullen boosted her salary by 20% -- about as much 
of an increase as she received during five years with her previous employer, 
Associated Travel Management in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's closer to home and money was quite a factor," says Pullen, who lives in 
Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 Pullen considers her new job to be the direct result of an improving business 
climate. "If the economy wasn't good, they wouldn't have been able to pay me 
what they did," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Pullen didn't go after a new job; it came to her by way of one of her former 
managers at Associated Travel, who had earlier left for Corporate Travel. When 
she asked Pullen to join her at a significant pay increase, Pullen said she 
could hardly ignore the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Pullen said that it wasn't an easy decision. She had a long history at 
Associated Travel, having started out as a part-time receptionist making about 
$6.50 an hour while she was studying psychology at Cal State Fullerton. She 
ended her college studies short of a degree and pursued a career as a corporate 
travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Pullen liked working for a big travel agency like Associated Travel. "They 
were able to train me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Pullen saw only modest incremental increases in her salary. 
And she knew a quick way to lift her pay was by changing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 At Corporate Travel Unlimited, a smaller agency with 10 employees, Pullen said 
she also sees the opportunity to become a supervisor or manager in the future 
as the agency grows. "I think I'll have a lot of opportunities here." DON LEE

RECESSION FADING FOR O.C. JOBLESS; ECONOMY: MANY OF THE NEWLY HIRED ARE MAKING

 Dick Hsu, general manager of Tustin Acura, believes he has ridden out Southern 
California's worst recession -- an economic downturn that has claimed 22% of 
the new car dealerships in Orange County over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hsu said that while things have been tough, he is seeing signs of recovery -- 
sales at his dealership in the Tustin Auto Center have picked up in recent 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 So sure is he that Orange County's economy is about to take off again that 
late last month Hsu added six new people to his sales staff -- three times the 
number he needs at current business levels. One of the trainees has already 
quit, but Hsu said he hired six figuring that one or two would drop out. 
</P>
<P>
 The five who remain all answered Hsu's newspaper ad for people interested in 
making career changes: Several said their desire to change was driven by the 
recession's impact on their old businesses, others said that they just needed 
to do something different. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is clear, though: all of them owe their new careers to Hsu's faith 
in a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Hsu's crew is a diverse bunch, including a former pro football player whose 
office cleaning business had shrunk in the recession and a 47-year-old mother 
of three who was regional sales representative for a major carpet manufacturer 
and got tired of trying to compete with much younger sales reps who are willing 
to work for much less money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest on the team is also the oldest hand in the auto business -- Linda 
Lee, 37, has worked at Tustin Acura for almost seven years in various clerical 
and support positions, most recently as a service department cashier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a dead-end job," she said, "and I had let people know that I was 
interested in a change, so when Dick decided to add to the sales staff, he knew 
I wanted to do something different and asked me if I wanted into the training 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee jumped at the chance. After a week of training and sales floor experience, 
she said she finds selling as enjoyable as she thought it would be, but more 
difficult, too, 
</P>
<P>
 "I like interacting with people, so talking to them and helping them is fun," 
she said. "But finalizing the sale," the part of the deal when both sides 
buckle down to negotiations, "that's harder than I thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Lee and the others, Dave Cochems, a 42-year-old former mortgage broker 
from Brea, said shifting to a sales career doesn't put him off because he 
enjoys working with people. And there is a degree of prestige associated with 
selling high-end cars like the Honda-built Acura, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochems said he would like to use his sales job as a stepping stone into the 
finance department and then into management. His 20-year career as a 
self-employed mortgage broker should help in all three areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He made the change from running his own business to selling cars on commission 
because the recession was wreaking havoc with the mortgage business. "I saw the 
writing on the wall. The economic situation was making things tougher and 
tougher and I just decided that I needed a change." He said his wife, Susan, 
and three sons are supportive of his career switch. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Riley still operates his own business, but the Irvine resident's 
custodial company that cleaned commercial buildings dwindled in recent years 
from 15 employees to two full timers and two part timers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41-year-old former Minnesota Vikings tackle (the USC grad was Minnesota's 
first-round draft choice in 1974 and was on the team through the 1984 season) 
says he ran up against a pair of obstacles he couldn't knock down -- the 
debilitating impact the recession has had on anything connected with real 
estate, and the huge demands on his time from running a business with 15 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 So he said he trimmed it down to its present size and went looking for 
something that would let him use his people skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Hsu's call for people interested in the car business as a mid-life career 
change caught his eye, Riley said, "because I liked the idea of having a good 
product to work with and of being able to work with people one-on-one," 
something he didn't get to do much of in his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I really like that it's local," said Riley. He wasn't looking forward to 
a commute that took much time away from his family life -- he and his wife, 
Jan, have four daughters, ranging in age from 4 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin M. Saporito brought a strong sales background with her when she answered 
Hsu's ad. She was one of 60 people who responded in three days, Hsu said, 
adding that he was "amazed at the quality of people who applied." 
</P>
<P>
 Saporito, 47, was working as Southern California territory manager for a 
carpet manufacturer after having been a part owner of a retail carpeting store. 
She quit the sales job in early June because she felt the East Coast 
manufacturer she worked for wasn't paying sufficient attention to the 
California market. 
</P>
<P>
 And, she candidly acknowledges, she didn't look for another carpet industry 
job because "I didn't feel I fit anymore" in a business where "all the sales 
reps look like 24-year-old male models and will work for $24,000 a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Saporito said she "really likes cars, the look and the style of them. I had 
been thinking about trying car sales for several months" before quitting the 
carpet sales job, "and I'd even talked to several other dealers, but I didn't 
like the atmosphere or the attitude at their places." 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, it exceeds my expectations . . . and I get no grief from anyone for 
being a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 The senior member of the trainee team, a 61-year-old former computer company 
vice president who was let go in a merger, wasn't available to be interviewed. 
His strong sales background was a big plus, said Hsu. 
</P>
<P>
 Hsu said that he is very happy with the five trainees and with his decision to 
go a bit outside the mainstream to find them. "The market is changing and 
customers want a more hassle-free environment," he said.

 As the economy comes back, the auto dealers who make the most of the recovery 
are going to be those who stress service and "relationship selling," Hsu said, 
adding that he was able to find good candidates for his program in part because 
so many highly qualified people had been set adrift in the recession and are 
considering new careers. JOHN O'DELL

POP MUSIC: TAKING STOCK OF A GRIM YEAR IN ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kurt Cobain's suicide last April tore the heart out of contemporary rock 'n' 
roll in ways that haven't begun to be repaired. One life does make a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Inch Nails and Hole delivered terrific, four-star albums during the last 
six months, but neither they nor any other release has filled the emotional 
void. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the alienation and anger in Cobain's music, Nirvana's records offered 
a sense of celebration and hope -- even if those qualities weren't strong 
enough in Cobain's own life to eventually save him. 
</P>
<P>
 With Nine Inch Nails, Trent Reznor makes music that is largely without hope -- 
an examination of despair that starts where Cobain left off. If Cobain were 
still alive to balance Nails with his more uplifting music, Reznor's journey 
into the darkness would have been compelling enough to reach a wider audience. 
The album, a masterpiece of the genre titled "The Downward Spiral," should have 
been a runaway hit. 
</P>
<P>
 With Cobain's death, however, the record became almost unlistenable. It 
remains an absorbing work, but this is a time when even the most hard-boiled 
fan wants some comfort -- and it's not surprising that the Nine Inch Nails 
album has spiraled rapidly down the charts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hole, the Seattle quartet led by Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, has run into a 
different problem. Because she was known outside the rock underground more as 
the notorious Mrs. Cobain than as the major talent she is, the new album was 
viewed with suspicion by much of the rock public. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Hole's record company, DGC, was powerless to promote the album, 
"Live Through This," because it would have smacked of exploitation. Love was 
also in no condition to tour, so the band was not able to state its own case 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 Hole was dealt yet another blow last month with the death of bassist Kristen 
Pfaff. After just two months, the album is out of the Top 100 on the nation's 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
 While the following albums stand as the 10 best works so far this year, it may 
be several more months before any album (Pearl Jam? Neil Young? R.E.M.?) 
rekindles the spark and finally helps remove the black armband that continues 
to surround contemporary rock. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 1 Nine Inch Nails, "The Downward Spiral," (Nothing/ TVT/Interscope). Trent 
Reznor explores human emptiness and despair with chilling fearlessness in this 
landmark collection. "I am the pusher, I am the whore . . . I am the need you 
have for more," he snarls in one especially sobering passage that focuses on 
contemporary obsessions and addictions. Rather than a celebration or acceptance 
of nihilism or decadence, the album stands as an anguished cry for something to 
believe in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 2 Hole, "Live Through This," (DGC). This album virtually gallops with 
imagination and spirit -- a work that combines in its best moments the rock 
self-affirmation of Patti Smith with the intimacy and candor of Leonard Cohen. 
Though far more accessible musically than the band's 1992 indie debut, Hole has 
sacrificed none of its individuality or bite. Love's voice and words fluctuate 
between abrasive and caressing as she explores both matters of personal 
commitment and private doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 3 Pavement, "Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain," (Matador). There are dangers when a 
band reminds you of too many influences (think Counting Crows), so it may be 
waving a red flag to suggest that Pavement offers echoes of everyone from Lou 
Reed and Gram Parsons to Elliott Murphy and Thurston Moore. Yet Pavement 
doesn't use the influences to prop up its music. The tracks here assert a 
convincing sense of genuine youthful optimism and discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 4 Bikini Kill, "Pussy Whipped," (Kill Rock Stars). Anarchy for the Northwest? 
This Olympia, Wash., band, with its punk defiance and feminist declarations, 
recalls the revolutionary command of the Sex Pistols. Like that classic British 
band, Bikini Kill brings together two seemingly contradictory elements (pure 
sonic rawness and songwriting savvy). The result is music that seems 
inaccessible on first listening, but ends up sticking with you like the 
Pistols' best. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 5 Beastie Boys, "Ill Communication," (Capitol). Eight years after proving in 
"Licensed to Ill" that white boys can rap, the Beasties -- who combine a sort 
of Three Stooges goofiness with streetwise hip-hop resolve -- return with 
another extraordinary party record. The heart of the sound is in the 
irresistible beats, but the talk is fun, too, touching on everything from music 
(Lee Dorsey and Bob Marley) to hoops (Bobby Knight and Anthony Mason) without 
missing a step. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 6 Sonic Youth, "Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star," (DGC). The problem 
with some acclaimed veterans (dare we say Elvis Costello?) is their work begins 
sounding labored, as if making music has become a responsibility. The wonder of 
these acclaimed veterans is they still make music that is joyful and alert. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 7 Beck, "Mellow Gold," (DGC). "I'm a loser, baby / So why don't you kill me" 
is as inspired a snarl for the '90s as Dylan's "Like a rolling stone" chorus 
was for the restless '60s -- all the better because Beck's line can mean 
anything to anybody. The rest of the folk/hip-hop union is no "Blonde on 
Blonde," but Beck has a quirky, questioning intelligence and spunk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 8 Johnny Cash, "American Recordings," (American). One of the cornerstones of 
modern pop music steps back into the creative forefront with an album that is 
as simple (just voice and guitar) as it is affecting -- tales of sin and 
redemption delivered with the intimacy and urgency of someone who has learned 
his lessons well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 9 The Auteurs, "Now I'm a Cowboy," (Virgin). Luke Haines, the suffering poet 
who guides this English outfit, writes about desire and doubts and bizarre 
relationships with the kind of sweeping sentimentality and awe that has been 
absent from the heart of rock since Bowie did it in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 10 Latin Playboys, "Latin Playboys," (Slash/Warner Bros.). Los Lobos' Louie 
Perez and David Hidalgo join with Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake for more of 
the experimental World Beat sounds that made "Kiko" such a soulful and spirited 
work. The tone is primarily playful and relaxed.

THEY WERE ONLY CHILDREN; THE VIOLENCE RECOUNTED IN AN ARKANSAS STUDENT'S MEMOIR 
IS AN EYE-OPENER; WARRIORS DON'T CRY: A SEARING MEMOIR OF THE BATTLE TO 
INTEGRATE LITTLE ROCK'S CENTRAL HIGH, BY MELBA PATTILLO BEALS (POCKET BOOKS: 
$22; 312 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jervey Tervalon, Jervey Tervalon is the author of Understand This, a novel 
set in South-Central L.A. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the first day of class in the fall of 1957, in Little Rock, Ark., a mob 
bent on preventing nine black students from entering Central High School chased 
the new students to the principal's office. There the children heard their life 
being debated between two sheriffs: 
</P>
<P>
 "What are we gonna do about the nigger children?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowd is moving fast. They've broken the barricades. These kids are 
trapped in here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Good lord, you're right," another voice said. "We may have to let the mob 
have one of these kids so we can distract them long enough to get the others 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let one of those kids hang? How's that gonna look? Niggers or not, they're 
children and we got a job to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the kids were saved and lived to fear for their lives for the 
duration of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Melba Pattillo Beals' memoir of integrating Little Rock's Central High School, 
"Warriors Don't Cry," is a painful but important document that shows how 
difficult the path of racial integration has been for this country and, more 
important, how high the price has been for families in the vanguard of the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The memoir starts with Melba's return to Central High after a 30-year absence 
to be reunited with her fellow Little Rock warriors of integration as honored 
guests of then-Gov. Bill Clinton. The bitter memories of her year at Central 
High hadn't been numbed even after years of progress on the racial front. 
</P>
<P>
 But how could they be numbed? What Beals had experienced as a child was one 
step from ethnic cleansing. It seemed that what kept her and her fellow black 
students from being lynched that very first day of classes at Central High was 
sheer luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the yearlong nightmare of integrating Central High commenced, life 
in Little Rock was far from a picnic for the black community. Beals had a 
healthy fear of whites and of the harm that was often inflicted on her family 
and community by them. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I was 3 years old I was already so afraid of white people that 
when my red-haired, white-skinned cousin came to baby-sit, I hid beneath 
mother's bed." And though Beals' childhood is filled with such memories, she 
and her family show Gandhi-like resilience and self-control in the face of 
vicious, racist treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The comparison to Gandhi is more than coincidence. Beals' grandmother, India, 
is a follower of Gandhi's teachings and impressed upon her granddaughter the 
importance and need for personal sacrifice to accomplish even modest social 
change; this willingness to sacrifice is a major theme of the book. Beals is in 
every sense a nonviolent warrior of integration. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the 10th day, their nonstop torture made me feel as if I were losing my 
mind. I had to keep telling myself what Grandma said: I couldn't lose my mind 
because God is my mind. Still, I imagined I had one of those machine guns 
television gangsters use. I would fire round after round . . . to clear my 
thoughts. I would have to do more prayer for them and for me. I know guns were 
forbidden even in my thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly at times it seems as if Beals was more frightened of disappointing her 
grandmother than of the wrath of the racists of Little Rock. Interestingly 
enough, though the grandmother encouraged Beals to follow Gandhi's example, she 
herself slept nights by the front window, shotgun in hand, ready to defend her 
sleeping family from midnight marauders. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the love of her grandma and mother, the lack of support from her 
father is hardly felt. It also helps that Melba Beals' mother is a teacher and 
makes enough of a salary so that when the girl's father runs in to voice his 
disapproval of the integration effort (and disappears again), it has no 
apparent affect on the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the backing of Beals' family and as much encouragement and logistic 
support as she receives from the NAACP and the churches, it is astonishing that 
the mother and grandmother would consent to send their daughter to such a 
hellish year at Central High. As the book is constructed, vivid first-person 
recollections of torture and diary entries of a young girl tested to a degree 
no adult should be, it stands on its own, a testament to sacrifice and 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet I want to know more. I want to know exactly what the mother and 
grandmother were thinking. Were they willing to lose their child for racial 
progress? Even years after having weathered what must have been one of the 
worst experiences of her life, Beals still admits to being influenced by what 
happened at Central High. When she married, she chose a white military man -- a 
protector who, she says, seems much like Johnny Black, the soldier from the 
101st Airborne, her bodyguard who made those first few months bearable. When 
Johnny Black was called away, it almost broke her spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the memoir she presents a surprising bit of information. One 
white student, Link, took it upon himself to protect her and save her from 
further pain at the hands of his classmates; he may even have saved her life. 
He did these acts grudgingly, however, and Beals was so uncertain of his 
motivations that she feared he was plotting to betray her. Only years later did 
she understand him: 
</P>
<P>
 "Until my marriage, I had been hearing from my old friend Link, living in 
faraway places as he piled up awards and degrees. . . . He was livid about my 
marriage, saying I'd all along told him we couldn't date because he was white, 
and now look what I'd gone and done. I never heard from him again." I was 
surprised to be told only as a kind of afterthought that Link was romantically 
interested in her. 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, I wanted more self-reflection from Beals: more than the four- or 
five-page summation of the rest of her life, less of the daily account of the 
cruelty inflicted upon her. It's as though Beals felt the impact of the events 
after that hellish year weren't worth exploring at greater length. But even so, 
her memoir is a compelling and memorable one. I am amazed at what she endured 
and sacrificed to further integration and the cause of civil rights.

WORLD CUP USA '94; UNFORGIVABLE; THE MURDER OF COLOMBIA'S ANDRES ESCOBAR AFTER 
HIS OWN GOAL AGAINST THE UNITED STATES UNDERLINES THE FACT THAT SOCCER FANS CAN 
BE DEADLY SERIOUS ABOUT THEIR GAME; PLAYERS STUNNED AS PALL SETTLES OVER 
SOCCER'S SHOWCASE 
</P>

<P>
 Andres Escobar could have been here this weekend instead of in his violent 
hometown of Medellin, Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular soccer player, who was murdered early Saturday, was asked to be a 
color commentator for Carcol radio, Colombia's premier network, after his team 
failed to advance to the second round of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar would have been in Carcol's cramped quarters at the International 
Broadcast Center in Dallas, where thousands of commentators are covering the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We invited him to stay," said Gusta Pombo, a network executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar considered the assignment but decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'No, I want to go back home,' " Pombo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar, who deflected the ball into his goal in a 2-1 loss to the United 
States on June 22 at the Rose Bowl, was shot 12 times outside a restaurant in 
Medellin in retribution for the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Escobar, 27, left America, his parents stayed on to vacation in the 
southwest. They were in Nevada when the incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar's death was the latest episode to cast a pall over the first World Cup 
in the United States. Two days earlier, Diego Maradona, one of the sport's top 
stars, was suspended by the Argentina Football Federation after testing 
positive for banned stimulants. 
</P>
<P>
 What was an almost universal celebration of soccer for the past two weeks 
became a day of mourning as the second round began in Chicago and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of Escobar's murder filtered through the RFK Stadium crowd and the locker 
rooms, intensifying in an official moment of silence before the 
Spain-Switzerland game. 
</P>
<P>
 A Colombian television crew abandoned its gear and wandered aimlessly through 
the press center outside the stadium, its appetite for soccer suddenly gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just found out and I am speechless," producer Marden David said. "He was 27 
and we were friends since he was 19. Andres was the nicest, most decent man on 
the team, and the most disciplined; the last one you'd think could be. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Blatter, general secretary of FIFA, soccer's governing body, said it 
was the saddest day he has seen in soccer, beyond violence in the stands or 
hooliganism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The popularity of our game has two faces," he said. "The first face produces 
joy and enthusiasm and brings people together as we have witnessed at the World 
Cup here. On the other face, the game mirrors our life. It has violence, tears, 
corruption. Like life, it has all its problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murders happen everywhere, every hour of the day. It is a reality." 
</P>
<P>
 But the timing has made it doubly difficult for FIFA officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like somebody does not like the success of the World Cup," Blatter said. 
"I don't know who to blame. But the two cases we have had in 48 hours -- it's 
hard to digest for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The incidents also have been an emotional drain for World Cup organizers from 
the United States. After piquing the American public's interest beyond their 
wildest imaginations, the organizers were disheartened by Saturday's news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a blatant criminal act," said Jim Trecker, World Cup USA spokesman. 
"It's deplorable." 
</P>
<P>
 But he does not believe Escobar's murder and Maradona's departure will take 
away from the tournament, which ends July 17 at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people are clearly smitten with soccer," Trecker said. "It's a 
pity some off-the-field tragedies . . . can divert interest in this event for a 
minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Those involved in the game spoke out against the violence in Colombia that has 
affected its soccer team, including a death threat sent to midfielder Gabriel 
Gomez in Fullerton during the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland Coach Jack Charlton said he might give Escobar's family the money 
collected by Irish fans to help pay a fine assessed against him for sideline 
outbursts during a match against Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who wants to play international football if you get assassinated doing it?" 
he asked. "It's a dreadful thing, just dreadful." 
</P>
<P>
 Players and coaches said soccer's atmosphere, the passion that is often 
associated with the sport, has its limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible to have someone killed because of a game," Swiss goalkeeper 
Marco Pascolo said after his team's 3-0 loss. "Even for us it's going to be 
tough to go home. There are a lot of regrets," 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer violence is common in countries where it is the dominant sport, but 
usually as collective acts by packs of fans against one another or property. 
</P>
<P>
 Attacks against individual players are rare, but all players know to keep 
clear of outraged fans, and Escobar's murder left some players pensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is despicable, an outrage; people should realize it is only a game," 
Spanish player Abelardo Fernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brazil's coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira: "We've got to start 
understanding that this is a game, not a war, and that all these crazy 
nationalistic feelings, while fine up to a point, have gone too far." 
</P>
<P>
 An own goal like the one Escobar scored is every defender's worst nightmare -- 
but sooner or later it happens to every defender. 
</P>
<P>
 "The murder has had a very profound impact on all of us," Spanish defender 
Francisco Camarasa said. "We are still in shock. We didn't know Escobar 
personally, but he was of our world. His loss hurts us all." 
</P>
<P>
 Blatter said FIFA is helpless to stop such situations. When asked recently 
about the death threats against Gomez, Blatter said it was not up to FIFA to 
respond, but rather to local police. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jorge Solari, an Argentine who coaches Saudi Arabia, called on FIFA to to 
ensure such tragedies are stopped. He said an organization is needed to address 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get upset during the game, but after the game, it's over," he said. "It's 
impossible for me to understand that a guy was killed because of a defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew Escobar said he was nice man, who was respected for his fair 
play. He had a middle-class upbringing in Medellin, and was well known 
throughout the country because of soccer and television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no American parallel to the vitriol, and Switzerland Coach Roy 
Hodgson, a transplanted Englishman, believes that the media must bear part of 
the blame if verbal violence escalated tragically into the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed at the murder but not surprised. Maybe it will make 
journalists stop and think about what they write," Hodgson said. "Swiss 
journalists destroyed the career of one of our players because of an own goal. 
Killing a career and killing a person. . . . Maybe the next time journalists 
will stop and think before they write things like: 'He disgraced his country. . 
. . He should be shot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The murder pierces the heart of Colombians, who hoped an extraordinary World 
Cup performance would erase some of the negative perceptions of a country 
struggling with drug lords. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole country pays for it," said Pombo, the radio executive. "It's a 
great shock. Nobody could imagine this." 
</P>
<P>
 Some could. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Colombia, anything can happen," Blatter said. 
</P>
