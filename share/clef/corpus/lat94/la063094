SCOTT HARRIS: CAN HISTORY BE DISNEYFIED AND DIGNIFIED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a boy, Oswald Robinson worked the family farm here. It was land where the 
spent ammunition of Union and Confederate infantry was as common as rock. Often 
he'd find old cannonballs and artillery shells; sometimes the plow would turn 
up the bones of the dead. These would have been the Union men, probably, who by 
virtue of their defeat had been buried where they fell. 
</P>
<P>
 The custom was to rebury remains in Groveton Cemetery. But sometimes the 
mischievous Oswald would frighten younger children with a soldier's skull. "I 
was 12 or 13, just old enough to be a devil," he says. "When my mother found 
out, she tanned my hide." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Robinson, 84 now, lives in my Aunt Jack's neighborhood on the western edge 
of the Manassas National Battlefield Park. In the first battle of Manassas -- 
what Yankees call Bull Run -- the old Robinson home, the home where Mr. 
Robinson's grandfather was reared, served as Gen. Sigel's headquarters. In the 
second battle a year later, it did duty as a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Robinson understands that history has a way of being revised, as when they 
moved the marker signifying where Gen. Thomas (Stonewall) Jackson earned his 
famous nickname. Now there are fears that history won't just be revised, but 
commercialized, merchandised and trivialized. This time, the invaders are 
coming from the West -- from Burbank, to be precise. And they're wearing mouse 
ears. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the "mouse ears" crack is a cheap shot. It's almost too easy to 
satirize the Walt Disney Co. and its plans for its fifth theme park, the third 
in these United States. By now, you've probably heard of "Disney's America" and 
the new battle it has sparked in a region that many Americans consider sacred. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, it's hard not to admire Disney's acumen. In Anaheim and Orlando, the 
company had to create a tourist destination from scratch. Here, they are 
grafting an amusement park within an hour's drive of Washington, already a 
family vacation spot. And, as in California, tax dollars are paying for roads 
and utilities to support the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the surroundings, Disney's America intends to evoke American 
heritage with shows, displays and rides. One Disney official actually was 
quoted as saying the park will be so historically true that it will really make 
visitors "feel what it's like to be a slave." If there's a "Roller Coaster of 
American History," it should be a hell of a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, historians such as C. Vann Woodward and James McPherson are fearing 
the worst. It is not hard to imagine Disney, as the novelist Shelby Foote 
suggests, treating America's past the way it treats nature. Disney says don't 
worry -- the park will educate America's youth. "Lion King" dolls are cuddly; 
real lions have a bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's opponents persuaded a Senate subcommittee last week to hold a hearing 
on the project's potential impact on the Manassas battlefield. Historian David 
McCullough may have been eloquent in stating the case against Disney. But 
Virginia Gov. George Allen, whose football coach father famously preached that 
"the future is now," made it clear that the state's power structure wants 
Disney in its future. It all looked very, very much like a done deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If that's the case, my Aunt Jack will be disappointed. She is 77 -- old enough 
to remember at least one elderly Confederate veteran in our family. My 
great-great- uncle, it seems, lost a few fingers at Manassas. When I called on 
Aunt Jack, she insisted I meet Mr. Robinson, who proved more edifying than any 
government hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Robinson claims a heritage of both Southern aristocracy and the people 
they enslaved. His great-grandfather, "Gentleman Jim" Robinson, was the son of 
a plantation owner and a slave woman. His father granted Gentleman Jim his 
freedom and some property, but it was up to him to purchase his wife and four 
of six children out of slavery. Two sons, it seems, had the misfortune of being 
trained as stone masons; Gentleman Jim could not afford the price. 
</P>
<P>
 The legacy of such history was 100 years of lawful segregation and the 
inequities and strife that remain. If the Civil War seems musty, consider that 
Fairfax County, Va., didn't integrate its schools until 1965. Mr. Robinson was 
the principal at the only black school that enrolled white students; the others 
were turned into warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Can such history be both Disneyfied and dignified? Mr. Robinson wants no part 
of that fight, but of this much he is sure: "They will slant it in a direction 
that will be to their profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Robinson suggests that those who tamper with history may pay a price. 
Once, he explains, Stonewall's marker was on Gentleman Jim's old property. 
Later, it was decided that Stonewall really made his stand on a neighboring 
farm. A statue was erected on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Mr. Robinson says, Stonewall has been struck twice by lightning.

A NEEDED MEASURE OF INSULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 White House aides estimate that President Clinton is facing huge legal fees, 
up to a staggering $2 million a year. These costs dwarf the chief executive's 
annual salary of $200,000 and exceed even the Clinton family's reported net 
worth of about $1.6 million. The Clintons, in short, could confront bankruptcy 
as they defend themselves against charges arising from allegations that predate 
the 1992 election. It's for this reason that they are seeking donations to a 
legal defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
 No sitting President has ever done this. Members of Congress do, however, 
allow themselves legal defense funds, with the House setting contribution 
limits of $5,000 and the Senate $10,000. The Clinton fund will accept donations 
of up to $1,000 a year only from individuals, and donors' names will be made 
public every six months. We have no problem with that. We do, however, strongly 
oppose one option the fund's trustees are said to be exploring. There should be 
no direct mail or telephone solicitation of funds, for such an approach could 
too readily be seen as exerting pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons' legal bills have two sources. One is the Whitewater inquiry, in 
which they have had to hire lawyers because of the federal investigation into 
possible wrongdoing involving a real estate deal the Clintons participated in 
when he was governor of Arkansas. The second is the federal suit filed in 
Little Rock by Paula Corbin Jones, who alleges that in 1991 then-Gov. Clinton 
made a sexual proposal to her that caused her emotional distress and violated 
her civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's lawyer has asked the judge in that case to rule that a President 
should enjoy immunity from civil suits arising out of alleged actions that 
occurred before he took office, with the immunity to end as soon his term of 
office expires. We support that request. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, President or otherwise, is above the law. What concerns us is that the 
Jones suit or others like it that might be filed could be an instance where the 
law is used not only for its intended purpose of seeking justice but, 
deliberately or not, as an instrument that could so distract the President from 
his official duties as to threaten his essential national leadership. Temporary 
insulation from such a contingency would not do harm to the processes of 
justice. But it would protect the institution of the presidency, and that we 
think is in the nation's interest.

THOSE IOUS ARE LIKE SOS SIGNALS; IS CALIFORNIA FACING A REPEAT OF 1992 DEBACLE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the eve of California's new fiscal year, another budget crisis looms. 
Unless it is resolved in time, the state faces the grim prospect of repeating 
the debacle of 1992: having to issue IOUs to pay state bills. Using scrip just 
once caused financial havoc; to do so again would court disaster, spooking Wall 
Street when California needs a record $7 billion in short-term financing. 
</P>
<P>
 More IOUs would increase the fear and loathing already growing within 
investors contemplating the state's budgetary uncertainties. Avoiding another 
spectacle of fiscal and political irresponsibility clearly is in California's 
long-term interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Crucial to Wall Street's assessment of state accountability is whether 
Sacramento provides a standby plan in the budget to ensure that money is 
available to pay back what is borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature currently is struggling to come to some agreement on Gov. Pete 
Wilson's proposed two-year, $57.3-billion budget, which includes a wide range 
of spending cuts. The lawmakers and Wilson have to work out a plan that would 
trigger additional, automatic budget cuts if the state's fiscal condition 
worsened after a budget was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 That standby plan is central to the state's borrowing of the $7 billion in 
short-term money. To assure investors that the debt will be repaid, California 
is trying to buy credit insurance from a group of banks. The banks, in turn, 
are seeking assurance of the state's ability to make good on its obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 A standby plan may help get California through the current crisis but could 
create bigger long-term problems should fiscal conditions trigger more spending 
cuts. Much of the budget problem has to do with paying for the $3-billion 
deficit accumulated over the last three years. The state keeps borrowing to pay 
loans on the deficit, draining the general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unrealistic to expect the deficit to be paid off within two years, 
especially with a budget that relies on federal funds -- $2.8 billion to 
reimburse the state for costs associated with illegal immigrants. There is 
little chance of that much federal money appearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Other states have faced similar deficits and found long-term solutions 
separate from their state budgets. Massachusetts and Connecticut, for example, 
have issued bonds dedicated to paying off deficits. California operates under 
legal constraints that would make it difficult to issue similar bonds without 
voter approval, but it is noteworthy that Louisiana and New York have created 
new agencies to help fund their deficits. Similar bold alternative solutions 
must be explored to find ways for California to pay down its deficit. The IOU 
route must be avoided at all costs.

SEEKING A CLEAN, CLEAR LINE; JUSTICES RIGHTLY RULE AGAINST SCHOOL, BUT 
CHURCH-STATE ISSUES REMAIN FOGGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court reached the only defensible decision it could Monday 
when it ruled that creation of a school district specifically for a religious 
group violates the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 This closely watched case involved the Village of Kiryas Joel, north of New 
York City. Village residents are almost all members of the Satmar Hasidic sect 
of Judaism. Most of the children attend religious schools that do not offer the 
special services to which handicapped students are legally entitled. 
</P>
<P>
 Handicapped Satmar children had attended a public special-needs school nearby, 
but parents complained that their children were uncomfortable there because of 
their beliefs, special dress and use of the Yiddish language.  
</P>
<P>
 The parents wanted their own district largely so their handicapped children 
could be schooled in their own community. In 1989, the New York Legislature 
created a school district at Kiryas Joel. In signing the bill, Gov. Mario Cuomo 
noted the district's religious makeup and said that the bill was a "good-faith 
effort to solve the unique problem" associated with providing special education 
services to Satmar children. The high court disagreed. The village district has 
authority to establish a full range of elementary and secondary schools, but it 
instead runs a special education program for just 40 Hasidic children. 
</P>
<P>
 That special-needs school does not teach religion; that was not the issue. 
Rather, by a 6-to-3 majority the court held that when the New York Legislature 
drew political boundaries deliberately along religious lines, a "fusion of 
governmental and religious functions" occurred. Thus the school district was a 
form of "explicit religious gerrymandering," unconstitutional under the First 
Amendment's bar against government's establishment of religion. 
</P>
<P>
 The five concurring majority opinions reveal a court still uncertain about 
where and how to separate church and state. But the Kiryas Joel case 
nonetheless underscores the majority's welcome appreciation that this court 
needs to clarify the lines it has drawn in recent years in this crucial and 
emotional matter.

WELFARE WATCH; FINGERING FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Welfare cheaters have never been as prevalent as political demagogues claim, 
but there is no doubt that some exist. Los Angeles and Orange counties are 
about to team up to crack down on such fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to spend nearly $1.3 
million to fingerprint applicants for general relief, a program with 3,600 
beneficiaries, most of them single men. Officials said they expected the 
anti-fraud operation to pay for itself in less than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Los Angeles County's Public Social Services Department claim 
their anti-fraud program has saved millions of dollars since it began three 
years ago. Orange County will "piggyback" onto the computer system in Los 
Angeles, checking fingerprints to ensure applicants are not collecting payments 
in both counties. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a good example of regional cooperation, but officials must show that 
there is indeed enough fraud to make fingerprinting cost-effective. They must 
also keep the emphasis on programs to get poor people off welfare altogether 
and onto the employment rolls through programs like California's Greater 
Avenues to Independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County has begun a three-year pilot program to fingerprint parents 
receiving money from the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, and 
Orange County officials said if it proves itself they will follow suit. That is 
wise. Crackdowns on fraud should not stigmatize all those on welfare. But if 
clamping down on cheaters frees up more money for the truly needy, the programs 
will be worth it.

LEGAL STRATEGY IN SIMPSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Poor, poor (Dist. Atty.) Gil Garcetti -- not only does he have the Menendez 
brothers debacle and the unresolved Michael Jackson case to contend with, but 
now he is saddled, without grand jury assistance ("Judge, in Stunning Move, 
Voids Grand Jury Probe of Simpson," June 25), with O.J. Simpson, accused 
murderer and convicted wife beater, to prosecute, along with O.J.'s boyhood 
friend and chauffeur. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti fell into a trap that he should have foreseen by not taking steps 
that would have prevented the use of the 911 tapes and the media to try and 
mold public opinion against Simpson prior to his indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is certainly entitled to a presumption of innocence, but it is only 
we, the public and our criminal justice system, that will suffer if Simpson's 
"high-priced" legal talent prevents a fair trial of the murder charges against 
him. 
</P>

Ron Goldman, the suspected guilt of O.J. Simpson, and the broader theme of 
domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, here comes F. Lee Bailey on every TV show imaginable for two days 
straight, doing his spin and setting a carefully crafted pitch in defense of 
his client and no one complains (June 27). 
</P>
<P>
 What's wrong for the prosecution should be wrong for the defense; what's fair 
for one should be fair for the other.

 * After reading your Column One piece, "The Team Defense: Strength in

now gone the way of so many institutions -- to the moneyed. Now, with enough 
financial resources, anyone can buy a place in Congress, be considered as a 
major candidate for President, or another office one might choose, and buy 
light punishment for a heinous crime. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no longer a matter of guilt or innocence, but what priced legal counsel 
you can afford. Imagine if we gave indigent defendants the same kind of legal 
advantage that the rich can buy. 
</P>
<P>
 How can we justify an attack on crime without including those in power? They 
deserve the same justice as the ghetto youths who kill because we can't afford 
programs to divert their energy into productive activities. 
</P>
<P>
 How far do we have to stray from the American ideal before we get back on 
track?

 * I watch in utter disbelief at the circus that passes for media coverage in 
the Simpson ordeal. What disturbs me the most is the single-minded coverage on 
the prosecution and defenses "strategies." Strategies designed to play the 
media for the dupes they are. Your June 26 profile of (Simpson defense 
attorney) Robert L. Shapiro revealed a chilling aspect of today's criminal 
"strategy." In dealing with the press, Shapiro advises that fellow lawyers 
avoid cliches and that they pick their phrases carefully. "Repeat such phrases 
continually," he wrote, and "they will be repeated by the media. After a while, 
the repetition almost becomes a fact. That is the lawyer's ultimate goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Wow. The ultimate goal of a lawyer is to create "almost facts" that will be 
repeated by the media that know only how to parrot the gibberish disseminated 
from the legal profession. It's a tried and true "strategy" used throughout the 
world and throughout history, but where is the "strategy" that will discover 
the "real facts"? You know the facts I'm referring to; the facts that will 
inform the public of what actually occurred? 
</P>
<P>
 Why is our legal profession so concerned with cultivating the appropriate 
media image and not with cultivating the truth about the events that actually 
occurred so the people who should be in jail (even the ones with lots of money) 
end up there? And why are media so willing to play the same game? 
</P>

<P>
 * The defense attorneys speak out in support of O.J. Simpson. This is their 
job. This is what they are paid to do. 
</P>
<P>
 But, who speaks out for the true victims of this crime, Nicole Brown Simpson 
and Ronald Goldman? Who speaks out for the thousands of others who have met 
death or injury as a result of spousal abuse? 
</P>
<P>
 I truly appreciate the articulate and eloquent words of Garcetti as he 
continues to remind the public about the true victims in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti has continued to do battle with the unrealistic and lenient 
consequences issued by our legal system to perpetrators of spousal abuse. He 
has continued to remind us about this horrible sickness which has imprisoned 
family members whose only escape from this prison is often death. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Garcetti's words will no longer fall upon deaf ears. Perhaps it is 
time to listen to the words of reason and stop worshiping a hero who no longer 
exists. 
</P>
<P>
 SUSAN BRANDT 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda 
</P>
<P>
 * I read with great concern "D.A. Mounts Media Drive to Shape Opinion" (June 
21). The whole point of your article is that Garcetti, apparently with some 
enthusiasm, is operating outside the judicial system to sway public opinion 
(and thereby the available jury pool) against Simpson. I wish to point out the 
following, which is Rule 7-106(A) of the California Rules of Professional 
Conduct, to which Garcetti and his staff are subject as California licensed 
attorneys: 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the trial of a case, a member of the State Bar connected therewith 
shall not communicate directly or indirectly with anyone he knows to be a 
member of the venire from which the jury will be selected for the trial of the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that Garcetti and his staff are flagrantly violating their 
ethical standards as lawyers and, in doing so, making it less likely Simpson 
will obtain a fair trial. Garcetti has said numerous times that his only job is 
to obtain justice. That is what his job should be but this is not the way it is 
being carried out. 
</P>

<P>
 * Concerning the unfortunate case of O.J. Simpson, aren't we losing sight of 
the big picture just a little bit? The man is accused of murder. If he did it, 
he should be punished. If he didn't, he should go free, and the real killer 
should be caught. Why are we cranking out pages on how likable his attorney is, 
and how tough the prosecutor is? Ironically, it's beginning to sound all too 
much like a sports event, with the audience whipped into a frenzy by the time 
the starting gun goes off. 
</P>
<P>
 The essential issue is that two people were brutally slain, and their killer 
should be stopped. To glorify and sensationalize this tragedy is shameful. 
Let's not pervert the process any more than it already is, and attend to the 
job at hand -- justice.

 I watched and listened with disbelief as the Garcetti played good cop-bad cop 
with the city attorney on television. Garcetti's remark, "I didn't know this 
was going to happen," was not convincing. If the evidence against Simpson is so 
overwhelming, why not let the jury system operate free of influence by the 
prosecution?

 * Meir Westreich's commentary (June 24) is written as though he thinks the 
grand jury system has been working the way it should be, except in the case of 
O.J. Simpson. Please, Meir, get real. Both federal and lower grand juries have 
for as long as I remember been simply rubber stamps of the district attorney. 
They have always been given only the prosecutor's side of cases, so there can't 
be an evenhanded operation standing between the criminal defendants and the 
government. To suggest so indicates a total lack of reality on his part. I wish 
that the way Westreich writes were true, but it isn't and Simpson's case simply 
puts it in the public eye.

 * Re "Oedipus, Achilles and O.J. -- Lessons From Antiquity for Our Time," by 
Michael Baur, Commentary, June 27: 
</P>
<P>
 Baur's comparison of Simpson's difficulties to a character in a Greek tragedy 
fails to mention the essential characteristic of the fallen hero -- hubris. 
Hubris is the key element in the ultimate destruction of a classical hero. It 
is lethal insolence to the gods leading to prideful self-indulgence. Ruin and 
desolation follow. 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, physical and spiritual arrogance are equated with the 
superiority necessary to win the contest. In life, that same characteristic is 
a liability. Unlike the sporting contest, life's game clock runs forever. The 
rules are different. The consequences for infractions are greater. 
</P>
<P>
 The classical analogy does not put us or our thoughts in center stage. We are 
part of a Greek chorus echoing the events we witness. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the play is still the tragic hero -- fumbling against destiny, 
laced with hubris, headed for ruin.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE SIMPSON CASE; RACE AND SEX -- THE LAST TABOO LIVES; ONCE 
AGAIN, AMERICA TAPS INTO A FAVORITE WHITE STEREOTYPE -- THE BLACK MAN AS 
HYPERSEXUAL AND DANGEROUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON, Earl Ofari Hutchinson is a longtime L.A. commentator 
and the author of The Assassination of the Male Black Image, published by 
Middle Passage Press, Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The semi-nude picture of O.J. and Nicole Simpson on the cover of People 
magazine made me shudder. Would this be a chilling reminder to many whites that 
a black man, albeit a wealthy and famous one, not only was suspected of murder 
but also had violated America's last taboo against interracial sex? If so, his 
indictment would be mine, too. This is not paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
 Many black men cringed the moment O.J. became a suspect in the murder of his 
wife. Many of us were reminded of Bigger Thomas, the character in Richard 
Wright's "Native Son" who murdered a white woman, reinforcing the ancient white 
fears of black men as hypersexual and dangerous. To many black men, O.J. may 
become the new Bigger Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although thousands of Asian, Latino and white men, some wealthy and prominent, 
have been accused of sexual crimes and abuses, four black men have become the 
symbols of male sexual menace. The Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings 
touched off the national debate over sexual harassment. Mike Tyson's conviction 
touched off the debate over "date rape." A 13-year-old's accusation against 
Michael Jackson touched off the debate over child sexual abuse. O.J. Simpson's 
arrest has touched off the debate over domestic violence.  
</P>
<P>
 There are two reasons for this symbolism. First is the negative view many 
Americans have of black men. The dire plight of young black men has much to do 
with that view. The California Assembly Commission on the Status of African 
American Males notes that four out of 10 men entering California prisons are 
black. Only 43% of black males under age 21 live with two parents. Black males 
with a high school education are twice as likely as white males to be 
unemployed. The national figures mirror those in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 1,000 black teen-age males a year die from gunfire, according to the 
National Center for Health Statistics. Young black males are seven times more 
likely than whites to end up as homicide victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The media obsession with ghetto crack, gangs and poverty has convinced many 
Americans that black males are hopelessly trapped in a grim netherworld of 
anger and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Even O.J. was not immune. He grew up in a single-parent household in a tough 
section of San Francisco. He flirted with gangs. Some media reports have 
suggested that only his incredible athletic talent and luck spared him a prison 
rap sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing stirs latent hostilities toward black men more than the X factor 
of interracial sex. Sexual fear is a product of America's long history of 
racial stereotyping. In early 20th-Century popular literature, black men were 
routinely depicted as lustful, sex-crazed brutes. Thomas Dixon in his wildly 
successful 1905 novel, "The Clansman," branded the black man "half child, half 
animal, whose passions, once aroused, are as the fury of the tiger." D.W. 
Griffith immortalized that image for millions of filmgoers in "Birth of a 
Nation" in 1915. Film critics still praise it as a classic. 
</P>
<P>
 In "American Dilemma," Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal called America's 
perverse preoccupation with black male sexuality "the main defense for 
segregation." Clarence Thomas was mindful of this tragic history when he called 
Anita Hill's accusations of sexual misconduct a "high-tech lynching." 
</P>
<P>
 It was no accident that the final battle of legal segregation was fought over 
interracial marriage laws. In 1949, 30 states prohibited marriage between 
blacks and whites. When the Supreme Court struck down the prohibition in 1967, 
17 states made interracial marriage a felony offense. Twelve states still had 
anti-miscegenation laws on the books well into the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 While polls show that the majority of white Americans no longer oppose 
interracial marriages, a substantial number do. A 1991 General Social Survey 
conducted by the National Opinion Research Center reported that one in five 
whites believes that interracial marriage should be illegal; marriage between 
black men and white women is frowned on the most. But even 66% of those who 
don't oppose interracial marriage say they would oppose a close relative 
marrying a black man. Forty-five percent in the survey were opposed to Anglos 
marrying Latinos or Asians.  
</P>
<P>
 Many churches aren't beacons of enlightenment on mixed marriages, either. 
Sociologist Ernest Porterfield in "Black and White Mixed Marriages" discovered 
that the majority of mixed couples who attended church before marriage 
discontinued attendance afterward.  
</P>
<P>
 South African expatriate Mark Mathabane, whose wife is white, recounts in 
"Love in Black and White" bitter encounters with racism in America. Mathabane's 
experience is not exceptional. The sight of a black male and white female 
together often brings hostile stares, insults, harassment and physical attack. 
This is why black-white marriages are a rarity. According to the 1990 Census, 
only 4% of black men have married white women. 
</P>
<P>
 While O.J. gained fame as athlete, entertainer and media personality, he 
carefully avoided racial or political controversy. This earned him mainstream 
acceptance, hero status and temporary exemption from racial backlash for 
marrying white. But many black men know this exemption doesn't apply to them. 
That's why we worry that if O.J. is put on trial, so will we be.

DON'T MUG THE COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM; LOS ANGELES: DRASTIC PROPOSED CUTS WOULD 
FURTHER WOUND A POPULATION WHERE 1 OUT OF 5 ADULTS IS ILLITERATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIDNEY SHELDON and GRANT P. THOMPSON, Sidney Sheldon, a Los Angeles 
resident, is the author of The Other Side of Midnight, Memories of Midnight, 
The Doomsday Conspiracy and Nothing Lasts Forever, which will be published in 
September. Grant P. Thompson, is executive director of Libraries for the 
Future. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will Los Angeles sit idly by while one of its crown jewels -- its county 
public library system -- is shipped to the emergency room with possibly fatal 
wounds? 
</P>
<P>
 Under the budget being considered by the county supervisors and the state 
Legislature, more than 50 branch libraries out of a total of 87 could be closed 
by August, denying services to millions of citizens who use the "people's 
university" to improve their skills, learn English and literacy, read 
bestsellers and how-to books, and find serene places to study, think and dream 
in an often overwhelming world. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past decade, libraries have been the object of slow-acting poison in 
California as local jurisdictions use scarce funds to bolster police, fire and 
other safety services. In the past year alone, libraries across the state have 
lost 11% of their staff, have cut public hours by 14% and have slashed 25% of 
their book buying. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. County library system -- which serves one out of every 10 
Californians -- has been even harder hit. It has been forced to close 10 of its 
libraries permanently. Of the 87 that remain, more than half are open only two 
days a week. Last year, libraries couldn't buy a single book or subscribe to a 
single magazine. Even if money is found in the future, there will be gaps that 
can never be filled. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mugging that the supervisors and the state plan for the L.A. County 
Library is something new and horrifying. America went through the Great 
Depression without closing a single public library. In one year, our 
magnificent library system stands to lose 51 branches. 
</P>
<P>
 We call it mugging because -- among other strengths -- libraries have an 
important, little-understood role to play in preventing crime. According to a 
study soon to be released by Libraries for the Future, a national advocacy 
group for library users, and PEN Center USA West, the very services that 
libraries offer at a cost of less than $18 per year per person, can prevent 
lives of crime that result in costs to society of more than $25,000 per year 
per criminal held in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 What are these life rafts that libraries offer? Why are the county supervisors 
and the ultimate decision-maker, the state, thinking of throwing them on the 
budget-cutting floor? They are nothing very mysterious: literacy, job training, 
access to computers, help with homework and finding adults who care about 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider these facts: In L.A. County, one out of every five adults is 
functionally illiterate. Almost one out of every six residents lives below the 
poverty level. Nearly one-third did not complete high school. Nationwide, 85% 
of juveniles who appear in court are unable to read. 
</P>
<P>
 What lies ahead for a county where so many people can't read or comprehend 
even simple instructions? In 1993, 115,000 children took part in programs 
designed to introduce them to books and provide pre-reading skills. During that 
year, L.A. County Library offered reading programs to 250,000 school-age 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, more than 5 million children's books were borrowed by patrons of the 
L.A. County Library. In a 1992 survey, 44% of school-age children said they 
came to the library for homework, 23% came to check out materials and 19% came 
to read. More than 3,500 children per day use the library at the end of the day 
before their parents come home from work. Eighty percent are doing homework and 
20% are seeking a safe haven. 
</P>
<P>
 If our elected officials are serious about rebuilding a strong Los Angeles 
that will have workers who can read, and safe places for motivated young people 
to study, they will find someplace else to cut the money. It costs about the 
price of a pair of movie tickets per year per county resident to restore these 
devastating cuts.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JOHN J. PITNEY JR.: LEFT'S MUDDLED ASSAULT ON THE RELIGIOUS 
RIGHT; LIBERALS LOSE SIGHT OF THE SPIRIT OF TOLERANCE THEY PROFESS TO EMBODY IN 
ATTACKS THAT LACK CONSISTENCY AND COMMON SENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. PITNEY JR., John J. Pitney Jr. is an associate professor of 
government at Claremont McKenna College. He is co-author, with William F. 
Connelly Jr., of Congress's Permanent Minority? Republicans in the U.S. House 
(Rowman & Littlefield, 1994). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Liberals are cooking up new attacks on religious conservatives, but their 
recipe is missing a couple of ingredients: consistency and common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), chairman of the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee, told the National Press Club last week that the "radical 
right" is seeking "to carry views that are distinctly religious over into the 
government and to try to impose those as laws." On the same day, Democratic 
gubernatorial nominee Kathleen Brown told a Sacramento press conference that 
her opposition to capital punishment is rooted in her Catholicism. Although she 
said she would enforce current law, presumably she would veto legislation 
extending the death penalty, thereby "imposing" her beliefs on California. 
</P>
<P>
 Why aren't liberals damning Brown? Fazio's comments hardly clarify the issue. 
Religious people may take part in politics, he said, "but should they come 
together as a force to change the direction of their party?" Oh, so religious 
influence becomes objectionable only when it turns into group action. The 
civil-rights movement surely flunks this test, since it has relied on 
organizations such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference as well as 
countless local churches. So, might liberals tell the Rev. Jesse Jackson to 
leave the Democratic Party? 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio denounced "stealth" politicians, referring to Christian conservatives 
who purportedly run for office without publicly emphasizing their religious 
ties. Indeed, candidates ought to disclose their affiliations, but not just 
their sectarian ones. If liberal politicians took this principle seriously, 
they would start every speech to business groups by listing all their campaign 
contributions from organized labor. Fazio, of course, rejected any analogy 
between labor and the religious right. "Well, I think the organized labor 
movement in the Democratic Party comes at most of its issues on the basis of 
personal beliefs." Huh? 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio veered deepest into Wonderland when he approvingly cited a book titled 
"The Culture of Disbelief" by Stephen Carter. Although Carter criticized the 
religious right, he made a crucial distinction that Fazio ignored: "If the 
Christian Coalition is wrong for America, it must be because its message is 
wrong on the issues, not because its message is religious." 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio's attack is not an isolated incident, but part of a larger effort to 
demonize religious conservatives in the eyes of the public. Two years ago, when 
Pat Buchanan spoke of a "religious war," liberals accused him of breaching the 
bounds of civil discourse. A few weeks ago, the American Civil Liberties Union 
of Southern California sent out a fund-raising letter that began: "This country 
is at war over whether we will remain a democracy or become a theocracy with 
our laws based on a literal interpretation of the Bible." So much for civil 
discourse. And it got worse. "Already, fundamentalist Christians have won seats 
on over 2,000 school boards throughout this country." If one substituted 
Catholics or Jews for fundamentalist Christians, it would sound like a letter 
from a fringe nativist group of the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU letter offers further examples of the tortured logic underlying the 
assault on the religious right. Among other things, it noted that Christian 
conservatives have won a majority on the school board of Vista, Calif. -- and 
that the board now prays before its meetings. But so do the Democratically 
controlled House and Senate, not exactly hotbeds of revivalism. The letter also 
said that the Vista board has curtailed school bus service, but what do budget 
cuts have to do with religion? The Clinton Administration boasts of slashing 
the budget and eliminating 252,000 federal jobs. Does this mean that Alice 
Rivlin is a snake handler? 
</P>
<P>
 The letter accused religious conservatives of trying "to take over state 
government." Unless the ACLU has evidence of a military coup in the works, I 
gather that it was referring to Christian participation in the electoral 
process. Yes, there is a word for this dastardly effort. It is called 
democracy.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether through calculation or mere insensitivity, such attacks are profoundly 
offensive and utterly inconsistent with the spirit of tolerance that liberalism 
professes to. Liberals should pick up the debate, lay down the smears and heed 
Stephen Carter's warning that "It is easy to be McCarthyite about the Christian 
right."

 For the last three and a half years, Beano has been a boon. You just measure a 
few drops of it on your beans or cabbage at the beginning of the meal and 
presto, no gas. (In effect, it corrects our bodies' inability to digest the 
complex sugars that cause gas.) The problem, for some people, is the 
inconvenience of hauling out a bottle and a dropper, so it's now available in 
chewable tablet form. It's at Sav-On, Payless and Thrifty stores, as well as 
many pharmacies and health food stores. For more information about where to get 
it, plus free tablet samples, call the Beano Hotline, (800) 257-8650 or (800) 
GET BEAN between 5:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. Thanks, Mom 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of years ago an athlete named Patrick Johannes married a Californian, 
left his home state of Minnesota, settled down in Los Angeles and started 
raising a family. The problem is that Johannes is America's fifth-ranked 
Greco-Roman wrestler, and training for the '96 Olympics costs money. So his 
wife came up with an unusual fund-raising idea: selling her Irish mother's 
salad dressing. Hence the brand name, My Mother's Dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's what Americans would call French dressing (to the French it would be a 
garlicky vinaigrette dosed with catsup and horseradish). You can see why 
Deborah Johannes thought that selling it would be a good idea, because it 
really is an outstanding example of the style, with a clean and vivid flavor. 
At the moment it's for sale in exactly two stores -- the country store in Pine 
Mountain, Calif., a minuscule town near Gorman, and Hot Hot Hot in Pasadena -- 
at $5 a bottle, but you can also get My Mother's Dressing directly from the 
Johanneses. They'll mail it for $7; call (818) 790-4847. By the way, this might 
be the only salad dressing in the country that's tax-deductible. CHARLES PERRY

THE BATTLE OF THE BOTTLED TEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tea is absurdly easy to make, so why do so many of us buy bottled iced tea? 
Well, maybe we're somewhere (such as work) where we can't make it. Maybe we're 
home, but at this time of year we can't bear to turn on a burner, boil water, 
stand around while the tea steeps and then wait for it to chill. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the idea just sounds good when we want a soft drink that isn't as sweet 
as a soda. It's true, sweetened tea generally has about half the calories per 
ounce of a non-diet cola. That advantage is reduced somewhat when you consider 
that tea is usually sold in 16-ounce bottles while sodas come in 12-ounce cans, 
but it's still usually the difference between 90 calories and 140. And there 
are sugarless bottled teas. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, the supermarkets are giving us a lot of choices these 
days -- it's not hard to find four or five brands in a single store. Some are 
available in several flavors (in the case of Snapple, make that dozens), while 
others are just plain tea. 
</P>
<P>
 To evaluate the styles of several leading brands, this tasting concentrates on 
the most common flavor, lemon. The brands are arranged in order of increasing 
sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
 Tejava Premium Java Tea: Dark color, tea flavor is relatively strong but not 
very distinctive. Bitter tasting because, unlike the others in this tasting, it 
has no lemon flavoring or sweetening (you could add your own, of course). 
Imported from Japan, it is the only brand not sold in the usual American 
16-ounce size. The 11.8-ounce bottles are also sealed with a crown cap 
requiring a bottle opener, rather than a screw top. No calories. 
</P>
<P>
 Snapple Lemon Flavored Iced Tea: Like all Snapple flavors, this has a murky, 
unfiltered look. Neutral tea flavor, very slightly sweetened. The effect is of 
a soft drink (or rather, because it's not very sweet, a flavored mineral 
water), rather than a tea, with a faint astringency. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestea Natural Lemon Flavored Iced Tea: Moderately sweet, good balance of 
acidity, closest to the usual home-made iced tea. Medium tea aroma, cleanest 
lemon aroma. 
</P>
<P>
 Kona Ki Lemon: Slight tea aroma; citrus aroma has an odd, faint, candy-like 
note. For dieters only -- it has the chalky taste of an artificial sweetener. 
No calories. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistic Iced Tea Naturally Lemon Flavored: Very faint, slightly "burnt" tea 
aroma. Dominant flavors are sugar and lemon, giving the effect of lemonade with 
a little tea in it. For tea drinkers who don't really like tea. 
</P>
<P>
 Twinings Ceylon Blend Iced Tea Sweetened/With Lemon: Best tea aroma. But 
sugary sweet. Has 100 calories, compared to the 90 calories of most other 
brands.

 Here's a chance to taste every Grange Hermitage ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 Grange Hermitage? What's a Grange Hermitage? Just the most acclaimed 
Australian red wine, that's all, produced mainly from Shiraz grapes by 
Penfolds, which happens to celebrate its 150th anniversary as a wine company 
this year.Los Angeles plastic surgeon and wine collector Richard Fleming is 
staging a tasting of every vintage from the first (1955) through 1989 at 
luncheons on Oct. 8 and 9 at Spago and Patina restaurants in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 However, though Fleming has at least three bottles of most vintages, he has 
only one of the '58, so he's willing to give up a seat at the luncheons to 
anybody who can come up with a perfectly stored bottle of that vintage. Cost of 
the two-day, invitation-only event, which features commentary by chief Penfolds 
winemaker John Duval: $875 -- or a '58 Grange Hermitage. If you've got a 
bottle, contact Carl Jaeger at Penfolds, (408) 655-4848. DAN BERGER

NEWS BITES : DOUBLE DOSE DIP

 It's hot. It's smoky. And there's definite fire danger if you have a tender 
palate.Garden of Eatin's new smoky chipotle organic red bean dip boosts its 
fire power with a double dose of jalapenos -- fresh ones and the dried smoked 
jalapenos known as chipotle chiles. The large, red, organically grown beans are 
left whole, which makes this dip seem a little like incendiary chili beans. It 
sells for $3.29 in natural foods stores. BARBARA HANSEN

COOL PARTIES FOR HOT TIMES

 Feeding a crowd doesn't have to mean hours spent shopping, prepping and 
cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week I invited 10 people for a birthday supper. Everyone loved the 
food. All the dishes were prepared ahead and arranged on platters. By meal 
time, I was cool as a cucumber and the kitchen was as neat as a pin. 
</P>
<P>
 If time and weather conditions require that the dishes be refrigerated, make 
sure to bring them to room temperature before serving. Refrigeration has a 
tendency to flatten flavors, so taste each dish and add more seasonings if 
needed. For instance, refrigerated couscous will need more lemon juice, and 
lentils will need more red wine vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For our party, the weather was perfect. Since all the work was done ahead 
(except for the grilling of the lamb), I enjoyed a glass of wine on the deck 
with our friends before dinner. Then we filled our plates from the sideboard 
and all sat down together to enjoy a luscious meal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leftovers are great, so don't hesitate to order a large leg of lamb.  
</P>
<P>
 GARLIC-HERB CRUSTED GRILLED LEG OF LAMB 
</P>
<P>
 4 cloves garlic, crushed 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon fresh or dried rosemary leaves, stripped from stems, plus few 
fresh sprigs for garnish 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon coarse salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 (6-pound) leg of lamb, trimmed of excess fat, boned and butterflied  
</P>
<P>
 Combine garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper in small bowl. Stir mixture into 
paste with fork. 
</P>
<P>
 Place lamb, smooth side down, on work surface. Spread with garlic-herb 
mixture. Let stand at room temperature. Broil or grill lamb, turning 
occasionally, until outside is browned and crusty and inside is medium-rare, 20 
to 30 minutes total cooking time, depending on intensity of heat and thickness 
of meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Let stand 10 minutes before cutting into thin diagonal slices. Arrange on 
platter and garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs. Makes 10 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 GREEN BEANS WITH MINT 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds green beans, rinsed, drained and ends trimmed 
</P>
<P>
 1 clove garlic, halved 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup thinly sliced red onion 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves, optional 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Bring large pan of water to boil. Add beans to boiling water and cook, 
uncovered, over high heat, stirring occasionally, until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. 
Drain. 
</P>
<P>
 Rub surface of large bowl with cut side of garlic. Leave garlic in bowl. Add 
olive oil, onion, basil and mint. Add hot beans to oil mixture. Season to taste 
with salt and pepper. Toss to combine. Serve while still warm or at room 
temperature. Makes 5 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lentils are one of the few legumes that require no presoaking, and they are 
quick cooking. Depending on the age and dryness of the lentils, they will cook 
until firm-tender in as little time as 20 minutes. This dish is also excellent 
when cubed, boiled potatoes are added.  
</P>
<P>
 LENTILS AND PEAS VINAIGRETTE 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound brown lentils, rinsed and sorted 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 onion 
</P>
<P>
 1 clove garlic, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 bay leaf 
</P>
<P>
 1 celery top or parsley sprig, optional 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup frozen tiny peas, thawed 
</P>
<P>
 2 green onions, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 Dressing 
</P>
<P>
 Place lentils in large saucepan and add water to cover by 1 inch. Add onion, 
garlic, bay leaf and celery top. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and 
simmer, uncovered, until lentils are tender but not mushy, 20 to 30 minutes. 
Drain and cool to room temperature. Remove onion and seasonings. Can be 
prepared 1 day ahead and refrigerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine cooled lentils, peas and green onions. Toss with Dressing and serve at 
room temperature or chilled. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressing 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup red wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1 clove garlic, crushed 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Whisk oil, vinegar, garlic, salt and pepper to taste until blended. Makes 1/2 
cup Dressing. 
</P>
<P>

 Couscous is simply semolina flour (semolina flour is the ground endosperm of 
hard durum wheat) that has been mixed with salt water and then tossed and 
rubbed into tiny little pellets. In Middle Eastern cuisine, cooking perfectly 
light, fluffy couscous requires gently steaming in an especially designed pot 
called a couscousiere. But for making a salad, follow the simple and quick 
method described below.  
</P>
<P>
 COUSCOUS SALAD WITH LEMON DRESSING 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups quick-cooking couscous 
</P>
<P>
 1 3/4 cups boiling water 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups lightly packed 1/2-inch crosswise cut slices romaine lettuce 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup diced, cored, chopped plum tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup finely chopped curly-leaf parsley 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Place couscous in large bowl. Add boiling water and stir to blend. Cover and 
let stand 10 minutes. Uncover. Fluff with fork. Let stand, uncovered, until 
cool, about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Add lettuce, tomatoes, parsley, green onions, dill and mint to cooled 
couscous. Add Dressing and toss salad to blend. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressing 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon cold water 
</P>
<P>
 1 clove garlic, crushed 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, water, garlic and salt in small bowl until 
blended. Taste and add more lemon juice, if desired. Makes 6 servings.

 DEAR SOS: The Tropicana Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas serves the best bread 
pudding at their buffet. It appears to be made with a layer of sliced cinnamon 
rolls instead of plain bread, and it is not dry. 
</P>
<P>
 -- TERRI 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR TERRI: Tropicana Hotel executive pastry chef Leroy King sent this recipe. 
You were almost right about the type of bread used: They're croissants. 
</P>
<P>
 TROPICANA BREAD 
</P>
<P>
 PUDDING 
</P>
<P>
 1 quart milk 
</P>
<P>
 7 eggs, beaten 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 2 dashes salt 
</P>
<P>
 8 medium croissants, preferably stale 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups raisins 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Combine milk, beaten eggs, sugar, vanilla and salt in large bowl. Blend well. 
Cut croissants into thin slices and place half into 2-quart casserole or baking 
dish. Cover with layer of raisins, then top with layer of remaining croissant 
slices. Pour custard over croissant slices and press down so all bread is 
soaked. 
</P>
<P>
 Let stand 30 minutes. Place pan in another pan filled halfway with water and 
bake at 350 degrees 45 minutes or until center of pudding is firm. Makes 8 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 437 calories; 427 mg sodium; 195 mg cholesterol; 16 grams fat; 62 grams 
carbohydrates; 14 grams protein; 0.27 gram fiber.

<P>
 DEAR SOS: I would like a good recipe for Swedish meatballs. I don't seem to 
have luck adding sour cream to the hot mixture. The cream curdles and looks 
like a big disaster! 
</P>
<P>
 -- MAGGIE 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR MAGGIE: Fret not. This recipe for Swedish meatballs is made with a 
flour-based sauce. Still, when you do use sour cream, it's best to blend the 
sour cream with a small amount of hot mixture before adding it to the remaining 
hot liquid. This tempering method helps avoid curdling. 
</P>
<P>
 SWEDISH MEATBALLS 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 pound boneless beef, ground 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 pound boneless pork, ground

</P>
<P>
 Heat 2 tablespoons butter in skillet and add onion. Saute until onion is 
tender but not browned. Add onion to meat along with eggs, salt, pepper, 
allspice, sugar and soaked crumbs. Mix thoroughly but lightly. Shape into small 
or medium-sized balls.  
</P>
<P>
 Heat 2 tablespoons butter in skillet. Add meatballs and brown on all sides, 
shaking pan occasionally. Add meatballs to Cream Gravy and simmer over low heat 
30 minutes. Makes 6 entree or 12 appetizer servings. 
</P>
<P>

 Melt butter in saucepan, then stir in flour until smooth. Gradually stir in 
milk, half and half, salt, pepper and sugar. Bring to boil, stirring 
constantly. Simmer, stirring, until sauce is shiny. Stir in enough brown 
cooking sauce to make gravy light-brown in color, about 2 teaspoons to 1 
tablespoon. 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR SOS: I clipped a recipe for paprika onions from The Times years ago and 
it has turned brown with age. Would you please reprint the recipe?  
</P>

HOME COOK: PLAIN PLEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm not sure whether it is consoling or depressing that some things never 
change. In the last few years I've criticized restaurants for putting far too 
many ingredients into dishes. I suspect chefs do this to appear creative, but 
too often the flavors collide rather than blend. 
</P>
<P>
 In the preface of a dilapidated old copy of "The San Francisco Chronicle Blue 
Ribbon Cookbook" (1904), I came across a paragraph that amazed me. It reads as 
follows: "What is the object of food? Why do we eat? These queries interest all 
humanity and have been answered repeatedly by intelligent thinkers. We 'eat to 
live'; we eat because waste is forever going on in the human body and must be 
replenished. But are there not many cooks who act upon the supposition that the 
greater the number of ingredients crowded into any one dish, the more 
remarkable the achievement and the more creditable the ingenuity displayed? 
This is plainly an error, for all right-thinking persons must admit that the 
cook deserving the highest praise is the one who can prepare the most 
appetizing, and at the time, the most wholesome and nourishing from the 
plainest material." 
</P>
<P>
 I only wish an example of such a dish had been given. I wanted to use one of 
the ginger cookies recipes from this book, but the two I tried were really what 
turn-of-the-century cooks called "cakelets." I've adapted one of them to be 
less cake-like; it's sweet, crisp and full of ginger flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The supper dish, sauteed mushrooms on polenta, is my idea of a "wholesome and 
nourishing dish made from the plainest materials." The flavor of our 
supermarket mushrooms can certainly compete with the fancy varieties, 
especially when done this way; and the flavors flow together smoothly, they 
don't clash. 
</P>
<P>
 GINGER COOKIES 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup vegetable shortening 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 egg 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup molasses 
</P>

<P>
 2 teaspoons baking soda 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon ground ginger 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beat together shortening and sugar in bowl. Add egg and beat until light. Stir 
in molasses. Add flour, baking soda, salt and ginger. Beat until smooth and 
blended. 
</P>
<P>
 Drop dough from teaspoon or roll rounded teaspoon of dough into ball and place 
cookies about 2 inches apart on greased baking sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 350 degrees 10 to 12 minutes until cookies have spread. Remove from 
oven and cool on racks. Makes 40 (2-inch) cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Each cookie contains about:

<P>
 Basic Polenta 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons minced parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Melt 1/4 cup butter in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallots and 
mushrooms. Cook, tossing frequently, 5 to 8 minutes, until mushrooms just begin 
to brown and most moisture has evaporated. Add remaining 2 tablespoons butter 
and stir until melted. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoon over hot polenta and sprinkle with parsley. Serve at once. Makes 4 
servings.

</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup butter 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bring 3 cups of water to boil in heavy-bottomed saucepan. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir cornmeal into 1 cup cold water in small bowl. Pour cornmeal mixture into 
boiling water, stirring constantly, until mixture becomes very thick, about 10 
to 15 minutes. Stir in butter until well blended. Serve immediately.

GOOD COOKING: SUMMER HERBS; FRESH HERBS: THE MAGIC SPRIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fresh herbs are available in supermarket produce sections throughout the year. 
They present the bright essence of an herb's flavor in a way that the dried 
form can't begin to do. The drawbacks of fresh herbs are that they are highly 
perishable -- and very expensive when you get them from the supermarket.  
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, you can easily grow your own, guaranteeing a fresh and 
inexpensive supply. Plant a variety of fresh herbs in pots, then use them in 
your summer cooking -- in soups, salads, vegetable dishes, marinades, sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider starting your summer herb adventures with the following recipes, all 
jointly developed by Chicago restaurateur Rick Bayless and Susan Goss, chef at 
Bayless's Restaurant Zinfandel. They highlight the special essence of flavor 
that fresh herbs bring to a dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayless' quick tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Add fresh herbs during the cooking, then add a little more when the dish is 
about finished, to introduce the fresh flavor of the uncooked herb. 
</P>
<P>
 * For an explosion of flavor, garnish a dish with chopped or julienned fresh 
herbs just before serving. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I urge you to make your own strawberry vinegar; it will be a boon to your 
summer cooking. It's easy to make and is full of bright, deep flavor without 
being harsh. You could use it as a salad dressing all by itself, with only a 
touch of oil. In this recipe, reserve the remaining dressing for a fresh fruit 
salad or perhaps a salad of small spinach leaves with quartered strawberries 
and marinated sweet onions.  
</P>
<P>
 SUMMER HERB SALAD WITH STRAWBERRY VINAIGRETTE 
</P>
<P>
 About 6 cups loosely packed mixed baby lettuces 
</P>
<P>
 About 2 cups loosely packed assorted summer broadleaf herbs such as basil, 
scented geranium, nasturtiums, borage, arugula, mint, summer savory, flat leaf 
parsley  
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry Vinaigrette 
</P>
<P>
 Rinse lettuces and herbs. Carefully dry in salad spinner or between paper 
towels. Wrap in paper towels and refrigerate until time to serve, up to 6 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Put lettuces and herbs in large salad bowl. Stir Strawberry Vinaigrette, then 
measure 1/2 cup. Sprinkle over salad and gently toss to coat. Makes 4 to 6 
servings.  
</P>
<P>
 Each of 4 servings, including Strawberry Vinaigrette, contains about:

 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon clover honey 
</P>
<P>
 1 scant teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

 Note : If strawberry vinegar is unavailable, substitute mild white wine 
vinegar. Then increase strawberries to 1/2 cup when making the dressing. Or 
make strawberry vinegar by putting 1 quart of very ripe (even blemished) 
strawberries in non-reactive container and cover with mild white wine vinegar. 
After 1 week or so, strain, bottle and store in dark, cool place.

 This almost cake-like tart is great for picnics -- it transports easily and is 
delicious at room temperature. Basically, you can use any seasonal vegetables; 
asparagus, shiitake and sweet onions went into the mixture I tried. Bayless 
suggests using baby artichokes, trimmed and quartered, in the vegetable mix (if 
you can find them). This tart is a carry-out item at Zinfandel's food market.

 The basil-lemon dressing goes extremely well with both the slaw and the smoked 
salmon. This quantity is for appetizer or first-course servings. If you want to 
serve the salad as a light meal, you may want to increase the amount of slaw. 
Reserve any unused dressing for another batch of slaw, or other salads such as 
potato salad with arugula.

 When you get right down to it, ice cream is cream sweetened with sugar, then 
frozen. Anything more is elaboration. It's the difference between Philadelphia 
ice cream (an innocent blend of cream, milk and sugar) and French (a decadent 
concoction rich with cooked eggs). This weekend, above all others, you should 
know which side to favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if your ice cream-eating experience is limited to what you've 
bought at the store or have been served at restaurants, it's quite possible 
you've never tasted ice cream made this simply. 
</P>
<P>
 Most store-bought ice creams are made with a complex of artificial ingredients 
that are necessary to cushion the product through the frequently bumpy road 
from producer to consumer. Ice cream is an exceptionally fragile substance and, 
left alone, the constant temperature variations it encounters in a typical day 
in a typical freezer would shatter its delicate constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 With homemade ice cream, that is no problem. Homemade ice cream is always gone 
before it has even the slightest chance of melting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In restaurants, where more and more chefs are making their own ice creams, 
temperature fluctuation is not so much a problem. But restaurant ice creams -- 
being made by pastry chefs -- are almost always based on a custard -- cooked 
eggs. It's tempting to say that the complication is just the nature of pastry 
chefs, but there is a reason for it. Egg yolks act as a liaison, binding the 
fat and water in the milk into a smooth emulsion. In commercial ice creams, 
you'll often find chemicals such as lecithin (egg yolks are high in it) or 
gelatin as a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there's nothing wrong with a custard-based ice cream. Not at all. In 
fact, it is nearly impossible to get an ice cream with the same luxurious 
texture without using it. But there are drawbacks as well, and you owe it to 
yourself to try the fresh, natural taste and crisp texture of real ice cream 
without the opulent masking a custard gives. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, anything made so simply is difficult to get right. In this style of 
ice cream, the flavorings are subtle and every detail shines through. The mix 
of cream and milk has to be just right, and even a tablespoon's difference in 
the amount of sugar in a quart of ice cream is detectable. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, because of the peculiar physics of freezing, each ingredient also 
has an effect on the texture of the ice cream -- how hard or soft, icy or 
creamy the finished product will be. 
</P>
<P>
 The fat in the cream carries flavor, and the more fat, the creamier the 
finished product. So you want as much fat as possible. But as you quickly 
realize in experimenting, it doesn't take much fat to get that disgusting 
mouth-coating waxiness that can make an ice cream darned near unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar is the same way. You want enough to lift the flavor of the ice cream, 
but too much and all you taste is this simple searing sweetness that seems to 
last forever. Beyond that, sugar lowers the freezing point of the cream. So you 
not only have something that tastes bad, you have something that won't freeze 
much beyond the chilled soup stage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there's a way to determine exactly how much your mix contains of 
each. To figure fat, add the percentages of fat for each type of cream 
(whipping cream is 30% fat, half-and-half is 10.5% and whole milk is 3.25%) and 
then divide by the total volume. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: If you combine three cups of whipping cream (three times 30% 
equals 90) plus one cup of whole milk (one times 3.25%), you wind up with 
93.25, which, when divided by the four cups of liquid, equals an average of 
23%. Notice that these are percentages of fat, not calories from fat. 
</P>
<P>
 And when we froze that mixture, everyone hated it. It was soft and smooth, but 
did it coat your mouth! In fact, most people started rinsing their mouths out 
with water. 
</P>
<P>
 We also tried ice creams made with 20% fat (two cups whipping cream, two cups 
half-and-half), 15% fat (two cups whipping cream, two cups whole milk), and 10% 
fat (four cups half-and-half). There was no clear consensus on which was best, 
but most people agreed it was either 15% or 20% (though 10% did get a lot of 
support -- primarily because it had been frozen most recently and hadn't 
hardened completely, so it was softest when tasted -- a good thing to 
remember). 
</P>
<P>
 So I split the difference and settled on an ice cream with 18% fat -- two cups 
whipping cream, one cup half-and-half and one cup milk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To determine the ideal amount of sugar, we went through the same arduous round 
of testing with 8% sugar ( 1/3 cup per quart), 12% ( 1/2 cup), 16% ( 2/3 cup) 
and 18% ( 3/4 cup). Again, after throwing out the low and the high (the low 
tasted OK, the high was way, way too sweet), the 12% was just a touch low, the 
16% a touch high. 
</P>
<P>
 So, again, I compromised. The ideal mix, it seems to me, is an ice cream base 
made with 18% fat and 14% sugar. That fits the general industry profile of 
deluxe ice cream, which, according to W. S. Arbuckle's textbook "Ice Cream and 
Related Products" (AVI Publishing: 1961), should be between 16% and 20% fat and 
14% to 17% sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're curious how that stacks up against some of your favorites, 
Haagen-Dazs vanilla runs 16% fat, Ben & Jerry's vanilla 15% and Baskin-Robbins 
vanilla 12%. Budget ice creams can be as low as 7% to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 The third factor that affects ice cream quality is run-over (essentially, how 
much air is pumped into the ice cream). This is something manufacturers talk 
about a lot, but it doesn't have much effect on home ice cream makers. You'll 
have to take what your ice cream machine gives you -- there's no way to 
manipulate it. 
</P>
<P>
 What was most amazing about the experiments is how good just plain old ice 
cream tastes. Without even a whisper of additional flavoring, the clean, fresh, 
almost crisp taste of milk was absolutely delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But man cannot live by milk-flavored ice cream alone. Or, at least, not for 
very long. The thing to remember when flavoring ice creams based on this mix is 
to go easy. First of all, add only flavors that you think will naturally 
complement the fresh milk taste. And then, apply with a restrained hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Save baroque blends for store-bought ice creams, where they have to cover up 
the stale taste, or for fancy Continental custards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is the basic recipe I developed while trying to find the right 
proportions of sugar and fat. It was intended to be a kind of "white" 
background to lay other flavors over. The real surprise is how good "white" 
tastes.  
</P>
<P>

 Some people just couldn't handle the idea of lavender ice cream. You'll know 
if you're one of them. If you're not, the slight hint of lavender flavor in 
this mix would be a perfect complement to fresh berries.  
</P>
<P>
 LAVENDER ICE CREAM 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped lavender leaves, or 1 tablespoon dried tops

 2 cups whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Scald milk over medium heat in saucepan. When milk is almost boiling, remove 
from heat and add lavender. Let steep until cool. 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl combine half and half, whipping cream and sugar and whisk to blend. 
Add milk, pouring through strainer to remove leaves, and stir again to make 
sure sugar is well absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeze according to manufacturer's instructions. Then pack into glass or metal 
dish and harden in freezer at least 1 hour. Makes 1 quart, or 8 servings.

 The goal here was to come up with berries and cream, without further 
ornamentation. What we learned in testing is that in order to draw out the most 
flavor, you must crush a third of the berries with sugar before adding them to 
the rest of the fruit.  
</P>
<P>
 BERRY ICE CREAM 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups fresh berries, whole raspberries or blackberries or quartered 
strawberries, or combination

</P>
<P>
 In bowl combine 1/2 cup berries and 2 tablespoons sugar. Mash well. Add 
remainder of berries and stir. Let stand while mixing ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate mixing bowl, combine milk, half and half, whipping cream and 1/2 
cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar. Stir well to dissolve sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeze according to manufacturer's instructions. When frozen, stir berries 
into ice cream, then pack into glass or metal dish and harden in freezer at 
least 1 hour. Makes 1 quart, or 8 servings.

 I've loved the taste of cinnamon since I was a little kid and my mom would put 
cinnamon sugar on toast. This ice cream is a long-time favorite of mine with 
just a warm background taste of cinnamon. This is wonderful served simply with 
sugar cookies, or with an apple or pear dessert.

 The taste of ginger in this ice cream isn't as assertive as it is in some you 
may have tasted. Here, it almost tastes like a spicy accent in the milk. Try 
this with poached peaches.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1/4-inch) chunk ginger root, grated

 GETTING WIRED: Caltrans plans to build its first on-ramp to the Information 
Superhighway in Thousand Oaks (B4). . . . The state's road builders are tired 
of playing catch-up with congestion. So Caltrans has an idea straight out of 
the Information Age: persuade commuters to pound the keyboard instead of the 
pavement. Once built, the city's $1.2-million Advanced Telecommunication Center 
could keep commuters off the road by offering rooms for teleconferences and 
other ways to travel by modem.

 BIRTHDAY BLUES: Poor Oxnard. Today is its 91st birthday, but the city has no 
plans for celebration. . . . With Johnny Carson off the air, Oxnard doesn't 
catch as much grief about its name -- which comes from Henry Oxnard, a 
turn-of-the-century sugar beet king who built a factory in town. "Up until the 
founding of Oxnard, all of this area was called La Colonia," said Madeline 
Miedema, the city's unofficial historian. The territory now called La Colonia 
has shrunk to one poor Latino neighborhood.

 ON THE RUN: Ventura County Hash House Harriers claims to be a running club. 
It's true, every three weeks, members set off on a footrace. But they don't 
care if you run fast, or slow. Or if you cheat on the course. . . . It's all 
part of the zany Hash, practiced by devotees worldwide (Ventura County Life, 
Page 8). Though they exhibit bursts of jogging, fitness is not a prerequisite 
for membership. The club's charter lauds the regenerative powers of the Hash, 
namely through "acquiring a good thirst and satisfying it in beer." 
</P>
<P>
 TOUGH CUTS: Wrestling with a $330,000 shortfall in Fillmore's budget, 
Assistant City Manager/Finance Director Allan Coates decided the city should 
eliminate four jobs, including his own. "My theory is that, if we get a little 
bit better organized, the city can run without my position," he said. . . . 
Don't feel too sorry for him. Coates will be able to retire next year. And 
under his proposal to the City Council, he could retire and be eligible for a 
new part-time job included in the budget.

 Sometimes the Uzbekistan Restaurant seems less a restaurant than a movie about 
a restaurant, some New-Wave French flick set in a room with wild, onion-dome 
cutouts and minarets, Uzbeki hats on the walls, a dome of trompe-l'oeil sky 
overhead, "1001 Nights" murals and gleaming teapots: It's a sort of 
Disneyland-like essay on the joys of post-Soviet capitalism. Uzbekistan 
Restaurant, run by the man who opened the first privately run restaurant in 
Tashkent, the Uzbeki capital, is a fairly swanky hang.

 Some nights, the women, Ivana-wannabes, seem all but lifted from a Julie 
Christie movie circa 1967, beehives, clingy dresses and all; at other times, 
there's more Chanel and Moschino here than the mind can comprehend. The men 
slouch in outfits so 1973-cool it's a wonder they don't moonlight in Beastie 
Boys videos. It's kind of a blast here on weekends, with the restaurant filled 
up with parties of 15, loud toasts every 12 seconds and an organist pounding 
out Slav-style Jamaican ballads. (Bad reggae may be the universal language.) 
Every two weeks or so, an actual Uzbek may show up for dinner amid all the 
Russians.

and delicious Uzbeki bread that is shaped like a giant bialy and flecked with 
black seeds. Everybody seems to get platesful of the flaky, meat-filled 
pastries called samsa , a near cousin to the stuffed breads of northernmost 
China, and chuchvara , tiny fried dumplings with tomato sauce that bear more 
than a passing resemblance -- though surely no kinship -- to St. Louis toasted 
ravioli. Like the population of Uzbekistan itself, the food here, heavy on 
vegetables, intricately flavored with spices and fresh herbs, seems two parts 
Central Asian exotic to one part Russian suave.  
</P>
<P>
 Eggplant Samarkand is the sort of cold sauteed eggplant in tomato sauce you 
have probably eaten at a dozen Middle Eastern restaurants; a Russian pickled 
vegetable plate includes tart, powerfully garlicky pickled red tomatoes in 
addition to the usual cabbage and kosher-style dills. Vegetables "Buhara" -- 
tomatoes and onions and peppers and eggplant -- are roasted almost to a puree 
and served in a small tureen. It is hard to imagine a meal at Uzbekistan 
Restaurant without an order of hasip , pungent, crisp-skinned sausages stuffed 
with rice and ground organ meat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know what is in hasip ?" the owner asked, after the third time I had 
ordered it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," I said, suddenly uneasy. "It's probably liver, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, ho, ho !" he said, and he held his stomach as if to contain his mirth. 
"Not liver . . . spleen ." 
</P>
<P>
 I ordered it the next time anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 When you are not in the mood for spleen, there are always chanum , floppy 
open-faced Uzbeki ravioli filled with a meat-tinged potato puree and served 
with sauteed vegetables and an almost hallucinogenic blast of fresh dill. Or 
lamb chops. Or a strangely charred stir-fry of peppers and mushrooms served in 
a smoking-hot cast-iron pan. Lagman , lumpy hand-pulled noodles, are served 
either in a thick meat broth or fried with vegetables and bits of lamb, nearly 
as soft as a Central European noodle but with a bit of Asian stretchiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Plov , the grandfather of all rice pilafs, is dense and slightly oily, more 
like fried rice than the pilaf you may be familiar with, spiked with diced 
vegetables and crisp-edged chunks of lamb, flavored with a peculiar sort of 
Uzbeki cumin seed that is halfway between cumin and caraway. Don't miss the 
plov . 
</P>
<P>
 Before going out for dinner in Uzbekistan itself, I am reliably informed, it 
is customary to eat first -- the restaurant tradition of the former Soviet 
republic is not as far along as one might hope. But this place . . . of all the 
Russian restaurants in Los Angeles, with all the newly arrived emigrees, is 
easily the equal of the Georgian restaurants in New York's Brighton Beach. It's 
the best former-Soviet-republic food in town.

SUMMER ICE; CHOCOLATE IN THE OFF-SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE LAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most cooks, summer is the time when chocolate is "out of season," when 
warm weather and a wealth of good fresh fruit make other desserts more 
appealing. Most cooks, however, are not friends with Annie "the chocolate 
queen," a dear old pal I no longer see except during summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 It's become a tradition. She and her family, chocolate lovers all, come to 
stay next door. I make some chocolate dish to welcome them. 
</P>
<P>
 When I first made this chocolate-and-orange sorbet, I thought it was so rich 
that one tablespoon would do per serving. But the stuff always seems to 
disappear. Small servings are definitely called for, but there's nothing wrong 
with that -- it cuts down on calories. So does the absence of dairy products, 
though this sorbet is still to be filed under "indulgence" rather than 
"health." As a bonus, it's very easy to make. Be sure to allow plenty of time 
for all the chilling. SUPER CHOCOLATE AND ORANGE SORBET 
</P>
<P>
 2 large oranges, or enough to make 1 cup juice 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 Using 1/8-inch holes on grater, grate enough zest from oranges to equal 2 
teaspoons. Place in small saucepan and set aside. Squeeze 1 cup orange juice 
and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine sugar and salt in saucepan with zest. Add 1 1/4 cups water. Over low 
heat bring to simmer, stirring frequently. Cook until sugar is completely 
dissolved and thin syrup is formed, 2 to 3 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Place chocolate in heat-proof bowl. Pour in hot orange syrup and stir 
constantly until chocolate melts, then let mixture cool to room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Strain chocolate mixture through fine sieve to get smooth sorbet without chewy 
bits of zest. Stir in orange and lemon juices, cover and refrigerate several 
hours or overnight, until mixture is thoroughly chilled. (Without thorough 
pre-chilling, it will freeze up heavy and coarse.) 
</P>
<P>
 Mixture may be frozen without benefit of special machinery, but it will be 
smoother if ice cream maker is used. 
</P>
<P>
 To freeze ice creams and sorbets without ice cream freezer: 
</P>
<P>
 Pour well-chilled mixture into shallow, non-reactive container such as glass 
baking pan. Place in coldest part of freezer 1 hour, or until there is 1-inch 
rim of frozen material around edge. Working as quickly as possible, beat with 
fork to mix. Return to freezer and repeat when there is again 1 inch of frozen 
material. After second beating wait until about three-quarters is solid. Then 
stir 1 more time and let finish undisturbed. Makes about 1 quart, or 8 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 225 calories; 31 mg sodium; trace cholesterol; 8 grams fat; 41 grams 
carbohydrates; 2 grams protein; 0.41 gram fiber.

 A summery version of an old favorite. These cookies are big and tender, with 
chewy nuggets of dried cherry and serious chunks of white chocolate.  
</P>
<P>
 CHERRY-VANILLA-WHITE CHOCOLATE CHUNK COOKIES 
</P>
<P>
 4 1/4 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups vanilla sugar or granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
 3 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon almond extract 
</P>
<P>
 3 ounces dried cherries, about 3/4 cup, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 9 ounces white chocolate, chopped to lima-bean-sized chunks. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside. In large mixing bowl, cream 
butter with sugar until very light and fluffy. 
</P>
<P>
 Add eggs 1 at time, beating well after each addition, then beat in vanilla and 
almond extracts. Stir in cherries. Press cherries against bowl with back of 
spoon to separate clumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Add flour mixture all at once. Stir in gently, working dough as little as 
possible. When no longer floury, add white chocolate chunks and mix completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Drop dough on buttered baking sheets by rounded tablespoons, keeping cookies 
well separated. Slightly flatten each cookie with fingertips. Bake at 350 
degrees until edges are light brown, about 15 minutes. Cool on wire racks and 
store airtight. Makes about 40 cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Each cookie contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 174 calories; 162 mg sodium; 36 mg cholesterol; 10 grams fat; 20 grams 
carbohydrates; 2 grams protein; 0.05 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : Vanilla sugar is granulated sugar that has been stored in closed jar 
with split vanilla bean, which leaves intense, unfading flavor quite different 
from that of extract. One bean can be used over and over. Keep replacing sugar 
up to 1 year. Vanilla sugar and dried cherries are sold in many grocery, 
specialty and health food stores.

WINE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vivace Prosecco, non-vintage ($7) -- This non-vintage semi-sparkling wine is a 
sheer delight, not to mention a bargain.The apple/melon scent and the soft, 
slightly sweet yet crisp finish are a testament to brilliant winemaking and to 
a technique specifically designed to avoid the additional tax on bubbly. 
</P>
<P>
 The wine is a perfect aperitif for warm summer days and works well with a 
variety of lighter foods. 
</P>
<P>
 Two cautions: To remove the deep and tapered corks, use a traditional 
auger-type corkscrew, not a prong-type or pump opener. And keep the wine corked 
and on ice until it is consumed, since the bubbles dissipate more quickly than 
in true sparkling wine. The wine tastes best chilled. DAN BERGER

A BOONE FOR WINE LOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first branch of a new liquor store chain opened Saturday, but it wasn't 
just any liquor store chain. The man behind it was Steve Boone, creator of the 
now-defunct Liquor Barn stores. One potential competitor traveled 3,000 miles 
just to see what Boone was up to. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone, one of the most respected marketers of alcoholic beverages in 
California history, developed the Liquor Barn concept for Safeway Stores in 
1979, eventually expanding it into a 105-store group that grossed $332 million 
in one year, and was instrumental in developing Cost Plus into a major beverage 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday he unveiled his first Beverages, and More! store in, 
appropriately, a former Liquor Barn location in Walnut Creek. The store was 
mobbed by upscale buyers all day. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the thousands who jammed the store arrived in a huge white limousine. 
He was Herbert Haft, founder of the Trak Auto, Crown Books and Dart Drug 
chains. A few weeks ago, Haft announced that the fourth store in his beverage 
chain, Total Beverage, would open soon in Chicago. The original three stores 
are in Virginia -- the newest is the first step in Haft's plans to make Total 
Beverage a national chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone hopes to expand faster than Haft, however. Five additional Beverages, 
and More! stores are scheduled to open this year in Northern California, three 
in former Liquor Barn locations, Boone said. Two stores are planned for 
Southern California next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are no national chains of stores dedicated to wine, beer and 
spirits, though regional chains have developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm optimistic that we'll hit our five-year plan, which calls for 100 
stores," said Boone, who was only 30 when he launched Liquor Barn. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone declined to reveal his dollar volume for the first two days of 
operation, but said: "It was a lot -- an incredible order of magnitude greater 
than anything I saw at Liquor Barn or Cost Plus." (After heading up Liquor Barn 
for seven years, Boone became president and chief executive officer of Cost 
Plus for a time.)  
</P>
<P>
 "Our gross this past weekend was 65% ahead of plan," he said. "We were just 
blown away." 
</P>
<P>
 The Walnut Creek store features a wide selection of wine, single-malt Scotch 
and microbrews. Also among the 8,000 items stocked is a huge array of vinegars, 
olive oils, jams and jellies, mustards, sauces and condiments, and a 
bargain-priced coffee called Loss Leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone said 30% of the stock in each store would be high-quality food items. 
Industry analysts say it looks like a nationwide version of Trader Joe's, which 
operates 62 specialty food/beverage shops in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Shields, chief executive of Trader Joe's, said he didn't see Boone as 
a direct competitor. "About 90% of the wine we sell is under five bucks per 
bottle," he pointed out. And 80% of Trader Joe's $500 million in gross sales 
last year was in food. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors or not, Joe Coulombe, founder of Trader Joe's, said Boone will 
face problems going national. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example," said Coulombe, "it's impossible to have a chain of alcoholic 
beverage stores in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Colorado and some other 
states because it's against the law. In Pennsylvania, alcohol is almost 
entirely a state monopoly. In Arizona and Washington, all alcoholic beverages 
must be paid COD." 
</P>
<P>
 "This concept probably can't work in some markets," admitted Boone, "but we 
think we know the territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Boone, 45, said the tangled web of liquor regulation from state to state has 
sunk more than one aspiring national liquor chain. 
</P>
<P>
 He points to three factors in his favor. He has hired key retail executives 
away from Cost Plus, which has a substantial fine wine and upscale food 
operation. He has a line of credit from a major backer -- Madison Dearborn 
Partners of Chicago, the former investment arm of First Chicago Bank, which 
provided original funding for the Sports Authority chain of sporting goods 
stores that eventually was sold to K-Mart. And his first stores will open in 
buildings that once housed Liquor Barns. 
</P>
<P>
 Coulombe, who left Trader Joe's five years ago after selling the company to 
the Albrecht family of Germany and was recently named president of Petrini's 
markets in Northern California, added: "There are always opportunities for 
innovations in retailing, and a store with some of the elements of Trader Joe's 
can be successful elsewhere, but the pitfalls are everywhere."

WINE: BEATING THE BUBBLE TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the giant Italian wine producer Zonin decided a few years ago to make a 
Prosecco sparkling wine for the United States market, it realized that if the 
wine was as sparkling as it usually is, luxury taxes would push the price too 
high. So they hit on a way to make a nice wine that avoids most of the tax -- 
they cut back on the bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal and state excise taxes on a bottle of sparkling wine in California 
are almost 75 cents a bottle. And by the time that tax has ratcheted its way 
through the three-tier marketing system, it's almost $1.50. The tax on 
non-sparkling wine is about 26 cents a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, when that additional $1.50 is added to the $60 price of a bottle of 
Dom Perignon, no one blinks. But Zonin knew that the added $1.50 on top of its 
price for the Prosecco, which sells for well under $10 a bottle, could make a 
real difference. 
</P>
<P>
 So Zonin developed the wine, called Vivace, by a technique that gives it 
bubbles, but not as many as you'd find in a typical bubbly. Other Vivace 
semi-sparkling wines include a Chardonnay (with fresh, attractive aromas, if a 
bit soft); a wonderful wine called Primo Amore (a sweeter wine more like Asti 
Spumante), and a Merlot that reminds me of Brachetto d'Acqui, the slightly 
bubbly red wine of Italy that is usually sold only locally and rarely is seen 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, a wine qualifies as sparkling when the percentage of submerged 
CO2reaches .392 grams per hundred milliliters. Vivace , which means "lively" in 
Italian, is made with a level of just .372, so it is not "sparkling" in a legal 
sense, though it has ample bubbles. 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity between excise taxes on sparkling and still wines goes back to 
just after Prohibition. At that time, almost all the bubbly sold here was 
French Champagne; almost no sparkling wine was made in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress decided that, since Champagne was consumed only on special occasions 
such as birthdays, World Series victories and elections, it warranted a far 
stiffer federal excise tax than table wine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress felt the only people who drank Champagne were the affluent," says 
John De Luca, president of Wine Institute, the San Francisco-based trade 
association of the California wine industry. "Since it was then purely an 
imported product, they saw this as a tax on the affluent and on the French." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal tax on sparkling wine has been $3.40 a gallon for nearly 40 years. 
California state tax adds another 30 cents per gallon. Table wine, on the other 
hand, is taxed at a rate of $1.07 per gallon by the federal government, 20 
cents per gallon by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vivace wines are made by first fermenting grape juice into wine, then 
adding unfermented juice to start a second fermentation and capturing some of 
the bubbles. Since the juice may not come from the same vintage as the majority 
of the wine, the final product is not vintage dated. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, the new Vivace was just being introduced two weeks ago when, 
in a monumental move, New York cut its state sparkling wine tax from 95 cents 
per gallon to 19 cents per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 De Luca says he believes that was the first time in more than a half century 
that an alcoholic beverage tax was cut. He says his office could find only one 
other instance in modern U.S. history of an alcohol tax going down -- in the 
1930s when the federal tax on a gallon of wine was cut from 2 cents to a penny. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider this unprecedented and we hope to use it as a prototype in those 
states where there is a huge disparity between table wine and sparkling wine 
taxation," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our judgment, economic activity in general was hurt by (the older) tax," 
De Luca continues. "Reducing it will encourage sales of sparkling wine." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds James Trezise, head of the New York Wine and Grape Foundation: "The 
concept is: lower the price (of sparkling wine) for the consumer, increase 
consumption as a result; and then increase production as a result, and then 
increase investment and jobs as a result. . . . It makes sense for everybody."

PICADILLO: WHERE'S THE BEEF? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEV BENNETT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you had lunch in your school cafeteria or went to summer camp, you probably 
didn't escape childhood without eating sloppy Joes. Of all the institutional 
foods, sloppy Joes were probably the best tasting and best loved. You may even 
still crave them occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweet, barbecue-flavored beef packed into a bun would make a great 
back-yard entree for July Fourth. Or, you can heat the sloppy Joe mixture, 
spoon it into a vacuum container and take it to an evening picnic when you 
watch the fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 What you've undoubtedly outgrown is the overly sweet and fatty taste of those 
early sloppy Joe recipes. Picadillo, a Southwestern dish, is a distant cousin 
to sloppy Joe (although many cooks will be offended by the very thought). 
</P>
<P>
 It has the basic meat in a sauce that's slightly hot yet mellow. However, 
that's where the similarities end. Picadillo has a sophisticated blend of 
aromatic spices. Dried fruit, not sugar, rounds out the flavor. And in this 
version, ground turkey, not ground beef, is the base. No oil is called for, so 
there's no added fat. Heap picadillo on a bun with a side of maple-flavored 
carrots and improve on those childhood memories. PICADILLO WITH DRIED FRUIT 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound ground turkey 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 2 hamburger buns, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Brown turkey with shallots and garlic in medium nonstick skillet, about 10 
minutes. When meat is browned and shallots are tender, stir in chili powder, 
salt, oregano, cinnamon and hot pepper sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Add water and scrape up browned bits in skillet. Stir in raisins, apricots, 
tomato sauce and lemon juice. Simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes. Season to taste 
with pepper. Serve mixture plain or on buns. Makes 2 servings. MAPLE-FLAVORED 
CARROTS 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups baby carrots 
</P>
<P>
 1 serrano chile, cored, seeded and minced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup water 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon maple sprinkles 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Combine carrots, serrano chile, salt and water in 2-quart pan. Bring to boil. 
Reduce heat to medium and cook until carrots are tender and only 1 tablespoon 
water remains, about 15 minutes. Stir in butter, maple sprinkles and white 
pepper to taste. Makes 2 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : Maple sprinkles is granulated form of maple syrup. It is available in 
gourmet and natural-food stores. Otherwise, substitute 1 tablespoon maple 
syrup.

 ALHAMBRA: There are seven candidates for three seats on the City Council in 
the November election, according to the city clerk. With Monday's deadline for 
filing past, the most heavily contested race is in the 2nd District, where 
incumbent Barbara A. Messina faces Louis Kuan, Thaddeus Wiecek and Michael 
Raad. Council members Michael A. Blanco and Mary Louise Bunker are stepping 
down after serving the maximum 12 years. In Blanco's 5th District, Paul Talbot, 
a Chamber of Commerce president, faces Elizabeth Mack, a community activist. In 
Bunker's 1st District, Mark Paulson, a city planning commissioner, is 
unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 ARCADIA: The Santa Anita race track could be transformed into one of the 
biggest outdoor venues for music and entertainment in the Southland if the City 
Council gives final approval Tuesday to an ordinance allowing such events. The 
City Council last week voted 3-2 to give preliminary approval to the ordinance 
that allows the track to hold outdoor entertainment with a permit. Council 
members Sheng Chang and Barbara Kuhn dissented. After hours of debate, the 
council unanimously approved a $44.6-million budget for fiscal year 1994-95 
that cuts 5% from all departments and eliminates the vacant positions of 
community development director and assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 DIAMOND BAR: Frustrated by the City Council's deadlock over plans to build a 
permanent building for South Pointe Middle School, a group of residents has 
served papers initiating a recall drive on council members Eileen Ansari and 
Clair Harmony. However, the city clerk's office staff said the group failed to 
file papers with their office in the time required after serving a member and 
must now serve the council members again if they wish to proceed. Harmony said 
he supports the group's right to petition for a recall, but said he doubts it 
will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 GLENDORA: City Manager Arthur Cook acknowledged that the City Council 
inadvertently violated the new Brown Act by not scheduling a public comment 
during a May 25 budget workshop. Cook said the council omitted a comment period 
because the city had held a public hearing on the budget the night before, and 
under the old Brown Act a public comment period is not required at special 
meetings. But the new act stipulates that there must be time for citizens to 
voice their views at any meeting where the council takes action. At the budget 
meeting, he said, the council instructed the staff to put the budget in final 
form and review several recommended changes, a request that counted as a 
council action under the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 MONROVIA: The City Council in a closed session discussed but took no action on 
whether to sue Newco Waste Inc., which collects the city's trash. City 
officials declined to elaborate on the reasons for the discussion. The city, a 
finalist in the National Civic League's annual All-America Cities competition, 
failed by the slimmest margin to be among the 10 winners in the national 
competition. Monrovia finished 11th after tying for 10th on four ballots. 
Thirty cities made the two-day final in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 MONTEREY PARK: The City Council has extended to September negotiations with 
BCTC Development Corp. over the planned multimillion-dollar North Atlantic 
Avenue development. The council last year approved an $11.5-million investment 
in the proposed high-end mall and multiscreen cinema complex. Mayor Judy Chu 
dissented and Councilman Francisco Alonso abstained. Chu also dissented on a 
resolution passed by the council opposing the Alhambra City School District's 
proposed facilities assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA: The City Council has approved a $124-million budget for fiscal year 
1994-95 and voted to use half of a $2-million Rose Bowl rental fee from World 
Cup USA '94 to boost crime prevention. The budget was approved 5-1 with 
Councilman William E. Thomson Jr. dissenting and Councilman Isaac Richard 
absent. The $1 million will be used to pay for two new permanent police 
officers and a city prosecutor hired for a year on a contract basis. It will 
also be used for programs for parenting, summer jobs, recreation and park 
maintenance as well as a pilot gang intervention program. The other $1 million 
will be held in reserves in case the state cuts city funding or additional 
policing costs from the World Cup runs beyond $615,000. City Manager Phil 
Hawkey also announced that the Rose Bowl made a $200,000 profit. 
</P>
<P>
 TEMPLE CITY: The City Council has approved a new city budget, created a Public 
Safety Commission and abandoned plans for a park assessment district. The 
council approved a $10-million budget with minor cuts and a five-member 
commission to review public safety issues. The council also approved a law 
making it illegal for day laborers to solicit work on city sidewalks and 
decided against proceeding with an assessment on property to rebuild a center 
at Live Oak Park. 
</P>
<P>
 WALNUT: The Walnut Improvement Agency approved a $334,000 budget for the 
Material Recovery Facility Task Force, established to oppose the City of 
Industry's recycling facility, planned to be built next to Walnut. The budget 
includes $218,000 for hiring special legal counsel for a lawsuit against the 
recycling facility.

SHORT OF THE GOAL; VENDORS ASK CITY TO HELP SAVE TROUBLED SOCCER FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One week into its monthlong run, Pasadena's soccer festival has drawn dismally 
small crowds and low sales, angering vendors who paid thousands of dollars to 
set up booths for what was supposed to be a profitable celebration of World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business has been so bad even some of the vendors have decided not to bother 
coming today," vendor Gary Kum, of Tokyo Grill, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Called Soccer Carnaval, the festival was supposed to combine soccer 
activities, crafts, entertainment, an international food court and carnival 
rides. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival was launched after World Cup '94 organizers decided to place its 
official recreational event, Soccerfest, in Los Angeles instead of Pasadena. 
Soccer Carnaval was conceived as an alternative event that would run every day 
through the World Cup and pull in $3.2 million, including $650,000 for the 
city, from admission fees, booth rentals and corporate sponsorships. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time it opened June 23 in Brookside Park, Carnaval had failed to 
draw a major corporate sponsor, had dropped plans for an admission fee and had 
been forbidden by World Cup to hold the event on game days, when the crowds 
come into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff acknowledges that daily attendance has been below three figures. 
</P>
<P>
 And three days into the event, the carnival-ride operator dropped out because 
of the poor crowds, city staff said. On Saturday, the carnival rides sat quiet 
in the park because no one was riding. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the 35 vendors is threatening to sue and others are demanding a partial 
refund of their booth fees. Tokyo Grill paid $7,000 for its booth, but food 
vendors said most of their sales have come from other mechants in need of 
lunch. Some of the vendors are begging the City Council for help in turning the 
festival around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to generate (people). Right now we have more squirrels," said Jim 
Cuell, owner of Hudson Grill, who paid $4,000 for a booth. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Dillon, a souvenir seller from Montebello, said he decided against 
opening his booth after he picked up his permit and found the event would be 
closed on game days. He is threatening to sue, saying he paid $5,000 for a 
booth and that his contract said the carnival would operate every day through 
the month. There was no mention of exceptions in the contract, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another vendor, John Cummings, who sells official World Cup merchandise, said 
event organizer Pasadena Productions should give partial refunds to offset 
vendor losses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Duke Collister, a partner in Pasadena Productions, describes the problem in 
two words: "the heat." Collister said every day since Carnaval started, a heat 
wave has deterred customers, and that he expects the crowds to pick up over the 
holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry vendors calling themselves the Soccer Carnaval Vendors Assn. met with 
Pasadena Productions partners several times last week and took their fight for 
more promotion of the event to the City Council Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need advertising, promotion, celebrities -- a real conscious effort from 
the council," said Joyce Smith, a dollmaker and one of six vendors who attended 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all want to make money on this and make it a success," added Smith, who 
has not made a single sale and has $22,000 worth of dolls in stock, many of 
them specially made for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they decided on June 13 to open during game days -- against 
World Cup's wishes -- at a part of the park outside of the organization's 
control, but backed down after the soccer organization threatened to initiate 
legal action and to prevent access, as it controls area security. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us they'd slap a temporary restraining order on us . . . so we 
immediately afterwards decided to close game days," said Ed Sotelo, assistant 
city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup Assistant Vice President Brad Rothenberg has said that for security 
reasons, his organization did not want people flooding the area on game days. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also alleged that World Cup told major corporate sponsors to steer 
clear of the event. Rothenberg denied that accusation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City staff promised the council Monday they would do whatever they could to 
make Carnaval successful.  
</P>
<P>
 David Jacobs, acting director of the Rose Bowl, said the city has already put 
up banners and signs directing potential customers to the venue. He said the 
city is recruiting a new ride operator with bigger rides. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Chris Holden placed the blame for the problems on the private 
production company, not on the city. "The final responsibility rests with the 
person hired for the job," he said. Holden said the staff seems to be doing the 
job of the production company. 
</P>
<P>
 A concerned Councilman Bill Crowfoot asked city staff, "Are we clear who is 
doing what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Productions won the contract to organize the event in February. The 
contract stipulates that the organizers will split the profits with the city, 
but will absorb the costs if Soccer Carnaval loses money. 
</P>
<P>
 Collister said the company is taking steps to improve Carnaval with more 
advertising, moving the music closer to the front of the venue and bring in a 
new big carnival. He said, "I think it will work out."

CITY'S MANAGERS TO FORM BARGAINING UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN UHRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena City Hall managers, some of them the highest paid employees working 
for the city, have voted to form a collective bargaining unit to negotiate 
their salaries and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena Management Assn., composed of planners, engineers, nurses and 
professionals with salaries ranging from $50,000 to $75,000 a year, voted 273 
to 67 to form a collective bargaining unit for the 440 members. Ballots were 
tabulated last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Association President Mike Milliner, administrative officer for information 
systems and technology for the Water and Power Department, characterized the 
vote as "historic." A handful of Southern California cities, including Santa 
Monica, Burbank, Culver City and Hermosa Beach, have collective bargaining for 
management employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Milliner was quick to point out that the vote was not a vote against City 
Manager Phil Hawkey or the current administration at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to just hold the line," Milliner said. "Some people want to see this 
as a referendum on the current administration. The Pasadena Management Assn. 
does not aspire to that position." 
</P>
<P>
 The drive to organize a collective bargaining unit for mid- and top-level 
managers started two years ago. At that time, city management decided to close 
a projected $10-million budget gap in part by eliminating raises, suspending 
merit pay and freezing car allowances for management employees. Over the past 
three years, managers have lost $5.2 million in salaries and benefits while 
workers represented by unions have seen wages and benefits go up more than $4 
million during the same period, Milliner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Olguin, a management association board member, said the vote indicated 
employees felt strongly about the cuts in their salaries and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There could have been other ways we could have met revenue shortfalls without 
taking the salary cuts and freezes that we did," said Olguin, a project planner 
with the Planning and Permitting Department,  
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey could not be reached for comment.

TOPIC / EDUCATION; OFFICIALS ASSAIL DECISION TO REVERSE EXPULSIONS; IN A LETTER 
TO COUNTY BOARD, CLAREMONT SCHOOL AND CITY LEADERS SAY ITS ACTION OVERTURNING A 
DISTRICT RULING TO EXPEL THREE STUDENTS ACCUSED OF HATE CRIMES IS CONTRARY TO 
'THE TENETS OF PROVIDING SAFE SCHOOLS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Claremont school district officials and city leaders this month sent a letter 
condemning the county board of education's unilateral decision to overturn a 
district ruling that expelled three high school students accused of racially 
motivated vandalism and assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, which was sent to the County Board of Supervisors and signed by 
the Claremont Unified School District board as well as the City Council, mayor 
and chief of police, said the county's decision was "diametrically opposed to 
the tenets of providing safe schools in safe communities." 
</P>
<P>
 This was one of four cases of expulsion countywide reversed this year by the 
county board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't take it to court and appeal the county's decision because of our 
low budget," said Lissa Petersen, president of the Claremont school board. 
</P>
<P>
 The county board reversed the district's decision in May, but has yet to 
submit a reason for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really hard thing for me, because I haven't received anything in 
writing about why they did this," said Charles Freitas, director of child 
welfare and attendance in the Claremont schools. "I'm eagerly awaiting some 
type of explanation." 
</P>
<P>
 That explanation was delayed by the busy schedule of county attorneys, who 
must review the letter before it is sent out, said Frank Kwan, the county's 
communication director. The letter will be sent to district officials in a few 
days, he said. Kwan also said the county has not received the district's letter 
yet.  
</P>
<P>
 The three students remain unidentified because they are minors; they were 
among 15 to 20 Asian students who reportedly chased a white student into a car 
in the school's parking lot. The students hit and kicked the car, breaking its 
windshield and causing about $2,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 An administrative panel, made up of three district principals, recommended 
that the school board expel five students, but board members felt there was 
only enough evidence to expel three of the five. The boys' parents appealed to 
the county education board. 
</P>
<P>
 After the county overturned the expulsions, one student returned to an 
alternative high school in the district. The two other students, one of whom 
graduated in June, chose to enroll in schools outside the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Five youths were arrested by police after the attack, but neither police nor 
the school board would confirm whether all or any of these five were among 
those recommended for expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of those arrested are juveniles, whose names were not released. The two 
others are Jason Tsai and Luke Chang, both 18, who were charged with assault 
and vandalism. In a plea bargain, the boys pleaded guilty to vandalism and the 
charges of assault were dropped. Tsai and Chang are on probation for two years 
and each must pay $1,000 in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem started in school, when a white boy smeared a banana on an Asian 
girl's locker. Although Freitas did not think it was initially a racial 
incident, he said there were clearly racial divisions later on, in the school's 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not had something the size of this incident for as long as I can 
remember," Freitas said. "There haven't been any problems since."

TOPIC / ENVIRONMENT; TRANQUILIZER RIFLES GIVEN TO WARDENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of a wildlife society established after the shooting of a bear in 
Azusa presented two tranquilizer rifles to the state Department of Fish and 
Game in the Monrovia City Council chambers Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Mountains Bear and Wildlife Preservation Society, formed 
earlier this month, raised about $1,000 in 12 days to buy the rifles, said 
Craig Bonholtzer, founder and president. Bonholtzer said 16 individuals and 
organizations, including local police unions, contributed to the fund.  
</P>
<P>
 Bonholtzer established the society after the May 20 shooting of a California 
black bear that wandered onto Azusa streets.  
</P>
<P>
 A May 31 police report said that Fish and Game wardens lacked the proper 
equipment to tranquilize the animal.

TOPICS / TRANSPORTATION; FREE SHUTTLES SERVE HUNDREDS EACH DAY; PASADENA WILL 
SPEND $500,000 ANNUALLY TO KEEP SIX BUSES RUNNING. STATE SALES TAX REVENUE WILL 
BE USED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena's free shuttle buses, which began running earlier this month, have 
been ferrying about 440 Pasadena residents and World Cup fans a day through the 
city's restaurant, shopping and entertainment districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will spend about $500,000 a year to keep six buses running Monday to 
Saturday through Old Pasadena, the Playhouse District and South Lake Avenue, 
officials said.The money will come from state sales tax revenue earmarked for 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The buses run west along Colorado Boulevard and east on Green Street, between 
North Orange Grove and Catalina avenues. They also head south along Lake Avenue 
and make a loop through the South Lake Shopping District. 
</P>
<P>
 The service is offered from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Thursday, from 11 
a.m. to 9 p.m. on Fridays, and from noon until 8 p.m. on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The buses stop every 12 minutes from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday. 
The rest of the time, they pass every 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials added an aesthetic touch to their new shuttle service: Each of 
the 25-seat buses is decorated with a mural and features a taped message 
relating to the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena paid artists $2,500 for each of the murals, and an additional $6,000 
to $8,000 to have them reproduced and installed on the buses. The murals depict 
various themes ranging from the arts to the environment.

BUSINESS; METAL DETECTOR SALES RISE WITH CRIME; SECURITY: USE OF THE DEVICES 
HAS INCREASED AT NIGHTCLUBS AND EVEN PRIVATE PARTIES. THEIR PRESENCE ALONE 
SERVES AS A DETERRENT TO HANDGUNS, ONE VENDOR SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Stephen Ryland's Pasadena shop caters to amateur miners, offering racks of 
coin detectors, sluices and maps to part-time prospectors who spend their 
weekends hunting buried treasure and soft nuggets of gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, though, business has picked up for devices that detect a different 
kind of metal: the hard steel of handguns and assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The metal detector used at the party in San Marino where two teen-agers were 
killed June 5 was there as a novelty, party-goers said, to provide a kick. But 
sales of the devices are serious business -- a booming business. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryland, who also has sold security equipment for 10 years at his shop, 
Cal-Gold Enterprises, saw sales of the devices double in the late 1980s. Last 
year he said he sold 25 to 30 hand-held metal detectors, mainly to local clubs 
and concert venues, although he declined to name any specifically. Since 
January, he has sold twice that many, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until only a few years ago, he said, metal detectors were used primarily at 
airports, political conventions, the Olympics and some rap shows. Now they're 
standard equipment at nightclubs, card clubs, many schools and almost all major 
concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Metal detectors come in two varieties. The walk-through kind retail at $3,000 
to $4,500, and hand-held devices cost $120 to $230. The type and number of 
devices used depend on what kind of club is using them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a supper club in Pasadena, they may not have any," he said. "If it's 
a place in South-Central, they may have two or three." 
</P>
<P>
 The devices play both a pragmatic and psychological role in preventing weapon 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 "The philosophy is that metal detectors exist as much as a deterrent as they 
do as a true detector," Ryland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryland said that he has sold one or two of the devices for use at private 
parties, but that's rare. He warns that in amateur hands they can create a 
false sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have a reasonably well-trained person (using them), they may not 
help," he said. "Sure they work. But what if you find something? After you do 
the detection you have to have people trained to follow up. . . . That's why 
the deterrent effect is good, because it keeps them from even having that 
confrontation."

 The Metropolitan Museum of Art opened a shop in Old Pasadena on Sunday. It is 
the third such shop to open in the Los Angeles area, and the 14th in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The store, at the One Colorado shopping plaza, features reproductions from the 
museum's collection, including cards, calendars, stationery, jewelry, scarves, 
books, glass and silver. 
</P>
<P>
 The store will have a more extensive print and poster collection than the 
museum's other shops, and will change themes monthly to correspond with museum 
exhibits.

 More than 2,000 dripping customers took the plunge last month at the opening 
of Raging Waters' newest water slide, the four-story Vortex. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride hurls visitors at 20 m.p.h. down 270-foot plumes flooded by fog, 
wind, pulsating lights and electrical storm-like sound effects. The Vortex took 
120 days to build and cost about $500,000.

 COVINA: Baldwin Park police officers chased suspects in a gang-related 
shooting Sunday through the streets of Covina, where the pursuit ended when the 
suspects crashed their Ford Probe into another car, driven by an LAPD officer, 
which then hit a pedestrian. John Duarte 29, and Frank Porcho, 21, both of 
Baldwin Park, were arrested and taken to Covina City Jail on suspicion of 
attempted murder and felony hit-and-run charges. 
</P>
<P>
 LA PUENTE: A 29-year-old La Puente man was fatally shot Saturday night in 
front of his home in the 500 block of League Avenue. Johnny Hernandez Lopez was 
shot once in the upper torso and was taken to Queen of the Valley Hospital in 
West Covina, where he died about 40 minutes after the 11 p.m. shooting,

EX-MORTICIAN PLEADS GUILTY IN BUS COUPON SCAM; CRIME: DAVID SCONCE ALSO FACES 
CHARGES IN PASADENA SUPERIOR COURT OF CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 David Sconce, former operator with his parents of Lamb Funeral Home in 
Pasadena, pleaded guilty Wednesday in an Arizona courtroom to fraudulently 
selling phony bus coupons. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea came after he surrendered Tuesday to Mojave County sheriff's deputies 
in Kingman, Ariz., 19 days after he disappeared in an apparent attempt to elude 
arrest warrants issued in two states. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities in Arizona and California had issued the warrants after Sconce 
failed to appear in court earlier this month to answer charges in separate 
criminal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sconce, who in 1987 was accused with his parents of multiple cremations and 
mutilation of corpses while running a Pasadena mortuary, will be sentenced July 
28 in Arizona in the bus-coupon scam. He faces the possibility of up to five 
years in an Arizona state prison on the felony fraud charge, said Craig 
Friesner, a prosecutor with Mojave County. 
</P>
<P>
 Sconce still faces trial in Pasadena Superior Court on a charge of conspiracy 
to commit murder. Sconce is accused of trying to hire someone in 1986 to kill 
Elie Estephan, a potential buyer of a rival crematory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in no hurry, but I'm not letting up on him," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Harvey Giss, who is prosecuting Sconce. 
</P>
<P>
 Sconce's guilty plea caps three months of seesawing legal moves between 
California and Arizona authorities that began in April after Sconce was 
arrested in Bullhead City, Ariz., for allegedly forging and selling about $400 
worth of bus coupons. The Arizona charges are the latest chapter in the 
seven-year prosecution of Sconce and his parents, Laurieanne and Jerry. 
</P>
<P>
 All three were accused in 1987 of mishandling hundreds of bodies cremated in 
Altadena and at a ceramics factory in Hesperia. His parents, who were acquitted 
in 1992 on charges of multiple cremations and commingling of remains, are 
scheduled to appear in Pasadena Superior Court on Aug. 12 on remaining charges 
stemming from the funeral home operation. 
</P>
<P>
 David Sconce pleaded guilty in 1989 to 21 criminal charges and served 2 1/2 
years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the remaining California criminal charge of conspiracy to commit 
murder, David Sconce had been free without bail on his own recognizance and 
living in Bullhead City, where he worked as a bus driver for 18 months, 
prosecutor Giss said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on April 11, Sconce was arrested in Arizona after the operators of 
Laughlin Transit, Sconce's employer, discovered the forgery of about 400 $20 
and $18 bus coupons good for discounted rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Sconce pleaded not guilty to those charges during an arraignment April 12 and 
was set free on $10,000 bail, which he met by putting up a family owned cabin 
near Lake Mead as collateral, said Friesner in Mojave County.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; WORLD CUP; SNAPSHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a little wacky out there. 
</P>
<P>
 A 300-pound inflatable crab bobs atop a Pasadena restaurant, its greedy 
pincers clutching -- what else? -- soccer balls. A Pas adena optometrist hawks 
World Cup souvenirs at a roadside stand. A bartender in Old Pasadena kicks more 
soccer balls behind the bar than he spears olives with swizzle sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 But it won't be long before World Cup leaves town and life gets back to normal 
(until Jan. 1, that is). 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on how you look at it, the local World Cup spectacle is, whew, half 
over -- or, hey, only half-begun, with four games down and four to go. The 
monthlong international soccer tournament started June 17 in nine U.S. cities, 
including Pasadena, which will host the championship game at the Rose Bowl on 
July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 For local residents, the question has been not so much which team is going to 
hoist the 18-karat gold trophy but: What's the traffic like? What's the 
economic impact? What's the long-term 0 benefit? 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the local impact -- giddiness, notwithstanding -- is hard to gauge. 
The business news so far has been mixed, and merchants are withholding judgment 
until the final week, when some are bracing for Super Bowl fever times 
infinity. But aside from a few political flaps and traffic problems, most local 
authorities already are pronouncing the event a success, if only because the 40 
law enforcement agencies hunkered at their Rose Bowl command post haven't had 
to handle marauding hooligans or bomb scares. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased with the first games," said Pasadena Police Cmdr. Mary 
Schander. "We have (four) more to go, and they'll build in intensity as we get 
closer to the championships." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the remaining game days poses a special problem: On July 3, traffic is 
expected to be especially heavy because of the Fourth of July weekend; on July 
13, the game starts at 4:30 p.m., just as Wednesday evening rush hour starts; 
and on July 16 and 17, the final games, tensions are expected to be high. 
Schander advised residents to avoid the freeways adjacent to the Rose Bowl on 
game days, especially two hours before starting time and 1 1/2 hours after the 
game's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a UCLA game or even a Rose Bowl game," said Schander, who has 
fielded hundreds of media calls since the World Cup began. "It's bigger, and 
the duration is longer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But whether the enthusiasm will translate into local dollars is another 
question. Merchants are unsure whether to believe a rosy USC study that 
predicts World Cup will bring more than $523 million in business to Pasadena 
and the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses -- such as restaurants, bars and souvenir shops -- are going 
great guns, said Jack Smith, president of the Old Pasadena Business and 
Professional Assn. But for others, it's business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be realistic about why people come to these events," he said. 
"They're down here to have a good time. If they're from another country, they 
don't necessarily want to buy an armoire and throw it on a plane." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who owns California Basket Co. in Old Pasadena, is among those whose 
business has not picked up in response to the Cup. Still, he said, he's 
"tickled to death" that the World Cup is here and predicts a long-term boon 
from all the publicity. Each World Cup game is expected to draw about 100,000 
people; the championship game alone is expected to draw 2 billion TV viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have a huge, world-class event seen by billions of people," 
Smith said, "and it focuses on Pasadena, people will say, 'I've heard of that. 
It's a neat area.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the publicity has backfired. 
</P>
<P>
 Media reports warning people to stay away from the Pasadena area on game days 
are hurting business, complained Michael Haddad, owner of West of Java, a 
furniture and accessory store in Old Pasadena. In fact, said Haddad, police are 
doing such a good job with traffic control that thousands of visitors are 
bypassing Old Pasadena entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be a disastrous month for us," said Haddad, who sat in 
his empty store, two hours before game time on a recent afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 And some of the publicity has put Pasadena in a bickering limelight. City 
officials feuded with World Cup authorities over Pasadena's family oriented 
soccer festival, Soccer Carnaval, and a World Cup sign at the Rose Bowl that 
said "Los Angeles"; Pasadena officials eventually agreed to not hold the 
carnival on game days and worked out an agreement to erect a separate Pasadena 
sign nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, international visitors are seeing Pasadena at its best, all 
decked out and spruced up, like a high school gym at senior prom. Several 
international visitors have remarked that Pasadena reminds them of a small 
European town, said Denise Nelson Nash, the city's coordinator for World Cup 
affairs. Tourists are so enthusiastic that the city's two information kiosks in 
Old Pasadena -- each stocked on game days and weekends with more than 3,000 
brochures on restaurants, special events and maps -- have nearly run out of 
material, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are taking away (the feeling) that this is a very special 
community where you can feel at home and a community that you want to come back 
to," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The carpe diem mood is striking locals too. 
</P>
<P>
 At Il Fornaio restaurant, regulars are wagering on World Cup games. On the 
lawn in front of John Bull English Pub, optometrist Gail Murphy temporarily set 
up a souvenir stand so she could get in on the action. And at Wise Guys bar in 
Old Pasadena, bartender George Alberto's playful soccer-ball kicks sometime 
knock down plastic beer pitchers to the brick floor. 
</P>
<P>
 One night, Colombian native Rafael Marin grabbed his video camera to tape 
Alberto's antics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Beautiful," said Marin, a 52-year-old Miami pediatrician, his voice heavy 
with emotion. "The blood is warming up here." 
</P>
<P>
 He slammed a fist into his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're feeling like we're in the right place." 
</P>
<P>
 Some say that spirits are so high that Pasadena can't help basking in the 
afterglow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a harmonic convergence," offered Frank Van Joolen, a 44-year-old 
Pasadena hospital orderly, his Netherlands World Cup cap snug on his head. "The 
world's soul is here, right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Others find local enthusiasm lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing like the Super Bowl or the Rose Bowl or the Olympics," mused 
Robert Dang, a 30-year-old production coordinator for a Thailand news crew. He 
struggled for the proper analogy, and then it hit him: "I'd say like another 
golf game." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Dang said, for a Bangkok TV news story, his crew interviewed people 
in Pasadena, Rosemead and El Monte to check out the local response to World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're like, 'World Cup? What is World Cup?' " 
</P>
<P>
 At Viva Pasadena, an open-air market set up for the games, sparse crowds have 
wandered through the 120 booths featuring crafts, souvenirs and food. A large 
Cameroonian contingent sat morosely at picnic tables for a ham-and-cheese 
sandwich lunch, lamenting the low-key atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not big at all," complained Cameroonian fan Afata Andre, a 34-year-old 
professional drummer who wore a tattered San Diego Chargers cap. "Four years 
ago in Italy (at the World Cup games), it was so nice. Not like this. It was a 
party." 
</P>
<P>
 But from a Pasadena perspective, the city put on a whole new face to welcome 
the Cup. World Cup banners hang almost everywhere, World Cup trash cans and ads 
dot what seems like every street; even churches unfurl signs that welcome 
soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup merchandise is sold at department stores, grocery stores and hotels, 
and at tables in the parking lots of liquor stores, bars and gas stations. Kids 
trade World Cup pogs, fans wear T-shirts that boldly proclaim, "Soccer is Life" 
and residents buy the very local "South Lake Avenue" World Cup pins. 
</P>
<P>
 High culture isn't immune to the World Cup bandwagon, either: the Pacific Asia 
Museum is exhibiting an Edo period scroll showing two boys playing soccer, and 
the Pasadena Pops orchestra will perform Saturday at Descanso Gardens in a 
musical salute to World Cup countries. Crowds are steady at the Armory Center 
for the Arts' exhibition, "The World of Cups," featuring cups in different art 
forms commissioned from prominent artists; visitors even dropped by on a 
Monday, when the art gallery was closed, said Torri Scott, marketing manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have more than doubled the number of officers on full-time foot patrol 
in Old Pasadena to a total of 25 during World Cup, Sgt. Jim Shear said, 
although problems so far have been mostly confined to a few drunks. 
</P>
<P>
 On foot patrol one night, Pasadena Police Officer Ed Calatayud stopped in 
alarm when a man leaving a souvenir shop told him: "There's a robbery in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 And then the man grinned: " A jacket for $1,500." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds have been rowdy but good-humored, said Michael Vieyra, the doorman at 
Q's Billiard Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "This town has really come alive," said Vieyra, 28, watching a postgame crowd 
stream steadily by. "It took me back to high school when I used to go down to 
Palm Springs, and people were going up and down the street, screaming and 
waving. It was cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Even residents who have to put up with the traffic and noise are mostly 
good-natured about the disruption. Steve Bridges, president of the Linda 
Vista/Annandale homeowners association, said he has heard few complaints from 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighborhood seemed very quiet except for the normal noise you associate 
with the Rose Bowl," he said. "For having a major event like that, (police) did 
a very good job." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in neighborhoods near the Rose Bowl, a few residents turned 
entrepreneurs, hawking lemonade, hot dogs and other refreshments behind the 
backs of police who shut down stands that lack business permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Davids, 13, and a friend sold cold drinks out of their backpacks to fans 
walking to a game last week. They've been averaging $400 profit a game but are 
unmoved by the whole spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like any other day," Scott said. "Cops close the street, people walk 
through, next day, it's all over." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent game day, resident Ray Brown stood across from the Rose Bowl in 
withering heat, trying to wave passing cars into his church lot, where the 
parking fee was $20. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours after the game, the Rose Bowl was a darkened, empty shell, its end 
zone littered with empty water bottles and film canisters left by 
photographers. Under a bright moon, the trampled field perked up under the 
shower of giant sprinklers, ready for another day. What's Left? 
</P>
<P>
 There are four more World 
</P>
<P>
 Cup games at the Rose Bowl: 
</P>
<P>
 July 3, Sunday: Round of 16 
</P>
<P>
 match, 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 July 13, Wednesday: Semifinal, 4:30 
</P>
<P>
 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 July 16, Saturday: Third-fourth place 
</P>
<P>
 game, 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 July 17, Sunday: Final, 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 What's 
</P>
<P>
 Left? 
</P>
<P>
 There are four more WorldCup games at the Rose Bowl:  
</P>
<P>
 July 3, Sunday: Round of 16 match, 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 July 13, Wednesday: Semifinal, 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 July 16, Saturday: Third-fourth place game, 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 July 17, Sunday: Final, 12:30 p.m. A Kick in the Wallet 
</P>
<P>
 So you decide to experience the World Cup on the cheaps, with a $25 ticket for 
the nosebleed section. 
</P>
<P>
 Better bring some extra money. With parking and a couple of snacks, the price 
of your day will easily double. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a sample of prices that could leave your wallet as empty as Morocco's 
score sheet: 
</P>
<P>
 * It's less convenient but more expensive: Parking at the Parsons Corp. 
shuttle lot in Old Pasadena costs $15. The shuttle is free. But the Rose Bowl 
parking lot costs only $10. 
</P>
<P>
 * Coca-Cola in World Cup souvenir cup goes for $4.50. No such thing as free or 
reduced-price refills; you just buy a new cup. Coke is only $3 in a regular 
cup, but the vendors for those are only in the stands and hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 * A liter of bottled water sells for $4. You can bring your own bottle of 
water, but caps are not allowed, which leaves you the fun of keeping it from 
spilling. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Big Mac, $4 
</P>
<P>
 * A can of soda costs only $1 from one of the kids selling them in the Rose 
Bowl lot from ice-filled garbage cans. But sellers don't have permits. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you passed up the souvenir cup and want a memento of the experience, 
souvenirs range from $38 for a U.S. team T-shirt to an official World Cup 
soccer ball for $195 (the balls are available at Sport Chalet for $99.)

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Walnut Library will reduce its hours beginning Friday, opening only on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1 to 8 p.m. The library previously was open five 
days a week, but continuing budget crunches in the county library system forced 
some new cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduction will save the financially troubled county library system about 
$171,000 over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The book drop in the parking lot will remain open 24 hours a day. On the days 
when the Walnut Library is closed, library employees suggest that patrons use 
the libraries in Rowland Heights and Diamond Bar.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Monrovia-based World Vision U.S. has signed an agreement to buy 15 acres in 
the Seattle area to build a four-story headquarters building. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, World Vision U.S. announced a cost-saving plan to sell its 11 
buildings in the San Gabriel Valley and look for new headquarters.World Vision 
U.S. officials estimated that the agency will save about $5 million a year by 
making the move. The international Christian relief and development agency has 
been in Monrovia since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 World Vision U.S. bought the land in the city of Federal Way from Weyerhaeuser 
Co. for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of World Vision's employees -- about 300 people -- indicated 
that they would relocate to the Seattle area, according to an in-house survey. 
World Vision expects to make the move by September, 1995.

COMMUNITY NEWS: POMONA; POLICE OFFICE OPENS DOWNTOWN ON 'ANTIQUE ROW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's newest police office is nestled between stores that tout old 
political buttons, decades-old lamps and other antique wares. In an office 
complete with a vintage radio, the Pomona Police Department opened its fifth 
community service center earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 This center, at 106 S. Locust St. in the "antique row" district of the 
downtown area, is being funded by the Pomona Central Business District. 
</P>
<P>
 Area business owners are providing the rent money for their new neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives you a more secure feeling," said Mike Hunter, who along with wife 
Debi runs Hunter's Collectibles next door to the police center. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will be the home of the department's graffiti/abatement coordinator 
and the department's new STOP (Stop Trouble Occurring in Pomona) team.

THEATER REVIEW; CAST BREATHES NEW LIFE INTO 'HASTY HEART' AT KNIGHTSBRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Knightsbridge Theatre, which threw open its doors exactly a year ago next 
week, has survived to its first birthday on a promising note. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while it looked like the shops and watering holes of Old Pasadena were 
less than hospitable to a steady diet of classical and modern theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But co-artistic directors (and husband and wife) Joe and Barbara Stachura, 
while amazingly staging an alternating menu of three different plays each week, 
seem to be winning the box office battle. 
</P>
<P>
 A cynic might say it was just a case of international soccer fans pouring into 
Old Pasadena after a Saturday match and accidentally stumbling into the 
Knightsbridge because they were lost -- but the Knightsbridge was jammed that 
day (the first full house this reviewer has experienced there) for the World 
War II-era comedy/drama "The Hasty Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 John Patrick's look at soldiers convalescing in a British MASH-like hospital 
hut in Burma in 1943 has long been a staple of small theater. It's also gone 
big time: It was a movie starring Ronald Reagan and Richard Todd in 1949, and 
the Ahmanson Theatre staged it in 1982 with Gregory Harrison in the title role 
of a bitter Scotsman who is dying but doesn't know it. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Knightsbridge, director Hugh Harrison and a textured ensemble cast 
breathe new life into a play that, while tautly written, does creak a bit in 
its construction and predictability. But its humor and human crucible have aged 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 A bunch of disparate military guys recovering from wounds in a bamboo medical 
ward are ordered to be nice to a new arrival because he's dying from a shrapnel 
wound and kidney failure, although he hasn't been told. The catch is that the 
new guy is impossible to like, with a chip on his shoulder as towering as the 
palm trees in the nearby jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second act he undergoes what is tantamount to a spiritual conversion 
("I shared a moment with kings," he says of the guys around him) and everyone 
in the play is a changed character by the end. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances are an audience pleaser if strongly acted, and this 
production's unwitting protagonist, the surly Scotsman named Lachlen, is 
superbly portrayed by Al Nowicki. The impressive actor also lays down a perfect 
Scottish accent but not so intrusive that it calls attention to itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scot's chief rival is the lone Yank in the ward (the old Ronald Reagan 
role), a brash, affable type vividly captured by the appealing Bruce McKenna, 
who adopts the period's wet-hair look and wire glasses. A no-nonsense nurse 
(played by Patricia Neal in the '49 movie) is crisply delivered by Stephanie 
Moffett. 
</P>
<P>
 One character, a black soldier called Blossom, can't speak, and it's the 
subtle achievement of Bobby Gene Mitchell that his muteness is as touching as 
it is and clearly the show's most visually expressive element. 
</P>
<P>
 Other characters include a New Zealander (Robert Bruce); an Aussie (Greg 
Fitchitt); an irritatingly shrill and self-satisfied, obese limey (the overripe 
Andrew Barach in the production's singular, glaring misstep), and a 
stiff-upper-lip British colonel (deftly performed by stand-in Hal Edwards). 
</P>
<P>
 It's the colonel who finally tells the Scotsman he's got but weeks to live, in 
a dramatic scene notable for the victim's sense of betrayal by mates he thought 
truly liked him -- who by now actually do. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Hasty Heart," Knightsbridge Theatre, 35 S. Raymond Ave., Pasadena, 5 
p.m. Saturday, 8 p.m. Sunday. Ends July 17. $15. (818) 440-0821. Running time:

AUDIENCES 'ADOPT' PROPS TO HELP PROP UP THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to put a new face on fund raising, the Music Theatre of Southern 
California is inviting the public to "adopt" props, sets and costumes for its 
upcoming production of "Peter Pan." 
</P>
<P>
 Marjorie Lindbeck, development director for the San Gabriel theater, said she 
thought it would be enticing for people to donate by giving money that is then 
designated as purchasing a specific item, such as Capt. Hook's hook or 
Tinkerbell's bell. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Lindbeck said, about $5,000 has been raised from people adopting props 
and other items in the play, which runs July 8-24. Donors can adopt such items 
as Tinkerbell's laser light for $500, or a bargain item such as Smee's hat for 
$10. "Everything helps," Lindbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, donors will receive certificates acknowledging their participation, 
will have their names included in the program and will be able to go backstage 
to mingle with the actors after the curtain goes down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lasting gift," Lindbeck said. "Theater is a magical thing, and I 
thought this would be a good way to include people in that." 
</P>
<P>
 About 35% of the theater's $1.3-million annual budget comes from donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Wilbert of Chino Hills, who used to sit on the theater's board of 
directors, donated $50 for the toy blocks used in the play on behalf of her 
10-year-old son, Jeremy. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Peter Pan' was the only musical production I had ever missed at the 
theater," Wilbert said. "So I'm really glad I'll have the chance to see it."

HAVING A BALL DURING CAMP; RECREATION: SUMMER BASKETBALL TRAINING SESSIONS GAIN 
POPULARITY AMONG COACHES AND PARENTS. YOUNGSTERS SAY THEY HAVE FUN WHILE 
IMPROVING THEIR SKILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The temperature was over 100 degrees outdoors and only somewhat cooler inside 
the La Canada High School gym. But the heat didn't seem to bother the 90 boys 
dressed in T-shirts, shorts and basketball shoes who sat on the floor 
encircling La Canada Coach Tom Hofman. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys, ages 7 through 13, looked star-struck as Hofman introduced current 
and former La Canada players who would serve as counselors during the seventh 
annual Spartan basketball camp. After a pep talk about working hard, having fun 
and drinking plenty of water during breaks, the boys lined up in groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the din of bouncing basketballs could drown out the excited chatter 
of the campers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the third year I've been here," said Peter Deutsch, 11. "It's fun 
playing with friends and learning a lot of drills that we can practice at home. 
This is a good way to spend part of the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 High school and college basketball coaches in the San Gabriel Valley 
apparently agree. Each year, more and more coaches are overseeing summer camps, 
which can generate a few to many thousands of dollars in revenue and provide 
youngsters with a basketball learning experience. Some camps are operated 
through the local recreation departments, others through the coaches and 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 La Canada and Glendora are probably the area's most popular and profitable 
camps. Both benefit from the high school programs' consistent success and 
community support. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartan camp, for example, has grown from a single one-week session that 
drew 37 kids to three sessions that are each filled to capacity with 90 
campers. The cost is $125. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our primary interest in starting the camp was to develop interest in the 
community," said Hofman, who has coached eight seasons at La Canada. "But you 
also hope to develop skills at a young age. I think everyone on last year's 
varsity went to the camp at one time or another."  
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat High School Coach Alex Acosta oversees a one-week camp that 
attracted more than 70 campers this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mainly, it's for our incoming freshmen to get a jump on basketball, and we 
also get a lot of grade-school kids that have brothers and sisters going to the 
high school," Acosta said. "The main thing is how much fun they have. Some kids 
are going to learn something new and others are just going to play around. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a kid who's teetering on the edge of whether he's going to stay 
in sports, you can help keep him interested by showing him how to play and 
keeping him out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Most camps include instruction in drills for dribbling, passing, shooting and 
defense. Contests in free-throw shooting are staples. The focus is on 
individual development rather than team play. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this camp, they stress skills, sportsmanship and what each individual can 
do," said Pam Como of La Canada, whose 8-year-old son, Giovanni, is attending 
the La Canada camp for the first time. "It's not so much somebody against 
someone else. I liked that attitude, that you can improve yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 The kids say they enjoy almost every aspect of the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shooting baskets, passing, all that stuff," said Danny McCoy, 7. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have contests and learn new drills and you can play games at the end 
of the day," said Mark Eisen, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Hofman said the counselors are key to a successful camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person in charge is significant, but you need counselors that are patient 
and work well with kids," Hofman said. "The kids in the camp look up to them 
because they're former players." Parents considering sending their child to any 
basketball camp should talk to others who have attended, Hofman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's camps that stress fundamentals and there are camps that stress the 
celebrities," Hofman said. "If you go to a camp that has 300 or 400 kids, 
you're probably not going to get much individual instruction, but you might 
have fun rubbing shoulders with some big names. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both experiences can be beneficial if they inspire a kid to keep playing and 
get better."

 The Senate has unanimously approved legislation calling for 25-year-to-life 
prison sentences for convicted first-time child molesters and violent rapists.

<P>
 A 33-0 vote sent the bill (SB 26X) by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach)

eight years to life imprisonment for child molesters and rapists.

 "Three strikes is too many -- their first strike should be their last," 
Bergeson said. "It is time to portray rapists and child molesters as what they 
are -- dangerous felons who should not be allowed to repeat their crimes."

 The world's largest black armband: Sure, it's another distinction that L.A. 
can claim. A black bandage has been wrapped around the City Hall tower for more 
than six months -- not as a symbol of mourning, as some visitors have thought, 
but as a safety net for earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Depressing any way you look at it. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the City Council has approved a motion by Councilwoman Laura Chick "to 
evaluate the feasibility of decorating" the net. And Patrick Media Group, the 
billboard people, have agreed to donate their services. "We're not saying it 
should be a mural or a symbol or what," said Eric Rose, a Chick deputy. "But we 
should be able to come up with something. We have the most creative artists in 
the world in Southern California."

<P>
 Recommendations are due in three weeks. To do its part, this column is calling 
upon readers to submit ideas to us in the form of drawings. And, naturally, the 
most creative will be awarded with prizes from Only in L.A.'s Cave of Wonders.

 His lucky number?Numerologists no doubt are following the still-uncertified 
City Council election in Long Beach -- the one in the 7th District. You may 
recall, that Tonia Reyes Uranga appeared to be leading by seven votes when the 
balloting was completed Election Day -- the 7th of June. But, in a recount, the 
clerks found several uncounted ballots, giving opponent Mike Donelon a one-vote 
lead. Uranga's forces are examining the questionable ballots, pending a final 
declaration.

 But fate may be on Donelon's side, given the number of letters in his last

we're sad to say -- is: LA Fitness.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK A PEOPLE WHO MATTER; AGENCY HELPS WOMEN FIND 
SAFETY, STRENGTH

 When her pager goes off in the middle of the night -- as it sometimes does -- 
Clara J. Stroup knows that nothing is guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 The caller may have just crawled through a window to escape her battering 
husband, she may be barefoot and only partially clothed. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who dialed the hot line operated by the Assn. to Aid Victims of 
Domestic Violence may have no idea where to turn next.  
</P>
<P>
 "The first issue is always safety," said Stroup, the the agency's executive 
director and only full-time employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroup and two part-time workers helped 145 victims of domestic violence last 
year. The agency is the only one of its kind in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "We provide support, and offer them their options," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency helps to arrange emergency shelter for battered women in safe 
houses. But workers are careful not to try to tell victims what to do. After 
all, the women have escaped a situation where their abusers were trying to 
control them through violence. Instead, the agency focuses on giving women a 
chance to rest in safety, collect their thoughts and, eventually, decide what 
to do.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency sometimes helps arrange a restraining order against husbands or 
boyfriends and may eventually place a woman and, perhaps, her children in a 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Group counseling with other battered women may help the women understand how 
they have become victims and what they can do to prevent it in the future. 
Women's partners, who are often also directed to counseling because of court 
orders, may be taught how to control their anger and deal with situations 
without resorting to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stroup has never been able to predict how any particular case will end up, 
if a couple will get back together or if a woman will make a clean break and 
start life anew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost always assume that they will go back at least once for a reality 
check," Stroup said. "Most of the time, it's to test whether it really was that 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Johnson, the agency's part-time direct service coordinator, also has 
learned not to make predictions. In her two years with the program, she has 
been the most surprised at how non-threatening the abusers may seem when she 
meets them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest surprise was to see that they were just guys," Johnson said. 
"They could be neighbors or friends. It could be anybody from any walk of 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Men who are assigned to group counseling under a court order spend at least 32 
weeks in the program. Some may voluntarily choose to stay longer. The time the 
victims stay in counseling may be longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men and women learn how to cope with confrontations, set boundaries and 
take a "time out" when things get too intense, Stroup said.  
</P>
<P>
 Women are taught to take practical steps to deal with the cycle of violence if 
they return to their mates. For example, a victim can often recognize that an 
explosive confrontation is about to happen. The agency teaches them to work out 
an escape plan ahead of time, including having a safe place to go, money set 
aside, gas in their vehicle, birth and marriage certificates and bank account 
numbers handy.  
</P>
<P>
 Holidays may be the most difficult times for abusers and their victims, Stroup 
said. Many finally come to the agency for help in mid-January.  
</P>
<P>
 But this year, the Northridge earthquake upset that pattern as families were 
forced to work together to survive the disaster. The numbers of women who come 
to the agency have been down for the beginning of this year, she said.

THOMAS BAROLDI, CIVIC LEADER AND DAIRYMAN, DEAD AT 74 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thomas Anthony Baroldi, a longtime dairyman who served on the city's first 
council, has died at UCI Medical Center in Orange after a lengthy illness and 
complications due to pneumonia. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
 Baroldi, a dairyman for 28 years, was on the original committee of dairymen to 
incorporate the area, then known as Dairy City, into Cypress in 1956. He served 
on the city's first council in 1956 and became mayor in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 After serving on the Cypress City Council for four years, he ran his dairy, 
one of the largest in the area, until selling it and retiring in 1968. Baroldi 
Sycamore Park, located on the same plot of land that later became a tract of 
homes, was named in his honor in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Baroldi, who died Tuesday, is survived by his wife, Irene, of Cypress; sons 
Tony Baroldi of Mission Viejo and Tom Baroldi of Yorba Linda; daughters Linda 
Baroldi-Hack of Whittier and Carla Murphy of Yorba Linda; sisters Rena Sierra 
and Irma Baroldi, both of Seal Beach; a brother, Leo Baroldi of La Habra 
Heights; and nine grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitation will be today at McAulay & Wallace Mortuary Chapel in Fullerton, 
from 2 to 4 p.m. and 6 to 8 p.m., with a vigil service at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Mass will be said Friday at 10 a.m. at St. Irenaeus Catholic Church in 
Cypress. Burial will follow at Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Orange.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: RESOURCES A PROBLEM IN TEACHING DISABLED; EDUCATION: 
SMALLER CLASSES AND SPECIAL TRAINING FOR TEACHERS ARE NEEDED TO MAKE 'FULL 
INCLUSION' WORK PROPERLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER L. BRITTON, Alexander L. Britton of Los Alamitos is a professor 
emeritus at Cal State Long Beach and consultant to programs serving the 
disabled. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The situation confronting 6-year-old Jimmy Peters and his parents, his 
schoolmates and their parents, and his teachers and other school personnel in 
Huntington Beach, is symptomatic of a much larger problem facing education in 
California today. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the history of special education, parent and professional advocacy 
groups have lobbied state legislatures and Congress to obtain school programs 
for disabled children. When political lobbying failed, these groups, especially 
the parents, turned to the courts for redress to obtain the same educational 
opportunities for their disabled children as those offered non-disabled 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Political activity by parent organizations resulted in special classes in 
public schools for children representing a wide variety of physical, 
neurological, intellectual or psychological disabilities. Seldom did the 
leadership to establish these special education programs come from local school 
board members or school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps in response to court activity and political activity on the part of 
advocacy groups, and after passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 
1973, Congress passed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (PL 
94-124), recently changed to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 
Its intent was to guarantee a "public-supported" education for every school-age 
child in the "least restrictive environment" regardless of the nature or degree 
of their disability. 
</P>
<P>
 While some parents and special educators were thrilled with the passage and 
implementation of this legislation, a controversy developed concerning the 
actual setting in which these children may be served; what should be the "least 
restrictive environment"? Special-education schools for the severely 
handicapped and special day classes on regular school campuses for the mildly 
to moderately disabled became the vogue.  
</P>
<P>
 Some professional educators, allied with advocacy groups, the California 
Department of Education and the U.S. Office of Special Education and 
Rehabilitation, have created the Regular Education Initiative which flowed from 
the idea in the mid-1970s that the majority of disabled children should be 
educated in the "mainstream," meaning the regular class. Today the emphasis is 
on "full inclusion," interpreted to mean that all children with disabilities 
belong in the regular class with their chronological age peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Our democratic system assures that equal educational opportunity be afforded 
students of all racial or cultural heritage, socioeconomic levels, with or 
without disabilities, if they are to be expected to fulfill their potential as 
they approach adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 However, until the citizens and legislators become willing to establish a tax 
program to produce sufficient revenue to support education, class size will 
continue to be too high to permit regular education teachers, even with aides, 
to provide the appropriate educational program for mildly to severely disabled 
children without interfering with the educational process of the other children 
in the class. 
</P>
<P>
 It is essential that class size be reduced considerably and teachers be 
provided comprehensive training concerning the actual teaching of children with 
disabilities to enable them to serve all of the children in their classes if 
"full inclusion" is to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges, who, in their wisdom, interpret the law cannot solve the problem. 
Taxpayers and legislators must. Otherwise the future Jimmy Peterses and their 
regular class peers will continue to suffer.

WEARY NETHERLANDS SHOWS ITS STAYING POWER; GROUP F: A LOSS FROM ELIMINATION, 
DUTCH INSTEAD SWEAT OUT 2-1 VICTORY OVER MOROCCO THAT CLINCHES TITLE. ROY 
BREAKS TIE IN 78TH MINUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One by one, they trudged toward their bus, their faces grim and their 
shoulders sagging under the weight of their bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a smile among the 22 players. 
</P>
<P>
 And these were the members of the winning team. 
</P>
<P>
 On a scorching day when simply breathing was an effort, the Netherlands found 
itself squarely on the hot seat. One defeat from an embarrassing exit from the 
World Cup, the Dutch had to survive on their grit, which has never matched 
their formidable talent. Sweating together instead of taking separate star 
trips, they defeated Morocco, 2-1, Wednesday at the Florida Citrus Bowl. It was 
no Dutch mastery, but it was enough to earn the Group F championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play very well, but the most important thing was that we won," said 
second-half substitute Bryan Roy, who scored the game-winner in the 78th minute 
with a left-footed nudge of a pass from Dennis Bergkamp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we are happy, but we are too tired to show it right now," Roy said. 
"The important thing was that we advanced to the second round. The way Morocco 
was attacking (early in the second half), I thought we might lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland won the game -- and the group -- on Roy's goal, scored 11 minutes 
after he replaced winger Peter van Vossen. "It was pretty simple," said Roy, 
who plays for Foggia of the Italian League. "I made myself available in front 
of the goal and it was passed in to me. The rest was easy." 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, none of it was easy. To make himself available, he had to outrace 
several defenders. To set it up, Bergkamp -- who had scored Holland's first 
goal -- had to keep the ball in the goal area after Morocco failed to clear the 
ball, and he had to sacrifice a scoring chance. To get the pass to Roy, 
Bergkamp had to cut sharply around defender Smahi Triki. 
</P>
<P>
 And Roy had to get just the right bounce on his shot to fool goalkeeper 
Zakaria Alaoui El Ashraf, which he did. "I'm always hungry to play," said Roy, 
who had started Holland's previous two games. "I thought I played well in the 
earlier matches, so I was confident. I was very proud to score the winning 
goal." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal turned the group standings upside-down. The Netherlands, Saudi Arabia 
and Belgium were 2-1 with plus-one goal differentials, but Belgium was 
relegated to third place because it had scored only two goals and had given up 
one. Holland and Saudi Arabia had each scored four goals and had given up 
three, but Holland won the head-to-head matchup, 2-1, to win the group title 
and gain a round-of-16 meeting with Ireland on July 4 in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we played our best game today. We played our best game against 
Belgium and didn't win," defender Frank De Boer said. "But that happens 
sometimes. We are very glad to stay here and play against Ireland because we 
don't have to travel." 
</P>
<P>
 Said midfielder Jan Wouters, who earned his second yellow card and will sit 
out the Ireland game: "Nobody expected us to finish in first in this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Dick Advocaat anticipated criticism for not having finished first in the 
group more easily, but he made no apologies for his team's performance. Venue 
officials said the temperature on the field hit 105 degrees, but a thermometer 
shown on television read 118. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only very few countries that managed to win two matches in this 
tournament, even the big countries that were expected to win the title, so we 
didn't do too badly," Advocaat said. "We know the way we like to play in Europe 
is here verboten , impossible. . . . The heat has hurt the play for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't evaporate the spirits of the below-capacity crowd of 60,578, 
including fans who wore curly wigs and painted their faces in honor of their 
beloved Orange. They sang and waved their bedsheet-banners when Bergkamp took a 
pass from van Vossen and sent a left-footer inside the right post in the 43rd 
minute, for his first World Cup goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a fluke that the ball came to me," he said. "I then took 
immediate action, and that's how we scored. . . . I created many chances and I 
felt good about those chances." 
</P>
<P>
 But Morocco (0-3) created some chances too. Coach Abdellah Ajri's lineup 
changes produced a feisty team -- it collected five yellow cards -- and a 
persistent effort. It paid off in a tie in the 47th minute, when Hassan Nader 
got behind defenders Ronald Koeman and De Boer and converted a square pass from 
Mustapha Hadji, who had entered the game moments earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we deserved better for the way we played in these games," Ajri said. 
"At least today, we lost to a great team." 
</P>
<P>
 They were one goal better, because of Roy, but not every Moroccan player 
thought the Dutch were great. "They didn't have any tempo," defender Nacer 
Abdellah said. "Only if Gaston Taument and Bryan Roy worked on the ball, there 
was more action and they created a lot of space. . . . The way Wouters plays, 
my grandmother could play better. It is a shame to send Ruud Gullit away for 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Gullit, a brilliant but mercurial midfielder, chose to leave the team on the 
eve of final roster selection. The Dutch might miss his talents but not his 
temperamental outbursts. "It's a pity we don't have him," Roy said, "but we 
have other great players and we have to do it with the players we have." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, those players were good enough.

Washington: "We are heading toward Washington. Everything is made so that it 
happens as quick as possible.Traveling in such conditions is quite pleasant. 
Furthermore, a telephone is available on the back of our seat in the airplane,

 "It may sound as if the heat is becoming something of an obsession with 
Charlton, but the sight of Germany wilting visibly in Dallas against South 
Korea left an indelible impression. And when visitors to Florida are advised by 
the local tourist board not to expose themselves to the sun for more than 15 
minutes when it is at its height, to expect northern Europeans to play at 
midday is tilting the balance against them. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'When the Germans were still running, they were much too powerful for South 
Korea. They looked likely to score every time they went forward,' Charlton 
said. 'But by the second half they had to stop running and in the end they 
could have drawn or even lost. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'What I hadn't realized is that dehydration affects you mentally as well as 
physically. The brain stops taking in information properly, fails to recognize 
situations and you're less likely to choose the right options. You could see 
that with the Germans and you can see that with some of our players as well.' "

 Ion Vladoiu of Romania, already banned from three games for a vicious tackle, 
was thrown out of the World Cup by his team Wednesday because of foul behavior 
on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladoiu, a midfielder, will return to Romania on Friday, two days before his 
team plays a second-round match at the Rose Bowl, a statement from the Romanian 
delegation said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, FIFA, soccer's governing body, suspended Vladoiu for three games 
because of a brutal tackle on a Swiss player in a first-round game. That 
suspension, the longest in recent World Cup history, would have sidelined 
Vladoiu through the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Romanians said the tackle, which the statement described as "strong 
intervention with one of the opposing players," was only one reason Vladoiu was 
sent home. 
</P>
<P>
 It also cited "bad behavior displayed by Vladoiu in front of one of the 
(Romanian) coaches." The identity of the coach and details of the incident were 
not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania was the surprise winner of Group A and will play either Italy or the 
third-place team from Group D in the second round.

 You would have thought Ireland had already won the World Cup by the goings-on 
in Kilburn, an Irish area of London. More than 1,500 Irish supporters 
shoe-horned themselves into McGovern's Pub to watch the big match against 
Norway late Tuesday on huge TV screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the draw became official and indicated that Ireland would go into the 
last 16, the crowd began singing "Dublin's Fair City," and cars sporting the 
Irish tricolor -- green, white and orange -- raced down Kilburn High Street 
sounding their horns for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of the Englishman, Coach Jack Charlton, who made it possible? 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be made King Jack of Ireland when he gets back," promised Noel 
Loughrey, 25, from County Donegal and now of London. 
</P>
<P>
 The London press hailed the Irish draw with Norway and their advance to the 
second round as if it were a historic British victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily Mirror bannered: "Everyone's a H-EIRE-O" and ran individual color 
photos of the entire Ireland team above a lead from New York that read: "Jack 
Charlton's Irish heroes return to Disney World ready to spray more stardust 
over the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be outdone, the Sun reported the Ireland-Norway game in a series of 
headlines that read: HIP HIP HOO-RAY for midfielder Ray Houghton; and "Charlton 
and his battling supermen take it to the wire." 
</P>
<P>
 With a banner that read "Jack walks tall in the land of the Giants," the story 
began: "He appeared on the balcony and it was only a matter of seconds before 
50,000 Irishmen spotted the man in the white cap -- and roared in admiration 
and worship. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were paying homage to Jack Charlton, but in those few, emotional moments 
in New York's (sic) Giants Stadium, they could have been hailing the Pope."

 Silence reigned over Italian cities Tuesday night. Police reinforcements 
waiting for what was expected to be a rowdy night of hooting cars, flag-waving 
fans and crowds of generally jubilant Italians celebrating a second soccer 
victory, were hanging around traffic barriers on empty streets with nothing to 
do after the 1-1 tie with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Television sports show defenders of the team's poor performance unconvincingly 
noted the pressures of the Italian soccer season, the hot, damp weather, the 
debate over Roberto Baggio in the last few days, the various injuries of the 
Italian players. The realists, such as former national team Coach Azeglio 
Vicini, said: "The truth is that we have a technically valid group; they just 
can't seem to show their worth on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 "Forward without glory" was the main headline of the Milan daily Corriere 
della Sera. The front page editorial was headlined "The Missing Man," in clear 
reference to Baggio. "All the times he had the chance of scoring a goal, he 
gave out tired little kicks, he couldn't even take advantage of the pastry 
hands of Campos, the fluorescent (Mexican) goalkeeper. No burst of genius, no 
successful dribbling, no outstanding shots. Nothing. What a disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
 "Saved by Russia" said the Rome daily La Repubblica, and more heavy criticism 
of Baggio's performance: "The little prince picked out as one of the great 
protagonists of the World Cup stayed in the little mode: little game, little 
heart . . . at this point, waiting for the real Baggio is as trying as waiting 
for Godot."

game." 
</P>
<P>
 No less than Thomas Boswell of the Washington Post, a writer whose sun usually 
rises and sets on the sport of baseball, waxed poetic on soccer in Wednesday's 
editions of the Post.Boswell was encouraging people to attend Wednesday's Saudi 
Arabia-Belgium game at RFK Stadium. He wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you hate soccer, despise a great party, loathe a swift sport with 
fabulous athletes and, basically, wish the rest of the world outside of America 
would evaporate, Just Do It. Tell the boss you're sick. Bend the budget. Show 
up early." 
</P>
<P>
 Boswell ended his column as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer is certainly gaining ground with me. If I could live a thousand years, 
I'd now set aside a decade for soccer. Before this World Cup began, I'd have 
given soccer about the same time slot in eternity as auto racing: maybe a 
week." BILL DWYRE

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; HENTGEN HELPS BLUE JAYS END 10-GAME SKID

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pat Hentgen pitched a three-hitter and Randy Knorr homered Wednesday night as 
the Toronto Blue Jays ended a 10-game losing streak with a 5-0 victory over the 
Milwaukee Brewers at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentgen (9-5) gave up a double and single to No. 9 hitter Jose Valentin and a 
ninth-inning single to Jody Reed in posting his third career shutout and second 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentgen walked three and struck out three in halting the Blue Jays' longest 
losing skid since 1981, when they lost 12 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad it's over and behind us," Hentgen said. "Ten games in a row is 
just unbelievable. If you would have said we'd lose 10 in a row, I'd have 
laughed at you. Well, it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know. We might go ahead and win 10 in a row." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto took a 3-0 lead in the second after Milwaukee third baseman Kevin 
Seitzer's two-out error. John Olerud scored from second when Dick Schofield's 
grounder went between Seitzer's legs. Knorr followed with a two-run homer, his 
fourth, against Ricky Bones (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 11, Minnesota 10 -- Dean Palmer led off the ninth with a game-tying 
homer and Jeff Frye later added a sacrifice fly, lifting the Rangers to a wild 
victory at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, who earlier squandered a six-run lead, fell behind in the eighth, 
10-9, when Chuck Knoblauch hit a sacrifice fly for the Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, who hit two homers, hit a 1-0 pitch from Rick Aguilera (0-2) for his 
12th homer. Rusty Greer followed with a single -- his third hit -- and moved to 
second on a sacrifice. Greer reached third on a passed ball, and after Junior 
Ortiz walked, Greer scored easily on Frye's fly to center. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 4, Boston 3 -- Danny Tartabull, who had struck out in his three 
previous at-bats, homered leading off the 10th inning at Boston to give the 
Yankees their eighth consecutive victory.

<P>
 Tartabull hit the third pitch from reliever Jeff Russell (0-5) into the Red 
Sox bullpen in right field for his 14th homer, sending the Red Sox to their 
12th consecutive home loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-hitter Wes Chamberlain had driven in the tying run in the ninth with a 
groundout. But Steve Howe (1-0) got out of a jam in the ninth when left fielder 
Luis Polonia ran down Scott Fletcher's drive to deep left field with two outs 
and a runner on second. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 7, Cleveland 6 -- Chris Sabo singled home the winning run in the 
10th at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles won for the fifth time in six games, all on the road, and improved 
their league-leading road record to 24-13. Cleveland has lost four of five at 
Jacobs Field since setting a club record with 18 consecutive home victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner Mark Eichhorn (5-1) pitched 4 2/3 scoreless innings in relief of Mike 
Oquist. Lee Smith pitched the 10th for his major league-leading 27th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 7, Kansas City 6 -- Tim Raines' single with one out in the ninth 
inning scored Ozzie Guillen with the winning run at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillen walked on four pitches to open the ninth against Billy Brewer (3-1) 
and Norberto Martin sacrificed. Raines followed by lining a single to center. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Hernandez (2-3) pitched one perfect inning for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Coleman went three for five and stole three bases for the Royals.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; SMOLTZ MAKES STRONG RETURN FOR BRAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Smoltz returned from an eight-game suspension Wednesday and gave up three 
hits over eight innings and added a homer as the Atlanta Braves ended a 
four-game losing streak with a 6-2 victory over the Expos at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used the time off wisely," said Smoltz (6-7), who was suspended for hitting 
John Cangelosi of the New York Mets on May 14. "I worked diligently but didn't 
overwork myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a good mind-set, knowing I'd only have one start in 10 games. I 
didn't have to worry about the Phillies, didn't have to worry about the Mets. I 
just concentrated on Montreal. Pitchers don't usually have that luxury." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Pecota drove in three runs as the Braves regained a 1 1/2-game lead over 
the Expos in the National League East. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoltz had not pitched since losing to the Cincinnati Reds, 12-4, on June 19, 
one day before the suspension began. He gave up four home runs in the first 
inning of that game. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, he was nearly unhittable, giving up only a leadoff single to 
Marquis Grissom in the first, pitcher Butch Henry's one-out single in the fifth 
and Sean Berry's pinch-double in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't felt this good with my fastball in a long time," said Smoltz, who 
gave up an unearned run, struck out seven and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 6, Pittsburgh 5 -- Glenallen Hill's two-run double with two out in the 
ninth inning lifted the Cubs at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs loaded the bases in the ninth against reliever Ravelo Manzanillo 
(2-2). Rey Sanchez doubled and advanced to third on Jose Hernandez's sacrifice. 
Manzanillo walked Shawon Dunston and Mark Grace to load the bases. Mark Dewey 
replaced Manzanillo and struck out Sammy Sosa before Hill, who had homered 
earlier in the game, doubled into the left-center field gap on a 2-2 pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Crim (3-1), who pitched the ninth, got the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 3, Cincinnati 1 -- Kevin Bass and Jeff Bagwell homered in a three-run 
eighth inning for the Astros at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell hit his 25th home run with one out. One pitch before the homer, Craig 
Biggio had been caught trying to steal second. Ken Caminiti then singled to 
center and Bass followed with his third home run, giving the Astros a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston reliever Dave Veres (3-3) was the winner, getting the final two outs 
of the eighth. Rookie John Hudek got the final three outs for his 12th save in 
12 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 10, Colorado 4 -- Pinch-hitters Billy Bean and Craig Shipley 
delivered run-scoring hits in the seventh inning as the Padres rallied at 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Padres trailing, 3-1, Bean tied the score with a pinch-hit triple 
against Willie Blair (0-4), and Shipley followed one out later with a 
tiebreaking single. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado left fielder Eric Young was injured in the ninth inning when he 
slammed into the outfield wall chasing down a double by Luis Lopez. Young hit 
his head on the wall and lay on the ground for several moments while Manager 
Don Baylor and a team trainer attended to him. He was carried off on a flat 
board by four teammates to the team clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays were negative and Young will be re-examined today. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 5, Florida 2 -- Danny Jackson gave up four hits in eight innings 
for his 10th victory and Doug Jones gained his league-leading 20th save at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson (10-2), who struck out seven and walked none, didn't allow a 
baserunner until Gary Sheffield singled with two out in the fourth inning.

BOOK REVIEW / MEMOIRS; GHOSTLY MEMORIES FEED CANCER NIGHTMARE; YOU DON'T HAVE 
TO BE YOUR MOTHER, BY GAYLE FELDMAN (W.W. NORTON & CO.; $23, 256 PAGES) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gayle Feldman was most of the way through a long-awaited pregnancy when she 
learned that what she and her doctors prayed was merely a blocked milk duct 
was, in fact, a malignancy. That sentence contains in it sadness enough for any 
lifetime, but Feldman looked back over her shoulder, into the past, and saw the 
ghost of her mother, who had died of breast cancer at 47. 
</P>
<P>
 Every decision she faced in the present churned up memories of a lonely, 
frightened adolescence. The birth of her son -- early, induced, so that she 
could get on with the grim business of fighting her cancer -- became a 
challenge as much as a joy. Tiny Benjamin Reid demanded a happier life than his 
mother had had. It was up to her to make sure that she escaped her mother's 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
 The title of this harrowing, uplifting memoir comes from an advertisement 
Feldman happened upon early in the story; it became something of a mantra for 
her, a chant to ward off the awful silent mystery and confusion that surrounded 
her mother's illness. For Bossie Feldman was a casualty, not just of her 
disease, but of the way it was handled in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 First an ill-informed doctor wasted precious time insisting that there was 
nothing wrong. Then she had a surgical biopsy, back in the days of the 
"one-step" procedure, and awoke from the anesthesia to find that she had lost a 
breast.  
</P>
<P>
 Shame and dismay made her a recluse, shut off even from her children, who 
inherited a legacy of fear and superstition. Feldman recalls one heartbreaking 
incident in which her mother called for help getting out of the bathtub -- and 
Feldman, terrified at having to see her mother naked, stood paralyzed outside 
the bathroom door, unable to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Until her condition was diagnosed, Feldman had had her share of good luck: a 
loving, deeply affectionate 20-year relationship with David Reid; a job she 
loved at Publisher's Weekly; a warm network of family and friends, and, after a 
harrowing round of surgeries and fertility drugs, a healthy pregnancy. She and 
her husband were preparing for the arrival of "C.C.", or "Constant Companion," 
as they had come to call their pending child, when she was suddenly catapulted 
back into her mother's life. 
</P>
<P>
 She did what any self-respecting, well-educated professional woman with good 
health insurance would do: She went to her exquisitely resourceful ob-gyns, who 
sent her to competent doctors, who gave her attentive care. If anything, the 
occasional ogre she encounters seems all the more dreadful because her core 
support is so exemplary. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that some of the medical personnel she encounters 
shouldn't be reincarnated as their own patients so that they can see what 
neglect feels like.  
</P>
<P>
 The chilly doctor who tried to turn her away when she arrived at the hospital 
to have her labor induced ("You'd better go home and call us back in the 
morning. Why does she need to be induced, anyway?") retires forever the notion 
that women doctors are necessarily more compassionate than the men. There is 
the dolt of a nurse who chatters about Feldman's "interesting" breast 
throughout her surgical biopsy, the orderly who can't be bothered to wheel her 
out of recovery because it's break time, the nurse who forgets to bring her 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feldman kept her wits about her. She and her husband seem possessed of 
exquisitely calibrated emotions. They allow themselves the release, and relief 
of tears, but they also know exactly when and how to lose their tempers.  
</P>
<P>
 I might have gone further and throttled the girl in the coffee shop who 
refused to put out her cigarette even though Feldman is asthmatic, but I would 
have been wrong. Feldman and D. Reid, as she calls him, know just how to muster 
their forces to best effect.  
</P>
<P>
 She is also a lovely, modulated writer, capable of the understatement that is 
perhaps crucial to writing about this subject. Had she been operatic, it would 
have been too much to bear -- the events are quite sufficiently melodramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 The clean pen-and-ink word portraits she draws -- of family members, of a 
clumsy night nanny who forgets that Ben has fallen asleep in her bed, of her 
no-nonsense woman surgeon -- are memorable ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Her medical situation is presented with equal clarity, but here the simplicity 
can be a bit misleading. One wants desperately to believe Feldman's claim that 
she is "cancer free" -- it is a tribute to her writing skill that the reader 
develops a fierce emotional investment in Feldman's continued good health -- 
but life is never quite that certain. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been much interest in prophylactic mastectomies (which Feldman 
eventually had on her other breast) as a protection against breast cancer for 
high-risk women. Still, it is not a guarantee: Some of those women develop 
cancer anyhow, in the remaining tissue, and doctors disagree about whether the 
procedure has anything but psychological advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of almost "sure things" in breast cancer treatment. There are 
not yet any definitive answers. The reader prays that the numbers will favor 
Feldman and her family -- but she and the 180,000 women who will be found to 
have breast cancer this year still need better odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the only thing lacking here is a somewhat stronger sense of context. 
Not even the best care comes with a lifetime warranty -- and not everyone is as 
well taken care of as was Gayle Feldman.

DANCE REVIEW; JOFFREY RETURNS WITH A REVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1933 -- the same year that Hitler came to power -- Leonide Massine created 
the first of his controversial, groundbreaking symphonic ballets for the 
starriest company of its time, the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
 In the conservative world of high culture, it was daring to move Tchaikovsky's 
weighty Fifth Symphony from the concert hall to the ballet stage. It was also 
daring to incorporate stylizations of the Nazi swastika and salute in the 
costume and movement design for a dance showpiece. Most of all, it was daring 
to depict the energies fueling the rise of fascism at that very moment in an 
allegorical work titled "Les Presages" (The Portents). Portents of what? 
</P>
<P>
 At the very end of the ballet, Massine showed society united under the 
leadership of a figure called the Hero. Critics and audiences of the time 
interpreted that ending as a return to law and order following a threat of 
chaos. After all, the portrayals of social turmoil and the danger of war had 
finished and the character representing evil destiny was destroyed. The future 
was definitely under control. 
</P>
<P>
 However, 59 years later, when the Joffrey Ballet mounted a triumphant 
reconstruction of "Les Presages," we all knew better. We knew exactly what the 
ascension of Massine's Hero in the ballet's final image would portend or 
presage. And it wasn't law and order. To us, "Les Presages" is a vision of 
Europe on the brink of cataclysm, a work conveying the Zeitgeist of a dangerous 
time when the performing arts were expected to get at the bottom of things. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, social turmoil in the form of the 1992 Los Angeles riots caused 
the Joffrey to cancel its scheduled premiere of "Les Presages" at the Wiltern 
Theatre. But local audiences finally got a look at this all-but-lost masterwork 
on Tuesday, when the company returned to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for a 
seven-performance engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 As staged by Tatiana Leskova (assisted by Nelly Laport), "Les Presages" speaks 
as compellingly about the fascism now consuming Bosnia as it did about Europe's 
capitulation to Nazism a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervised by Campbell Baird and John David Ridge, the somewhat simplified 
re-creation of Andre Masson's original set and costumes enforces a restless 
asymmetry bristling with graphic warnings. Dominated by a threatening mask, the 
backdrop alone features tongues of fire, shooting stars, falling planets and 
plenty of storm clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 Divided into nearly as many components, Massine's corps is first glimpsed at 
the sides and back of the stage in intense, bravura passages that reveal a 
split body: The dancers' legs do classical steps but their upper torsos and 
arms belong to the Expressionist dance-theater of the '30s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This dramatic physical opposition and the dynamic alternation of group 
activities help generate tremendous force long before symbolic figures come to 
dominate the ballet. In his autobiography, Massine writes about his interest in 
the "contrasted blending of rounded and angular forms," a concept highlighted 
in an early solo danced strongly by Beatriz Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Threatened by Fate (an uneven Gregory Russell), the love between the 
characters danced by the majestic Valerie Madonia and the ardent Daniel 
Baudendistel barely manages to survive -- and, before long, Baudendistel is 
wearing what looks like a melted swastika on his chest. He becomes the Hero, 
rising above everyone, arm raised, palm out. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking rushed and overtaxed, Rita Martinez impersonates a desperately 
glamorous character named Frivolity in a conventionally decorative 
divertissement -- the ballet's most dated segment. However, Massine's layering 
of action-units in the finale is absolutely inspired and the sense of people 
driven into a new, crueler reality emerges with enormous power. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Lewis conducts an uncredited abridgment of Tchaikovsky's score with 
great surety, and Thomas Skelton's lighting contributes to the lushness of this 
latest example of the Joffrey's service to 20th-Century dance archeology. 
</P>
<P>
 Familiar to local audiences, the rest of the opening program offered no 
comparable revelations. Martha Clarke, Felix Blaska and Robby Barnett created 
"The Garden of Villandry" in 1979 and have performed it here, as has American 
Ballet Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joffrey has been dancing it for two years. On Tuesday, a passionate Pascal 
Benichou and a curiously glum Tom Mossbrucker were the endlessly hopeful 
suitors, Beatriz Rodriguez the subtly manipulative target of their wooing 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
 However, long before Benichou and Mossbrucker linked arms to form a human 
swing for Rodriguez, the generalized flow of images proved far less compelling 
than the music being played at the upper right of the stage by Stanley Babin, 
Kenneth Yerke and Ernest Ehrhardt. 
</P>
<P>
 To close the program, a newly energized Mossbrucker and the coolly virtuosic 
Jodie Gates led the company in Gerald Arpino's plotless 1981 diversion "Light 
Rain." 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the relentlessly shimmering fingers, upside-down splits, pumping 
hips and nonchalant technical display had the audience on its feet screaming 
for more.

 More NEA Cuts Proposed: A Senate committee has voted to deepen National 
Endowment for the Arts cuts made last week by the House amid lawmakers' 
continuing concerns about support for controversial artists. The Senate 
Appropriations Committee approved a bill Tuesday that would trim the 
endowment's 1995 budget to $161.6 million, an $8.5-million reduction. Last 
week, the House voted to trim $3.4 million from the agency after rejecting an 
$8.5-million cut. The cuts in the Senate bill were proposed by Sen. Robert Byrd 
(D-W.Va.), who two weeks ago warned the endowment that its budget would be 
jeopardized unless it stopped supporting "grossly improper activities."

 * Glendale's Broadway: Two established 99-seat theaters, the Colony and A 
Noise Within, have each obtained $2.5-million grants from the Glendale 
Redevelopment Agency, designed to help them expand as part of the burgeoning 
Glendale theater district. A Noise Within is already in Glendale but hopes to 
create a 350- to 500-seat theater there. The 19-year-old Colony, currently in 
Silver Lake, is reviewing several sites in Glendale and intends to build a 
299-seat theater and a 99-seat second stage. TELEVISION

 On Both Sides of the Camera: When the NBC-owned cable channel America's 
Talking debuts July 4, its president will host one of the show's programs. 
Roger Ailes, known to TV viewers after serving for five years as a commentator 
for NBC's "Today" and appearing as a guest on numerous news shows, will host 
"Straight Forward," featuring one-on-one interviews with celebrities, 
newsmakers and members of the media. Behind the scenes, Ailes has served as 
executive producer for several talk shows including the "Rush Limbaugh Show." 
"Straight Forward" will air weeknights at 6.

 * Not Eligible: "Home Improvement" co-star Patricia Richardson will join 
Academy of Television Arts & Sciences President Richard H. Frank on July 21 to 
announce nominations for the 46th annual Primetime Emmy Awards. But 
Richardson's leading man, Tim Allen, won't be eligible for the awards, due to 
what a spokeswoman called "an oversight" by members of Allen's team. 
Representatives of Allen, the star of TV's highest-rated series, never 
submitted his name for Emmy consideration, apparently because those involved 
all assumed somebody else would do the job. Other "Home Improvement" cast 
members were submitted, however, making them eligible for Emmy voting, as is 
the series. After discovering Allen's omission, ABC and the show's producers 
sought unsuccessfully to have a supplemental ballot issued.

 * Royal Coverage: "Dateline NBC" will air excerpts tonight from the 
much-publicized British documentary in which England's Prince Charles admits to 
being unfaithful to Princess Diana and says he wants to abolish the monarch's 
role as head of the Church of England. Then on Aug. 24, cable's A&E will show 
the complete documentary, "Charles, the Private Man, the Public Role," as part 
of a "Royals" theme week featuring a different royal each night. Diana gets her 
air time July 24, as the first subject of Lifetime's documentary series 
"Intimate Portrait." MOVIES

 Philippine Film Scandal: Seven people have been charged with fraud in a 
scandal in which best actor and actress awards in the Philippine equivalent of 
the Academy Awards went to the wrong people. The seven, including the false 
winners, conspired to read the wrong names at the Manila Film Festival on June 
22, said Mayor Alfredo Lim. Ruffa Gutierrez and Gabby Concepcion, nominated for 
their roles in a film takeoff on the Lorena Bobbitt case, were named best 
actress and actor. But the real winners were actress Aiko Melendez and actor 
Edu Manzano. The scandal broke when a presenter said a talent agent asked her 
to read the wrong name for best actress in return for winning next year.

 Motown vs. Power 106: Los Angeles radio station KPWR-FM (105.9) is one of five 
U.S. stations served with a cease and desist order from Motown Records charging 
it with airing poorly recorded copies of the new Boyz II Men album, "II," which 
is due to be released in September. Also cited were stations in Houston, 
Orlando, Dallas and the group's hometown of Philadelphia. . . . Meanwhile, 
Virgin Records, which earlier this week issued a similar order against a 
Wichita radio station for playing taped copies of the Rolling Stones' new 
album, "Voodoo Lounge," will send advance copies of the album via satellite to 
radio stations today, even though it won't be released until July 12. The move 
was prompted by several stations airing unauthorized copies, a spokesman said.

CLUB REVIEW; HOT MOVES AT MEN'S ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The go-go dancer on the bar knows all the titillating moves. The masked figure 
sways, shimmies and spins to the fast-paced music.But this barely clad dancer 
represents a slight variation on the tradition: He's a man. 
</P>
<P>
 So are most of the onlookers on Thursday night at the Men's Room at Cosmos, a 
primarily gay dance club where $1 is your ticket to dance to your heart's 
content. 
</P>
<P>
 Few clubs in town exude as much dancing pleasure as the Men's Room. Although 
there's barely enough room to shake your hips from side to side, and the heat 
can be oppressive, the determined bodies still manage to work their frenzied 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons shake tambourines while twirling around the pool table. Others dance 
atop the bar to get more leg room. Nearly everybody seems to be smiling, and 
the music is largely responsible. Deejay Tony Powell lures the dancers out on 
the floor by spinning what he dubs "very erotic house," a sensual blend of 
pulsing house music and techno, from selections by French vocalist Patricia 
Kaas to Club Ultimate's "Carnival '93." 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to get into the swing, arrive early, because the club hits its 300 
capacity each week soon after it opens, and few people bail out of the Men's 
Room early.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; CHESNUTT'S CONTRIVED STAGE SHOW MASKS HIS STRENGTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Chesnutt is one of country music's more appealing young singers, with a 
rich, loamy voice and an ear for solid songs that reflect the east Texas 
honky-tonk tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not George M. Cohan, Tom Jones or Garth Brooks, who seemed to be some of 
his ill-advised role models in his concert at the Universal Amphitheatre on 
Tuesday.The nature of the show seemed determined less by musical vision than by 
a fear of getting left behind by the competition as country concerts 
increasingly adopt slick, rock-style trappings. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're going to hop down a ramp from the drum riser or spread your legs and 
thrust your hips, you'd better appear to be enjoying it. Chesnutt looked 
dutiful when not downright uncomfortable in this eager-to-please mode, and his 
band's incessant scampering was forced and distracting. 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, Chesnutt and his musicians pushed the sound to the limit, leaving 
no room to breathe and eliminating all dynamics. Chesnutt's voice sounded harsh 
and electronic, with none of its natural grain. 
</P>
<P>
 The net result was a thorough masking of the intimacy and directness that are 
his chief strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also featured Doug Supernaw, who specializes in melodramatic, 
slice-of-life songs. His show was unruly and all over the place, but at least 
it was alive and kicking. The Mavericks, who blend Roy Orbison grandeur, pop 
savvy and roots-rock force, served notice in their brief opening set that 
they're a coming force to be reckoned with. RICHARD CROMELIN

MOVIE REVIEW; 'HELAS POUR MOI' CONFOUNDS, TANTALIZES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jean-Luc Godard's "Helas Pour Moi" ("Oh, Woe Is Me") is beautiful, terse, 
perplexing, allusive as it is elusive -- and a stunning experience if you're 
prepared to bring to it near-total alertness and openness. It helps a lot if 
you're an admirer well versed in the films of the ever-evolving New Wave 
pioneer, one of the giants of the cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a lot can be said for certain about what's going on in this most 
elliptical of films. It is set in an idyllic Swiss lakeside community both in 
the present and in unannounced flashes back to an incredible event said to have 
occurred there in July, 1989. A burly, middle-aged publisher, Abraham Klimt 
(Bernard Verley), has come to find out whether the body of Simon Donnadieu -- 
which means God-given, hmm -- (Gerard Depardieu), proprietor of the local inn, 
was in fact inhabited briefly by God. 
</P>
<P>
 Godard has helpfully stated that his shimmering fable of emotional and 
spiritual longing in the face of the remorseless decline of faith was in part 
inspired by Zeus' impersonation of Amphitryon so as to seduce Amphitryon's 
wife, Alcmene. Yet, there is a decidedly Christian cast to Godard's retelling. 
(The film's Zeus, barely glimpsed, arrives accompanied by a Mercury carrying a 
tennis racket.) "Helas pour moi" is what Simon's beautiful wife, Rachel 
(Laurence Masliah), exclaims when she realizes that she has discovered the 
"weakness of the flesh" when she was tempted to submit to God in the form of 
her own husband (who in the meantime may have set off on a trip to Italy to buy 
a small hotel). But Rachel, helas , is not interested in the promise of 
immortality in return for her favors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Godard seems to be creating a paradox, expressing a belief on the one hand 
that the spirit must be made flesh if we are to know God and a suspicion on the 
other that such an experience, should it actually happen, may ultimately be 
merely transient rather than transforming for those who experienced it. The 
irony here is that the film can evoke an actual sense of spiritual awakening 
for those watching it, but then Godard insists that the best we can do is to 
arrive at an image of truth rather than truth itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Helas Pour Moi," so radiantly photographed by Caroline Champtier, unfolds on 
two levels of reality while alternating between past and present. As in Eugene 
O'Neill's "Strange Interlude," the film's people, as they go about their daily 
routines, speak conversationally but also let loose with a sort of 
stream-of-consciousness barrage of Godard's trademark aphorisms (which also are 
heard on the soundtrack and written in intertitles on the screen). The film is 
a tantalizing miracle of economy: Godard will hold a moment as long as it has 
meaning; otherwise, he has assembled his film as a brisk flow of fragmented 
images. Yet no one can charge an image with so much emotion, so much thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Depardieu and Masliah bring to Simon and Rachel understated portrayals of 
absolute concentration and passion. Depardieu's God is deep-voiced, and 
trench-coated like Bogart -- that is, if he actually manifests himself as one 
is tempted to believe he does. 
</P>
<P>
 As ferociously demanding as "Helas Pour Moi" is, it is not without Godard's 
characteristically dry, throwaway humor. Amid a plethora of religious and 
philosophical propositions, one line pretty much summons up the bemused, 
confounding spirit of the enterprise: "All the perfumes of Araby cannot remove 
a nonexistent stain."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; DAVID LEE ROTH AS A NATTY LOUNGE LIZARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You had to feel sorry for David Lee Roth at the House of Blues on Tuesday -- 
not because in the six years since his last Los Angeles appearance he's gone 
from filling the Forum to playing a 1,000-capacity club, but because he's gone 
from being perhaps the most entertaining figure in hard rock to perhaps the 
most irrelevant man in music. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Van Halen singer has traded in his old long-haired, leering, 
party-boy image for that of a short-haired, natty lounge lizard.But where he 
once worked with the most knowing wink in show biz, on Tuesday he looked as if 
he didn't have a clue. His mugging and sub-Vegas patter came off like a Robin 
Williams parody but with no punch lines.  
</P>
<P>
 His new songs bounced around aimlessly from hard-rockers to fake R&B to failed 
social commentaries. And although the crowd came alive for such old faves as 
Van Halen's "Panama" and "Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love" and Roth's hit versions of 
"Just a Gigolo" and "California Girls," they were pale memories of past 
glories. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it's Roth's old persona that could serve a needed role these days. 
A hard-rock harlequin might be the perfect antidote to the oppressive 
seriousness of current rock, an oasis of cool relief from the anguish and rage 
of Young America.  
</P>
<P>
 Where have you gone, Diamond Dave? A nation turns its lonely eyes to you.

MUSIC REVIEW; BOWL 'PREVIEW' OFFERS INSPIRED MOZART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Setting a standard that will be hard for others to maintain over the coming, 
10-week summer season, Gerard Schwarz opened "preview week" at the Hollywood 
Bowl Tuesday with a Mozart program played inspiredly by 41 members of the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Mozart, of course, has been a longtime specialty of the symphonically 
versatile American conductor.But years of probing have not made Schwarz 
insensitive to the endless charms of this repertory. He conducts it not only 
with deep knowledge and broad perspective but with true lightness and perfect 
balance. And unending affection. 
</P>
<P>
 After a surprisingly transparent "Star-Spangled Banner," the 46-year-old 
conductor led the Philharmonic contingent in a serious but never heavy-handed 
revival of the Symphony No. 35 ("Haffner") in which the band delivered all the 
boldness and delicacy in this score with a superior effortlessness and a lean 
sense of style. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing this polished is not the stock-in-trade at Bowl performances -- but 
then, conductors this authoritative are not usual, either. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the program, heard by a clap-happy audience of 8,658 
Bowlgoers, Schwarz and his colleagues delineated a compelling and beauteous 
run-through of the "Linz" Symphony, wherein we were again reminded that true 
leadership -- the kind one finds seldom on any podium, anywhere -- combines 
aggression with permissiveness: Inspire them to play, then leave them alone to 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the symphonies, Israeli-American violinist Gil Shaham was the highly 
musical, efficient and slender-toned soloist in the Concerto in G, K. 216. 
Here, Schwarz and the chamber-sized orchestra became amiable colleagues.

ART REVIEWS; RE:SOLUTION STARTS OFF ON WRONG FOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies has a new name and a new 
address. Located two doors away from Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions on 
Hollywood Boulevard and a few blocks from the newly relocated TRI Gallery, the 
nonprofit center is positioned to be a highly visible venue for the exhibition 
of contemporary photo-based art. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the center's new name -- Re:Solution, the Los Angeles Center for 
Photographic Studies -- suggests that serious problems may lie ahead. Not only 
is it an unwieldy title, it also represents a fundamental misunderstanding of 
how art works. 
</P>
<P>
 Re:Solution has more than one meaning. It refers to the sharpness of images, 
speaks of artistic resolve -- especially of commitments and priorities often 
articulated by manifestoes -- and further recalls that photographs take shape 
in chemical solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with Re:Solution is that it also suggests that art solves social 
problems. When it's effective, however, art always raises more questions than 
it answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bureaucrats and fund-raisers often treat art as social therapy, but it's 
irresponsible for a publicly funded arts institution to dedicate itself to such 
an ill-conceived goal. The more important job of a venue like this is to 
provide a forum for diverse approaches to art. 
</P>
<P>
 Re:Solution's inaugural exhibition, an annual show this year selected by 
Denise Miller-Clark, director of Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Photography, 
is what results when art is expected to resolve social contradictions. The work 
by its 11 young artists is cliched and forgettable. 
</P>
<P>
 Although (political) content is meant to take precedence, the most interesting 
aspect of the show is the variety of forms in which its images are presented. 
Included are framed and unframed C-prints, black-and-white enlargements, 
light-boxes, projected slides and mirrors. Added to the inventory are 
computer-generated images, storyboards, silk-screened T-shirts, placemats and 
key chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than demonstrating the strength and diversity of socially oriented art, 
the exhibition demonstrates that this type of work has already become an empty, 
academic formalism. The same old idea -- that art is good for us -- gets 
dressed up in a variety of forms. 
</P>
<P>
 For art and society, it is finally offensive that art be required to serve as 
a symbolic solution, when real ones are needed. 
</P>

 Sweet Pop: George Stoll's painstaking paintings of paper towels and fast-food 
wrappers recycle Warhol's famous statement "I want to be a machine." Where the 
father of Pop pushed this impossible desire to its limits, by using 
photo-silk-screens to make paintings and by turning his studio into a factory, 
Stoll backs off from the jarring, impersonal nature of early Pop. 
</P>
<P>
 His brand of Pop is sweeter, more personal, almost touching and wholly 
nostalgic. At TRI Gallery, Stoll's diminutive, hand-crafted copies of the 
disposable wrappers that advertise fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Pizza 
Hut and Taco Bell display the artist's absorption in mindless activity. 
</P>
<P>
 On close view, his touch is omnipresent. None of the patterns are perfect, but 
are suffused with human inconsistencies. Stoll's tracings of newspaper pages 
and sheets of plywood are even looser and more obviously the work of an 
individual, hardly that of a machine. 
</P>
<P>
 His three series share little of Warhol's fascination with relentless 
repetition. Each of Stoll's works is perversely one-of-a-kind. Fussed over and 
precious, they have the presence of collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
 A cautious craft ethos collides with a love of mechanical reproduction. 
Stoll's images blend the hallucinatory perfectionism of Vija Celmins' 
landscapes and Maxwell Hendler's super-realistic pictures with Pop's trademark, 
slap-dash speed. The combination is confused yet charming.

THROW ANOTHER SHRIMP IN THE SAUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE LEVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many shoppers buy pre-cooked shrimp at the supermarket -- it seems so much 
easier to handle than raw. But shrimp that you cook yourself has far better 
flavor and texture than the pre-cooked sort. 
</P>
<P>
 And shrimp is one of the fastest-cooking foods you can buy. It's easier to 
shell than most shellfish, and it's less difficult in the pan than many fish 
since it doesn't fall apart when stirred. 
</P>
<P>
 An easy technique is to cook shrimp directly in a sauce. It's faster and 
simpler than the classic way of cooking in seasoned water, draining, then 
making a separate sauce. Besides, the shrimp gain flavor from the sauce as they 
cook. They are done when the outer surface of their flesh turns pink and the 
inside becomes white. 
</P>
<P>
 This method is perfect for low-fat cooking -- as long as you prepare a light 
sauce, such as a tomato sauce or a stock- or wine-based sauce. Shrimp blend 
well with spicy or delicate flavors, so I flavor the sauces with herbs or 
spices to suit my mood. I prefer basil, cilantro, garlic, thyme, cumin, saffron 
and red pepper flakes because they quickly lend a lively taste to the sauce 
without requiring long simmering. 
</P>
<P>
 Sauced shrimp is delicious served over rice, couscous, orzo or fine noodles. 
You don't even have to worry about reducing the sauce to thicken it; it will be 
absorbed by the rice or pasta anyway. Naturally, by spooning the shrimp over 
rice or pasta you can serve fewer shrimp, so the dish is more economical. 
</P>
<P>
 At the store you will notice that shrimp may be labeled with a number, such as 
31/35; this means 31 to 35 shrimp make one pound and is a more precise 
indication of size than "medium" or "large." The higher the number, the smaller 
the shrimp. I find about 30 per pound, which is often called "large," is a 
convenient size -- large enough so there are not too many shrimp to peel but 
more moderately priced than "jumbo" shrimp.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Garlic, cumin, hot pepper flakes and fresh basil give these shrimp a robust 
flavor. Diced canned tomatoes -- especially during those times of the year when 
great fresh tomatoes are out of season -- make this sauce a snap.  
</P>
<P>
 QUICK SHRIMP IN SPICY TOMATO SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 4 large cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
 2 (14 1/2-ounce) cans diced tomatoes, drained, juice reserved 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon dried leaf thyme 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound large shrimp (30 to 35), shelled and deveined 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons shredded fresh basil 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in large saute pan. Add garlic and saute 1 minute over low heat. Stir 
in cumin, tomatoes and 1/2 cup reserved juice. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. Stir in thyme and hot red pepper flakes. Bring to simmer. Cover and 
cook over low heat 5 minutes. If sauce is too thick, add 2 to 3 tablespoons 
juice from tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir in shrimp. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and cook over low 
heat, stirring occasionally, until tender, 3 to 4 minutes. To check, cut 
through thick end of 1 shrimp. It should be white throughout. Adjust seasonings 
to taste. Serve sprinkled with basil. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 White wine is the secret ingredient in this colorful dish. Serve these shrimp 
on a bed of rice or orzo for a beautiful entree.  
</P>
<P>
 SHRIMP IN RED PEPPER-SAFFRON SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon water 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons potato starch  
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 large sweet red pepper, cut into 1/2-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup bottled clam juice or homemade or frozen fish stock 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon saffron threads 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound large shrimp (30 to 35 per pound), shelled and deveined 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons chopped green onions 
</P>
<P>
 Place water in small bowl. Add potato starch and let dissolve. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in medium saute pan. Add sweet red pepper and saute 5 minutes over 
medium heat. Add wine, clam juice and saffron threads. Bring to boil. Cover and 
simmer 5 minutes over low heat. Stir potato starch mixture to blend. Add to 
sauce, stirring constantly. Bring to simmer, stirring. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir in shrimp. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer over 
low heat until shrimp change color, 3 to 4 minutes. To check whether shrimp are 
done, cut through thick end of 1 shrimp. It should be white throughout. Stir 
green onion into sauce. Adjust seasonings to taste. Makes 2 servings.

WESTSIDE WATCH: JET SKIS MAKE A SPLASH WITH 'BAYWATCH' CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Lifeguards boast some speedy swimmers, but none as 
quick as a Kawasaki Jet Ski at full throttle. 
</P>
<P>
 That much was clear off Santa Monica this week as 16 lifeguards experimented 
with four of the "personal watercraft," sizing them up as possible rescue 
tools. 
</P>
<P>
 No one expects the Jet Skis to replace the old fashioned crawl as the 
preferred method of reaching swimmers in distress. But among the guards who 
trained with the Jet Skis Sunday and Monday, the consensus was that in some 
scenarios they could come in handy, particularly when a swimmer is struggling 
far from the shore or when multiple swimmers need help. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're interesting, we'll see," said lifeguard Lt. Bill Robinson. "I think 
they could work for certain things." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-seater Jet Skis are on loan for six months from a Redondo Beach 
dealership at no charge to the county. They will be used at various local 
beaches and replaced after six months through Kawasaki's Jet Ski Loan Program, 
which provides free watercraft to law enforcement and search-and-rescue 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 As rescue craft, the Jet Skis have a lot going for them. They are quick, 
maneuverable and lack exposed propellers or moving parts that could harm a 
swimmer. They also handle well in shallow or rough water and can be launched 
almost instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the whoops and hollers from the "Baywatch" crowd, they're also 
more fun than a long swim in cold water. 
</P>

 SKY'S THE LIMIT: An aviation "walk of fame," inspired by the Hollywood 
version, has been cleared for takeoff in downtown Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 The precise nature of the exhibit, dubbed the "Flight Path," is still a little 
hazy, but boosters say it will honor Southern California's aviation heritage 
with displays and plaques. Backers hope it will draw some of the millions of 
LAX patrons into the faded retail district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time in 40 years we're getting something new built in the 
central business district," said Morris Plotkin, a former Westchester/LAX 
Chamber of Commerce president who is spearheading the project. 
</P>
<P>
 According to organizers, the first phase of the Flight Path will be part of a 
new shopping village on Sepulveda Boulevard being built by Howard Drollinger, 
downtown Westchester's biggest landlord. The path would gradually be extended 
down Sepulveda, as local shops and hotels get into the spirit by placing 
flight-related memorabilia in their lobbies. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber, which is working in conjunction with the Aero Club of Southern 
California and the Southern California Historical Foundation, also hopes to 
acquire land from nearby Los Angeles International Airport for an aerospace 
learning center. 
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiasm for the project, which has the backing of City Councilwoman Ruth 
Galanter, is running high, though there's something faintly incongruous about 
downtown's love affair with the aeronautics industry. It was, of course, the 
expansion of LAX during the 1960s that devastated the business district in the 
first place.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: CITY HALL LEARNS AN OLD MANURE PILE PROVES A FERTILE AREA 
FOR LITIGATION.

<P>
 Three city officials in Rolling Hills Estates could soon find themselves in 
court being grilled about horse manure. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, horse manure. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Barbara Rauch, Councilman Robert Beck and City Manager Doug Prichard 
have been subpoenaed by an attorney representing the Empty Saddle Club in a 
lawsuit filed by one of the owners of a property next to the riding club. The 
property owner, John Robertson Jr., is suing the club for dumping a reported 
50-foot-high pile of manure and other waste onto the Chandler Trust property 
next door. He says the manure has been piling up for years, and, for fairly 
obvious reasons, he wants it to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The club maintains it was given permission for the manure dumping by 
Robertson's grandfather, Linden H. Chandler, a long time ago. Meanwhile, the 
city, which has been asked by attorney Robert L. Luty to provide documents and 
testify in court concerning the dumping, says it does not want to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to see that thing cleaned up, but we don't know who's at fault," 
Prichard said.

 When you think about farming, you probably envision rich, fertile fields, 
golden rows of wheat, fluffy bolls of cotton or maybe some contented cows 
grazing in a vast pasture. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not farming in Los Angeles County, and the 48th (Assembly) District 
Agricultural Assn., a group that promotes farming education in urban areas, 
wants city kids to know that they don't have to live out in the country to 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
 The group offers free materials for projects about plants, animals and the 
joys of farming to area schools, including Catskill Elementary and Del Amo 
Elementary in Carson and Rogers Intermediate in Lawndale.  
</P>
<P>
 "The whole trick here is showing the kids that when you talk agriculture, 
you're not talking just cows and horses and being out on the farm," said Yvonne 
Savio, a spokeswoman for the program. "It's hydroponics (farming without soil) 
and science and math as well. . . . We try to show them that growing your own 
little garden means having food, and growing cotton means T-shirts," Savio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, students and entire classrooms won more than $18,000 for exhibits 
they made for the program, and several teachers who participated won computers 
for their classrooms.

 There may not be enough room in Redondo Beach for the both of 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach City Treasurer Alice E. DeLong says she doesn't want City 
Councilman Joseph Dawidziak near her because he causes her "distress." She also 
filed an incident report with the Police Department last weekend, complaining 
that she felt Dawidziak was watching her. 
</P>
<P>
 She made the report after an angry confrontation with the councilman Friday in 
City Hall about a memo Dawidziak had written accusing Delong of a possible 
ethics violation. According to Dawidziak, DeLong confronted him in an "agitated 
state," yelling and waving her arms about.  
</P>
<P>
 "She brought it all up," Dawidziak said at this week's council meeting. 
"Called me the 'Bad Man of the West.' It's not true." 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong said the allegations against her are politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's absolutely no conflict of interest," DeLong said, adding that she has 
reported the business interest Dawidziak talked about in his memo every year on 
the disclosure documents she files. QUOTE OF THE WEEK

PLANS PROCEED FOR HOMELESS CENTER BEFORE FINAL REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD and JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A South-Central organization is going ahead with plans to set up a 
controversial homeless center in San Pedro even though federal officials have 
yet to complete a review of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's Technical Institute Inc. has appointed Samuel Theus as its executive 
public relations director to help establish the center on 27 acres of surplus 
Navy property on Taper Avenue. Theus said the institute plans to start moving 
homeless families into the site's 144 units in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Health and Human Services and Housing and Urban Development 
departments -- which approved Turner's application for the land in January -- 
agreed to review the issue more than two months ago in response to allegations 
that the property is not suitable for a homeless center and that the institute 
lacks the track record to make the project succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is still no definite word from department officials about when the 
review will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do expect that they will have something wrapped up pretty soon," said Jack 
Flynn, a spokesman for Health and Human Services. "I'm hoping in the next week 
or two, but I can't say for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Theus said Health and Human Services is now helping the 
Turner's group apply for funding to start the homeless project. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Judy Breitman, a Health and Human Services official who recommended 
that Turner's initial application for the property be approved, has been in 
contact with the institute's executive director, Priscilla Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Breitman has "been giving us the information we need and she's been very 
helpful," Theus said. "They speak regularly, and she's working with us to make 
it happen."  
</P>
<P>
 Breitman could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Theus said the institute is applying for $2.2 million from HHS and HUD to 
start the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy personnel and their families will be moved off the site by the time the 
Long Beach Naval Station closes in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute plans to house up to 880 homeless people, but opposition to the 
proposed homeless center is still strong in the San Pedro community. 
</P>
<P>
 Theus said Turner's officials, who faced more than 1,000 hostile residents at 
meetings in March, will now try a different tack.  
</P>
<P>
 "From now on, what we think we'll do is wait until we actually get the 
property . . . and we have some funding in view, because right now, we've been 
putting the cart before the horse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Theus, who is president of the HELP Public Service Foundation, said his 
organization and Turner's have worked together for 15 years. HELP, at 5460 S. 
Crenshaw Blvd., primarily works with the LAPD, helping the families of prison 
inmates. It also has helped homeless shelters, Theus said.  
</P>
<P>
 His appointment follows the resignation of Turner's former assistant director, 
Johnathon C. Marzet, who was in charge of the shelter plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Marzet resigned amid allegations he forged letters of support and falsified 
his educational qualifications in Turner's application to obtain the Taper 
Avenue site. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) is preparing amendments to the Stewart B. 
McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, the law that gives homeless advocacy groups 
such as Turner's first priority on surplus federal property. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman said Tuesday that the amendments would shift more authority over the 
use of surplus military land into the hands of local officials. She expects to 
have the bill ready to introduce after Congress' July 4 recess. 
</P>
<P>
 "My view is that the community should be able to decide on best use of the 
military property. In theory, the McKinney Act does that; in practice, it does 
not," Harman said. 
</P>
<P>
 She plans to base her bill on recommendations for using surplus government 
property made by a task force appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson. She also will 
include three suggestions made by a local committee that was established to 
look at possibilities for surplus military land in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee intends to speak on the issue at a general town meeting at 7 
p.m. tonight in the Peck Park Community Room on Western Avenue.

$1.7 MILLION IN TESTS PLANNED FOR AREA BESET BY TOXICS; ENVIRONMENT: THE EPA 
WILL SCRUTINIZE THE SOIL, WATER AND AIR ALONG WEST 204TH STREET, WHICH IS NEAR 
TWO FORMER INDUSTRIAL SITES WHERE CONTAMINATION WAS FOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal government has unveiled a $1.7-million plan to test soil, 
household air and tap water in a neighborhood near Torrance that is wracked by 
fears of pollution from two toxic-waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers will begin today boring out soil samples along West 204th Street where 
some yards are known to contain fill tainted with chunks of the banned 
pesticide DDT. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood of modest homes and duplexes is flanked by two toxic chemical 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 To the northwest is the former Montrose Chemical Corp., once a major DDT 
manufacturer and now a federal Superfund site. And to the north is a proposed 
Superfund site, the Del Amo Study Area, which was once home to a synthetic 
rubber factory operated by Shell Oil Co. and the Dow Chemical Co., among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 The soil results, due back in about six weeks, will help U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency officials decide whether to permanently relocate families 
found to be living atop or near DDT-laced soil. 
</P>
<P>
 As teams of experts probe their neighborhood, 33 families wait in nearby 
hotels, where they have lived since April at federal expense. Many of them have 
called on the government to move them to new homes, but the EPA's four-state 
regional office has only once permanently moved families living near a 
Superfund site. The area is one of 1,200 toxic-waste sites nationwide 
considered the most hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing what chemicals may permeate the fill soil is "critical to the analysis 
of permanent relocation," said John Blevins, the EPA section chief overseeing 
the testing. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA will study the extent of DDT contamination by employing a machine 
called a "geoprobe" to take soil samples from as far as 15 feet below the 
surface. The soil also will be tested for contaminants from the nearby Del Amo 
toxic-chemical site.  
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials plan to monitor air inside the homes of the families that 
have been relocated, looking for benzene -- a known Del Amo contaminant -- and 
other chemicals. They will also test tap water to assure it is not 
contaminated.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, tests are scheduled to determine if such chemicals as benzene, 
naphthalene and hydrogen sulfide are escaping into the air over waste pits in 
the Del Amo area, directly north of homes along West 204th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Most testing will be done this summer and fall, while residents remain in 
temporary housing. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those residents, community leader Cynthia Babich, questions whether the 
planned testing is thorough enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel it falls short of what we were proposing," said Babich, who had 
asked for a longer study. "Since they're sinking all this money into it, it 
should be the most primo testing they've done." 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the testing will be West 204th Street from Budlong Avenue to 
Catalina Street, in an unincorporated Los Angeles County area east of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents' concerns were ignited this spring with the discovery of large 
amounts of DDT in two back yards on the north side of West 204th. After the 
yard cleanup, the EPA announced last week it believes the DDT came from 
Montrose and is ordering the firm to handle the $2-million disposal of 
contaminated dirt. Lawyers for the agency and Montrose were to confer this week 
about the order. 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag for testing: $300,000 for fill-soil tests, $600,000 to study 
indoor air, $200,000 to monitor tap water and $600,000 for the waste-pit air 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
 The government may ask Shell and Dow to conduct the waste-pit tests, Blevins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomi Van de Brooke, spokeswoman for Shell and Dow, said Tuesday that the 
companies have offered to do the work and are talking to the EPA about 
procedures. "We believe the work plan needs to be drafted so that it is 
conclusive about what is and isn't coming from the pits," said Van de Brooke, 
adding that 1984 tests at the pits did not show chemicals beyond normal 
background range. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA will have its geoprobe soil-testing machine on public display at 2 
p.m. today at 1055 W. 204th Street. Also today, some residents plan a 
neighborhood march that Babich describes as a show of unity addressed to 
Montrose, Shell and Dow. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Babich: "I want them to know off the bat, if they don't know already, 
that we're a strong, organized community."

ARTIST PUTTING FINAL TOUCHES ON REFURBISHED AVALON THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eva Matysekis playing a painstaking role in the $750,000 restoration of the 
Avalon Theatre on Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance-based artist, who restored a Rembrandt in her native Poland, has 
been working 12 to 14 hours a day since early April, returning color and detail 
to the huge mural in the movie theater in the Casino Building. 
</P>
<P>
 The paintings, which depict life on the island since before human habitation, 
were done by John Gabriel Beckman, who also painted murals at Graumann's 
Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I construct whatever is missing and restore whatever is there," Matysek said. 
"It's not my own creation; I'm just trying to preserve the original." 
</P>
<P>
 The Art Deco theater is undergoing its first complete restoration since the 
Casino Building was built in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 The overhaul has been in the planning stages for two years, said Billy 
Delbert, director of the Casino Building for the Santa Catalina Island Co. A 
team of about 20 workers is expected to finish the work in August. 
</P>
<P>
 But Matysek has the most exacting role. 
</P>
<P>
 She has dusted away paint that had turned to powder on the 15-by-250-foot 
mural, and is painting with brushes as small as one-twelfth of an inch. 
Larger-than-life Native Americans and horses once again spring from the theater 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love it. I feel very pleased to be able to help save these pieces of 
art," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater's renovation also includes removing the 1,184 folding seats from 
their wrought-iron bases, so the plush covers can be reupholstered and the 
wooden seat backs and armrests refinished. 
</P>
<P>
 The worn carpet has been replaced with one of royal reds and blues to match 
the design of the wooden aisle ends. 
</P>
<P>
 In the foyer, the fresco ceiling and lighting fixtures have been cleaned, and 
workers are refinishing the dozens of 12-foot-high black-walnut wall panels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything will be as close to original as we can get," Delbert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater is on the ground floor of the Casino Building, constructed for $2 
million at Big Sugar Point, on the shores of the island's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The building was conceived by Chicago entrepreneur William Wrigley Jr., who 
established the Santa Catalina Island Co. 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed by Walter Webber and Sumner A. Spaulding, it was erected not as a 
gambling palace, but in the traditional spirit of the Italian word casino , 
meaning a place of entertainment. It also has a ballroom directly above the 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "They felt early on that people wouldn't come to Avalon just for the sake of 
coming to Avalon, that there had to be things for them to do," explained Wayne 
Griffin, executive director of the Catalina Island Chamber of Commerce & 
Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater, with its high-domed, silver-leaf ceiling dotted with twinkling 
stars, creates a feeling of being outdoors. "That's why we call it an 
atmospheric theater," Delbert said.  
</P>
<P>
 Silent films were accompanied by music from the Page pipe organ that still 
sits in front of the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, merchant seamen were entertained by performers, bands and 
boxers on the theater stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, one recent movie release is presented there every week. But silent 
films are still occasionally reeled through Brenkert carbon arc projectors. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a showing of Rupert Julian's silent film version of "Phantom of the 
Opera" earlier this month was sold out.

MARQUEZ CANYON PLAN STIRS DISPUTE; DEVELOPMENT: BRENTWOOD BUSINESSMAN HOPES TO 
BUILD CAR MUSEUM AND BOTANICAL GARDEN ON 5.5-ACRE SITE IN PACIFIC PALISADES. 
LEADER OF COMMUNITY GROUP VOICES OPPOSITION TO PROPOSAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A wealthy Brentwood businessman has unveiled a plan to build an antique car 
museum and botanical garden in Marquez Canyon, reviving a long-simmering debate 
over the future of the Pacific Palisades site. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Mullin hopes to succeed where others have failed, namely, to garner 
enough community support to buy and develop 5.5 acres owned by the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy in an area of million-dollar homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullin, a high-powered corporate pension plan consultant, wants to build the 
nonprofit museum and gardens near Sunset Boulevard and Marquez Avenue on 11 
acres of separate, but connected, parcels owned by the conservancy, the city of 
Los Angeles and a private developer. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum would house some of the businessman-philanthropist's extensive 
collection of pre-World War II French racing vehicles, surrounded by a 
botanical garden that supporters have said would be comparable to Canada's 
famed Butchart Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a strong and abiding love for both autos and botanical gardens, and 
sees this (project) as an opportunity to merge the two interests," said 
development consultant Gary Morris, a spokesman for Mullin. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris said his client is "cautiously optimistic" about the project's chances. 
"The more exchange we've had with the community, the more receptive people have 
become." 
</P>
<P>
 But others, including the head of a community group whose members have long 
opposed development of the conservancy property, expressed a different view. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are adamantly against it," said Kurt Toppel, president of the Marquez 
Knolls Neighborhood Assn. "The consensus here is that (the conservancy parcel) 
either be used as a simple neighborhood park or be left alone." 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy, which has desperately wanted to sell the property since 
acquiring it as part of a complicated land swap in 1991, is expected to 
formally open bids next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers say the project's prospects are more likely to depend on Mullin's 
success in wooing community support than on his ability to spend the millions 
of dollars it would take to develop his plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing concerns about traffic and noise, some community leaders have 
suggested they will go to court, if necessary, to block the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, who presented Mullin's plans to the conservancy board last week, 
dismissed the traffic concerns, saying that plans call for the garden and 
museum to be visited by appointment only in a system similar to that used at 
the J. Paul Getty Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy obtained the land in 1991 from the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power as part of an arrangement to help finance the purchase of 
Fryman Canyon in the hills above Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 To help raise the funds, the conservancy took $2 million from a trust fund 
earmarked for Temescal Gateway Park, which is also in Pacific Palisades. The 
DWP, in turn, transferred the Marquez property to the conservancy with the 
understanding that proceeds from the sale would be used to reimburse the trust 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Marquez residents cried foul, insisting that the canyon was being 
sacrificed to preserve another canyon 11 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Not wanting to be cast as the villain in a struggle between the neighbors and 
would-be developers, the conservancy took extraordinary steps to accommodate a 
last-minute bid by a group of Marquez neighbors who professed interest in 
buying the property for $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But the group raised only $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy further delayed the sale after another group, the Marquez 
Canyon Preservation Assn., pushed for a special tax district to allow the 3,500 
households nearest the canyon to preserve it as parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 But the effort fizzled last year after Los Angeles Councilman Marvin Braude, 
who represents Pacific Palisades, said he would not pursue the creation of a 
tax district unless 70% of the people who would have to foot the bill supported 
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other funds were later used to make the needed improvements to 
Temescal park, the cash-strapped conservancy has yet to fully recover from the 
1991 transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph T. Edmiston, the agency's executive director, said the proceeds from 
the sale of the Marquez property are desperately needed to help purchase a 
private parcel surrounded by parkland in Runyon Canyon in the Hollywood Hills, 
where a property owner wants to build a 10,000-square-foot mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmiston, who was criticized by Pacific Palisades activists for the 
conservancy's role in the Marquez arrangement, stressed that the agency did not 
initiate talks with Mullin, even though it is legally obligated to try to sell 
the property. "They came to us," he said.

 A decade after it was rocked by controversy when HIV contamination was found 
in some of its blood supply, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center faces more 
repercussions from the episode: The families of two infants who died of AIDS 
after receiving transfusions at the hospital have contended in lawsuits that 
the hospital deliberately withheld information about the tainted blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Both babies, Anique Kasper and Aaron Barbakow, were born prematurely in the 
early 1980s and were given HIV-tainted transfusions while in the center's 
neonatal intensive-care unit. They subsequently died of AIDS, Aaron in 
February, 1991, at age 9 and Anique in July, 1992, at age 11. Jordan Barbakow, 
Aaron's twin brother, also was given a transfusion at Cedars, but is healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 The families recently have filed separate lawsuits in Los Angeles Superior 
Court alleging that Cedars' staff members knew of the probability that their 
children had received tainted transfusions several years before the families 
were notified in 1987, a claim the hospital denies. 
</P>
<P>
 The suits seek unspecified damages for emotional distress. The families say 
that if they had known earlier, they could have coped better with their 
children's illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 At the crux of both suits is when the hospital discovered the blood 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital has maintained that it did not learn about the tainted blood 
until it conducted a "look back study" in 1987, matching the contaminated blood 
through donor records with recipients, as other clinics and blood centers were 
doing at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Thomas Mundy, a Cedars physician who directed the study in conjunction 
with the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, made his findings 
known in 1987 to the families with babies born at Cedars. Mundy found that 34 
of about 700 babies born prematurely at the hospital received HIV-contaminated 
blood between 1980 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 12 of those children have died since 1993, Mundy said, but an exact 
figure was not available. Cedars is treating 13, said hospital spokesman Ron 
Wise. A person can have the virus for eight to 11 years before getting 
full-blown AIDS, according to the Centers for Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruce Kasper, 53, of Playa del Rey, alleges the hospital was aware of 
contaminated blood before Mundy's study. He points to a 1983 blood-product 
liability lawsuit filed against the hospital by the mother of a child who died 
of AIDS after receiving contaminated blood. 
</P>
<P>
 That suit, filed by Helen Kushnick, a former manager for "Tonight Show" host 
Jay Leno who lives in the San Fernando Valley, claimed the hospital was 
negligent in providing her son, Sam, with contaminated blood. But a judge 
dismissed the case on the ground that the hospital could not have known about 
the virus in the blood because no screening test had been developed yet. Such a 
test did not become available until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasper points to Helen Kushnick's sworn statement in court papers in which she 
said a Cedars pathologist acknowledged the contaminated blood, but declined to 
disseminate the information. 
</P>
<P>
 "In October of 1983, my husband (Jerrold)and I met with Dr. Dennis Goldfinger 
. . . and a representative of Cedars' Risk Management Department. My husband 
and I insisted at that time that Cedars contact parents of other children who 
were transfused while being treated at Cedars' neonatal unit. Dr. Goldfinger 
stated that he did not wish to so inform other parents because such 
notification may have alarmed them unnecessarily," Kushnick said in the 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldfinger's lawyer, C. Snyder Patin, defended the doctor, saying Kasper's 
"suit is completely groundless. There is no basis to it whatsoever. Fraudulent 
concealment is an absolute lie." 
</P>
<P>
 Kasper's and ex-wife Nicole Pascale's suit, filed in March last year, is 
scheduled for trial later this year. A trial date for the suit by Dan and 
Beatrice Barbakow of Los Angeles, which was filed a few months ago, has not 
been set. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital's lawyers did not return phone calls seeking comment on either 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 But in court papers filed with the Kasper suit, which is further along in the 
legal process, Cedars' attorney Barbara Reardon defended the hospital, saying 
that Kasper has not presented any evidence of negligence or misconduct. And, 
Reardon contended, Kasper has not shown a date when anyone learned that Anique 
Kasper was transfused with HIV-tainted blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds have sued hospitals and blood banks because of tainted blood 
transfusions, but juries generally have ruled against the plaintiffs on the 
ground that hospitals either did not have a screening test available or used 
procedures accepted throughout the industry at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilmer Harris, an attorney representing Kasper, sees those past cases as 
distinct from his. The other cases were based on the theory that the blood 
banks failed to use reasonable care in handling the blood and, as a result, 
some patients contracted AIDS. Harris' case contends that once Cedars' 
administrators became aware of the blood supply, they had a duty to inform the 
patients, even if those patients were no longer under their care. 
</P>
<P>
 To Kasper, his case is clear. "With the death of Sam Kushnick, the hospital 
had an obligation, a responsibility to look back at all the babies in the 
hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David Goldstein, the chief of internal medicine at the USC School of 
Medicine, agreed. In a deposition on behalf of Kasper filed a few weeks ago, he 
said that Cedars had an obligation to notify parents about the blood supply 
when they first learned of the possibility of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Joseph Church, clinical director of the AIDS Center at Childrens 
Hospital in Los Angeles, said it's difficult to locate people possibly 
contaminated with the HIV virus. His center treated Aaron Barbakow and Anique 
Kasper in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I can tell, I don't see fault anywhere," said Church, who is 
expected to file a deposition on behalf of Cedars in the Kasper suit. "Look at 
the millions of people who received blood products from 1978 to 1985. With 
records, hospitals can find less than 20% (of patients), so anyone trying to 
reach patients had to use research and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
By the time a record is three years or older, the information is non-traceable" 
because people move. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Shirley Fannin of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services 
said there was no way of knowing about or preventing the tainted transfusions. 
"It was never my impression that anyone was concealing anything. It was public 
knowledge," she said, recalling that she and the Kushnicks were interviewed 
extensively by the media in the early 1980s. Local and national media did 
stories on the Kushnick case. 
</P>
<P>
 "A hospital can only do so much" to find people who may be contaminated with 
the virus, Fannin said. "I find it hard to believe unless someone was off on 
Mars that they did not hear" about HIV blood contamination from clinics and 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedars attorneys have not commented on Barbakow's suit, filed this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbakow, 45, said that if the hospital "could do it (notify them) in 1987, 
they could have done it earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone's life is in danger, doesn't a hospital have an obligation to go 
back and track down patients and do all they can to help" even after they have 
stopped treatment there? Kasper asked. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Cedars offered medical care to Anique Kasper after receiving numerous 
letters from Kasper. It offered AIDS-related medical care, however, only beyond 
what medical insurance would absorb. Bruce Kasper did not accept it and 
considered the limited offer a slap in the face from the facility where Anique 
contracted the virus. The same offer was extended to Dan Barbakow, who also 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Barbakow and Bruce Kasper have the only current suits against Cedars, 
Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, the case will come down to whether Cedars-Sinai can put down a 
plausible case (explaining) why they did not tell anyone about the blood," 
Harris said.

RELUCTANT NOVICE: BUYING A NEW SET OF WHEELS WITHOUT DOING A SPIN-OUT; IT ALL 
STARTED WITH A LOUD THUD COMING FROM SOMEWHERE INSIDE THE CAR. IT ENDS AT THE 
DEALERSHIP WITH A WAVE TO SALESMEN NAMED BILL AND PETE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEO SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You hear a half-shriek, half-groan as you shift your car into reverse. You try 
to ignore it -- maybe it came from a neighbor's vehicle, maybe it was a beached 
whale. 
</P>
<P>
 What you find more difficult to ignore is the loud thud coming from somewhere 
inside your 4-year-old, 118,000-mile Hyundai, as you stop at the first traffic 
light. The gears seem to be slipping. True, you don't know a manifold from a 
billfold, but you suspect something's up with the transmission. 
</P>
<P>
 You know you should have the car looked at immediately. It's just that you are 
a strict practitioner of what-you-don't-know-can't-hurt-you car maintenance. If 
no one says your car needs $1,000 of repair work, it doesn't need $1,000 of 
repair work. It's that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 But the zoo animal under your hood would have you believe otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 So you bring the beloved Hyundai, with it's one year of payments remaining, to 
a mechanic who says he'll take a quick look at it for you. It's quick, all 
right. It doesn't take long for a guy to shake his head. For once you were 
correct with an auto diagnosis. Your constant fear of the worst has finally 
proved accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The transmission fluid's bubbling," the mechanic says. "Look." 
</P>
<P>
 You look. You don't see bubbling. You don't exactly see fluid. You don't even 
see the transmission -- well, maybe you do, you're not really sure. You nod 
your head in agreement. "Yep," you say, "it's sure bubbling." 
</P>
<P>
 The mechanic says you'll either need to repair the transmission or replace it. 
And the best way to do either is through the dealer. It may cost more, he says, 
but it's worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 You call the dealer. They say they'll fix it for $700 or replace it for $1,200 
to $1,500. You emit a sound like the one the car is making. You decide to have 
the car checked out by a transmission specialist in Ventura. He gives you 
similar estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 The next few days are filled with a series of calls to other auto experts to 
find out if the car is worth pouring money into. The term "throw-away car" is 
used often. You don't take that as a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
 After much deliberation, and determining that the car will cost more to 
maintain than it's worth, you go looking for new transportation. Not that you 
can afford it, not by a long shot. But hey, you've got plastic up the exhaust 
pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 First you need to do your homework -- find out what people recommend. A friend 
has recently bought a Geo Prizm. Your mother has recently bought a Geo Prizm. 
You'll check it out. Another friends suggest a Saturn. You go the nearest 
bookstore to sneak a free peek at the Consumer Reports car guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer Reports loves the Prizm. It loves the Saturn. It loves a few other 
small cars that are way out of your price range. Of course your true price 
range tops out at about 27 dollars and 42 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The big day finally arrives. Test-drive day. You pull into the local Geo 
dealership. They see you coming. Maybe they just hear your transmission -- 
either way, they're drooling. You get out, and within seconds a salesman is 
shaking your hand like a long-lost buddy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Pete. Pete will be your friend for the better part of the next hour -- 
and into the coming weekend. You drive him around the block. As you approach 
the final leg of your ride, he makes you an offer. After all, if you bought the 
car now, he says, you would be the dealership's first sale of the day and would 
get a special discount. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks, but no thanks. You love the car, but have to test-drive one or two 
others. You tell him you'll be back. 
</P>
<P>
 You proceed to a Toyota dealership. You mention to the sales guy there that 
you're interested in trading in your car. He glances at it and says, "Nobody'll 
give you anything for that." You say thank you and fly off to Saturn -- the 
dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturn has made a name for itself with a no-haggle, consumer-friendly 
operation. That sounds good. You test-drive two cars with a very gracious, 
soft-sell dealer who tells you his life story. In fact, you like the guy so 
much his soft-sell approach has turned into hard guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, a Thursday, you receive a letter in the mail from your pal Pete. 
He wants to thank you for driving his car. 
</P>
<P>
 After weighing your options you decide to go back to Saturn and Geo on Friday, 
to see what they can offer you. While you're shaving that morning Pete calls to 
say hi. He wants to let you know that he'll be at the showroom until 6 p.m. You 
say thanks, consider asking him to lunch or something, and tell him you'll 
probably see him later. 
</P>
<P>
 As you thought, Saturn is too expensive, and they estimate they'll only give 
you $1,000 for your old car. That would leave you with about $1,200 to pay. 
Can't be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Back to Geo. It's 5:30, and Pete has gone home for the evening. But salesman 
Bill, a friendly former police officer, will show you the car. You want it. 
It's too late to buy the Prizm, so you ask if Bill will be in Saturday or 
Sunday. He'll be in Sunday, he says, and so will Pete. Now you know you're in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday you pull into the dealership. There's Pete. There's Bill. They both 
wave to you. You feel like a two-timer. You think about going over to Pete. You 
consider Bill. Pete. Bill. You pick Bill, the former police officer. Pete isn't 
pleased. His body language says it all. He discusses matters with Bill. They 
decide to split the deal, assuming they make one. 
</P>
<P>
 They do make one -- one you'll be paying off until midway through 1999. At 
least you won't have to take it into the 21st Century.

 Ending an attrition program that cut 77 positions in three years, the Redondo 
Beach City Council added two firefighting positions to the city's staff 
Tuesday.The decision came as part of the approval of the city's budget for 
fiscal year 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's $63-million budget also adds two public works employees and $55,000 
for incentives, bonuses and other compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 A controversial plan to charge residents and businesses a monthly fee to fund 
$16 million in maintenance and repairs to the city's sewer system was vetoed by 
Mayor Brad Parton earlier this month, but the city did approve $2 million to 
start some of those projects under the new budget. MARY GUTHRIE

SOUNDS: LATEST WORK IS BOWEN'S MOST HIGH-PROFILE; COMPOSER AND PERFORMER OF NEW 
MUSIC SPENT YEARS WORKING ON THE FRINGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Listening to the lilting strains of Gene Bowen's new album "The Vermilion Sea" 
as you drive along the Rincon, some kind of sonic/geographical synchronicity 
takes place. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vermilion Sea was the name given by the Spanish explorers to the Gulf of 
California, and this terrain, full of dry brush and the gently lapping expanse 
of the Pacific Ocean, is much the same scene you'll find hundreds of miles 
south. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a terrain that honors no border. Likewise, the musical map. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail to Bowen himself leads to an apartment half a block from the beach 
in Ventura. Here, the Nordic-looking Bowen has a few guitars, a synthesizer and 
the all-important computer -- his main composing tool -- and piles of records 
and CDs. A surfboard -- for his 13-year-old son -- sits on the front porch. The 
bare necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen's project was recently released on Gyroscope, the new label with a 
roster that includes Brian Eno, Harold Budd and others at the soothing end of 
the new music spectrum. This is a tender time for Bowen, who has spent years 
working on the fringes of new music as a composer and performer, and whose 
current project is his most high-profile. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't happen overnight. Three years ago, Bowen began his 
work-in-progress, creating the raw material on synthesizers and computers. He 
gradually replaced the canned segments with his own guitar parts and tracks by 
guest musicians, including such key new music players as percussionist John 
Bergamo, bassist Buell Neidlinger, and Budd. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a couple of pieces," Bowen said, "I actually stripped away the initial 
composition and just left the player, like on the North Indian flute piece ('As 
I Lay Dying'). I ended up completely stripping the synthesizer away and leaving 
that flute solo until the end." 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, the real instrumental heart of the album is Mexico City-based 
harpist/vocalist Cynthia Valenzuela. Her clean, delicate harp parts are laced 
throughout most of the album, whether on the themes of Mexican folk songs or on 
original material. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've traveled in Mexico extensively," Bowen explained, over a lunch of a 
tostada and beer, "and I've always had the notion of writing pieces to Mexican 
folk songs, ever since I heard Copland's 'El Salon de Mexico,' which is ripped 
off by every western movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of my concept for the album was to incorporate American folk melodies 
along with African and Mexican folk songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Though born in Mississippi, Bowen discovered America as an Army brat whose 
family moved regularly. The family finally landed in Oxnard when Bowen was in 
high school, partly because Bowen persuaded his father to move to the land of 
the Beach Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've basically been in Ventura County since then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying music at Moorpark College, Bowen found his curiosity piqued and 
his aesthetics forged at the then-newly opened Cal Arts. There, a happy 
convergence of studies in ethnic music, electronic music and other disciplines 
left its mark on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My interests came through guitar music and songwriting coupled with interest 
in folk and ethnic music, where repetition is always so important. Repetition 
and texture are almost more important than western harmony. For me, it's always 
been a natural thing to be doing as little as possible," he grins, 
half-serious. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '70s, Bowen wrote music, worked as a teacher, and played in the 
country-Western band The Chesterfield Kings ("named after our favorite 
cigarette"), which played at spots such as the old Glenoaks Hotel in Santa 
Paula. Next came the rock band the Sleeping Dogs, which recorded an album for a 
French label that went belly up just after the album's release. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen also did some music-copying work for renowned composer-conductor John 
Adams -- as he did briefly for Frank Zappa -- and was hired by Adams to perform 
in the "New and Unusual Music" series of the San Francisco Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Budd, in particular, has been a friend and mentor to Bowen since his Cal Arts 
days, when Budd was teaching there. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s, Bowen released an experimental record called "Bourgeois Magnetic" 
on the Cantil label, run by Budd and himself. Later, Bowen worked on Budd's 
album "Abandoned Cities," released on Opal/Warner Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Budd and Bowen also pieced together various music at the Old Rugged Cross, the 
name of Bowen's home studio on a ranch in Fillmore where he lived and worked 
for 14 years. The pair hope to release music from those sessions titled "The 
Orange Grove Archives." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, "The Vermilion Sea" is his focus, the long-awaited opus now gone 
public. "Due to that long process, I was able to live with those pieces and 
really hone them -- which is why I can't even stand to listen to it now," he 
said. "It seems to hold up. People comment that they like the way it flows. 
It's sort of like a novel. You want it to start, go through all its chapters 
and end." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the terrible things is: How do you categorize this kind of music? This 
is a battle everybody who doesn't do pop music is up against. People ask me 'is 
it New Age?' I say 'no, it's more serious than that.' "

CITY HALL; HAWTHORNE; OFFICIAL PROPOSES 1.5% UTILITY TAX HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Interim City Manager James A. Algie has proposed increasing the utility user 
tax by 1.5% to help fight a growing budget deficit.  
</P>
<P>
 Algie has asked the City Council to consider the measure to help keep a lid on 
the budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the tax would increase from 3.5% to 5%, raising consumers' 
bills $3 to $4 per utility each month, Algie said. Utilities affected are 
water, electricity, gas, phone, cable television and cellular telephone 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The city takes in $3.6 million a year under the existing tax rate, including 
$600,000 earmarked to match a federal grant to pay for six additional police 
officers over the next three years, Algie said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax increase is part of a budget that estimates the city's deficit at $1.4 
million, said Algie, who took over as city manager several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to vote on the budget Wednesday. JON GARCIA

CITY HALL; INGLEWOOD; CASINO REVENUE TO HELP BALANCE BUDGET 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council, in a 4-1 vote, approved a $161-million budget that included 
no layoffs and maintained services without a general tax increase, said City 
Manager Paul D. Eckles.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1994-95 budget was balanced with an expected $4 million from the Hollywood 
Park Casino, which opens Friday, Eckles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new revenue is also being used to fund two new police programs, including 
4,000 hours of police overtime for curfew enforcement and nine new police 
officers for a community policing program based in local elementary schools, 
Eckles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget also includes an average 3.5% fee increase on residents' water 
bills. The increase covers the higher cost of buying water from the 
Metropolitan Water District while the city's water treatment plant is being 
renovated, Eckles said. JON GARCIA

2 SUSPECTED LAWBREAKERS ARE SHOT DEAD; CRIME: A TORRANCE LIQUOR STORE CLERK 
KILLS AN ALLEGED ROBBER, WHILE IN HAWTHORNE A BODY IS FOUND IN A PARKING LOT.

<P>
 In separate incidents in Torrance and Hawthorne last weekend, two suspected 
lawbreakers were shot and killed and another was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 In Torrance, an alleged armed robber was shot dead and another was wounded by 
a 67-year-old liquor store clerk. In Hawthorne, a man was found dead from a 
gunshot wound in a parking lot early Sunday morning, his body surrounded by car 
stereos. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Torrance incident, investigators say two men armed with at least one 
9-mm handgun walked into the Red Eye liquor store in the 21100 block of 
Hawthorne Boulevard about 10 p.m. Sunday and demanded money from the clerk. The 
clerk dropped behind the counter and the robbers started shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk then grabbed a .357-caliber handgun and fired back, hitting one of 
the suspects in the chest, Torrance Sgt. Gil Kranke said. The clerk suffered a 
grazing wound in the neck. Both suspects ran from the store, Kranke said, 
pursued by the clerk, who fired another shot. The suspect who had been shot in 
the chest collapsed and died after running about 40 yards into an alley next to 
the store. His companion got in a car and drove off but was arrested about an 
hour later at the hospital where he had sought treatment for a bullet wound in 
the leg, Kranke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk, whose name was not released, was treated for his neck wound and 
released, Kranke said. The wounded suspect was identified by police as Michael 
Delee Overton, 19, of Los Angeles. The dead suspect was identified as Bonnice 
Lockett Jr., 17, also of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Kranke said the clerk apparently shot in self-defense, and no charges against 
him are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Sunday in Hawthorne, about 4:40 a.m., police responded to reports of 
shooting in an apartment building's underground parking lot in the 13000 block 
of Doty Avenue and found the body of a man in his 20s with a gunshot wound to 
the head. Four car stereos that apparently had been taken from cars parked in 
the lot were found next to the body.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the man may have been shot by someone who caught him 
stealing the stereos. Sheriff's homicide investigators who are assisting 
Hawthorne police in the case interviewed numerous residents of the 76-unit 
apartment building, but no one has been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens are permitted to use deadly force to protect themselves or others 
from bodily harm, but not simply to protect property. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Sgt. Larry Lincoln said the dead man has not been identified, but 
apartment manager Guadalupe Gonzalez said he did not appear to have been a 
resident of the apartment building.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A local family plans to donate three acres on Silver Spur Road and Crenshaw 
Boulevard to the city of Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Levitt and her daughters Alexandria and Susan have proposed giving the 
land in memory of the family patriarch, Al Levitt, who died last year at age 
69, said their attorney, William A. Finer.Al Levitt was a developer and 
property manager. 
</P>
<P>
 However, two of the estate's acres are in the city of Rancho Palos Verdes. 
Finer said he will ask Rancho Palos Verdes to adjust its boundary so the land 
can become part of Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although council members in Rolling Hills Estates have discussed the donation, 
they have not decided if it should be rezoned.  
</P>
<P>
 The Levitt family has lived in the South Bay for more than 30 years. SUSAN

 As the group of children huddles by the pond, they gaze intently at the 
insects they have trapped in small, glass boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, let the bugs go where you found them so they can go back to their homes," 
hollers Holly Gray, a 17-year-old volunteer with the Palos Verdes/South Bay 
Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, ages 6 to 12, wander back to where they caught the creatures and 
release them. 
</P>
<P>
 On this Saturday morning, the youngsters are beginning their three-hour 
activity in Wilderness Park, Redondo Beach, with a game of charades, imitating 
their favorite animals and birds. One boy keeps the group guessing when he gets 
down on all fours, tucks his head in and makes like a slug. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the morning is over, the children also hear Native American tales and 
touch fluorescent green iguanas, a salamander, snakes and other living 
reptiles. 
</P>
<P>
 They are participating in "Sharing Nature With Children," a program initiated 
by the Audubon Society's local president, Lillian Light, three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which attracts about 30 children to the park one Saturday a 
month, is designed to develop the instinctive feelings that children have for 
nature in hopes of teaching them to respect and care for the ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an education difficult to come by in the urban sprawl of Los Angeles 
County, but one that is essential, Light says. 
</P>
<P>
 "A life without natural places to go is not worth living," she said. "If you 
experience nature, you love it and you want to save it."  
</P>
<P>
 In the 11-acre park on Camino Real that used to be a Nike missile base in the 
1940s, leaves crunch beneath the children's feet as they move through the park, 
touching trees and spotting possums and turtles. Birds sing overhead, a cool 
breeze rustles through the treetops and a fresh, earthy aroma fills the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Beatrice Rasof, a retired clinical psychologist from Harbor/UCLA Medical 
Center who also volunteers for the Audubon Society, says children who do not 
experience nature lose their connection with it. 
</P>
<P>
 She lays pine cones, sycamore leaves, wild radish and other plants on a yellow 
bandanna so the children can identify them in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many of us live in the cities, and when we go out for a picnic we might 
not be aware of all the senses that are used because we're so used to using our 
eyes for everything," Rasof says. 
</P>
<P>
 Children in the 1990s seem to be more aware of the need to preserve the 
environment than were earlier generations, Rasof said. Schools are playing a 
big part in this new awareness, she said, by encouraging students to recycle 
and by including programs similar to "Sharing Nature With Children" in their 
curricula.

BRIEFLY; FIRE SAFETY: BOARD URGES BAN ON WOOD-SHINGLE ROOFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Wildfire Safety Panel has released a report calling for 
a ban on wood-shake and shingle roofs in all "high-risk fire and buffer zone" 
areas in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory committee, formed by the county Board of Supervisors, included 
representatives of the U.S. Forest Service, Department of Public Works and the 
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also made a series of recommendations for fire-prone areas affected 
by last fall's canyon fires, such as Topanga and Malibu. Among them: boosting 
the capacity and reach of rural water systems and re-evaluating emergency 
access routes.

TPOICS; ART; MUSEUM SERIES GOES BEHIND THE CANVAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contemporary art can baffle even the most ardent art lovers. Sometimes an 
abstract or conceptual work offers hardly a clue to its meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Santa Monica Museum of Art, the mysteries of contemporary art and 
culture are unraveled during the museum's free Friday Evening Salons. The 
informal sessions take place almost every week, providing an opportunity for 
the public to participate in the exchange of ideas about art and other 
imaginative endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always talked about trying to create opportunities to demystify the 
art-making process, especially in installations that we do," said Scott Boberg, 
the museum's education director. "I think that's true for the salon series. . . 
. It's almost a voyeuristic opportunity for people to come in and get inside an 
artist's brain and find out whatthey're thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Boberg cites the informal, "living room" character of the salons -- and the 
fact that they are presented regularly. "There's questions and answers; it's a 
comfortable thing, not intimidating," he said. "It really gives an immediacy 
and accessibility to what's being discussed or presented." 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical salon, one artist or more will start a dialogue about a current 
exhibit or about a contemporary arts issue that has nothing to do with the 
museum's schedule. Friday night, Lili Lakich, founder of the Museum of Neon 
Art, will be at the museum to discuss the use of neon by fine artists and the 
history of neon signage. Betye Saar's installation, "Limbo: A Transitional 
State or Place," which incorporates neon, will serve as a starting point for 
discussion. (The Saar exhibit closes Sunday). 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a contemporary art institution. Why not try to get the people who are 
making the art together with the people who are trying to understand it? I 
think part of our role here is to provide a kind of participative, interpretive 
forum between art, audience and artist," said museum director Thomas Rhoads. 
"It's a unique opportunity that we as a contemporary art institution have." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhoads describes three aspects of the salons: "In some senses, it's artists 
talking about their process and how they create work. In other senses, it's a 
cultural kind of phenomenon where people from different backgrounds come and 
meet people different from who they are. The third one is probably more 
museum-like, about art ideas or aesthetic kinds of ideas, which functions in a 
much more traditional kind of role." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the salons center on the visual arts. Boberg said that by creating 
a more eclectic program, he wants to "introduce new audiences to the museum. 
The last series we did, I invited a number of playwrights and actors to come 
and talk about theater in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The July 22 salon will offer a cooking demonstration inspired by the museum's 
upcoming exhibition, "The Return of the Cadavre Exquis " (French for "Exquisite 
Corpse"). Chef Carol Cotner is going to re-create one of photographer Lee 
Miller's surrealist meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Late in her life, (Miller) got very interested in food, collected recipes, 
made her own recipes and held a whole series of surrealist banquets in the '60s 
and early '70s for her friends. So it's going to be like Julia Child meets 
Andre Breton," Boberg said. "One of the things that I've tried to do with the 
series is to create events that inspired thinking among the audience, but were 
fun, that really had a surprising quality to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The salons have benefited artists and audiences alike. For artists, they have 
provided a place to present unfinished work. "It's turned out to be a really 
good opportunity for many of them to work out new ideas," Boberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because exhibition schedules are often set years in advance, there's a 
considerable lag between the time an artist imagines a work and the time the 
piece goes on exhibit. By then, "the artist is on to completely new ideas," he 
said. "So this series provides an opportunity to literally keep it in the 
moment in terms of what people are thinking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the museum has supported the free salon series from its own 
coffers, and Starbucks donations of coffee. Recently, though, it was awarded a 
grant for the series from the National Endowment for the Arts. The money will 
be used to continue to pay honorariums ($50 and a yearlong museum membership) 
to salon participants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our commitment is to the future," Rhoads said. "We're involved with artists 
who are creating culture and it's always hard to have a perspective on that. 
While they're doing it, you don't have the vantage point of history. But I 
think if you can provide some entry point or access, then at least it becomes a 
springboard for discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 All Friday Evening Salons are free and begin at 7:30 p.m. at the Santa Monica 
Museum of Art, 2437 Main St., Santa Monica. Friday: Neon Art. July 8: No salon. 
Salons continue weekly beginning July 15 through Sept. 4. The surrealist 
cooking salon is on July 22. For information and a schedule, call (310) 
399-0433.

NIGHT LIFE: HIGH-POWERED DANCE MUSIC; THE SANTA CRUZ BAND WINDCAVE WILL OPEN 
FOR JEFFERSON STARSHIP AT THE VENTURA THEATRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 WindCave, a colorful group from Santa Cruz, will head south to open for 
Jefferson Starship at the venerable Ventura Theatre on Friday night. Playing 
high-powered dance music, which incorporates about every genre except country, 
WindCave hopes to give the dancers those Deadhead whirlies. 
</P>
<P>
 WindCave, formerly of Santa Barbara, is six guys driving around in an old 
school bus. The boys in the band are Mark Adams (drums), Dave Keller 
(congas/percussion), Zach Thompson (bass), Jason Gonzales (guitar), Robin 
Macomber (keyboards) and Harlan Isaac (flute/vocals). Most noticeable is Isaac, 
of course, being that rarest of rock musicians, a flute player. 
</P>
<P>
 WindCave has put some serious miles on the bus since surviving the Santa 
Barbara bar scene, getting gigs all over the state, with trips to Arizona and 
Oregon coming up. They played a few times at the Metro Bay Club in Ventura, but 
this is their debut on the big stage. The flute player discussed his favorite 
band during a recent phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 With a name like WindCave, you guys sound like some groovy hippie band. Are 
you? 
</P>
<P>
 Right . . . the source of the name is a real place in Santa Barbara. It's a 
sandstone cave with Native American rock art. We used to hike up there to play 
acoustic music even before we thought about being a band. When we became a band 
in 1992, and were looking for a name, nothing seemed quite as appropriate as 
WindCave. 
</P>
<P>
 What was it like to move from Santa Barbara to Santa Cruz? 
</P>
<P>
 It's just world's apart up here. The Santa Cruz music consciousness is more 
responsive, more open and more energetic. People seem to be less reserved, and 
there are a lot of venues to play. The more we toured up here, the more we 
wanted to relocate here. I spent five years in Isla Vista and Mission Canyon. 
When we started playing, Santa Barbara wasn't really happening. It's probably 
happening more now than it was then, but we never seemed to find a large enough 
audience, and we really weren't into the bar scene. 
</P>
<P>
 No day jobs for any of you? 
</P>
<P>
 Nope, no day jobs. It's the usual paradox. We can't afford to tour and we 
can't afford not to tour. So far, we've made enough money to upgrade our 
equipment, plus we bought a 20-foot school bus, "La Luna," plus (we have) a 
permanent driver and mechanic, Robby McLain. Lately, on the road, we've been 
getting into acoustic music because it's easy and there's nothing to set up. We 
all write and everyone has contributed a seed for a song. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the specialization of labor in a six-piece band? Is there a bandleader 
or is it sort of democracy with a beat? 
</P>
<P>
 All of us are leaders. The controlling aspect and the leadership is spread out 
as much as possible. We all have real convictions about this band. We're all 
working and supporting this thing. We all give that extra commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Your bio lists a number of hemp festival gigs. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of local bands up here are working hard for Cal Hemp Initiative in the 
Santa Cruz zone. The shows are always fun and there's never any cops. The cops 
up here go to the farmers' market to hassle the transients. 
</P>
<P>
 What if someone told you WindCave sounds like Jethro Tull meets the Grateful 
Dead? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I'd say that's a limited description, but I can see the Jethro Tull 
connection because I play the flute. I did listen to Jethro Tull, and Ian 
Anderson was the first flute player I ever heard, but actually, I started out 
playing blues harmonica. When I hear a song, I listen for the sax or the 
guitar. Our music is 100% original -- it's high energy dance music. With six 
players, there's a lot going on with lots of textured layers. There's jazz 
fusion, rock, reggae, hip-hop and just a lot of groove music. It's challenging 
music from the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you want your audience to learn from your music? 
</P>
<P>
 The messages vary. The songs are about consciousness, life experiences and 
moving forward. We try to make the message accessible. We want people to get 
our message through body consciousness by dancing or by just standing and 
listening. 
</P>
<P>
 What's next for WindCave? 
</P>
<P>
 Touring, recording, expanding our tours a little bit, maybe getting some 
better venues. We'd like to go out of the country; and did I tell you -- we're 
looking for backing. We're just waiting for the right situation to come along.

BRIEFLY; CRIME: TRAVEL AGENT ACCUSED IN $500,000 SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The former owner of a South Bay travel agency was to appear in court Wednesday 
to face charges that she stole almost $500,000 from more than 400 Palos Verdes 
Peninsula clients, Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Reindl, former owner of Apollo Travel Service at 29135 S. Western Ave., 
Rancho Palos Verdes, was arrested by deputies Tuesday after a three-year 
investigation into the travel agency, which closed in 1991 after operating for 
at least 12 years. 
</P>

 Reindl has worked as a travel agent in other agencies over the past three 
years, but because she did not own the agencies, it is unlikely that she 
defrauded customers, said Sgt. Barbara White.  
</P>
<P>
 Reindl, 48, used a number of methods to defraud potential travelers, White 
said. For example, Reindl would take money from customers, but fail to make 
reservations, or that Reindl would make reservations and cancel them later. 
</P>
<P>
 Reindl's arrest warrant listed 74 felonies involving grand theft and 
violations of travel promotion laws. White said it took three years to sift 
through all the necessary documents before deputies could arrest Reindl. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the alleged victims, meanwhile, formed the Victims of Apollo Travel 
support group. 
</P>
<P>
 Reindl was working at a Harbor City travel agency when she was arrested, but 
White declined to release the agency's name. JEFF KASS

 The rocks are small, rounded, and plentiful. Most interesting, they are 
covered with a disquieting faded brown goo, giving the appearance of a 
cobblestone street after a long-ago parade involving many horses. This is 
disquieting because we are treading on these rocks, running actually, lurching 
through a culvert on the outskirts of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gosh, this is strange colored rock," says Colleen Bruns. "I wonder if it's 
just sediment." 
</P>
<P>
 This statement is couched as a question, but by the way Bruns delicately 
sidesteps the more sorely stained rocks, you can tell she's not far from an 
answer. You don't have to be a public works employee of the month to know that 
culverts can house questionable stuff, which is precisely why they're the sort 
of places hashers seek out. 
</P>
<P>
 A true hasher views shiggy with relish -- shiggy being a Hash term that refers 
to any liquid or solid that looks bad, smells worse and impedes forward 
progress. Sane people avoid such gleck; drastically reducing the chances of 
ruining their shoes, not to mention contracting boils, lesions and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
 But hashers are not sane. Fact is, we could have avoided the culvert entirely. 
Moments earlier, Bruns and I, along with several other members of the Ventura 
County Hash House Harriers, had arrived at a juncture. Etched by the roadside 
in white chalk were two words. One said "Eagle," and was accompanied by an 
arrow pointing down into the culvert. The other said "Turkey." That arrow 
pointed up the road on which we had been running. To the true adventurer the 
choice seemed obvious, though not everyone agreed. One suspicious hasher eyed 
the culvert with disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going that way," he snorted. "God knows what's down there." 
</P>
<P>
 He may, but we don't. Still, Bruns is a good sport about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do get off the beaten path," she said, cheerily picking her way around the 
uglier splotches of goo. 
</P>
<P>
 To fathom such behavior it is important to understand the Hash House Harriers. 
The Hash, as it is known to its disciples, claims to be the largest running 
organization in the world, and given its members' erratic habits and 
dispositions, only a fool would dispute them. According to the "World Hash 
Handbook and Directory," there are close to 1,100 hash clubs worldwide, 
allowing for a sort of global hostel in which a hasher from Antarctica might 
drop in on a hasher from Jakarta, whereupon they might immediately procure a 
rubber chicken and go careening through the jungle. THE HASH 
</P>
<P>
 The Hash has been called many things, often involving descriptive phrases that 
would flush the cheeks of a longshoreman. But the modus operandi of the Hash 
can be best grasped by perusing the group's written rules. Penned, fittingly 
enough, 12 years after the Hash came into existence, the Hash charter gives 
requisite mention to fitness, then goes on to laud hashing's regenerative 
powers, namely through "acquiring a good thirst and satisfying it in beer." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that swilling beer is part of every Hash run. Soda and 
water are usually offered, too. Teetotalers are not derided, possibly because 
it means more beer for the rest of the hashers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hash dates back to times no one cares about, with things coalescing in 
1938 when a gentleman named Albert Stephen Gispert, borrowing from the English 
children's game hares and hounds, started what is largely recognized as the 
first Hash at a British outpost in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
 Gispert was described by friends as a "short, stout, rubicund fellow with a 
keen wit." He was not described as an athlete. Unquestionably some hashers have 
been bona fide athletes and have accomplished much, among them Graham Douglas, 
who trekked the Himalayas numerous times without mishap, then suffered multiple 
fractures in his wrists and elbows when he fell through the roof of his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, though the Hash does involve bouts of jogging, athleticism is not a 
prerequisite for membership. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be a fast runner, you don't have to be a slow runner -- we 
don't care," Ventura County Hash Grand Master John Eckhart told me shortly 
before the Ventura Hash set off on a run on a recent Sunday. "As a matter of 
fact, you don't have to be in any physical shape at all." 
</P>
<P>
 You do have to be observant. A Hash run proceeds as follows. Hashers follow a 
trail laid by members dubbed hares. The hares deposit droppings -- paper, 
flour, chalk marks, foot powder -- to mark the trail. They make the trail as 
confusing as possible. Trailing runners ardently pursue the trail in 
floor-of-the-stock-exchange fashion, blowing bugles, tooting whistles and 
shouting things like "On, on!" (meaning they are on the trail) or milling about 
and staring at the ground like drunks who have just stepped off a 
merry-go-round (meaning they are lost). Distances vary, but generally fall 
between three and six miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want anyone dying," said Eckhart. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there aren't risks. Clever hares lead their hapless minions to some 
interesting places. Hashers have dashed through jungles, hair dressing parlors 
and funerals. A Hash in Texas purportedly trotted through a papal assembly. 
Another Hash wandered through the Library of Congress. Members of the Ventura 
County Hash have run through shopping malls, sewage treatment plants and across 
freeways. This has given some members pause, though they are always wise in 
their choice of options. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to run across the freeway," explained Hash member Wendy 
Lascher, "but going around would have meant running another mile or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Lascher, today's hare, may not be much for freeway wind sprints, but 
apparently she has no objection to bacteria. She laid the trail that will send 
us, among other places, through the questionable culvert. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the start of the run, Lascher went over some guidelines. The three new 
hashers listened intently as she explained the rules of the run, while the 
20-some veteran members milled about paying no attention at all. When Lascher 
was done, Grand Master Eckhart explained the reason for this indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no rules," he said. "You can cheat all you want." 
</P>
<P>
 At the run's start, marked by most of the hashers wandering slowly off, I fell 
in next to a polite woman wearing a T-shirt that proclaimed "Yee Sook Kung 
Virgin Run." 
</P>
<P>
 "Drop Shorts," she said, extending a hand. NICKNAMES 
</P>
<P>
 This was not a command. This is Maxine Dewbury's Hash name. All hashers have 
nicknames, awarded them by their fellow hashers who have hit on some personal 
quirk, embarrassing circumstance or no good reason at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Among larger hashes it is not uncommon for two hashers who have run together 
for months to know each other only as "Scumhead" and "Captain Naked." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Hash members are less intent on maintaining anonymity, though 
during runs they address each other solely by their Hash tags. Wendy Lascher, 
an appeals attorney, is "Bananappeal." Eckhart, who at one time worked as a 
well driller, is "Deep Thrill Her." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 60-some members of the Ventura County Hash, you'll also find 
"Fertilize Her" (a landscape architect), "Butter Cup" (drives a yellow pickup), 
"Mend Strait" (a seamstress), "Major Dad" (former Marine, current father), "Roc 
Doc" (a geologist) and "Bunns" (Bruns, give and take a consonant). Those are 
the names that can appear in print. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the names are so bad that people just use initials," explained Drop 
Shorts. "I wasn't going to argue with Drop Shorts. It could have been a lot 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, women belong to the Hash, lots of them actually; about one-third of the 
Ventura County Hash are women. Hashing was once an all-male pursuit, and in 
some places it still is. But for the most part both men and women frequent the 
Hash, though it isn't always easy to tell the difference. A Hash run in Oxnard 
once required sleep wear. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't see men wearing women's lingerie very often," said Drop Shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Membership in the Ventura County Hash isn't exclusive, nor is it expensive. 
Members pay $4 at each run; the money covers beer, soda, chips and a monthly 
newsletter that goes out to each member. Hash clubs have existed in Ojai and 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ventura County Hash is the only Hash in the county that's up and 
running, which may be good news to hikers unaccustomed to the sight of muddy, 
flour-caked personages bursting from the shrubbery wearing rabbit ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Ventura County Hash is fairly conservative. Runs are family 
oriented. Wardrobe, for the most part, is conventional and stays in place. This 
is not always the case among other Hash clubs. Drop Shorts has seen her share 
of derriere during a Hash career that has done stints in Tennessee and Georgia, 
and she hasn't been overly impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's OK," she said. "But, you know, some men's bare buns are pretty 
ugly." ON THE TRAIL 
</P>
<P>
 Drop Shorts and I followed the trail which swung up the side of a steep hill 
and onto the shoulder of Highway 33 in Oak View. Actually, I followed Drop 
Shorts while she followed the trail; I had yet to glimpse a single trail 
marker. I scanned the road's shoulder intently while Drop Shorts pointed out 
markers: small piles of flour that resembled tidy droppings from an overfed 
Pillsbury Dough Boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finding the markers takes some getting used to," she said. "You've just got 
to pay attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Drop Shorts paused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make sure you don't get run over," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually the trail made a right turn into the woods, good news for local 
motorists, but bad news for me because Drop Shorts had run off. Still there 
were other hashers around. I stopped for a moment near a curious burst of green 
foliage. An elderly fellow with the body fat of bamboo ran past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey boot, keep running!" he shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps feeling badly, he glanced back over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep an eye out for poison oak," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail wound through scrub and an occasional stand of oak, then turned down 
into a dry river bed. At least I thought it did. I hadn't seen any markings for 
at least 10 minutes. I drew hope, however, from the blasts of a whistle up 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon I came upon the whistle blower, a short, dusty woman walking slowly along 
the trail. I commended her for her wise and selfless use of the whistle to keep 
others on course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I carry it in case I get lost," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A crafty hare, it turns out, lays numerous false trails along with the real 
McCoy. Consequently, hashers routinely go astray, sometimes in grand fashion. 
Once an entire club got lost in the Malay jungle. When word got back to the 
wife of one of the hashers, she was unperturbed. "Well it serves the old 
bastard right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, a few minutes later I came upon Lascher. She set the trail; she 
would know where we were headed. Maybe so, maybe not. At one point she paused, 
brow knit, gazing at an arrow chalked in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know we set this trail almost five hours ago," she said. "It's not always 
easy to remember what you did." 
</P>
<P>
 Hashers are nice people, but they aren't much for organization. Lascher 
learned this on her very first Hash run. Out for a jog on the outskirts of 
Ojai, she happened on the Ventura Hash in mid-chase and was invited along. 
Shortly thereafter she came upon a large orchard. Hashers were scurrying back 
and forth like schizophrenic bird dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were running up and down trying to find where it was they had put the 
beer," said Lascher. 
</P>
<P>
 We are more fortunate. Several miles into the run, a car is parked by the side 
of the road. Hashers are cloistered about the car's upraised trunk. I am 
encouraged. Sustenance is my reward at the conclusion of a hot, dusty haul. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nope," said Drop Shorts. "If this was the finish, they'd have the beer chest 
out." REST STOP 
</P>
<P>
 For regular runners, drinking on the fly means snatching a liquid the color of 
radiator fluid and tossing large portions of it down their front. Hashers are 
more circumspect in their hydration. We stood in the shade and made idle 
chit-chat, casually sipping water, soda or beer. I opted for beer, hoping it 
might rescue my mouth, which felt like a sandbox. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I had enough experience drinking cold beer under a hot sun to realize 
the potential drawbacks. A gentleman named P-Nile -- short, of course, for 
Peter of the Nile -- assuaged my concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not to worry," he said. "The liquid part will just come out as sweat. Kind of 
concentrates the alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
 In pairs and in groups the hashers slowly trotted back onto the trail. The 
Hash frowns on competition. More to the point, many hashers are in no hurry at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The faster runners go out, get lost and come back," explained one hasher, as 
we walked through a quiet neighborhood. "By the time we get there, they've 
figured out which trail is the right one and we're spared the work." 
</P>
<P>
 She paused, nostrils flaring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smell that?" she said. "Someone burned breakfast. When you move slowly you 
can really get a sense of a place." 
</P>
<P>
 Or establish a ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this might lead one to conclude that the Hash is composed of loud, 
slow-moving drunks with a fondness for nudity and convoluted outdoor travel. 
While this isn't entirely off the mark, it isn't accurate either. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been called a drinking club with a running problem and that's part of 
it, but it's not the focus in my opinion," said Bruns, post-run. "The idea is 
to get together with people and go for a run with a little bit of challenge and 
a lot of fun. Some of my best friendships have been cultivated through the 
Hash." 
</P>
<P>
 Noxious? Infantile? Good, dirty fun? Your decision. Hashers won't explain 
their behavior, much less defend it, probably because they feel no need to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of us can be a little childish from time to time," said Bruns. "We don't 
always have to grow up." Details

COMMUNITY NEWS: COASTAL; GROUP'S MONTHLY REPORTS TRACK OCEAN CONTAMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Malibu/Santa Monica chapter of the Surfrider Foundation has unveiled a 
project to keep beach-goers informed of unhealthful bacteria levels in coastal 
waters from Malibu to Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Each month the group will distribute a report to surf shops and other beach 
hangouts that tracks ocean contamination.The first reports were distributed 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Water samples are taken at 10 sites, including the Santa Monica and Redondo 
Beach piers, and Playa del Rey, Zuma, Topanga Point and Malibu beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter spokeswoman Debi Tappis said the organization came up with the idea to 
publish the report because it regularly receives phone calls from the public 
asking about conditions at local beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Surfrider Foundation, a nonprofit environmental organization, will use 
test results collected by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services 
in the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The department tests the sites weekly and compiles the data by month, but the 
results are not readily available to the public, Tappis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People may not know how to get that information. We're getting the word out," 
Tappis said. Bacteria levels "will be posted so the beach-going public will 
have the opportunity to see (results) and can make a decision on whether they 
want to recreate at the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 High levels of contamination frequently occur at some beaches, according to 
the organization's reports.  
</P>
<P>
 Swimming in tainted water may cause earaches, nose and throat irritation, skin 
rashes, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials post warnings discouraging swimming and close beaches when 
bacteria levels are dangerously high. DONNA BIRCH

SOUTH BAY COVER STORY; EDUCATING GEORGE; FAMILY, COUNSELORS WORK TO SAVE LENNOX 
TEEN-AGER FROM LURE OF THE STREETS. WITH THEIR HELP, HE HAS BEGUN A TURNAROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 George Lupersio, 14, wandered outside the Bird's Nest, an airy glassed-in 
building at Loyola Marymount University. Inside, Latino students from Lennox 
Middle School who had spent the night at the college were enjoying a 
continental breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 While they ate, college administrators encouraged them to apply to the 
university in a few years. If they go, most will be the first in their families 
to attend college.  
</P>
<P>
 Munching on a danish, George, an eighth-grader voted most popular by his 
class, surveyed Loyola's campus and considered his options. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, at school I get respect for being smart, but on the street I get respect 
for being cool," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 George, like many teen-agers who grow up in neighborhoods where gangs and 
gunfire punctuate the day, is at a crossroads.  
</P>
<P>
 As George sees it, his choices are to go to college or to join a gang. Over 
the past two years, the appeal of education and a career -- possibly as a 
zoologist -- have battled with the lure of street life. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the streets and school have their advantages, he said, but Loyola's 
manicured lawns -- as well as its growing numbers of Latino students -- had 
dazzled George and his Lennox classmates. So that particular Sunday in March, 
education had the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 At other times, the bleak streets of Lennox, a poor community that serves as a 
port of entry for many Latino immigrants, has had the stronger pull. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, George hung around with gangbangers on the streets of Lennox, even 
though he wasn't in a gang himself, swore at peers and adults alike, tagged 
buildings -- and loved it all. 
</P>
<P>
 A prized possession is a taped episode of the television show "Kidsview," on 
which he appeared in a segment on Los Angeles taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I'm thinking positive, and about my education," George said. "But 
if I have to think negative, then I will."  
</P>
<P>
 The tough talk comes from growing up in a tough family. When George was 6, his 
father, Armando Lupersio, died in a car accident, leaving George's mother, 
Zoila, to support four children. Zoila, who is a supervisor at Dodd 
International, which provides food services to airlines, is often asleep when 
her children are home. So with their mother preoccupied and their father's 
strict discipline gone, the children turned to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 George's oldest sister Miriam, 19, works as a teacher's aide at Lennox Middle 
School and has stayed out of trouble. But his sister Briseida, 18, says she was 
a hard-core gang member for years, stealing, beating up people, running the 
streets of Los Angeles and causing trouble. Mara, 17, also joined a gang and 
now is detained in Camp Kirby for violation of parole stemming from an earlier 
conviction for attempted murder. Mara's boyfriend, Rene Ramos, whom George 
loves like a brother, is in Camp Munz for violation of parole from an earlier 
assault conviction.  
</P>
<P>
 The turmoil in his life, at one point, made George almost unapproachable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time that he was so angry that you couldn't even talk to him," 
said Lennox Middle School counselor Pam Rector. "He still has a lot of anger, 
but now at least you can talk to him while he's in the middle of it." 
</P>
<P>
 George's turnaround has begun because adults have bombarded him with 
attention. Rector and Rachel Romero, another middle school counselor, say they 
find his mix of brains and rebellion irresistible; they treat him like a son. 
Briseida, who runs the library resource room at Lennox and goes to college at 
night, has set rules for him and monitors his every activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Loyola Marymount University student Armando Mena has become a mentor and 
surrogate big brother, helping George with homework and showing him that he too 
can go to college. 
</P>
<P>
 George is simply too bright to let fall through the cracks, Romero and Rector 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1992, his vocabulary was on a 10th-grade level, and the 
California Basic Skills Test showed him in the 78th percentile of 
eighth-graders nationally -- a good showing for any school, but especially good 
at Lennox, where about 90% of students begin school with limited proficiency in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in the seventh grade, he was suspended three times and was put on 
academic probation. George finished that year with a D average. But this year, 
in part because of the extraordinary attention he has received, he has at least 
a B average. School officials say it may be higher by the time final 
calculations are done. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennox school officials say their mission is to keep students out of gangs and 
away from guns, to teach them to speak and write English well and to plant a 
yearning for college in their minds. But even for those with a mission, George 
is viewed as special. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a boy they think they can save. 
</P>
<P>
 So Romero and Rector take him to plays: "Romeo and Juliet" and "Helen Keller." 
To movies: "Schindler's List," among others. They take him out to eat and to 
events at Loyola Marymount University, where Rector is president of the alumni 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 The outings are rewarding for the adults too: Take him to a play, and he 
remembers the lines. Show him a book -- "Seinlanguage" or "Monster" -- and 
he'll read it too -- just to prove he can. 
</P>
<P>
 At "Schindler's List," Rector cried through the movie while George patted her 
on the head murmuring, "There, there." The additional support, particularly 
palling around with Rector, has made George happier. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to sound kind of stupid, but I think I was so angry last year 
because I didn't get enough attention," he said. "I know it's a dumb reason, 
but I think that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Helping George Lupersio means helping him manage his anger. His temper strikes 
as fast as a rattlesnake.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just always angry," George said. "It never really goes away. But it's 
getting better. It used to be that any little thing would make me mad and I'd 
stay that way the rest of the day. Now it goes away sometimes in a few hours." 
</P>
<P>
 If George does not complete high school and go to college, it will be because 
his temper gets the better of him and he winds up in jail, Rector said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the anger," Rector said. "I don't think he's going to pick the path that 
leads to (gang life), but one angry moment could make him do something he could 
regret and could put him in the justice system."  
</P>
<P>
 Little things, an insult or slight offense, can spark a fight. Criticism can 
make George moody for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 George and Briseida say they inherited their temper from their father, Armando 
Lupersio, who died eight years ago. He had an anger that blazed like lightning 
and could deliver a punishment that would be remembered for life. But he also 
loved to joke around and was proud of his children, of his daughters' brains 
and beauty and, particularly, of his only son. With his death, the joking left 
the family, and only the anger remained. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great man," George said. "He worked hard and he always had time for 
us. He would take me out and he taught me about sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was cool. We were all good little kids then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After her father's death, Briseida said she started hanging around with gangs. 
But her father's memory, Briseida said, convinced her to give up gang life and 
go back to school.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was always smart and he would say that if anyone was going to make it, 
Briseida was," she said, wiping away tears. "And there I was around guns and 
crack." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest things that's had an influence on George has been 
Briseida's complete turnaround," Rector said. "Now he's got a model in his 
family. He sees that you can decide that you're done with the nonsense, you're 
gonna go ahead and do that daily ritual of getting up every morning and going 
to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Briseida, lithe with dark hair and eyes, is serious almost to the point of 
being stern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a happy person," Briseida said. "But when my family does well, then 
I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
 She works during the day and takes classes at El Camino College at night. It 
has been two years since she quit the gang and returned to adult school to earn 
her high school degree, but she has not forgiven herself for her past, partly 
because of her influence on George. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was running with the worst crowd for years, hanging out in Hawthorne back 
then, Compton, Inglewood, L.A., Watts, everywhere. I was crazy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 George was awed by the respect his sisters commanded from others on the 
streets, and he wanted to be like them. Now he has adopted Briseida's emphasis 
on education, and as she has moved farther away from gang life, George thinks 
less about the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's my biggest influence," George said proudly, "because once she was 
(messing) up, but she turned around and now is doing good." 
</P>
<P>
 If George does not do well, it won't be because he wasn't warned. In a letter 
last week, Mara's boyfriend, Rene Ramos, wrote to congratulate George for 
completing eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing I'm afraid of is you turning out like me or your sister," 
Ramos wrote. "The life we chose didn't have nothing to offer us but time and 
death." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Rector and Romero want to see that George has other choices. Normally, after 
leaving Lennox Middle School, George would go on to Hawthorne High School. And 
there, more because of George's personality than the deficiencies of the high 
school, they believe George would act out in whatever way necessary to gain the 
respect of other teens on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 At Lennox Middle School, when George is tempted to misbehave to win respect 
from the youths, consequences from Briseida, Romero and Rector are swift and 
fierce. 
</P>
<P>
 But those three will not be at Hawthorne High School, which has 3,000 
students, some of whom belong to the numerous gangs in the area. So Romero, 
Rector, Mena and Briseida are pooling their resources to come up with the 
$2,500 tuition needed to send George to Junipero Serra Catholic High School in 
Gardena. It only has about 600 students, and Mena will teach there next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If George goes to Hawthorne High School, it would be very bad," Rector said. 
"He would feel too much pressure to be a big man on campus and would act out." 
</P>
<P>
 George agrees. "It's just not very nurturing there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rachel and I joke around about how we're both single and haven't even had 
kids and now we're budgeting for private school," Rector said. 
</P>
<P>
 Educating George, however, is necessary, Romero said, because it will someday 
be George's turn to take the lead in helping his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how when a flock of geese flies, there's one that takes the lead and 
then when it gets tired another one comes up and it falls back a little? Well, 
right now Briseida has the lead, and I know it's taking its toll on her. 
Hopefully one day George will step in and take the lead," Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think we're lucky to be given the opportunity to mold this kid's life 
and help him become a success," Romero said. "Whatever money, time, attentions 
and laughter we put into him, if he becomes a success, it'll all be worth it."

 Lt. Col. Charles (Combat) Hudson flew B-17 Flying Fortresses on deadly bombing 
missions over Europe that took more American lives than any other World War II 
aerial action. The all-volunteer crews died by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudson survived to come home as the most highly decorated bombardier in 
history. His exploits during the war and dangerous, exotic adventures as a 
civilian are all documented in "Combat He Wrote," co-authored with Ross Olney 
of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 A radio and television commentator, and author of more than 170 nonfiction 
books, Olney also flew combat missions in Korea. He founded the Southern 
California chapter of the American Society of Journalists & Authors and 
lectures on the writing business. Hudson was for many years a restaurant owner 
and golf professional in Oxnard and Ventura.

 Andrew Ryan, a philosopher / psychologist, has written a book attacking some 
of the myths about romance and relationships. In his "The Real Romantic 
Marketplace: Know Good Women?" the Thousand Oaks resident says the relationship 
gurus have sold millions of books based on pro-female propaganda and 
male-bashing themes. Ryan admits that he's out on a politically precarious limb 
in his attempt to put the blame on she instead of he in "Romantic Marketplace."

THEATER REVIEW; PLAY MAKES ANNUAL AFFAIR SEEM LIKE AN ACCEPTABLE AMUSEMENT; 
ONCE-A-YEAR RENDEZVOUS FOR 24 YEARS BY A COUPLE MARRIED TO OTHERS PROVIDES 
PLENTY OF LAUGHS.

 Among its other virtues, "Same Time, Next Year" makes an appealing case for 
adultery. That may be enough to attract audiences to the current production 
being presented in weekend matinees by the Conejo Players, directed by Patricia 
Adrian. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Slade's Neil Simonish comedy follows a couple through more than 20 
years: Meeting accidentally in 1951 while he is away from home on a business 
trip, they renew their affair every year thereafter. In the meantime, "Doris" 
and "George" continue perfectly satisfactory lives with their own spouses the 
other 364 days of the year. Whoopee! 
</P>
<P>
 There are changes in George's and Doris' lives during the 24 years encompassed 
by "Same Time, Next Year" as well as significant changes in politics and 
fashion. Watching the young lovers grow mentally and emotionally is one of the 
play's stronger aspects; the more amusing one, though, is watching them switch, 
for instance, from business wear to hippie motley and back. 
</P>
<P>
 The weakness in Slade's script comes from Doris and George communicating only 
during their annual assignations: thus, each has a major bomb to drop on the 
other from time to time. Surely a couple in this position would have found some 
way to communicate crucial events in their lives via mail or telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Ingram and Lou Ann Stephan are appealing actors who age convincingly 
from their mid-20s to late 40s, more or less, though the most dramatic physical 
transformation doesn't come until the beginning of the second act, 1965 (up 
until then, the changing times are mainly reflected in Stephan's evolving 
hairdos). 
</P>
<P>
 Though "Same Time, Next Year" is officially a two-character play, stage 
manager Greg Leitzel wins his share of laughs during set changes between 
scenes. Details

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; REMODELED THEATER EVEN HAS CUP HOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the oldest movie theaters in Santa Monica has lost its drab 1970s look 
in favor of something futuristic with a dash of Art Deco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monica 4-Plex Theater, part of one of the oldest art and foreign film 
chains in the country and long noted among Westsiders for its popcorn with real 
butter, has just completed a $350,000 remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
 The redesign is aimed, in part, at turning the 25-year-old venue into a place 
where newly released art films are premiered. In the past, the theater hasn't 
screened first-run art films but has shown them after they opened at other West 
Los Angeles art theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the remodel will do is increase the potential for films that we've 
always played," said Gregory Laemmle, assistant to Robert Laemmle, the family 
patriarch and company president. "It will help Santa Monica play art films upon 
their release, like art theaters in West Hollywood and West Los Angeles. Our 
(theater) was not considered a first-run house because it required a certain 
level of comfort that we didn't have." 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the squishy seats with low back support that cut off the circulation 
in your legs -- even before the movies began. No more are the oppressive vinyl, 
wood-grain columns in the lobby. Never again will there be burnt orange, 
chocolate-brown and banana-yellow felt coverings lining the walls. (The gold, 
frosted mirror behind the candy counter remains, however.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing, but the thing that the public wants to know most is whether or 
not we have cup holders in the new seats," said Robert Laemmle, owner of eight 
Los Angeles-based Laemmle theaters. "Yes, we do have cup holders." 
</P>
<P>
 Project architectural designer Steve Giannetti said: "We were trying to take 
that old '70s box and give it a sort of Art Deco-ish look and give the place 
some scale. There's a 1920s tradition of doing movie theaters where the lobbies 
were done up like a courtyard with a night sky. So we painted the ceiling dark 
blue with the gold-leaf dome left intact." 
</P>
<P>
 Giannetti's vision for the lobby is a mix of the futuristic and celestial, but 
with Art Deco accents. Hanging from the gold-domed ceiling are six spiky, 
asteroid-like glass light fixtures, remnants of the original design. And along 
the walls on both sides of the lobby are new vertical, opaque tube lights, 
reminiscent of transporter on the TV series "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
 State-of-the art, ergonomically correct seats with high backs have replaced 
the old seats, and the theater is now accessible to people in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket prices have increased 50 cents to $7.50. KATHLEEN KELLEHER

THEATER REVIEW; INVISIBLE 'HARVEY' POPS UP FOR A REPRISE AT DINNER THEATER; 
OTTAVIO'S STRONG CAST KEEPS THE HUMOR HOPPING IN THIS TALE OF A BOOZY OLD MAN 
AND HIS TRUSTY RABBIT FRIEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of theater's true perennials, Mary Chase's 50-year-old fable of a man and 
his six-foot invisible rabbit companion, has been dusted off this year by the 
crew at Ottavio's Dinner Theater. Firmly rooted in '40s consciousness, "Harvey" 
should nevertheless appeal to modern audiences of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspiring socialite Veta Louise Simmons and her daughter, Myrtle Mae, share a 
home with Veta Louise's brother, Elwood P. Dowd. There's considerable money 
about, which the women would love to spend. The problem is that the money, and 
the home, belong to Uncle Elwood. And he's embarrassingly batty, carrying on 
conversations with Harvey, a giant rabbit that only Elwood can see or hear. 
Veta Louise and Myrtle Mae attempt to commit Elwood to a sanitarium, and 
eventually everybody gets his or her comeuppance. 
</P>
<P>
 High society and psychiatry aren't exactly choice targets for satire in 1994: 
These days, people might embrace the shrink and the invisible bunny, and it's 
unlikely that very many would consider (as Veta Louise does) a newspaper's 
society columnist important -- or someone you'd want to deal with, anyway. 
Elwood drinks entirely too much by today's standards, though nobody suggests 
that his problem stems from excessive boozing. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's a problem at all, that is. Elwood is one of the nicest people ever; 
he's adept at making friends, and quite generous. And it turns out that a 
character such as Harvey has a basis in folklore. Could it be that Elwood is 
more sane than he appears? 
</P>
<P>
 The play remains very funny, thanks here to confident performances by 
principal actors Eleanor Brand (Veta Louise), Gene Bernath (Dr. Chumley, head 
of the sanitarium) and Scott Lee, whose likable Elwood less resembles Jimmy 
Stewart's definitive film characterization than current TV personality Harry 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 As the shallow, vain Myrtle Mae, Debi Lewis is perhaps a bit too mannered 
under Michael Tachco's otherwise shrewd direction; Mario Shawn Marino is 
capable as orderly Duane Wilson; and Bill Jones and Arnold Fadden are 
convincing as a junior-grade psychiatrist and judge, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Deanna Lynn Milsap appears as a friend of Veta Louise's, Gail James as a 
nurse, Valorie Paradise Lant as the Bernath character's wife, and Keith Jacobs 
as a cabbie. It's Jacobs, incidentally, who gives the program's most intriguing 
biographical notes, which claim that the actor ". . . is a direct descendant of 
George and Ira Gershwin." Further details, please! Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Harvey." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: 7 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays through Aug. 5. Additional performance 
July 31. 
</P>
<P>

senior discount. Season tickets, group rates and fund-raising programs also 
available.

<P>
 * FYI: Suitable for family audiences. Doors open at 6:30 p.m., dinner served 
at 7; show begins sometime after 8 p.m. For the July 31 show, doors open at

'MAN OF LA MANCHA' HOLDS UP AS ENDEARING MUSICAL DRAMA; THE STRONG CAST DOES 
JUSTICE TO THE TIMELESS STORY. EXCEPT FOR 'IMPOSSIBLE DREAM,' THOUGH, THE SONGS 
ARE WEAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 A legendary literary character and his author become one in "Man of La 
Mancha," a clever musical that made its debut on Broadway nearly 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Best known for introducing the popular standard "The Impossible Dream," the 
show is enjoying an unexpected revival in Ventura County this year, with 
productions in Camarillo and Thousand Oaks scheduled within three months of one 
another. The first, imaginatively staged and energetically performed by the 
Camarillo Community Theatre, opened over the weekend and will play through July 
23. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Wasserman's script begins with author Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra 
(better known to English-speaking readers as Cervantes) imprisoned during the 
Spanish Inquisition. Partly to pass time in his holding cell and mainly to 
ransom a manuscript being held by fellow prisoners, Cervantes "defends" himself 
by recounting the story of Don Quixote. 
</P>
<P>
 The hero of Cervantes' novel, published in 1605, is an elderly man deluded 
into thinking himself a knight, although the age of chivalry was long past. 
Accompanied by his "squire," Sancho Panza, Quixote travels Spain, seeking to 
right wrongs, rescue damsels and fight giants. A ridiculous figure, Quixote 
projects his fantasies so that windmills became giants in his mind and he sees 
the low-born barmaid, Aldonza, as his noble lady, Dulcinea. 
</P>
<P>
 Cervantes acts the story out, playing Quixote and enlisting guards and fellow 
prisoners to play other roles in the improvised drama. 
</P>
<P>
 What we get is not really Cervantes and not really Quixote: The author's life 
is distorted, and the picture of Don Quixote is about as well-rounded as the 
image on a T-shirt. Which is not to say that the script doesn't hold up as a 
dramatic piece, or as an introduction to Cervantes' master work. The story is 
consistently involving, and it's close enough to perhaps persuade people to 
read the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the presence of "The Impossible Dream," the weakest aspect of "Man of 
La Mancha" is the score, especially Joe Darion's lyrics (Mitch Leigh wrote the 
music). While there are highlights -- "Little Bird" is an appealing ballad in 
the style of Harry Belafonte's Caribbean-styled material, incongruously placed 
in 17th-Century Spain -- certainly the repetitive "I Really Like Him" (sung by 
Sancho Panza, referring to Quixote) is among the worst songs ever performed on 
Broadway, and the rest of the material falls somewhere in between. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo group's musical productions have been consistently strong in 
recent memory, and this "Man of La Mancha" is no exception. Director Mark 
Andrew Reyes has assembled a fine cast, featuring Damian Gravino as Cervantes / 
Quixote, Rex Waggoner as Sancho Panza and Linda Steigler as the earthy Aldonza. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel de la Vega is particularly impressive as the innkeeper for whom 
Aldonza works, and David Banuelos turns in a couple of notably comic 
characterizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Music is supplied by a versatile group under the direction of Kevin Parcher; 
two guitars, two woodwinds, keyboards and percussion accompany the singing. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences should be aware that the story gets rather raw in places, notably in 
the graphic portrayal of a gang rape: This show is not for young children. 
</P>
<P>
 The next production, by the Santa Susana Repertory Company, will be performed 
at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza in mid-September. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Man of La Mancha." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Camarillo Airport Theater, 330 Skyway Drive, on the grounds of 
Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: At 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 7 p.m. Sundays. Through July 23. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $10 general admission; $8 students, senior citizens and active 
military; $5 children under 12. A special family package for two adults and up 
to four children is available for $25.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; ECONOMIC UPTURN ALLOWS BREATHING ROOM IN '94-95 
BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council has approved a $200.5-million budget that 
signals a slight upswing of the local economy after several years of recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a coming-back budget," Councilman Paul Rosenstein said after 
Tuesday's unanimous vote. "We're coming back from several years of hard times 
to restore the city to what it should be." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994-95 budget has no major cuts or general tax increases because revenues 
-- thanks to the beginnings of economic recovery -- are expected to be 
relatively strong. The budget will, however, increase fees on city services 
ranging from pawnbroker license renewals to the preparation of traffic accident 
reports. Accident reports will now cost $17, up from $10. These increases are 
expected to bring in $1 million in additional annual revenue.

 City workers will receive a cost-of-living pay increase next year, after a 
year in which their salaries were frozen to save money amid the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some contentious budget sessions in the past, the five-hour hearing 
went smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 Other budget features: 
</P>
<P>
 * An appropriation of $5,800 to the domestic abuse program at Westside Legal 
Services, which was funded for only three months because of its financial woes. 
(It owes the IRS about $90,000.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Noting there has been an increase in calls to domestic violence programs 
since the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, the council 
set aside another $50,000 for such services without specifying which 
organizations will get the money. 
</P>
<P>
 * An appropriation of $560,000 to allow the Police Department to beef up 
patrols in Palisades Park and downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 * $360,000 for a new homeless shelter, with some of the money coming from cuts 
in emergency services for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 * $60,000 to allow the library to purchase CD-ROM computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had expressed a willingness to appropriate more money to extend 
library hours. But City Librarian Wini Allard told the council she did not want 
the hours extended this year because it would interfere with a library 
remodeling program. 
</P>
<P>
 The main library is not open Sunday evenings, and the branch libraries are 
closed Fridays and Sundays. NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: TOP-NOTCH FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT ON TAP FOR HOLIDAY; BANDS, 
DANCING, PARADES AND FIREWORKS ARE PLANNED ACROSS THE COUNTY TO CELEBRATE THE 
FOURTH OF JULY WEEKEND.

 Country music is as American as hot dogs, apple pie, Mom and pickup trucks. So 
what better way to spend Fourth of July weekend than kickin' back and enjoying 
all the live country entertainment available around the county? 
</P>
<P>
 And this is one time when the adage "You get what you pay for" doesn't apply, 
because all but two events are free. And every act is top-notch. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a guide to great family outdoor country listening and dancing: 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the legendary Buck Page and his Original Riders of the Purple 
Sage, who just returned from playing a gig with Waylon Jennings in Montana, 
will keep your toes tapping 1 to 4 p.m. in front of Carousel Marketplace at 
Ventura Harbor Village. I've seen them perform more than once and they're not 
to be missed. And folks of all ages love their classic cowboy music, including 
hits "Ghost Riders in the Sky" and "Tumbling Tumbleweed." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a place to dance if the mood takes you, as well as some grassy areas. 
But bring a blanket because there are never enough bales of hay to go around 
for benches. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've visited Ventura Harbor Village, it won't be hard to find your way 
back Sunday to enjoy Sibling Rivalry, a duo featuring Leti Morgan and her 
brother, Pino Sanchez, from noon to 3 p.m. Their upbeat country singing has 
been well-received at previous appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 As a bonus, the Seaview Cloggers will dazzle you with their footwork from 1 to 
4 p.m. near Andria's Seafood Restaurant and the Boatyard. Bring the kids and 
cameras because Tony the Pony will also be there for rides and photos. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7 p.m. Sunday, performers in Ojai's Libbey Bowl will donate their time to a 
free family-oriented variety show. Among the acts will be Buck Page and the 
Original Riders of the Purple Sage. Local favorites Marvin Johnson -- national 
senior Old Time Fiddlers champion and 11-time California state champ -- and 
accordionist Frank Umbro will also take the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Rowe, composer of great country standards including "He Stoped Loving Her 
Today" and "You Don't Know Me," will emcee the whole shootin' match. Bring 
blankets and lawn chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 For free live country music Monday, just mosey around the city of Ventura's 
Fourth of July Street Fair. Guitarist Ron Sexton will be playing Chet Atkins 
licks from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. at California and Main streets. From noon to 3 
p.m., the Marshall Brothers, one of whom is a former member of Pure Prairie 
League, will entertain in Plaza Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard-based singing dynamo Rosilee will be belting out a mix of classic, new 
and original country tunes from 2 to 4:45 p.m. at Fir and Main streets. And 
during this time, you'll find the Geary Hanley band playing in Valdez Alley 
across from the Historical Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 You might want to start July 4 off with the annual pancake breakfast from 6 to 
10 a.m. at the Ojai Community Center. Then comes the parade, which starts at 
the Community Center, moves down Ojai Avenue and ends at Sarzotti Park, 510 
Park Road, where there will be a community picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12:15 p.m., Raywood will present line dancing, the Sweet Country Band will 
perform and there will be pie-eating contests to keep you full all year. At 4 
p.m., entertainment and family activities will continue at Nordoff Stadium, 
1401 Maricopa Highway, finishing with a fireworks display at 9 p.m. Tickets 
cost $5 for adults and $2 for children, 12 and under. For details, call 
646-0076. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 2 and 4 p.m. Monday, Umbro and Johnson will perform on accordion and 
fiddle during a free, all-day, old-fashioned family festival that also features 
continuous live music at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near Simi 
Valley. For information, call 522-2977. 
</P>
<P>
 From 5:30 to 9:30 p.m. Monday, you'll find plenty to do at the first Community 
Picnic and Fireworks Show, co-sponsored by the Rotary Club of Ventura and 
Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 Families are invited to bring picnic fare and blankets to the softball fields 
at Ventura College, 4667 Telegraph Road, where they can enjoy continuous 
entertainment, including the Sweet Country Band and a musical fireworks display 
entitled "An American Adventure: A Tribute to the 25th Anniversary of the 
Americans' First Moon Landing." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlye Parker and Dave Lawrence from K-HAY radio will emcee the evening, 
which will include juggling demonstrations, games and vendor booths to keep you 
busy. But, please leave all pets, glass containers and alcohol at home. Tickets 
can be purchased in advance at several locations in Ventura. Admission is $6 
for adults and $4 for children 12 and younger. At the gate, you'll pay $8 and 
$5. For details, call 658-2244. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 John Anderson has a current hit with "I Wish I Coulda Been There for That." 
Chances are lots of you regret missing nationally known country recording star 
and hunk Billy Dean when he and a buddy dropped by Borderline in Thousand Oaks 
recently. The blond crooner sang with Cactus County and two-stepped with some 
of our local gals. I was told he may stop in the next time he's in town because 
he had such a good time.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: DELICACIES A LA CART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's long been easy to get dim sum -- Chinese snacks sold by the plate from 
carts that wheel from table to table -- in Chinatown and Monterey Park. Now 
they're becoming popular in the South Bay. The place to get them is Szechwan, a 
large establishment on a stretch of Pacific Coast Highway in Lomita that could 
be called the South Bay's Chinese restaurant row. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef/owner Andy Kao came to the United States with practically nothing, but 
after years of working in Monterey Park restaurants, he opened Szechwan in 
1980. The original 30 seats grew to 90 by '83, and 150 by '88, and today the 
place can seat 300 people. At this rate, in the year 2036 it will seat 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Wallace Lee, dressed in a tuxedo, oversees the two large, attractive 
dining rooms featuring booth seating and a large tank full of exotic, colorful 
fish. There are several other fish tanks of more interest to diners. These are 
filled with live Maine lobsters, Santa Barbara spot prawns, Dungeness crab and 
a changing variety of fresh fish.  
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after you are seated at lunch, the dim sum procession begins. A 
waitress will stop her cart at your table to offer such delicacies as har gow 
(steamed shrimp-filled dumplings, four to an order) or small spare ribs in 
black bean sauce. Then another cart will come by offering siu mai (open-faced 
dumplings filled with minced pork and shrimp) and steamed lotus buns with a 
sweet bean paste filling. The carts keep coming, ultimately giving the diner a 
choice of 70 items ($1.95 to $3.95), including braised chicken feet. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the dim sum service, there's a regular menu listing 251 
selections. Pay particular attention to the first 17, chef Kao's specialties. 
Among them are plump scallops, slightly crisp on the outside, very tender 
within, chili pepper heat contrasting with the sweetness of caramelized orange 
peel ($13.95). Farm-raised venison ($14.50) comes with a sizzling black pepper 
sauce, while a large platter of sweet lobster is accented with fresh ginger and 
scallions. 
</P>
<P>
 Szechwan is at 2107 Pacific Coast Highway, Lomita. (310) 534-2280. Open daily 
11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.

WESTSIDE COVER STORY; ON EVEN TERMS; PRIVATE ALL-GIRL SCHOOLS ARE GAINING FAVOR 
IN LIGHT OF REPORTS THAT PUBLIC EDUCATION SUFFERS FROM GENDER BIAS FAVORING 
MALES STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 IN THE MIDDLE OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE merits of single-sex education for 
girls, Sister Gina Marie interrupted a visitor's question with an abrupt, yet 
polite, correction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to use the (term) 'young women,' not 'girls.' There's a big difference 
(between) the two," explained the principal of Notre Dame Academy, the 
all-female college-prep high school in West Los Angeles. "The students arrive 
as girls, but leave as young women. We're trying to develop capable young 
women." 
</P>
<P>
 The young women who attend all-girl schools such as Notre Dame Academy, 
Marlboro School for Girls, Marymount or Immaculate Heart high schools on the 
Westside say their campuses are havens where they develop leadership skills, 
freely express themselves, and excel in athletics and academics. 
</P>
<P>
 Such schools represent an old idea that has gained popularity on the heels of 
reports maintaining that public education often suffers from gender bias. These 
reports conclude that educators often teach in ways that foster boys' success 
while overlooking the efforts of girls. For instance, a recent report found 
that teachers more often call on boys and frequently allow them to dominate 
classroom discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have also found an increasing incidence of sexual harassment of 
students on public school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary all-girl schools on the Westside -- Notre Dame, Marymount, 
Marlboro and Immaculate Heart -- are all high schools, with Marlboro and 
Immaculate Heart including middle school grades as well. All have reported an 
increase in the number of enrollment inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The application pool has gone up, given the recent press about gender bias in 
the schools," said Sharon Stevens, director of admissions at Marymount High in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have twice as many applicants as we do spaces," said Sister Gina Marie of 
Notre Dame Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Marymount, Immaculate Heart -- which is in Hollywood -- and Notre Dame are all 
Catholic schools; the Marlboro School for Girls in Hancock Park is an 
independent private school. All have enrollments of between 350 and 450 
students. Low enrollment, say educators at the schools, means that students 
have easier access to teachers, who can spend more time, one-on-one, with 
students. At Marlboro, for example, the student-teacher ratio is 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among parents unaware of the recent studies, all-girl schools are 
increasingly seen as an attractive alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Susanna Jones, director of the high school at Marlboro, said: "We are seeing 
our students come from a broader area. And the reason for this is increasing 
disillusionment with (the quality of education in) the public schools." 
</P>
<P>
 "The teachers I have had really wanted for us to develop a really strong 
self-esteem," said Lenita Morgan, a 15-year-old sophomore at Marlboro school. 
"I get the sense that we are really important, and what we have to say is 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students at all-female schools said that if boys were around they might 
be less opinionated in class or less involved in campus activities. "Girls 
struggle with looking too assertive or too smart," Jones said. "The girls here 
have opportunities to take leadership roles, while in the process bucking some 
stereotypes." 
</P>
<P>
 The heightened interest comes despite tuitions that range from $3,400 to 
$11,000 per year. And although many young women thrive at all-girl schools, 
it's not for everyone. Some people say all-girl schools establish a sheltered 
environment that may not adequately prepare women to compete with men once they 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for many, the schools offer a counterbalance to public education, which 
has been sharply criticized in recent studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Assn. of University Women published a study in 1992 that cast a 
harsh light on gender inequality in public school education. Girls are not as 
self-confident as boys when they emerge from schools, the study said, and they 
get less attention in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 At the elementary school level, girls and boys scored equally high in math and 
science, but by the middle school years girls' achievement in these areas, 
particularly in science, begins to take a downward slide. 
</P>
<P>
 The slip has been attributed to the effects of the lingering perception that 
science and math are simply things "that men do," the report said. But even 
when girls do well in these subjects, they receive less encouragement to pursue 
such disciplines, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although differences in math achievement are narrowing, the study said, the 
gender gap in science may be increasing. In addition, girls seldom get a chance 
to learn about the accomplishments of women, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group reported that a study of 13 popular U.S. history texts revealed that 
only 1% of the 13 textbooks had any material on women, and women's lives were 
often trivialized, distorted or omitted. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-girl schools, whose faculties are usually headed by women, also offer 
relief from sexual harassment and bias by male students and teachers, which 
some researchers say has been on the rise in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, Congress passed Title IX, a federal law that prohibits sex bias in 
school athletics, career counseling, medical services, financial aid and the 
treatment of students. Violators were threatened with the loss of federal 
funds. But many schools did not take the law seriously. Between 1972 and 1991, 
no school was denied federal funding because of sex discrimination, according 
to a 20-year study of inequity in public education titled "Failing at Fairness: 
How America's Schools Cheat Girls," written by Myra and David Sadker of 
American University in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey of 1,600 middle- and high-school students conducted by Louis 
Harris last year, 85% of the girls polled said they had experienced some form 
of sexual harassment. The survey also revealed that 33% of the girls reported 
they were targeted often, compared to 18% of the boys. One-third of the girls 
who reported harassment said they did not want to go back to school as a result 
of their treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 At the all-girl schools, students say the campuses are havens from such 
pressures. In addition, many such schools approach teaching in a manner that 
recognizes the differences between the ways that boys and girls learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studies have suggested that girls learn better in an environment that is 
hands-on, where they can work in groups and where they can see the practical 
application of a theory," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Notre Dame Academy recently, four young women seated in a classroom talked 
about what they love most about going to an all-girl school. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of my friends who go to co-ed schools say they don't feel as free to 
express themselves in front of boys," said Jennifer Hatch, an honor student and 
a member of Notre Dame Academy's basketball team. Her sentiments were echoed in 
the American Assn. of University Women report, which found that many young 
women grow up afraid to look too smart or too aggressive in front of boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Being in the all-female environment, said the students, enables them to focus 
on the most important aspects of high school life. For most teen-age girls, 
looking good is priority No. 1, they said, but that is much less a concern for 
those who attend all-girl schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have to worry about my appearance so much," said Virginia Cormier, a 
senior at Notre Dame Academy. "I hardly ever wear makeup to school. I'm here 
for school." 
</P>
<P>
 If they are going to impress anyone, they say, it's going to be because they 
became National Merit Scholars, not by dating the cutest guys on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Cormier said that her experience as class president at Notre Dame has helped 
her gain an edge and develop in ways she feels she would have missed had she 
attended a co-ed high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men are not used to confident young women; they are intimidated by (the 
confidence)," she said with a laugh. An honor student who will be a senior this 
fall, Cormier believes she will have no problem competing with males when she 
goes to college and embarks on a career. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Gina Marie said the school conducted a survey of Notre Dame graduates 
from the last six years. "We were amazed at the number of young women who went 
into math and science majors, and how well they did in those fields," she said. 
She based the conclusion on an early assessment of the data, which is still 
being compiled. 
</P>
<P>
 A large percentage of recent grads, she added, went on to medical school and 
other fields traditionally dominated by males. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering 11th grade at Marlboro this fall, Lenita Morgan has her eyes on 
medical school at Stanford. She recently sat on a panel of students who 
interviewed candidates for the science department chair at Marlboro -- and 
found too few female candidates for the job. Her experience on the panel 
further encouraged her to pursue science. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she believes she would have excelled at a co-ed school, "I would be a 
little more contained, having guys around. It's still that idea that girls are 
not supposed to be too smart." 
</P>
<P>
 Not having boys around, Lenita said, "really takes away a lot of the pressures 
we as teens have to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
 Some girls in public schools, however, doubt that their private school peers 
are gaining an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Going through the Angst of the teen years at an all-girl school, said some 
teen-agers at Beverly Hills High, might be detrimental in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Public school, said Sara Myers, 18, editor of the campus newspaper, "is the 
real world." 
</P>
<P>
 "What 16-year-old doesn't feel uncomfortable around guys?," she asked. "Unless 
you learn how to be proud of who you are in front of everyone -- not just girls 
-- then you might never feel truly confident." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Donna Baynes, a 1964 graduate of Immaculate Heart, said she 
emerged from the school confident and prepared to compete with men in college 
-- and she believes her daughter, who recently graduated from the same school, 
will too. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no question that Immaculate Heart does a fabulous job in developing 
a young women so she can compete, and she doesn't have to be reticent or 
apologetic about pursuing a certain career," Baynes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic mission at all-girl schools, educators say, is to help young women 
develop their raw talents, something they contend public schools should 
emulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Little by little, school districts are paying attention to issues that affect 
young women. At the Los Angeles Unified School District, the Sex Equity 
Commission produced brochures and initiated discussions at the middle school 
and high school levels about sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 On a larger scale, the American Assn. of University Women is pushing for 
Senate approval of the proposed Gender Equity in Education Act, which the House 
of Representatives passed in April. The act is aimed at achieving equity 
through federally funded education programs such as teacher training to 
identify and change the behaviors that contribute to gender bias in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators say nurturing girls' interest in science and math and making the 
campus environment less hostile to young women are lessons that public schools 
can learn from the all-girl schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women and men think and develop in similar ways. But really good teaching 
takes into account the variety of learning styles, regardless of gender," said 
Jones of the Marlboro school. "The more the two can dovetail, the better off 
all our students will be."

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; TV PRODUCER LAUNCHES CABLE MAGAZINE SHOW; 
OXNARD'S ROBERT GUZMAN CALLS THE BIWEEKLY 'E TICKET' A PROGRAM THAT 'DARES TO 
DO ANYTHING.' IT PREMIERED ON JONES INTERCABLE BUT THE PRODUCER SEEKS BROADER 
DISTRIBUTION.

<P>
 Television producer Robert Guzman of Oxnard has launched a half-hour cable TV 
magazine called "E Ticket," which premiered Sunday on Jones Intercable. 
</P>
<P>
 The biweekly show "dares to do anything," Guzman declared. That helps explain 
the eclectic pieces on in-line skating, diving in Channel Islands National Park 
and the staging of the musical "Evita" in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it happens in the 805 area code, we'll do it," Guzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He's positioning the show for broadcast on Cox Cable in Santa Barbara, Ventura 
County Cablevision, Comcast in Simi Valley and Falcon Cable in Malibu. And the 
24-year-old Oxnard native is looking for much broader distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been hustling it over the Internet," Guzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Internet is often called the prototype for the information superhighway. 
Guzman contacts cable operators on Internet, sending them notes about the show. 
He's gotten interest from as far away as Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he's aiming for the time when information technology like Internet 
merges with entertainment programming on the information superhighway. Guzman 
said that when dial-up cable service is available, viewers anywhere in the 
country would be able to chose "E Ticket" from a menu of shows about Southern 
California.

 Wallace Theaters breaks ground today on a seven-screen movie house in Santa 
Paula. The Hawaiian theater chain will open "Movies 7" in late 1994 on West 
Main Street in the Santa Paula Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater is boasting lots of "state of the art" doodads and one traditional 
touch -- the seats will be built on rocker springs.

 Another theater, this one in Simi Valley, opened last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards opened its second just down the road from the Edwards Mountain Gate 
theater. The new building at Simi Valley Plaza gives Edwards 2,200 seats in 
Simi, said Michael Tiemeyer, director of operations for the Newport Beach 
theater chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards will continue to gobble up market share in Ventura County by building 
a 3,000-seat, 12-screen complex in Camarillo. That location should open by 
Thanksgiving.

 The El Segundo American Legion baseball team has embarked on a two-week road 
trip to South Dakota and Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 The team began play Wednesday in the Rapid City Tournament in South Dakota, 
and will compete in the Miles City Tournament in Montana starting July 6. El 
Segundo High players make up most of the squad, which includes two South Bay 
all-stars from Redondo, pitcher Scott Albin and shortstop Morgan Enberg. Other 
standouts include pitchers David Reed and Dan Croxall, first baseman Mike Poor 
and infielders Marco Estrada and Kirk Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo improved to 9-3-1 Monday with a 7-2 victory over Newbury Oaks, the 
1992 American Legion World Series champion. El Segundo leads the Bay-Pacific 
League with a 7-0-1 record and has been dominant in recent games, beating South 
Torrance, 21-0, and San Pedro, 8-2, last weekend. Notes

 Mira Costa High graduates composed three-fourths of Sunday's championship 
match of the pro beach volleyball tour event in Baltimore. Former Mustangs Eric 
Fonoimoana and Scott Ayakatubby defeated Mike Dodd and Mike Whitmarsh in the 
final, 15-10, to win the $15,000 first prize. Dodd, who also attended Mira 
Costa, and Whitmarsh split $8,550. It was the first tournament victory for 
Fonoimoana and the fourth for Ayakatubby, who will team with Kent Steffes in 
the 35th annual Manhattan Beach Open this weekend. Steffes' regular partner, 
Karch Kiraly, will sit out the tournament because of a bruised kidney. Kiraly 
has won the last four Manhattan Opens, three with Steffes. . . .

first in five of 13 events, led by Ray Butler, who won the 200 meters and the 
long jump. Other Monarch winners were William Taylor in the 100, Eric Poland in 
the triple jump and the 400-meter relay team. Morningside's Tina Moore won the 
girls' long jump. In other sports, Banning beat Peninsula, 3-0, in the boys' 
soccer final, Peninsula lost to Arcadia, 3-0, in the girls' soccer final, 
Carson's Adrian Manalang won the boys' tennis singles title, and Carson won the 
girls' tennis team title. Westchester reached the boys' basketball semifinals, 
losing to eventual champion Dominguez, 41-35. . . .

BANNING, CRENSHAW TO COMPETE IN AFRICA; BASKETBALL: PILOTS' BOYS TEAM AND 
COUGARS' GIRLS SQUAD WILL REPRESENT THE U.S. IN THE AFRICA CHALLENGE TOUR. THE 
MONTHLONG TOURNAMENT BEGINS IN PARIS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Banning boys' basketball team reached new heights when it won a second 
consecutive City Section 3-A Division title. But the Pilots didn't realize 
their victory would carry them halfway around the world. The Pilots, along with 
two-time City 4-A girls' champion Crenshaw, have been chosen to represent the 
United States in the Africa Challenge Tour. They depart July 27 on a monthlong 
trip that begins in Paris and continues through four countries in Western 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very excited about the trip and all the opportunities it will provide 
us," Banning Coach Marc Paez said. "We never imagined getting a chance to visit 
Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Banning and Crenshaw will participate in boys' and girls' tournaments in 
Benin, Togo, the Central African Republic and Gabon. Paez will be responsible 
for the seven Pilot boys making the trip and Crenshaw co-coach Greg Cobbs will 
escort the seven Cougar girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the trip for the Pilots are senior forward Kevin Burton, junior guard 
LaDonte King, junior guard Brian Jones, senior forwards Harold McCrimmon, Kito 
Patterson and Akbar Rahman, and junior center Rick Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially, I will be a single parent for seven teen-agers," Paez said. "It 
will be a lot work, but it will be worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Representing the Cougars will be Naila Mosely, All-City Section senior guard 
Kristi Lattin, junior point guard Devin King, senior forward Bridget Jemison, 
senior guard Sommer Tillet, junior forward Quiana Knox and sophomore forward 
Kisha Shephard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really disbelief," Jones said. "I thought they were joking when they 
told me I was going. When I heard it was for real, I had no words because I 
didn't believe we were going." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the seven girls and only one of the boys making the trip have ever 
traveled outside the United States. Seven players have never flown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on a small private plane, but I've never been on a commercial jet," 
said 16-year-old Sanchez. "I'm little worried, but I can deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 But even McCrimmon, the team's most experienced traveler, said he was 
apprehensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I'm a little bit scared," McCrimmon said. "It's a very long trip." 
</P>
<P>
 The African tour is sponsored by the French National Basketball Federation, 
which each year selects European teams to compete and help promote basketball 
in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 City Commissioner Barbara Fiege said she was told by a tournament official 
that this is the first time teams from the United States have been asked to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The invitation was presented to the school district as an all-expense-paid 
trip for two teams of seven players each and a coach to travel to Africa," she 
said. "The Senior High Division selected Banning and Crenshaw based on their 
double victories in City championship games. It was up to the individual 
schools to decide whether they sent their boys' or girls' teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said the details of the trip have been sketchy so far because the 
information she has received has been written in French. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had to have everything translated into English because my French isn't 
very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the trip is a month away, some Pilots have already thought about 
packing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to pack lots of shorts and cool clothes," Jones said. "A couple 
pairs of sandals and tank tops. It's going to be hot." 
</P>
<P>
 For most players' parents, this will be the first time their children have 
been away from home for more than a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a wonderful opportunity," said Jones' father, Carl. "I'm not too 
thrilled with him going so far away. I trust Coach Paez, though, and I think he 
will take good care of him."

DESALTER: FACILITY OWNERSHIP CLARIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This letter is in reference to "Torrance: Success of Desalter May Be 
Multiplied," (June 23). In the article it is stated that the C. Marvin Brewer 
Desalting Facility is owned by the Central Basin Municipal Water District.This 
statement is incorrect. The C. Marvin Brewer Desalting Facility is owned by the 
West Basin Municipal Water District, which serves the communities in the South 
Bay, the city of West Hollywood and unincorporated areas of southwest Los 
Angeles County. The Central Basin Municipal Water District serves the 
communities located in Southeast Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Basin Municipal Water District and the Central Basin Municipal Water 
District are two of the 27 member agencies of the Metropolitan Water District 
of Southern California. Each district is governed by a separate five-member 
board of directors, who are elected by the public. Together, both districts 
serve 2.4 million people within a 412-square-mile area of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, we are currently living in a time in which the phrase reinventing 
government is commonly heard, and yet rarely acted upon. At the West Basin 
Municipal Water District and the Central Basin Municipal Water District, 30 
full-time employees have been working without fanfare to solve the area's 
drought problem through the formation of partnerships with other governmental 
agencies and innovative water-recycling projects that will help to 
drought-proof the 40 communities we serve.

EMPLOYMENT: HUGHES' SUPPORT FOR HARMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First, Hughes Aircraft Co., long a high-tech fixture in Playa del Rey, El 
Segundo and Torrance, generated controversy by distributing a form letter 
"encouraging" its employees to give money to incumbent Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Marina del Rey), believing that Harman could help Hughes and the rest of the 
aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, (last week), Hughes announced 3,200 job cuts in California. 
</P>
<P>
 I doubt that the many Hughes employees who dutifully gave Jane Harman their 
contributions and votes, and who will soon join the unemployment rolls, feel 
that they made a wise investment.

RELIGION: METHODIST CHURCH LOSING REVEREND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This past Sunday I did something that I rarely do -- I went to church. Not 
just any church, but St. Paul's United Methodist Church in North Redondo Beach 
to hear Rev. Jim Hamilton's last sermon.After 17 years there, Rev. Hamilton is 
leaving for a year's sabbatical in Costa Rica. After that, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 I first met Rev. Hamilton almost four years ago when, as editor of the Redondo 
Beach News, I became intrigued by the work that both Project: NEEDS and the 
AIDS Heartline were doing out of his little church in District 5. Over the next 
few years I wrote several stories about them and Rev. Hamilton and I became 
good friends, getting together for lunch every few months to catch up on life 
and complain about the demise of our beloved Boston Celtics. I even began 
helping out at the church's Tuesday night meal. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past two years, I've seen the South Bay Community Church of the 
Brethren and the First United Methodist Church of Redondo Beach add Wednesday 
and Thursday night meals to their schedules, always remembering that it all 
started at St. Paul's. 
</P>
<P>
 To me, Jim Hamilton is everything God wants a preacher to be. A leader to both 
his flock and his community. Kind, loving, compassionate and tolerant. I like 
to think some of that has rubbed off on me over the past few years, just 
because I had the honor and privilege of being his friend. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll all miss Jim.

EDUCATION: COVERAGE OF POSITIVE SCHOOL EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing to thank you and Mary Guthrie for the willingness to publish "For 
Students, It's an Act of Healing," (June 2). At a time when media plays such an 
instrumental role in shaping public perceptions, I so appreciated that your 
paper would cover examples of youth and local citizens joining together to 
create positive directions for their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to commend Mary Guthrie, not only for her professional and thorough 
approach to gathering information, but even more for her genuine interest in 
looking for good news that helps communicate and perhaps even inspire others to 
actively lend a hand in serving schools like Curtiss Junior High School in 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 On behalf of the students, teachers and families involved in our ACE 
(Achievement and Commitment to Excellence) Program in Carson and citywide, we 
thank you. We thank you for caring enough, and perhaps even being courageous 
enough (for good news may not be as sensational and glitzy), to share the very 
common yet ordinary, positive side of what kids, teachers, parents and local 
citizens are doing in their schools to help make their communities great. We 
need to let that positive view be known and enhanced. Thank you for playing a 
part.

LIBRARIES: THREATENED CLOSURE IN HERMOSA BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again the Los Angeles County Library system is threatening our Hermosa 
Beach library with closure -- total shutdown sometime in July or August. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether this is simply another political ploy, or the library is really to be 
boarded up, is not the issue.The point is that our situation is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 The county collects about $304,000 from Hermosa Beach property owners, tax 
revenue mandated for yearly library services. With a two-day-a-week library 
operation, we're not getting our money's worth! For that amount we deserve a 
full-time library and think we can operate one if the county will return our 
library funds to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The governing board of the Hermosa Beach Friends of the Library voted 
unanimously to endorse and support the recommendation of the Hermosa Beach City 
Council library subcommittee: that the city immediately begin the process of 
leaving the county library system, acquire title to the library building, 
negotiate for the current inventory of books and materials, and for the terms 
of transfer of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the sequence of events, the Hermosa Beach Friends of the Library is 
here to stay. If the library is closed for a period of time (a short transition 
period, we hope) we have requested that the city provide us with a reading room 
for use of the magazines and newspapers we already donate.

JAUNTS; TREKKING ON LOS ROBLES TRAIL; CONEJO PARK DISTRICT NATURALISTS LEAD 
MONTHLY HIKES LASTING ABOUT 2 1/2 HOURS. THE PACE IS RELAXED WITH PLENTY OF 
TIME TO ENJOY THE VIEW AND THE WILDFLOWERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HULSE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Robles Trail, a 10-mile stretch along the south edge of Thousand Oaks, is 
a bonanza for hikers who want easy accessibility. With its network of spurs and 
loops, though, it can look rather daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 But every month, naturalists with the Conejo Recreation and Park District lead 
hikes on a portion of the trail. Usually the hikes are no more than four miles 
long, beginning at 9 a.m. and running about 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not forced marches. The pace is relaxed, with plenty of time to take 
in the view, pull out the wildflower book to identify a bloom or get a swig of 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, naturalist Jim Lux led a handful of hikers to Rasnow Peak from a 
trail head at the south end of Moorpark Road in Thousand Oaks. It was about 
four miles round-trip and ventured into the area that burned during last year's 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
 From the trail head, Los Robles Trail is more like a gently rolling fire road 
than a trail. It draws mountain bikers and, in fact, on this hike, the group 
passed more bikers than hikers. 
</P>
<P>
 By day, Lux is a computer consultant, but on these hikes he passes on tidbits 
about the plants, geology and history of the area. Wild mustard borders the 
trail and, according to Lux, it was planted by the Spanish to mark the roads. 
It apparently thrived well enough here to be a cash crop at one point, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, wildflowers are still blooming: varieties of phacelia, monkey 
flowers, sunflowers, morning glories and yucca. Because of the fires, the 
wildflowers popped up in record numbers this spring. The flames destroyed the 
chaparral and brush, making it easier for the flowers to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 There is still evidence of the fire. Charred tree trunks stand out starkly. 
But the ashen look of the ground is gone, replaced by new greenery. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail eventually narrows and becomes more like a trail than a fire road. 
About one-third of the way from the top, the switchbacks begin, but they are 
gentle. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the sun is beating relentlessly, and there is no shade anywhere on the 
trail. Water is a must. So is sunscreen. (Lux packs it just in case a hiker 
forgets.) 
</P>
<P>
 There are no markers at the top of Rasnow Peak to let you know that you've 
made it. The trail simply starts descending. If you stay on it, continuing 
west, you'll wind up at Rancho Sierra Vista Park in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The peak is named for the family that owns land in the area. From the top, 
hikers have a good view of the Conejo Valley below. You may see red-tailed 
hawks circling in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 The elevation here is about 1,500 feet, a climb of 700 feet from the trail 
head. The trip down is faster, halted occasionally by passing mountain bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 Anywhere from two to 50 hikers sign up for the monthly hikes, which cost $3. 
On the same day the district also offers a similar hike especially for single 
people. That one starts at 6:30 p.m. and also costs $3. 
</P>

EARTHWATCH: COMPUTERS ARE BECOMING VITAL IN IMPROVING SOIL; YOUR PC CAN LINK 
YOU TO EXPERTS AND MESSAGE GROUPS THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO BETTER 
THE LAND BY PRODUCING COMPOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When people hear the term computer composting , they think I'm suggesting that 
we grind up old PCs for mulch. And though we are talking about a means of 
protecting and enhancing the soil that sustains us, none of us will have to 
sacrifice our expensive computer hardware for the good of the garden or the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer composting I'm referring to is the sort that, as Ventura 
composting expert Eric Werbalowsky puts it, teaches us "how to be Johnny 
Appleseed with a horticultural education program on the Internet." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he reeled off the names of some electronic databases that composters, 
organic gardeners and professional agricultural experts are already using. 
</P>
<P>
 Their goal is to promote and practice the gentle art of tending the land -- 
the soil itself. The idea is this: If you have vital, healthy, biologically 
active soil, a lot of other growing problems will disappear. Organic, 
non-chemical, grind-up-the-green-waste ideas predominate on these electronic 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Werbalowsky, there are already a large number of gardeners around 
the country who have been running to their home computers to seek advice from 
computer groups, whose members can be found through names such as tree.zip, 
plant.zip, slug1.thd and something one might expect, mlchmw.txt, which is about 
mulching equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 These pithy monikers represent the e-mail addresses of organizations such as 
the Master Gardeners' Conference and the Montessori Foundation's Horticultural 
Education Within the Schools Program. Go Gardening is the e-mail address for an 
organization called the Gardening Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Users either delve into the electronic data much as they might browse through 
the best agricultural library in the world, or they post a sort of electronic 
cry for help on the Internet and wait for a response. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals such as Werbalowsky -- whose e-mail address is WERB@DELPHI.COM -- 
is among those ready to play the J. Appleseed role. Later this summer, this 
hardy band will be joined by some people in Ojai, known as Harmonious 
Technologies, which plans to offer a sort of electronic composting college / 
catalogue sales service. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, headed by John Roulac, is already well-known in national composting 
circles for its best-selling book "Back-Yard Composting." California 
municipalities have been buying copies in the thousands to pass out to 
residents to encourage them to compost rather than throw green waste into local 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 And techniques such as composting, urban tree trimming and mulching are 
particularly important for California, where our use of chemicals and a growing 
shortage of water so imperil our rich topsoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Computers, in their no-nonsense way, are a great aid in dealing with this 
issue. Paul Bartels, president of the local citrus growers association and 
owner of GreenSource, a mulch-producing operation in Fillmore, is a big booster 
of composting. And he is practicing what he preaches: Within 10 years, the 
grounds of the 30 acres of orchard he leases will all be covered in mulch for 
water retention and nutrient replenishment. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicts that big commercial growers will eventually notice -- 
electronically -- the experiences of folks like himself. "It's going to show up 
on the computer screen -- just like the info they're already checking out about 
the best loan packages and most efficient watering patterns -- in a form they 
have come to think of as irrefutable." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of this, he said, is already happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their CPAs are recommending bugs ("friendly" insects, which eat pests) 
instead of spraying. The computer will (eventually) recommend mulch instead of 
bare land and fertilizers." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Computer-savvy and environmentally minded readers interested in the 
latest information on composting, organic gardening, and even how to plant and 
maintain a kitchen garden from the 1776 Fourth of July era can hook up their 
modems and address e-mail to Go Gardening, tree.zip, cmpst.Txt. or a local 
expert, WERB@DELPHI.COM, whose human name is Eric Werbalowsky.

 As the Summer Solstice Celebration a couple of weeks ago proved, Santa Barbara 
County knows how to throw a party. And form is likely to hold true this weekend 
as the Fourth of July rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some events for you that are spread out over Saturday, Sunday and 
Monday, so you could, assuming that you have the stamina and tickets are 
available, attend them all. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the folks at Santa Ynez Winery will be cooking up tri-tip for a 
Saturday barbecue on the lawn overlooking the vineyard. Wine, of course, will 
be available for sampling. The party will run from noon to 4 p.m. Tickets are 
$15 (general), $7.50 (ages 10-21), free (under 10). Call (800) 864-3443 for 
reservations, which are filling fast. The winery is at 343 N. Refugio Road. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the Fess Parker Winery in Los Olivos will host the Davy Crockett 
All-American Independence Day Celebration, with re-enactments of the historical 
events from the 1800s, stage coach rides, country music and a chicken dinner. 
There will also be a Davy Crockett costume contest for children and a visit by 
Davy himself. Tickets are $25 (adults), $12 (children). Call 688-1545 for 
reservations. This, too, is filling up quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Monday (the real holiday), the best bet is to just hang around 
downtown Santa Barbara, with most of the day's activities taking place on 
Cabrillo Boulevard near Stearns Wharf. 
</P>
<P>
 A car show and crafts show will be held simultaneously on Cabrillo from 10 
a.m. to 3 p.m. There will be a picnic at Pershing Park (at Cabrillo and 
Castillo Street) from 11 a.m. to dusk, and a parade will run along Cabrillo 
(from the Red Lion resort to Castillo) starting at 6:30 p.m. Finally, a big 
fireworks display beginning at 8:30 p.m., launched from offshore, will be 
visible from the beaches adjacent to the wharf. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Fourth of July event away from Cabrillo Boulevard, the Santa Barbara 
Symphony will present a free concert of pop and patriotic tunes at the Santa 
Barbara Courthouse Sunken Gardens starting at 4:30 p.m. The courthouse is at 
118 E. Figueroa St. 
</P>
<P>

Semana Nautica Summer Sports Festival on Friday through July 10 in and around 
Santa Barbara. All events are free. For specific days, times and locations, and 
information on other events, call the Santa Barbara Parks and Recreation 
Department at 564-5589.

 Actress Barbara Perry, whose career spans television to Broadway, will star in 
the Santa Barbara Civic Light Opera presentation of "Passionate Ladies." The 
one-woman musical will run Wednesday through July 10 at Santa Barbara's Center 
Stage Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Passionate Ladies," which Perry also wrote, the actress plays the roles of 
five women: a stripper, an English professor, an acting coach, a housewife and 
an aging tap-dancer. In 1980, the show won two Los Angeles Critics Circle 
Awards and two Los Angeles Dramalogue Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Show times are at 8 p.m. Wednesday through July 9, 2 p.m. July 7 and 9, and 4 
p.m. July 10. Tickets for Wednesday night's show, a Civic Light Opera 
fund-raiser, are $55, which includes pre- and post-performance receptions. 
Tickets for the remaining shows are $18. Call (800) 366-6064. The theater is on 
the second level of the Paseo Nuevo shopping center.

SHOPTALK; COMPARE TAGS TO GET BEST BUY ON A LOAD OF SEASIDE ACCESSORIES; HERE'S 
THE LOWDOWN ON PRICES FOR AN ARRAY OF BEACH 'ESSENTIALS,' EXCEPT THE TRUCK IN 
WHICH TO HAUL THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Remember when all you needed for a great day at the beach was a towel and a 
buspass? Those days have long since passed. Now we find ourselves lugging tons 
of "essential" stuff. And burning our feet on scorching sand. Worst of all, 
eating sandy hard-boiled eggs and hot peaches. Why does anyone like going to 
the beach anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there are the kids. And a Significant Other who owns a dizzying array of 
Boogie boards. Need we say more? 
</P>
<P>
 If we could just get organized! Flip-flops on everyone's feet. Sun block. 
Sunglasses. Sand toys for the kids. What else do we need for the perfect day at 
the beach and where do we get this stuff for the best price? 
</P>
<P>
 We questioned a few beachcombing moms and dads, and we found most families 
also take a couple of sand chairs, a beach umbrella and a cooler for a day's 
outing. A quick trip to Thrifty, Savon or Target will help you collect what you 
need. Unfortunately, no one store was best for all items. Here's a rundown of 
what's available: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sand chairs: Thrifty's sand chairs were priced lowest at $8.99. They are 
high-back, single-position chairs and they come in a variety of bright colors. 
The same chairs are $1 more at Target and $2 more at Savon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Umbrellas: Clamp-on umbrellas that attach to a sand chair were $4.99 at 
Thrifty and Savon. A 46-inch clip-on at Target was $9.99. Thrifty had a 
standard beach umbrella for $12.99, but we didn't see one at Savon. Target had 
a couple to choose from, one at $14.99 and another for $19.99. The best sun 
protection for your money was the Beach Chair Canopy at Target. The canopy fits 
any 20- to 21 1/2-inch sand chair and has a sun-protection rating of 465! (The 
label claims that this is total sun block.) All this for $7, reduced from 
$16.99. 
</P>
<P>
 * Coolers: to keep that fruit fresh and your drinks drinkable. Igloo's Little 
Playmate is $9.89 at Target, $11.99 at Savon and $12.99 at Thrifty. 
</P>
<P>
 * Towels: A big, old sheet is a great home base at the beach. Light-colored 
ones stay coolest. You can bring smaller ones just for drying off. We do love 
big, plush beach towels, though. Don't look for great towels at any of these 
stores. The ones we saw were thin and skimpy. Target had character towels for 
$8.99 and striped towels for $7.99. Savon's towels were priced at $12.99 for 
stripes and $14.99 for the privilege of advertising Looney Toons characters. 
Thrifty's beach towels were least expensive, ranging in price from $6.99 to 
$11.99. 
</P>
<P>
 For good towels, try Strouds or department stores. Best buy for beach towels 
is the Price Club. Its towels were priced from $8.99 to $11.99. They were 
gorgeous and substantially thicker and bigger than those at the other stores. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sandals: Thrifty does the best job on flip-flops. It also had the widest 
selection: only 89 cents for children's sandals and $1.99 for the thicker-soled 
thongs in all sizes. Savon had only a few pairs of sandals. However, it did 
have some nifty fake Birkenstocks for $5.99. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sand toys: If you're not taking kids, this item is optional. You might not 
want to rule it out entirely, though, especially if you've always wanted your 
own castle. A three-piece castle maker with molds for different turrets and 
towers was only $2.49 at Savon. Target has the biggest selection of sand toys. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sunscreen: If you take nothing else, take sun block! The choice is daunting 
but don't be confused. Just pick one with a high protection rating and use it! 
We like Banana Boat's Children's Sun Block. It has a rating of 30 and is 
waterproof. At Thrifty and Target, it's priced at $5.99 for three ounces. The 
best price is at Savon: $7.99 for six ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, this list will help you enjoy your trip to the beach. If only we 
could keep the sand off your lunch!

SCRAMBLIN' MAN; QUARTERBACK PERRY KLEIN HAS BEEN VILIFIED FOR SWITCHING SCHOOLS 
-- BUT THAT WAS BEFORE THE NFL CALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sports agent Gary Wishard says that Perry Klein's story, the rags-to-riches 
tale of a controversial quarterback, will make a best-seller someday. 
</P>
<P>
 An appropriate title might be "The Post Man Always Rings Twice." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, after all, had been knocking on doors for some time until he found a 
football program that allowed him to showcase his talent. It all came together 
last season at tiny C.W. Post in Brookville, N.Y., where Klein set a bushel of 
NCAA Division II passing records, caught the attention of NFL scouts and wound 
up being drafted in the fourth round by the Atlanta Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the third quarterback taken overall, after Tennessee's Heath Shuler and 
Fresno State's Trent Dilfer were among the top six picks. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an improbable turn of events for Klein, who had become better known for 
changing schools than throwing touchdown passes until finding his niche in the 
run-and-shoot offense at C.W. Post. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to work hard and be successful," Klein said by phone from 
Atlanta. "I'm not trying to gloat. I've had a bumpy road. I think it makes me 
appreciate everything a little more." 
</P>
<P>
 The path appears to be getting smoother all the time for the 23-year-old 
Malibu native. He has been encouraged by his early meetings with Falcons Coach 
June Jones and quarterback coach Mouse Davis. He is now looking for a place to 
live in Atlanta. And on July 10, Klein will marry his girlfriend of three 
years, Cari Delson, a former volleyball player at Pepperdine and at Irvine 
High. After a brief honeymoon in Laguna Beach, Klein will report to camp with 
the Falcons on July 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all fitting together for Perry," said Klein's mother, Diana. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two years ago, though, Klein's football career was in disarray. He 
left UC Berkeley in the middle of the 1992 season after three frustrating years 
as a backup. He wasn't sure what his next move would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Wishard. 
</P>
<P>
 A successful agent whose NFL clients include linebacker Ken Norton Jr. of the 
San Francisco 49ers and tight end Keith Jackson of the Miami Dolphins, Wishard 
was a friend of Klein's father, Danny, a Malibu neighbor, when he met Perry for 
the first time in the summer of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Jets receiver Rob Moore, one of Wishard's clients, was in town and 
wanted to work out with a quarterback. Although Wishard was a College Division 
All-America quarterback at C.W. Post in 1971, he knew Moore needed a younger, 
stronger arm to throw to him. Wishard called Klein, whose passing and athletic 
ability made an immediate impression on the agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see right away he was one of the most talented quarterbacks I had 
ever seen," Wishard said. "He just jumps out at you. I figured he would be 
playing for Cal that season, and I said, 'Good luck.' I was going to keep my 
eye on him as a potential client." 
</P>
<P>
 When Klein left Cal six games into the 1992 season, he called Wishard, who has 
since become the player's agent and is negotiating his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was frustrated," Wishard said. "Maybe (leaving Cal) was a mistake. I said, 
'Let's turn a negative into a positive.' " 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid having Klein sit out a season, which he would have been obligated to 
do had he transferred to a Division I school, Wishard suggested that the 
quarterback transfer to a lower-division school. 
</P>
<P>
 He called C.W. Post Coach Tom Marshall, who was the offensive coordinator when 
Wishard played there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never heard of it," Klein said of C.W. Post. "At that point, I just 
wanted to have an opportunity to play. It wasn't like I was looking down on the 
school. I liked the idea that it was in New York. That was an exciting thing 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Wishard said leaving the West Coast was the best thing for Klein, who had 
earned the nickname "Mr. Transfer" for his highly publicized school-hopping in 
high school. After enjoying a record-breaking junior season at Palisades High, 
Klein transferred to Carson for his senior season and helped the Colts win the 
1988 City Section 4-A Division title. 
</P>
<P>
 After the football season, the Kleins gave up an apartment in Carson and Perry 
transferred to Santa Monica, where he finished his senior year. To many, the 
events portrayed Klein as an opportunist, a spoiled rich kid, who, with the 
help of his family, was making a mockery of poorly enforced transfer rules in 
his pursuit of a bigger, better deal. The press had a field day. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Klein says his only regret is that he did not finish his senior 
year at Carson. "I always said that I never meant to hurt anyone, or take 
anything away from a school," he said. "A lot was written at the time, and I 
took a lot of heat. To go through that when I was young was tough. But I've 
used it to fuel my fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "When things didn't go right for me at Cal, a lot of people were probably 
saying, 'Here he goes again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The way Wishard saw it, Klein was caught in the middle of two movements at 
Cal. As a freshman and sophomore, he played behind an older, more experienced 
and more popular quarterback in Mike Pawlawski. When Pawlawski left, and the 
starting job appeared to be Klein's by seniority, new Coach Keith Gilbertson 
went with a younger quarterback, sophomore Dave Barr.

 Klein may have undermined his junior season when he walked out of spring 
practice. He returned two days later and apologized to the team, but the damage 
was already done. Klein got off to a bad start with a new coach and lost his 
teammates' respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to unseat Barr, Klein left Cal after a particularly humiliating 
experience. Playing against USC before family and friends at the Coliseum, 
Klein got in for one play, was blindsided and lost a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-3 Klein committed himself to weightlifting after leaving Cal and 
bulked up to his present weight of 210 pounds. Faster and stronger, he went out 
and rewrote virtually all of C.W. Post's passing records. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the 1993 season, Klein had passed for 3,757 yards and accounted 
for 4,052 yards in total offense, both Division II records. 
</P>
<P>
 No one could dispute the numbers Klein put up, but some questioned the 
competition he was facing. This was, after all, Division II football. 
</P>
<P>
 Wishard, though, never had any doubts that Klein was NFL material. He rattled 
off a long list of quarterbacks who excelled in the NFL after playing at small 
colleges -- Terry Bradshaw, Ken Anderson, Dan Pastorini. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Falcons use a run-and-shoot offense, their interest in Klein was 
understandable. He was the 111th player selected in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real excited because I worked so hard for it," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, does Klein have anything to say to those who doubted and criticized him in 
the past? A last laugh, so to speak? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, that's not what this is all about," he said. "It's about Perry Klein and 
me being happy. It doesn't make me happy to make other people look bad. I don't 
feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's nice to overcome odds."

NOTEBOOK / SEAN WATERS; COLLEGE DROPS BASEBALL PROGRAM BUT REINSTATES MEN'S 
VOLLEYBALL

 Santa Monica College is suspending its baseball program for the 1995 season 
but will reinstate its men's volleyball program, Athletic Director Avie Bridges 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica wanted to operate a joint baseball program with West Los Angeles 
College, which would supply the baseball field and pay for the coach. Santa 
Monica, which does not have an on-campus field, had planned to pay the 
remaining 75% of the costs associated with running the program. Those costs, 
estimated at $15,000, include equipment, transportation and liability 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges said she was told Friday that West L.A. did not have the funds to pay 
for baseball expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica tentatively dropped its men's volleyball and men's tennis teams 
and added women's soccer in May in an attempt to meet gender-equity 
requirements. Men's tennis, however, will not be reinstated, partly because the 
school's courts are being used for temporary classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Aronin, the former Notre Dame Academy girls' basketball coach, accepted a 
similar position Tuesday with St. Anthony of Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 In four seasons, Aronin, 50, led the Regals to a 66-13 record and three 
appearances in the Southern Section Division IV quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jackson, Santa Monica High tight end, has been selected to play in the 
43rd annual North-South Shrine Game July 23 at Cerritos College. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Venice guard Yuriko Jung is a member of the City Force girls' basketball team, 
which recently competed last week in an Amateur Athletic Union tournament in 
Minnesota. Jung, a junior, was selected to The Times' 1994 Westside all-star 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Chase, who guided Washington to four consecutive City Section titles from 
1989 to 1992, coaches City Force, which includes of 15 top City Section 
players. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 University catcher Kirk Romo and Westchester shortstop Henry Jones were 
selected to the All-City 4-A Division all-star team by the Amateur Athletic 
Foundation First Interstate Bank board. Romo batted .378 to lead University to 
the Western League championship and Jones batted .348 for the second-place 
Comets. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood outfielder Roberto Marroquin, who batted .438, was selected to the 
3-A Division all-star team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielders Tami Albright and Kristina Klein of Westchester and outfielder 
Poppy Gee of Venice were selected to the City Section 3-A all-star softball 
team. Debbie Grace and Lisa Ikeda of Westchester were named honorable mention.

MUSIC; THERE'S NO APRIL, BUT THERE IS JULY 13TH; THE BEST BAND IN SIMI VALLEY 
HAS A RELEASE DATE FOR ITS DEBUT ALBUM. THE MUSICIANS SAY THEIR FORAY INTO L.A. 
GAVE THEM NEEDED EXPOSURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Being the best band in Simi Valley is sort of like being the smartest guy in 
jail. Even if it's true, who knows and who cares? Suburban Simi Valley has a 
bunch of bands and nowhere for them to play. April's Motel Room, the best band 
in Simi Valley, got out of their hometown, did the L.A. schmooze tour, and got 
signed to Immortal Records, one of the many aliases of corporate giant Epic 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Their debut album, "Black 14," will be released on July 13. Their last local 
gig for a while will be Friday night at the Beach Shack in Santa Barbara. Bay 
Area rockers MCM and the Monster are also on the bill and Mac's still has those 
killer burritos across the street from the venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the Ventura Freeway goes to Pasadena and the majority of blue hibiscus 
plants have purple flowers, there's no April in April's Motel Room, but there's 
Tom Kelly on voice and guitar, Sam Nickell on lead guitar, Mike Hoolihan on 
bass, Aaron Zidenberg on drums; John Baffa is the percussionist. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll notice the show is not in Simi Valley, which has the Vampyre Lounge 
Cafe, an all-ages coffee house; MVP Sports Bar, a venue that has live music on 
weekends, and a lot of rock fans driving away to rock elsewhere. The 
alternative to the lack of venues is the party circuit, where the band plays 
approximately three songs before the cops show up. So why doesn't Simi Valley 
rock? 
</P>
<P>
 "Couldn't tell you -- we've been on the road," said Baffa during a recent 
phone interview. "It's a very conservative town, and there's not a whole lot of 
support for the local scene. The scene is so dead now that it makes me think 
that a year and a half ago when we were playing with Hail Rumpus and 
Contradiction at Cheers (since closed), that it must've really been a special 
time. But we all still live here -- we're totally comfortable. There's enough 
adventure at work, so it's totally cool to go home and eat dinner at my 
parents' house and watch TV." 
</P>
<P>
 There's plenty of adventure for everyone in L.A., a town that has to be seen 
to be disbelieved. In addition to trying to drive or breathe, everyone seems to 
be either an actor, a screenwriter or a musician. The music community is 
particularly large because the record industry is there, and MTV dreams precede 
even the hair and the funny clothes. April's Motel Room did the showcase 
circuit and, for once, it worked out when Happy Williams signed them, and made 
them Immortal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a conscious effort on our part, definitely," said Baffa. "We pretty 
much split from Simi Valley and kicked around in L.A. for a year or so, and we 
just knew something was bound to happen. People just started showing up to our 
gigs, and we built a fan base of L.A. people, not our friends from Simi Valley. 
Playing L.A. is something you need to do. You have to get out of your hometown 
and quit playing for your friends. You'll see if you've got it or not pretty 
damn quick." 
</P>
<P>
 The band has a press kit now that's bigger than a Chrysler, complete with a 
basic bio (not exactly the Eiffel Tower of elucidation), stickers, a giant 
poster, a tape, a five-song CD that's headed for college radio and an actual 
record. So now, it's dinner with mom, cable TV and checks in the mail. Well, 
not quite yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to work a lot harder now," Baffa said. "We've got a little more money 
so that now we can afford to eat twice a day instead of just once. More is 
expected of us now, from ourselves, and also, the people backing us. We've been 
afforded the opportunity to concentrate on our art, which has pretty much 
brought us to a different level. We pretty much all lost our day jobs by the 
time we got signed, anyway. It's not like we're rock stars or anything, but 
it's getting interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 As the percussionist -- basically a drummer who can't find a chair -- Baffa 
has had the opportunity to upgrade all the weird things he beats on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aaron gets to sit down with the drum kit, while I'm more of a stand-up guy. I 
play a lot of different stuff from congas to bongos to bells and shakers. If it 
sounds good, I'll use anything from saute pans to lead pipes. It's a small 
luxury, but I've got cool junk now. We just have so much fun, we can't help but 
create fun stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Making "Black 14," or any album these days, is much more involved than 
guzzling a few beers, then flipping on the tape machine and doing it in one 
take. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought making the record was going to be one of the coolest things I've 
ever done, and I had the best time in the world," Baffa said. "We had maybe 
four days off and we worked 12-hour days for a month and a half. Our producer, 
Matt Hyde, ended up becoming our friend; he was totally cool. We thought he was 
going to try to change us because that's definitely a concern for first-time 
artists doing their first album, but he let us make our own choices." 
</P>
<P>
 The five-song EP is already getting some airplay, and the band has some fun 
stuff upcoming, such as a spot on the next HORDE tour, which also features the 
Allman Brothers, Blues Traveler and Big Head Todd & the Monsters. And a few 
months ago, the band had a gig in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stayed in Costa Rica for a week and did three shows with Depeche Mode, but 
we were in the city most of the time," Baffa said. "We were doing radio 
interviews with a translator, then eating at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. They had 
great beer down there for 40 cents." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell in Costa Rica? It must've been like 
being back home in Simi Valley. Details

RESTAURANT REVIEW; A LARGESS OF LARGENESS AT ROXY'S DELI; FOR PATRONS HUNGRY 
ENOUGH, THERE ARE MOUNDS OF DELIGHTFUL FARE -- PILES OF PASTRAMI, COLOSSAL 
COLESLAW. ALL IN ALL, IT IS NOT SMALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The first thing that hits you when you walk into Roxy's Famous Deli is the 
tangy, pleasant smell of pickles. The second thing you notice is that you've 
now entered Paul Bunyan food country. Those cakes twirling around in the 
dessert cases are at least two feet tall. That pastrami sandwich over on the 
table is piled as high as a blue ox. And the side of coleslaw next to it 
resembles a small green haystack. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be that this place is courting fame for the size of its portions. It 
could even become famous for the quantity of its selections -- a whopping 400 
items on the menu, not counting drinks. But, just in case, they've also 
plastered the walls with a cheerful, nostalgic mosaic of theatrical posters and 
head shots of famous actors. 
</P>
<P>
 I went back again and again; I ate and ate, and still I feel that I've barely 
discovered the strengths and weaknesses of this restaurant. I do believe that 
any time you try to make a virtue out of quantity, you'll pay a price in 
consistency, and that was the case here. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the clientele gives the generally happy impression that 
they've come here first and foremost to eat -- and eat and eat. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the kind of place you can bring a passel of kids, plunk the baby on 
the table in his infant seat and feel right at home. For sports enthusiasts, TV 
screens are positioned strategically around the place but, thankfully, the 
sound isn't turned on. 
</P>
<P>
 We had the surreal experience of seeing an ad come on the TV for the 
restaurant, which is pleasantly decorated in red "leather" and green "marble," 
just as we were ordering. My husband had to ask the waitress to please step 
aside in case they were showing food choices he'd overlooked on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 That classic deli standby, matzo ball soup ($3.95), came with a matzo as big 
as a softball, perched on a bed of noodles and chicken chunks. We took home the 
matzo ball we couldn't finish, kept adding broth to it and ate it for days. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabbage soup, as sweet as ice cream, had nuggets of good meat and plenty of 
cabbage. The barley soup was hearty and homey with slippery barley in a thick, 
flavorful broth. 
</P>
<P>
 The lox appetizer ($7.95) was OK, although not superb. Chopped chicken liver 
($5.25) was better, with a lively, almost lemony flavor, and it went very well 
with the half-sour pickles set out on every table. 
</P>
<P>
 Our friend said his roast chicken ($7.95) reminded him of Sunday afternoon 
dinners at Aunt Sadie's. As he put it: "Savory, well-cooked, moist and all 
those good chicken things." The asparagus that came with it was crisp and 
delicious, but mistakenly camouflaged by a mustard sauce laced with chopped 
pimientos. 
</P>
<P>
 With breakfast served all day here, we tried a corned beef hash that was 
definitely homemade, but that didn't mean it was any better than the canned. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange roughy ($8.95) was plain fare indeed, although plenty big in size. The 
roast turkey dinner ($8.95) with mashed potatoes was strictly for the white 
gravy crowd. Although the stuffing was miserable, the turkey itself was decent. 
The meatloaf ($7.95) -- three generous pieces -- was wonderful, and its baked 
potato was also good. 
</P>
<P>
 At one of our dinners, the vegetable of the day consisted of a stockpile of 
what seemed to be frozen carrots, which were neon orange and quite dreadful. 
They could be spotted uneaten on plates all over the dining room. However, on 
another night, the carrots were fresh, well cooked and very good. 
</P>
<P>
 Branching away from deli fare one day, we tried the chicken fajita pita, which 
was yummy and juicy, with big morsels of chicken, sweet peppers, onions and 
fresh tomatoes. The salsa was nice and spicy, although the guacamole was so 
tangy it seemed carbonated. On the side was a fresh, appealing fruit cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Salad nicoise ($7.95) was terribly large, about as big as an igloo. I merely 
touched it with my fork and it tumbled all over the table. The nicoise 
ingredients -- tuna chunks, onions, potatoes, tomatoes and olives -- were all 
right, but the bland iceberg lettuce was bottomless. You could pour cups of 
dressing on it and wonder where it went. 
</P>
<P>
 I liked the Caesar salad ($7.95) much better. It came with a wedge of lemon 
and whole anchovies, just the way I like it. A fine hamburger, as big as the 
moon, came with giant French fries, mushy and crispy in all the right places. 
</P>
<P>
 When I saw it at a nearby table, I lusted after a sinfully decadent grilled 
pastrami melt. Returning another day for one of my own, I found it as 
glisteningly good as it looked. 
</P>
<P>
 After meals this size, even contemplating dessert seemed suicidal. But we 
tried. Although the cheesecake was somewhat ordinary, a humongous piece of 
carrot cake ($3.95) was astoundingly delicious, with light, superb frosting and 
moist layer upon layer of cake -- enough to sink a small rowboat. Details 
</P>
<P>

 Since joining Roger Keller's Restaurant in Ojai in February, chef Philippe 
Berger has been getting comfortable with the menu, taking it kind of slowly. 
But watch out, things are about to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted Philippe to learn what we're doing and be successful and then he 
can experiment. He can do whatever he wants," Keller said. "We usually change 
our menu every seven or eight months and it's about that time. We'll be working 
it over pretty soon." 
</P>
<P>
 So far the 30-year-old chef, who most recently was executive chef at El 
Encanto Hotel in Santa Barbara, has added one main dish to the menu. It's an 
angel hair pasta with roma tomatoes, roasted garlic, fresh basil, kalamata 
olives and grilled tofu. He has also lent his French training to the dessert 
list with some French tarts. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Keller's has been closed for weekday lunches while undergoing earthquake 
retrofitting, and Keller expects it to remain that way for another couple of 
months. But the restaurant is open for dinners every night and lunch on the 
weekends, and Keller said a shift toward Saturday and Sunday brunches may be in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't be surprised to find some fried chicken on the menu. "I have this 
chicken fryer and I was thinking of Mondays through Thursdays doing that and 
selling it kind of reasonably," Keller said. "It's not a French thing or 
anything, but you know. . . ." Roger Keller's is at 331 E. Ojai Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of quick updates: Mario's Bistro, located at Oxnard's Shopping at the 
Rose complex, opened June 23 (a tad behind schedule), with chef Neal Rosenthal 
in the kitchen. Meals are served beginning at 11 a.m., seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And as for the Glen Tavern Restaurant at Santa Paula's Glen Tavern Inn, things 
are pretty much on hold. Inn manager Sungshil Kang has plans to reopen the 
restaurant, which has been closed to the public for two years. He said he would 
like the restaurant to be up and running soon, but at this point there's little 
progress to report.

 ON TARGET: When local employment consultant Ruth Fassets calls companies about 
hiring the disabled, she says, "They usually talk about cutbacks or needing a 
fast worker." Officials at Target in Irvine were different, she notes: "They 
not only were enthusiastic, they set up working hours for one to accommodate 
his bus schedule." . . . . Result: the Irvine store will be honored today by 
the Orange County Employment Advocacy Network for "best innovation" in 
employing the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD POET SOCIETY: Comedy skits and lively Latino music will fill the air at 
La Casa Garia restaurant in Anaheim tonight. But its purpose is a serious one. 
. . . Edelmira Marin, 17, was just a few steps from her home in La Habra when 
she was fatally struck by a car two months ago. Her family, struggling 
financially, is still trying to pay off her funeral expenses. The Chicano Poet 
Society put together tonight's fund-raiser to help them. 
</P>
<P>
 OPRY STEPS: Ed Applegate of Laguna Hills jokes that he goes country dancing 
"about every night." It's paying off. . . . He and dance partner Tina Bright of 
Costa Mesa are Southern California winners of a free trip to Nashville, Tenn. 
They'll be finalists in the "Best Two-Stepping Couple in America" contest at 
Opryland. Bright and Applegate say they hadn't expected to win -- other couples 
had impressive, preset routines. "We just decided to have fun, and we clicked," 
Applegate says. "The judges liked that." 
</P>
<P>
 NOT SO FUNNY? It was a comedy team not meant to be. When John Wayne Bobbitt 
announced he wanted to try comedy, comedian Todd Glass, currently performing at 
the Brea Improv, was interested. Bobbitt gained notoriety after his wife, 
citing his physical abuse, cut off his penis. . . . "We wanted to do something 
clever with it; he would draw people," says Glass. Problem is, Bobbitt didn't 
want to be part of Glass' act, and negotiations broke down. Just as well, says 
Glass: "Comedy and wife abuse just don't go together."

 MAKEOVER: The waiting is over for the folks at the Crown Cork & Seal Co. 
beverage can plant in Van Nuys, and it was worth it. That's because the 
company's headquarters in Philadelphia will spend $37 million to rebuild the 
plant, which was damaged in the quake. . . . "It's great news," said plant 
manager Donald Queen. "There was no guarantee they wouldn't close it."

 EYE FOR EYE: Paddling vandals is getting a lot of publicity. In fact, a state 
Assembly committee Tuesday supported the idea. But Victor I. Reichman, a 
Superior Court commissioner of juvenile courts in Sylmar, suggests another 
punishment for graffiti vandals: spray-painting a minor's possessions -- with 
parental permission. . . . "Then he or she will feel what it is like to have it 
done to them," Reichman said. 
</P>
<P>
 TRYOUT: So what if the all-woman Colorado Silver Bullets (1-20) have been 
firing blanks all season? They're still in a league of their own, and plenty of 
women would love to join them. Sunday, in fact, 70 women attended a tryout 
(above) for next year's team. . . . "This is a chance of a lifetime," said 
former CSUN softball star Shannon Jones (C12).

 ON TRACK: The ride from Lancaster to Los Angeles is getting shorter and

a week after the Jan. 17 quake, took 2 hours and 25 minutes. But they've cut 30 
minutes off that, and hope to slice another 15. "We want to be in a situation 
where our travel times are competitive with the automobile," said Metrolink's 
Richard Stanger.

MENENDEZ JUDGE HINTS HE PREFERS SINGLE-JURY TRIAL; COURTS: DEFENSE LAWYERS 
REQUEST THAT THE BROTHERS BE TRIED SEPARATELY. WEISBERG POSTPONES A FINAL 
DECISION AND SETS ANOTHER HEARING FOR JULY 22.

<P>
 The judge in the Menendez brothers murder case signaled Wednesday that he 
wants Lyle and Erik Menendez to be tried together and before one jury unless he 
is given compelling reasons otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers told Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg on 
Wednesday that they want separate trials or, at the least, separate juries in 
the case of the brothers from Beverly Hills accused of murder in the Aug. 20, 
1989, shotgun slayings of their parents. The prosecution argued for one trial 
and a single jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg put off ruling until at least next month, ordering both sides to file 
more legal briefs on evidence they expect to be significant at the brothers' 
retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said: "This case can be tried with one jury. That's my impression." 
</P>
<P>
 At the brothers' first trial, which ended in January, Lyle and Erik Menendez 
told separate juries that they had killed their parents in the TV room of the 
family's Beverly Hills home.  
</P>
<P>
 They testified that they had lashed out in fear and self-defense after years 
of physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Prosecutors contended the brothers 
killed out of hatred and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 After a six-month trial, the separate juries, one for each brother, deadlocked 
between murder and manslaughter charges. Prosecutors immediately announced that 
they wanted a retrial and would again seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, remain in County Jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg had been due Wednesday to fix a date for the retrial, to decide 
whether the brothers will be tried together or apart, to decide between one 
jury or two if they are tried together and to decide whether the retrial will 
be held in Van Nuys or at another county courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 None of those issues were decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, after ordering more legal briefs, Weisberg set another hearing for 
July 22. But he said Wednesday that the two-jury system from the first trial 
produced many problems, and left him with such lingering concerns as the 
possible sequestering of one or both juries and the issue of keeping one jury's 
decision secret from another that is still in deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is this case should be tried by one jury instead of two juries 
unless there is some compelling reason there should be two juries," Weisberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers said the compelling reason was that one brother could suffer a 
spillover prejudicial effect during the penalty phase of the case -- if it got 
that far -- by testimony meant to apply only to the other brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty phase occurs only if a jury returns a verdict of first-degree 
murder. Then the jury must choose the penalty: the death penalty or life in 
prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Leslie Abramson, Erik Menendez's lead attorney, told Weisberg that 
she would not be ready to begin the retrial until Dec. 1. She said she has to 
try three other cases and then needs a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez's lawyers, Deputy Public Defenders Bill Weiss and Terri Towery, 
said they would not be ready until March. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors would be ready in December, Deputy Dist. Attys. David Conn and 
Carol Najera said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proceedings Wednesday were marked by sharp exchanges between the 
prosecution and the defense that revealed the animosity that already has 
developed between the two sides -- although Conn, Najera, Weiss and Towery have 
all been brought on since the end of the first trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss complained Wednesday to Weisberg that three recent letters to the 
prosecution had brought no response: "It's like we don't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Conn responded that phone calls from the defense to prosecution secretaries 
had been "extremely discourteous." 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful that the first trial was punctuated by jibes from prosecution and 
defense, Weisberg urged both sides to be civil with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as the hearing was breaking up, defense lawyers asked prosecutors for 
photocopies of hundreds of pages of transcripts from the first trial. 
Prosecutors responded that they didn't want to copy stacks of paper, especially 
since the defense already had access to the transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
 At that, Abramson said in a loud voice to Conn, "Why don't you stop being a 
wise guy and start acting like a lawyer?" 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg gaveled the hearing into session again, and ordered prosecutors to 
turn over the copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, speaking to reporters, Conn dismissed the back-and-forth as 
"animosities which attorneys generally put aside at some point." 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson, however, took a different tack. She called Conn and Najera "very 
immature people" and said they had been "extremely uncivil." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "I don't think you ever get the upper hand by behaving badly."

AUSTRIAN SLAYER OF L.A. PROSTITUTES KILLS SELF 
</P>

 Just hours after he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for 
strangling nine prostitutes in Austria and the Los Angeles area, an infamous 
author-inmate was found dead in his Austrian prison cell Wednesday, an apparent 
suicide victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Jack Unterweger, 43, was found hanging from a curtain rod, 
according to the Austrian Ministry of Justice. Officials said he apparently had 
used a cord from his jogging pants to hang himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Unterweger, whose autobiography had made him the darling of the Viennese cafe 
intellectual set and helped win him parole in 1990 from an earlier murder 
sentence, was found guilty Tuesday of nine more murders -- all of them 
committed while on parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said his latest victims included Shannon Exley, 35, Irene 
Rodriguez, 33, and Peggy Jean Booth, 26, all of whom were slain during the 
summer of 1991, when Unterweger was visiting Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial in Graz that concluded Tuesday, Unterweger maintained his 
innocence in the nine latest murders, begging the jury to spare him from a life 
behind bars. One of his defense lawyers, Hans Lehofer, said Unterweger "broke 
down inside" when he heard the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Unterweger, the son of an Austrian streetwalker and an American soldier, was 
raised among prostitutes in an Austrian village. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 25, he was arrested and charged with beating a prostitute and 
strangling her with her bra. Convicted of murder, he was sentenced to life in 
prison. He subsequently admitted the crime, explaining that "I envisioned my 
mother in front of me and I killed her." 
</P>
<P>
 While in prison, Unterweger wrote stories, plays and an autobiography. His 
widely publicized work won him the praise and support of his nation's literary 
elite. Hailed as a model of rehabilitation, he was released from prison in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Profitable offers poured in, and within months, Unterweger was wearing 
expensive suits, driving a flashy American convertible with personalized 
license plates and appearing regularly on television talk shows. But during 
those same months, prosecutors say, six more prostitutes in Austria were 
strangled, in most cases with their bras. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, hired to write articles about street crime for several Austrian 
magazines, Unterweger traveled to the United States, arriving in Los Angeles in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 During his visit, he wangled a ride in a Los Angeles Police Department patrol 
car, saying he was researching prostitution in the city. While he was here, 
three local prostitutes were strangled with their bras, the LAPD and the county 
Sheriff's Department realized later. 
</P>
<P>
 Exley's body was found June 20 on a brush-covered hillside on the shoulder of 
the Pomona Freeway in Boyle Heights. Rodriquez's was discovered June 30 beside 
a truck dock in Boyle Heights. The body of Booth, who also used the name Sherry 
Ann Long, was found July 10 in a rugged, brush-filled canyon in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Unterweger was not connected to the crimes, and he returned to 
Austria. When evidence linking him to the European slayings began to mount, 
police raided his apartment in Vienna. Unterweger, who reportedly had gotten 
word of the spreading investigation, could not be located. 
</P>
<P>
 Police eventually learned that he and his 18-year-old girlfriend had traveled 
to Switzerland, Paris and New York, pausing along the way to call newspapers 
and a popular Austrian television show to taunt officials and proclaim his 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in February, 1992, tracking a trail of credit card charges, agents from 
the U.S. Marshal's Office arrested Unterweger in Miami. He was subsequently 
extradited to Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Through Interpol -- the international police agency -- prosecutors in Austria 
talked with police and sheriff's deputies in Los Angeles, who soon became 
convinced that Unterweger was responsible for the slayings here. In August, he 
was indicted in Vienna in the slayings of 11 prostitutes, including the three 
in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Heimo Lambauer said that although there were no witnesses linking 
Unterweger to any of the killings, there was "an amazing similarity in the way 
the murders were committed." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Lambauer said, Unterweger's proximity to the crimes when they 
occurred was a matter of record. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday afternoon -- after a bomb planted by an unknown attacker damaged 
the courthouse, but caused no injuries and failed to delay final arguments -- a 
jury in Graz found Unterweger guilty of nine of the murders, acquitting him of 
the other two. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in a penitentiary for 
dangerous and psychologically disturbed convicts. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3:40 a.m. Wednesday, prison guards found him dead in his cell. Police said 
tape-recordings were found in the cell, but they declined to reveal the 
contents.

HEAT HAZARD; EXPERTS SAY HIGH TEMPERATURES HIT THE ELDERLY ESPECIALLY HARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 On days when the temperature rises to scorching and the two fans that he found 
in a trash bin can't cool his apartment, 74-year-old Lavhan Watson gets in his 
Buick, drives across the street and parks the car in the coolest spot he can 
find. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came over here just to get out of there," Watson said, standing in the 
shade of a sign on Sepulveda Boulevard across from his North Hills apartment. 
"It's hot in there -- plus I get claustrophobic." 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes the heat takes an even greater toll on him. "I get depressed 
awful easy," he said, sipping on a water bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical experts say older people are particularly vulnerable to extreme heat. 
The biggest danger is heatstroke, a sharp increase in body temperature that can 
lead to faintness, loss of consciousness or even death, said Dr. Richard 
Minter, director of geriatrics at Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the temperature rises, older people in particular should take 
precautions to avoid heatstroke and other heat-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty deadly if you aren't treated right away," Minter said. "The 
elderly have less margin of error for their physiology." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pacoima Multipurpose Senior Citizens Center, staff members have 
cautioned members about the heat and how to survive it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're encouraging them to keep calm, stay inside as much as possible and 
drink plenty of liquids," said the Rev. Alicia Broadous-Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the advice takes on greater importance to senior citizens using 
the Pacoima center because each day of searing heat forces them to make a 
difficult choice. 
</P>
<P>
 They can spend their days at the center, eating lunch, exercising, playing 
bingo with their friends -- and sweltering in rooms that aren't 
air-conditioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, they can stay alone in their homes -- cooler and more comfortable -- but 
without the camaraderie and activities they find at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather come up here than stay at home," said 82-year-old Sarah 
Casstevens, sitting at a lunch table Wednesday afternoon. "Why should I stay 
home and look at four walls? . . . It would be nice if we had air conditioning 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 But the heat may be keeping many more in their homes. At noon Wednesday, only 
seven people sat down in the lunchroom for a meal of roast beef, broccoli, 
mashed potatoes and lemon pudding. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally about 50 people show up to eat each day, site manager Virgia Bryant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The room where center members eat lunch is not air-conditioned, nor is the 
room that houses the center's day-care program for older people with 
Alzheimer's disease and dementia. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat was so bad one day, she sent everybody home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so unfair to this population," said Broadous-Duncan, her face glistening 
with sweat. "It's not conducive for them to come, but they come anyway because 
this is their outlet." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Don Jong, assistant emergency room chief at Kaiser Foundation Hospital in 
Woodland Hills, said persistent hot weather often aggravates the condition of 
people with health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 About five such patients a day have shown up at the hospital since the heat 
wave began. Authorities said they have seen few serious heat-related problems 
so far, but that could change if the heat continues. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pacoima center, workers and volunteers have phoned all homebound and 
particularly frail senior citizens to check on their conditions, 
Broadous-Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who attend the center will continue to choose between companionship and 
comfort for at least a few more weeks -- or until the heat spell ends. The 
center was scheduled to move into a new air-conditioned building this week, but 
because of building delays that date has been pushed back.

WOMAN BILLED $10,848 FOR HOMICIDE PROBE; POLICE: OFFICIALS CITE LAW ON MAKING 
HOMEOWNERS PAY FOR A SECOND RESPONSE TO ROWDY PARTIES. AN APPEAL IS UNDER WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When West Covina police responded to a complaint about a rowdy bachelor party 
in February, they issued their standard warning: Keep the noise down. A return 
visit would mean the homeowner had to pay for the police expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hours later, they returned. A 17-year-old party guest had been stabbed to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 When the promised bill arrived last month, it was for $10,848 to cover the 
entire cost of the homicide investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowner Louise Peery, who was not at the party held by her 22-year-old son, 
is appealing to the City Council. "I can't believe the city could be doing 
this," the 62-year-old bookkeeper said. "I can't afford this." 
</P>
<P>
 The practice of charging residents for repeated police visits to unruly 
parties became common several years ago as cities began looking for innovative 
ways to cover expenses. But the West Covina case brings the practice to an 
apparently unprecedented level. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of law enforcement agencies throughout Los Angeles County said 
they have never heard of anyone being billed for a criminal case or of a tab 
close to $10,000 for any police response. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we going to charge the Coliseum every time there's a stabbing in its 
driveway?" asks Los Angeles Police Officer George Villegas, the department's 
coordinator of complaints on loud parties. "We can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Los Angeles instituted its loud party ordinance in 1992, the largest 
bill issued has been for about $700, Villegas said, and there has never been a 
bill for a criminal investigation. He would reject any bill for such a large 
amount, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Responding as a result of a homicide has nothing to do with loud parties," 
Villegas said. 
</P>
<P>
 But West Covina City Atty. Elizabeth L. Hanna said her city's Police 
Department interpreted its police-billing ordinance properly. After the host of 
a noisy or unruly gathering is warned, the ordinance says, the city can charge 
for "special security assignment" of police. "I think what we did is 
justifiable," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many cities throughout Los Angeles County have a "second-response" law that 
allows police to bill for responding more than once to the scene of a nuisance. 
Some cities have maximum amounts -- often $500 or $1,000 -- they can charge 
property owners. The county allows the Sheriff's Department to recover 
reasonable costs in unincorporated areas. West Covina, like several other 
cities, does not have a limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Peery maintains that she should not have to pay anything because she was not 
responsible for what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 During the course of the evening, 16 patrol officers and 13 investigators were 
sent to the home to investigate the stabbing and subsequent death of 
17-year-old Daryl Smith, a West Covina High School student who was due to 
graduate this month. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Smith and another party-goer, Brian Stinson, 21, of 
Laguna Hills got into a fight over a tip for a stripper. Stinson put down a tip 
that Smith picked up, apparently intending to add to it, police said. Stinson 
thought Smith was trying to steal his money, police said, and the two fought. 
After the fight broke up, police said, Stinson attacked Smith with a knife, 
stabbing him 10 times. His trial on murder charges is scheduled for July 6.  
</P>
<P>
 Police contend that the party's rowdiness contributed to Smith's death; if the 
party had ended when police made their first visit, West Covina Police Chief 
John T. Distelrath said, there would have been no homicide and no expense to 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was needless. It didn't have to happen," Distelrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Louise Peery, a 35-year resident of the city, said she is not the one to 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't care about circumstance, about who is at fault," she said. "It's 
really scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Peery's son Dale said he had mailed out invitations to about 40 people and had 
told neighbors he was having a party. He also told neighbors that the music 
would end by 11 p.m. The band had stopped playing even earlier and the party 
was quiet when the stabbing occurred, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police paint a different picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "This wasn't just another everyday bachelor party," Distelrath said. Flyers 
were sent out and party-goers were charged a $10 entrance fee, he said. 
Underage people were drinking alcohol, strippers were present and no one took 
control of the party, the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bachelor party began about 7 p.m. on Feb. 12, on Indian Summer Avenue, a 
quiet cul-de-sac. About 9:50, a medical student on the next street called 
police, complaining about the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty minutes later, two officers met Dale Peery outside the home, which he 
shared with his mother; he has since moved out. He was issued a notice of legal 
and fiscal liability and was warned to shut down the party or risk a fine if 
the police came out again. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Peery said that he complied with police officers by telling the band to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12:05 a.m., he called police to tell them someone had been stabbed at his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "We responded with just about everything we had," said West Covina Police 
Cmdr. Jim Dillon, who said 11 patrol cars were immediately sent to the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Police concede that the billing is atypical. Normally, second-response bills 
cost the property owner about $600, Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, a bill doesn't involve a homicide," he said. "This was an unusual 
circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing West Covina's ordinance, USC law professor Michael H. Shapiro 
said the law is cryptic and the city's $10,000 bill "seems like a stretch."  
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look to me like this woman bore anything that looked like legal 
responsibility for this homicide," he said. "What's being done to her is a 
burden or a sanction that is disproportionate to anything she did." 
</P>
<P>
 West Covina's finance director takes a opposite view, saying it is an unfair 
burden on the taxpayer to absorb the cost for something a homeowner could have 
prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every city (that has such a code) is trying to recover the cost of services 
beyond the regular call of duty," said Abraham W. Koniarsky, the finance 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week took no action on her appeal, but Distelrath said 
he would meet with Peery to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The stabbing victim's parents, Linda and Martin Smith, said they agree with 
the city's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever lives in the house is responsible," she said. "It's a lot of money 
and she might not be able to afford it. But I'd rather have something to pay 
and still have a son."

CURFEW PLANNED IN HUNTINGTON PARK; WORLD CUP: THE CITY WILL ALSO DEPLOY EXTRA 
POLICE TUESDAY TO FORESTALL THE POSSIBILITY OF VIOLENCE AFTER MEXICO'S MATCH. 
CELEBRATING CROWDS HAVE TURNED UNRULY AFTER TWO GAMES. 
</P>

<P>
 Concerned about a pair of disturbances after Mexico's last two World Cup 
appearances, Huntington Park city officials are planning a 10 p.m. curfew and a 
heightened police presence when the Mexican team takes to the field again 
Tuesday in the second round of the monthlong tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ric Loya predicted that it will take the City Council "about 30 seconds" 
at its meeting today to declare a Tuesday night curfew, which would apply to 
adults and juveniles. In addition, he said, police will close off Pacific 
Boulevard, the main street along the city's central business district, 
beginning Tuesday morning -- even before Mexico's match in East Rutherford, 
N.J., is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities reported 17 arrests ranging from traffic violations to assault 
with a deadly weapon during a disturbance Tuesday afternoon and evening after 
Mexico's 1-1 tie with Italy -- a result that ensured the team's advance to the 
next round of World Cup play. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no major injuries reported in the 5,000-plus crowd, although 
paramedics were dispatched to assist a 3-year-old girl reportedly struck on the 
head by a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Looting was limited to a charity-run fireworks stand, which reported a loss of 
$10,000 in merchandise. The stand raised funds for Huntington Park's sister 
city program with Julian, Mexico, Police Lt. Stephen Peeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's particularly ironic a Mexican celebration would have a negative effect 
on a Mexican city," Peeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 law enforcement officers, many dressed in riot gear, were called 
in to control the crowd. About 2:30 p.m. officers fired several stingballs -- 
explosive devices that emit rubber pellets -- into the air.  
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Wednesday, Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block 
praised officers at the scene, including members of his department, for their 
early use of non-lethal weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing we have learned over the years," Block said "is when you have 
numbers of people seen together, whether in protest or in celebration . . . it 
doesn't take very much for that group to suddenly deteriorate and become a mob 
and become a riot, with looting and assault and everything else. You don't 
stand by and wait for that to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred officers will be ready Tuesday morning in anticipation of 
another Mexican victory, Peeler said. "I don't know what we'll do if they 
advance to the finals," he said. "It will certainly be interesting."  
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, a festive Huntington Park crowd of 5,000 turned violent, 
throwing rocks and bottles at police and firing guns into the air after 
Mexico's 2-1 win over Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Loya said Wednesday that Huntington Park has become a focal point for 
boisterous celebrations because of its hub-like, Latino-flavored shopping 
district and its large first-generation Mexican population. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Latino sales area is a mecca for southeast Los Angeles," Loya said. "And 
recent studies show that we have about a one-third transition population of 
recent arrivals from Mexico. They have a strong allegiance to Mexico and soccer 
is it there." 
</P>
<P>
 Fueling the crowds, Peeler added, were TV reports on Spanish-language stations 
about the initial celebration in Huntington Park. "The crowds were not that big 
to begin with, but once it was shown on TV, we suspect people sitting at home 
saying 'Gee, where should we go?' said, 'There's the place to go.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Several other smaller celebrations Tuesday night led to arrests in Pacoima, 
Santa Ana, East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pacoima area, a few members of a crowd at the intersection of Laurel 
Canyon and Van Nuys boulevards grew unruly and began throwing rocks and 
bottles. The situation led Los Angeles police to call a citywide modified 
tactical alert for more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Two officers suffered minor injuries. Three people were arrested for battery 
on a police officer, police spokesman Rigo Romero said.

HEAT TAKES TOLL ON YOUNG AND OLD; LANCASTER: A BABY SURVIVES AFTER BEING LEFT 
IN A CLOSED CAR IN THE SUN. DEPUTIES ARREST THE FATHER, WHO HAD GONE INTO A 
SHOP. 
</P>

<P>
 Despite sweltering temperatures that could have proven fatal, a 9-month-old 
infant survived seemingly unscathed when his father left him in a locked car in 
a parking lot with the windows rolled up. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies, notified by passersby, rescued the child by forcing open a 
door of the car parked in front of the Costco store. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby's father, William Lynch, 27, was taken into custody when he came out 
of the store and returned to the car. He was arrested on charges of child 
endangerment and taken to Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station where he was held 
on $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred at 11 a.m., when temperatures had already reached 100 
degrees. The midsize car where the infant was discovered was completely closed 
up and parked on asphalt in an area without trees or shade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The child was extremely hot, he was sweating profusely," said Fire Capt. 
Justin Demello. "Other than those two things he appeared to be in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 A Sheriff's Department report said the infant, who was taken to Antelope 
Valley Hospital for observation, is believed to have been locked in the car for 
at least 20 minutes before being rescued. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities did not know whether Lynch forgot his son was in the car or 
thought he could do his shopping so quickly that the child would not be 
affected by the extreme heat. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lynch returned to his car, Demello said, he simply identified himself as 
the boy's father and began crying. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Wamsley, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles SPCA/SouthernCalifornia Humane 
Society, said the temperature inside a car can soar to 160 degrees in just 10 
minutes, even when a window is cracked open. 
</P>
<P>
 Such temperatures could cause "permanent brain damage or even death," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car did not even have a covering over the front window, Demello said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a car is closed up there's no way for the heat to dissipate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the infant had been left in the car much longer, Demello said, the outcome 
could have been tragic. "It's just lucky someone saw the child in the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Other shoppers saw the child, who was crying in a car seat positioned behind 
the driver's seat, and called for help, according to the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 After a sheriff's deputy was able to open the car, Demello said, the fire crew 
immediately worked to lower the child's body temperature by putting cool water 
on him and then placing him in the back of an air-conditioned ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a fair-skinned child and he was beet red," Demello said. "One of the 
good things was that he was still sweating. When you get to the critical stage 
you're not sweating." 
</P>
<P>
 The infant was released to his mother, who came from the family's Acton home 
to retrieve him.

HEAT TAKES TOLL ON YOUNG AND OLD; WEATHER: THOUGH VULNERABLE TO HIGH 
TEMPERATURES, SOME SENIORS MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN COOL AIR AND COMPANIONSHIP. 
</P>

 On days like this, when the temperature rises to scorching and the two fans 
that he found in a dumpster can't cool his apartment, 74-year-old Lavhan Watson 
gets in his Buick, drives across the street and parks the car in the coolest 
spot he can find. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came over here just to get out of there," Watson said, standing in a 
parking lot on Sepulveda Boulevard, across from his North Hills apartment. 
"It's hot in there -- plus I get claustrophobic." 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes the heat takes an even greater toll on him. "I get depressed 
awful easy," he said, sipping on a water bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical experts say older people are particularly vulnerable to extreme heat. 
The biggest danger to the elderly is heat stroke, a sharp increase in body 
temperature that can lead to faintness, loss of consciousness or even death, 
said Dr. Richard Minter, director of geriatrics at Encino-Tarzana Regional 
Medical Center.  
</P>
<P>
 And as the temperature rises, older people in particular should take 
precautions to avoid heat stroke and other heat-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty deadly if you aren't treated right away," Minter said. "The 
elderly have less margin of error for their physiology." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pacoima Multipurpose Senior Citizens Center, staff members have 
cautioned members about the heat and how to survive it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're encouraging them to keep calm, stay inside as much as possible and 
drink plenty of liquids," said Rev. Alicia Broadous-Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, those words of advice take on greater importance to those seniors 
using the Pacoima center because each day of searing heat forces them to make a 
difficult choice: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They can spend their days at the center, eating lunch, exercising, playing 
bingo with their friends -- -- and sweltering in un-air-conditioned rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, they can stay alone in their homes -- cooler and more comfortable -- but 
without the camaraderie and activities they find at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather come up here than stay at home," said 82-year-old Sarah 
Casstevens, sitting at a lunch table Wednesday afternoon. "Why should I stay 
home and look at four walls. . .? It would be nice if we had air-conditioning 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 But the heat may be keeping many more in their homes. At noon Wednesday, only 
about seven people sat down in the lunch room for a meal of roast beef, 
broccoli, mashed potatoes and lemon pudding. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally about 50 people show up to eat each day, said site manager Virgia) 
Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too hot today," she said. "They're not coming out." 
</P>
<P>
 The room where center members eat lunch is not air-conditioned, nor is the 
room that houses the center's day-care program for older people with 
Alzheimer's and dementia. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have big fans but they're stirring up hot air," Broadous-Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
 And running the portable fans causes the power to go out periodically, she 
explained while sitting in a dark and very warm office. When the power goes 
out, the phones go too. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat was so bad one day, she sent everybody home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so unfair to this population," said Broadous-Duncan, her face glistening 
with sweat. "It's not conducive for them to come, but they come anyway because 
this is their outlet." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Don Jong, assistant emergency room chief at Kaiser Permanente hospital in 
Woodland Hills, said persistent hot weather often worsens the condition of 
people with existing problems like heart disease or diabetes, giving them 
additional symptoms such as chest pain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About five such patients a day have shown up at the hospital since the heat 
wave began. "Because of their debilitated status, you see them get tipped over 
the cliff with the added stress" of a heat wave, Jong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they have seen few serious heat-related problems so far, but 
that could change if the heat continues. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pacoima Center, workers and volunteers have phoned all homebound and 
particularly frail seniors to check on their conditions, Broadous-Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who attend the center will continue to choose between companionship and 
comfort for at least a few more weeks -- or until the heat spell ends. The 
center was scheduled to move into a new air-conditioned building this week, but 
because of building delays that date has been pushed back. 
</P>
<P>
 For seniors like Watson, however, staying cool -- and healthy -- boils down to 
the two salvaged fans he repaired, a Buick and a water bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Bout all I can do is find a shady place where it's cool," said the Texas 
native. "You just trying to run away from something when you know you can't."

OWNERS ORDERED TO SECURE QUAKE-DAMAGED BUILDINGS; AFTERMATH: MOVE IS PART OF 
L.A.'S STRATEGY TO RAZE OR REBUILD STRUCTURES THAT LURED TRESPASSERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the latest step in their attack on "ghost towns," city officials taped 
signs to cracked walls Wednesday, ordering apartment owners to secure their 
earthquake-damaged buildings before the city steps in. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is part of Los Angeles' strategy to either demolish or rebuild 
apartment buildings in areas where damaged and vacant units have attracted 
looters, prostitutes, drug dealers and other trespassers. The notices give 
owners five days to fence, board up or remove debris from their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners welcomed the step because the city, using federal funds, will secure 
buildings in the ghost towns -- 13 neighborhoods identified as areas of 
concentrated destruction -- if owners do not. 
</P>
<P>
 At a cluster of vacant apartment buildings near Hubbard Street in Sylmar, 
apartment and condominium owners said that in some cases vandals had caused 
more than twice as much damage as the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damage went from about $5,000 to $10,000 per unit, to something like 
$25,000 per unit," said Victor Nuguid, who owns six quake-damaged and now 
vacant buildings on Hubbard Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the six buildings Nuguid owns was made uninhabitable by the quake. 
Now, each has been broken into by thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of his units, intruders ripped up a section of the living room floor 
and built a huge bonfire. The blaze threatened to engulf the building before 
firefighters put it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Nuguid's buildings, thieves broke sliding glass doors or kicked 
holes in walls to get into apartments, where they stole everything from the 
copper piping on water heaters to sofa beds and refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had everything boarded up, but they just kept breaking in," Nuguid said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while touring the neighborhood Wednesday, officials from the city's 
departments of housing and building and safety maintained that the program to 
secure the buildings was not too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized this was a citywide problem, but it took us this long to map it 
out," said Robert Moncrief, director of the city Housing Department's Major 
Projects Division. "So taking this step now ends the chance that there will be 
a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first step is to stop the vandalism so we can keep the buildings from 
being further devastated." 
</P>
<P>
 For the cost of securing, policing and clearing rubble away from the 13 ghost 
towns that contain 6,000 housing units around the city, a task force identified 
about $240 million in local and federal money that had been set aside for other 
uses. A key role in obtaining those funds was played by Federal Emergency 
Management Agency Director James Witt, who agreed to contribute to the security 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Small Business Administration agreed to review 28,000 disaster 
loan applications that were denied or withdrawn and give top priority to loan 
requests from property owners in ghost towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Moncrief said that after the buildings are secure, the city will make loans to 
owners of quake-damaged complexes and press financial institutions to do 
likewise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've contacted all the mortgage holders on the street, and we're hopeful we 
can work out some arrangement so the situation doesn't get any worse," Moncrief 
said about the Sylmar neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Moncrief said the process will be complicated, however, because the Sylmar 
ghost town involves 13 apartment or condominium complexes, 27 owners and 22 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pam Nelson, who owns a condo at the red-tagged El Dorado Avenue Townhomes, 
said she was happy about the government attention anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past several months, she has watched her abandoned home become a 
haven for prostitutes, pimps, drug users and gang members with an affinity for 
marking indoor walls. A $1,500 chain-link fence did little to keep them out, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working six months so we could get more security here," Nelson 
said. "This is a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Pausing and pointing out a section of dead grass that used to be green and a 
weather-beaten couch dumped in front of her building, she said: "I really used 
to like living here. I guess it's hard to believe that now."DISASTER VICTIMS

EDELMAN ELECTED CHAIRMAN OF MTA; POLITICS: SUPERVISOR WILL SERVE UNTIL HIS 
YEAR-END RETIREMENT. ANTONOVICH IS PICKED TO SUCCEED HIM. HE SOUGHT TO TAKE JOB 
IMMEDIATELY. 
</P>

<P>
 In a compromise over who should hold one of the region's most powerful 
political posts, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board Wednesday 
elected Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman as its next chairman, picking 
fellow Supervisor Mike Antonovich to succeed him after his retirement in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich had angled to take over the job immediately, lobbying board members 
to bypass the usual rotation and install him as the next chairman over Edelman. 
But observers said a lack of votes forced Antonovich to accept a compromise 
that would allow him to serve out the remainder of Edelman's one-year term as 
chairman, which begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairmanship is one of the county's most important positions, with the 
power to direct the $2.9-billion agency's agenda for the coming year, including 
the fate of proposed bus fare hikes, labor negotiations and mammoth public 
works projects, such as a rail line spanning the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich said the vote to appoint him now as Edelman's successor was 
important for continuity's sake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good compromise," he said. "We need to have a full team working 
together. You have everybody here right now." 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Gloria Molina, who voted against Antonovich, disagreed, saying 
the Board of Supervisors should decide later who among its members would 
replace Edelman. Under MTA rules governing the tenure of its officers, the 
county board has the right to hold the chairmanship for the entire year. 
</P>
<P>
 To select Antonovich now "is totally inappropriate," said Molina, who in a 
rare appearance at Wednesday's MTA meeting, unsuccessfully sought to postpone 
the vote on Edelman's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 The dual election of Edelman, who is vacationing in Europe, and Antonovich 
effectively shuts out the possibility of Supervisor-elect Zev Yaroslavsky 
assuming the post as one of the duties he will take over from Edelman. 
Yaroslavsky, now an alternate on the MTA board as a Los Angeles city 
councilman, said he did not want the job, but criticized Antonovich for trying 
to depose Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't seeking the chairmanship," he said. "I have plenty on my plate 
without running this organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich's intervention in the normal course of succession made the MTA 
appear like a "Wild West saloon" run by whim, without regard for proper 
procedure, Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't speak well of Mike Antonovich . . . that (he) would try to pull 
such a banana republic type of stunt." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Antonovich had pushed to have himself elected chairman 
immediately, without the wait until Edelman's retirement. His office had put on 
the MTA board's agenda an item calling for an amendment to current succession 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 But the item was effectively withdrawn when it became apparent Antonovich 
could not muster enough votes to muscle Edelman aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We beat that," said one MTA official who asked not to be identified. Several 
of the board members had already declared their support for Edelman, and "they 
weren't going to renege on their commitments," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Antonovich and Edelman have clashed on the design and route of a 
planned east-west Valley rail line. Edelman has advocated a subway paralleling 
Burbank and Chandler boulevards, while Antonovich has pressed for an elevated 
line straddling the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter comes before the board later this summer -- during Edelman's tenure 
as MTA chairman -- when cost analyses of the two proposals will be presented. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials predicted that Antonovich would try to delay a final vote on the 
issue until he takes the gavel, but the supervisor said he was confident an 
elevated rail line would be found to cost less and would win the board's 
backing on that basis alone. 
</P>
<P>
 As the new chairman, replacing Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre, 
Edelman will have other matters requiring immediate attention, such as a 
proposed 25-cent increase in bus fares recommended to help erase the MTA's 
$126-million operating shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The board had been scheduled to vote on the highly controversial plan 
Wednesday, but deferred action until next month -- partly to turn its full 
attention to the succession flap but also to give members more time to weigh 
the issue, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA is also locked in fractious negotiations with its biggest union, 
representing 4,400 bus and train drivers, whose three-year contract expires 
today. Last week, the union rank and file overwhelmingly voted to authorize its 
leadership to call a strike if talks fail. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a three-member investigative board appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson 
heard testimony that a bus drivers' strike would cripple the region. It will 
report on the status of negotiations to the governor within a week. The report 
will probably move Wilson to seek a 60-day restraining order against any job 
action to let talks continue -- standard procedure in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA has already produced a contingency plan for supervisors and non-union 
employees to operate buses and trains in the event of a strike. The MTA board 
ratified the plan Wednesday.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; FAMILY OFFERS REWARD IN GUARD'S SLAYING

 The family of an unarmed security guard who was shot to death at a popular 
Burbank watering hole in May is offering a $5,000 reward for information 
leading to the conviction of a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter H. Thomas III, 44, had worked at Stuart Anderson's Black Angus 
restaurant for about four months when he was killed while patrolling the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if we'll ever really be able to get over it," said Thomas' 
father, Walter Thomas Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The May 6 shooting was preceded by at least two fights and three arrests, 
according to police and witnesses. It prompted Black Angus management to change 
the restaurant's dress code, music format and drink specials, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men were arrested in connection with the shooting, but charges were never 
filed against them for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still being actively investigated," said Police Lt. Larry Koch. "We sure 
need any information. We just don't have enough evidence right now to get a 
case filed with the district attorney." VIVIEN LOU CHEN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LANCASTER; BABY RESCUED 
FROM LOCKED CAR; FATHER IS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite sweltering temperatures that could have proved fatal, a 9-month-old 
infant survived seemingly unscathed after his father left him in a locked car 
in a parking lot with the windows rolled up. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies, notified by passersby, rescued the child by forcing open a 
door of the car parked in front of a Costco store. 
</P>
<P>
 The infant's father, William Lynch, 27, was arrested on suspicion of child 
endangerment and taken to Antelope Valley sheriff's station, where he was held 
in lieu of $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred at 11 a.m., when temperatures had already reached 100 
degrees. The mid-size car where the infant was discovered was completely closed 
and parked in an area without trees or shade. The infant, who was taken to 
Antelope Valley Hospital for observation, is believed to have been locked in 
the car for at least 20 minutes. The infant was released to his mother.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; GRAFFITI-SPANKING BILL CLEARS COMMITTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state Assembly bill that would allow judges to order parents to spank 
juvenile graffiti vandals with a hardwood paddle in a public courtroom has 
passed its first hurdle in the Assembly Public Safety Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members voted 4 to 1 this week to approve the measure, known as 
Assembly Bill 150.The bill was drafted by Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) 
and co-authored by Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale). 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, drafted in response to what Conroy characterized as "public 
outrage over an explosion of graffiti," will travel next week to the Assembly 
Ways and Means Committee.  
</P>
<P>
 The measure is far from becoming law, however, as it must receive the go-ahead 
from the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, the entire Assembly and Senate, and 
then signed into law by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 If it passes, the bill would mark the first time any United States lawmaker 
has successfully introduced corporal-punishment legislation in this century, 
said Conroy spokesman Chris Manson. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would require youths under the age of 18 who are convicted of 
graffiti vandalism to receive from four to 10 whacks with an 18-inch-long, 
6-inch-wide and 3/4-inch-thick wood paddle from their parents in front of a 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 If the parents refuse to punish their child, the judge can order the bailiff 
to administer the spanking. The bill would also require court officials to 
release the names of convicted vandals to the public. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PANORAMA CITY; PROGRAM AIMS TO KEEP YOUTHS OFF THE STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tucked away in a converted apartment is the other side of Blythe Street, where 
young residents are working to tear down the neighborhood's crime-ridden image 
and create their own futures. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers -- as many as 50 from the Blythe Street neighborhood -- have 
been meeting for the last two months, planning trips and events, organizing car 
washes and playing softball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people come and look at the negative points of Blythe Street, not the 
positives," said Danny Aristega, one of the group's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which meets Wednesday afternoons, is part of a joint program 
operated by Friday Night Live, run by the Los Angeles County Office of 
Education, and the San Fernando Valley Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're walking these kids through a rough part of their lives," said Albert 
Melena, neighborhood specialist for the partnership, who started helping the 
kids as a volunteer coach for football and basketball games.  
</P>
<P>
 The partnership has acquired $10,000 in federal grants to help pay for the 
group's activities, which also may include neighborhood beautification 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers meet with Melena and Abel Sedillo Jr. of Friday Night Live in 
one of three apartments converted in December into the local offices for a 
Blythe Street project run by the Immaculate Heart of Mary order of nuns. 
</P>
<P>
 The project brings a wide range of social service agencies into the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are top-notch kids," said Sister Anne Regan, director for the IHM 
Blythe Street project. "I've worked in many areas of Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. These are basically good kids. They want to go to college, and they 
are all dying to work this summer. They know the gang kids, but they leave them 
in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest problems for the neighborhood is that there simply has not 
been enough to do, Sedillo said.  
</P>
<P>
 Friday Night Live and the San Fernando Valley Partnership work to stop alcohol 
and drug abuse. "But instead of just preaching don't do this and that, we give 
them what they can do," Sedillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, one or two kids who have been involved in the program have gone back 
to hanging out with their gang friends again, Melena said. But they still have 
an open invitation to come back, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are changing a lot," said Maria Soriano, the mother of two of the 
teen-agers in the program. "I'm sure everything can be better." ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; FREE PARKING OFFERED AS PROJECT CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting next week, the city of Los Angeles will provide 120 free parking 
spaces to temporarily replace public spaces eliminated by the construction of a 
senior citizen housing project in Sherman Oaks, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The replacement parking will be available from Tuesday through Nov. 23 at La 
Reina Fashion Plaza, located on the 14600 block of Ventura Boulevard, across 
the street from the proposed Dickens Senior Citizen Housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose district includes Sherman Oaks, said he and 
the project developer are looking for another parking site for the period 
between Nov. 23 and the anticipated completion of the project in June, 1995. 
The nonprofit housing center will include a 206-space parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago when the plaza was proposed, the city's Department of Transportation 
ordered the developer to widen Ventura Boulevard by 370 feet west of Van Nuys 
Boulevard. The widening was ordered to allow for the addition of double 
left-turn lanes on east-bound Ventura to north-bound Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents and merchants opposed the improvement, saying they didn't 
want to lose sidewalks that would have to be removed to permit the widening. 
</P>
<P>
 As a resolution, Yaroslavsky said he is instructing the Department of 
Transportation to widen Ventura by just 150 feet and only on one side of the 
boulevard in front of a gas station. The modification will allow for the 
addition of the additional left-turn lane but will remove little walkway. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements are expected to be completed by this fall. HUGO MARTIN

<P>
 The Broadway store in Sherman Oaks Fashion Square will reopen Saturday, nearly 
six months after being damaged by the Northridge earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Only the first two floors will be open to customers, while reconstruction 
continues on the third floor, said store manager David Richards.The third floor 
will reopen later this year.  
</P>
<P>
 The store will officially reopen at 10 a.m. after a ribbon-cutting ceremony. 
Festivities will include live music, free make-overs and golf tips in the men's 
accessories department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're as excited as the customers to get the store opened," said Richards. 
"We've thoroughly recarpeted and relighted the whole store. It's much 
brighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to the store in the Fashion Square mall at 14060 Riverside Drive was 
caused mainly by water after the Jan. 17 temblor set off the store's sprinkler 
system, Richards said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bill Ihle, a spokesman for the parent company, Broadway Stores Inc. in Los 
Angeles, could not provide an estimate of repair costs. ERIC SLATER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PUBLIC REMINDED OF BAN ON FIRECRACKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the long Fourth of July weekend approaches, fire officials warned residents 
that possession of firecrackers within city limits is illegal and punishable 
with jail time and / or stiff fines. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been illegal to use sparklers and other firecrackers in the city for 
more than three decades, said Fire Marshal Mike Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are cited with misdemeanor firecracker use violate provisions of the 
city's Health & Safety code. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said they will have additional personnel on duty this weekend 
because traditionally many residents violate the city's ban on fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Those caught using fireworks could face up to one year of jail time in Los 
Angeles County Jail, and / or a fine not less than $500 and not more than 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials suggest residents attend area fireworks displays to celebrate 
the Fourth of July. For celebration locations, call 1-800-900-FIRE. JENNIFER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
$148.6-MILLION CONTRACT AWARDED IN PORT PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Harbor Commission awarded a $148.6-million contract 
Wednesday for what it described as the largest dredging and landfill project in 
the nation, one that will create nearly a mile of new berths for the Port of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The awarding of contracts to a joint venture of Great Lakes Dredging & Dock 
Co. and Connolly-Pacific Co. was able to proceed after the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers approved permits for the dredging of three miles of new navigation 
channels.The corps also agreed to pay $60 million of the initial cost of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year dredging project will begin in August and create 4,200 jobs, 
according to port officials. It will also form a new, 265-acre land mass south 
of Pier 300 on Terminal Island that will be dubbed Pier 400.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
JUDGES MEET TO REVIEW MTA LABOR DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three retired state judges met Wednesday to review a labor dispute involving 
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and two unions. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit agency's contracts with the United Transportation Union and the 
Transportation Communications Union expire today. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges were appointed to the Board of Investigation by Gov. Pete Wilson 
after the unions requested the governor's involvement in efforts to resolve 
contract negotiations with the transit agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to avoid a strike, either management of a public transit agency 
or a labor union in contract negotiations can request the governor's assistance 
under the state Labor Code. After conducting public hearings, the Board of 
Investigation has until Wednesday to issue a report to Wilson. No strike or 
walkout can occur during their review.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MEN'S 
SENTENCING SET IN HEALTH CARE FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Russian immigrants who may have pulled off the largest health care scam in 
U.S. history are scheduled for sentencing by a federal judge Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Smushkevich is a graduate of Moscow's Missile Construction Institute 
and reportedly has been linked to the KGB and Russian organized crime.He 
pleaded guilty March 16, 1993, to mail and wire fraud, money laundering, 
embezzlement and other charges.  
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Lee Michaelson said the amount of loss Smushkevich 
stipulated to as part of the guilty pleas was more than $80 million. 
Smushkevich, who is representing himself, was supposed to have been sentenced 
Monday, but he asked for more time. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogich Jovovich, a doctor who managed medical diagnostic clinics for 
Smushkevich, also will be sentenced Sept. 19. Prosecutors said he set up the 
shell corporations through which fraudulent billings were made. 
</P>
<P>
 David Smushkevich, Michael's brother and a former Soviet doctor never licensed 
to practice medicine in the United States, is scheduled for sentencing July 11. 
The men billed insurance firms for sophisticated diagnostic tests performed on 
people who were contacted by phone and told that the exams were either free or 
offered for a nominal charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants falsified medical records to create the impression that the 
patients suffered from various illnesses and required the tests, prosecutors 
said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DEPUTY 
GETS PROBATION FOR SEX WITH INMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former sheriff's deputy who admitted having sex with a woman prisoner at a 
courthouse has been sentenced to community service rather than jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Wayne Fraize, 43, was ordered this week to perform 200 hours of 
community service and serve three years felony probation.He must also pay a 
$900 fine. Superior Court Judge Judy Champagne said a 180-day jail sentence 
would be imposed if Fraize violates his probation. 
</P>
<P>
 After Fraize waved his right to a jury trial, he was found guilty of two 
counts of oral copulation. "It's an appropriate punishment," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Alan Yochelson said. "We were not able to demonstrate that Fraize used force or 
coercion." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1993, Fraize was arrested after he was caught on a surveillance 
videotape receiving oral sex from a female inmate in a holding tank at the Van 
Nuys court. A 10-minute portion of the tape also showed the inmate engaging in 
sex with another female prisoner while Fraize watched.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman told investigators that she was not forced to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraize's lawyer, Paul Kinion, plans to appeal the conviction.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: TEACHERS SELECTED FOR CHEMISTRY WORKSHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four San Fernando Valley high school teachers are among 20 educators from nine 
states selected to participate this week in an Occidental College workshop on 
teaching the daily life applications of chemistry.  
</P>
<P>
 The workshop, sponsored by the American Chemical Society, helps science 
teachers develop an instructional plan for high school students who will 
probably not study science in college.The course material and the laboratory 
activities emphasize how chemistry can play a part in the experiences of the 
average person. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the teachers may have students take water samples from their 
house and test it for lead. Instructors also may talk about the health hazards 
of pesticides that can show up in food.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the newspaper, we are reading about toxic waste, environmental hazards, 
ozone layers, pollution of the bay," said Frances B. Hill, media director of 
Occidental College. "(The program) empowers the teacher to pass on base 
knowledge to students and hopefully interest them in keeping current with 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers who received fellowships to attend the workshop include Kate Smirnoff 
and Richard Buck, Louisville High School, Woodland Hills; Sandra Rallis 
Comouche, Notre Dame High School, Sherman Oaks, and Emily Smith of Burroughs 
High School in Burbank. KAY HWANGBO

MTA ELECTS EDELMAN IN LEADERSHIP COMPROMISE; TRANSIT: AFTER FAILING TO MUSTER 
ENOUGH VOTES TO TAKE POST NOW, SUPERVISOR MIKE ANTONOVICH WILL GET JOB WHEN 
BOARD CHAIRMAN RETIRES IN DECEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a compromise over who should hold one of the region's most powerful 
political posts, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board on Wednesday 
elected Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman as its next chairman, picking 
fellow Supervisor Mike Antonovich to succeed him after his retirement in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich had angled to take over the job immediately, lobbying board members 
to bypass the usual rotation and install him as the next chairman over Edelman. 
But observers said a lack of votes forced Antonovich to accept a compromise 
that would allow him to serve out the remainder of Edelman's one-year term as 
chairman, which begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman has the power to direct the $2.9-billion agency's agenda for the 
coming year. That agenda includes proposed bus fare increases, labor 
negotiations and mammoth public works projects, such as a rail line spanning 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich said the vote to appoint him as Edelman's successor is important. 
"We need to have a full team working together," he said. "You have everybody 
here right now." 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Gloria Molina, who voted against Antonovich, disagreed, saying 
the Board of Supervisors should decide Edelman's successor later. 
</P>
<P>
 The dual election of Edelman, who is vacationing in Europe, and Antonovich 
effectively shuts out the possibility of Supervisor-elect Zev Yaroslavsky 
assuming the post as one of the duties he will take over from Edelman. 
Yaroslavsky, now an alternate on the MTA board as a Los Angeles city 
councilman, said he did not want the job, but criticized Antonovich for trying 
to depose Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't seeking the chairmanship," he said. "I have plenty on my plate 
without running this organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich's intervention in the normal course of succession demonstrates that 
he lacks regard for proper procedure, Yaroslavsky said. "It didn't speak well 
of Mike Antonovich . . . that (he) would try to pull such a banana republic 
type of stunt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Antonovich had pushed to have himself elected chairman 
immediately, without the five-month wait until Edelman's retirement. His office 
had put on the MTA board's agenda an item calling for an amendment to current 
succession rules. 
</P>
<P>
 But the item was effectively withdrawn when it became apparent that Antonovich 
could not muster enough votes to muscle Edelman aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We beat that," said one MTA official who asked not to be identified. Several 
of the board members already had declared their support for Edelman, and "they 
weren't going to renege on their commitments," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the new chairman, replacing Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre, 
Edelman will have to deal with a proposed 25-cent increase in bus fares 
recommended to help erase the MTA's $126-million operating shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The board had been scheduled to vote on the highly controversial plan 
Wednesday, but deferred action until next month -- partly to turn its full 
attention to the issue of succession but also to give members more time to 
weigh the matter, officials said.

ACTIVIST URGES RIORDAN CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A local transit activist on Wednesday urged California's political ethics 
agency to investigate Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan for championing a rail 
project that has benefited a company in which the mayor holds a $9.75-million 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The request for investigation was made by John Walsh, a Los Angeles 
schoolteacher who has frequently criticized rail construction spending by the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Citing a Times article last Sunday that 
reported Riordan's actions, Walsh sought the investigation in a letter to the 
chairman of the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan has said he had no idea his actions, taken in August, would affect the 
company, Pasadena-based Tetra Tech Inc. He had no knowledge that Tetra Tech did 
any business with the MTA, Riordan said, until The Times asked him about it 
last week.  
</P>
<P>
 The mayor, who is the No. 2 shareholder in Tetra Tech, declined Wednesday to 
comment regarding the request for an investigation as he left a meeting of the 
transit authority board. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing policy, representatives of the Fair Political Practices Commission said 
they were not at liberty to discuss Walsh's letter. The commission enforces and 
interprets California's conflict-of-interest law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times article reported that Riordan won approval in August for an 
amendment to the MTA budget that provided $97 million for the rail project 
connecting Downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena. At the time, funding of the 
proposed Pasadena line was a matter of intense controversy because of the MTA's 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to a $170-million capital budget deficit and a $126-million operating 
shortfall, MTA officials had recommended postponing or killing the 13.6-mile 
project. In August, with the viability of the Pasadena line in question, 
Riordan introduced and won passage for his amendment, which provided funding 
for engineering services, real estate acquisitions and preliminary 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Within seven weeks of that vote, Tetra Tech got the first $267,000 of its 
payments under an engineering contract it had received in June, 1993, one month 
before Riordan took office. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and an aide, lawyer David Michaelson, said last week that although the 
amendment provided funding for the work, there was no violation of law because 
the amendment did not award a contract to Tetra Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Fair Political Practices Commission have said that 
state law prohibits officials from participating in any decision that can 
financially affect their personal investments. For Riordan, the test would be 
whether he reasonably should have known that his actions in August would affect 
Tetra Tech, according to legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan placed his investments in a blind trust upon entering office last 
July. Because of the trust, Riordan has said, he had no way of knowing whether 
he still owned Tetra Tech stock. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the mayor has explained that Riordan would be informed of the 
sale of any securities he held before the formation of the blind trust. Riordan 
also has signed financial disclosure forms, in April and last July, 
acknowledging ownership of the Tetra Tech stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan has said he introduced the amendment to resolve a dispute on the MTA 
board.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: TEEN PARENTS WARN OTHERS OF REALITIES OF SEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a time when Adan Chamul would do anything to get a girl to fall for 
a line. His friends told him it was the thing to do and they liked to go to 
junior high schools where their luck was the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Adan was at Pacoima Junior High School on Monday, but with a very different 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to tell girls not to fall for the guys' lines," said Adan, 18, and 
now the father of a baby girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a program run by El Nido Family Services, which has an office in 
Pacoima, eight teen-age parents -- seven girls and Adan -- have been visiting 
junior high schools in the northeast San Fernando Valley to give the younger 
students the benefit of their experience.  
</P>
<P>
 Since February, they have been trying to shatter the fantasy of having sex by 
talking to 1,700 students in health classes and assemblies about the realities 
of family conflicts, the pain of labor and the constant nights of broken sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief introduction by Alexandra Tobeck of El Nido, Adan and 
17-year-old mother Karen Johnson of Panorama City sat side by side in front of 
a health class of about 20 students. They spoke plainly about how their lives 
have been forever changed since they became parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost all my friends when I got pregnant," said Karen, who had a baby boy 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't regret not having an abortion," she said. "I regret having sex at an 
early age. I sometimes regret not thinking about adoption, and giving him a 
better life than I had." 
</P>
<P>
 But Karen has kept the baby, perhaps out of stubbornness. Participating in the 
panel with other teen parents has helped her to look at her life more closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "It taught me to really think about what I'm doing," Karen said. 
</P>
<P>
 What Adan and Karen had to say had a big impact on the class, said teacher 
Cornelia Romey. The quiet that fell over the room as the two told their story 
was unusual. The students were paying attention, shyly raising their hands to 
ask questions throughout the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine having to go home today and tell your parents, 'Oh, by the 
way, I'm pregnant,' " Tobeck asked. The entire class gasped. One student made a 
clicking noise with his mouth, like a shotgun being loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think having a baby is worse than dying," Karen Rivas, 17, of Panorama 
City, told another of Romey's classes.  
</P>
<P>
 She said she was in labor five days before giving birth to a daughter, now 1 
year and 10 months old. "It hurts so much you can't even breathe," Karen Rivas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobeck cautions that not just one talk can change someone's opinion about sex. 
But she said surveys and letters written to the teen-age parents have shown 
that the frank discussions have an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that at this age you don't have to have sex to have fun," one 
student wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I really don't want to have sex until I'm married," wrote another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many see only the 'romance' of a doll-like baby, not the hardships which will 
take over their lives," a Pacoima Junior High School teacher wrote. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; DISTRICT OKS BUDGET WITHOUT MAJOR CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in five years, the Las Virgenes Unified School District 
Board of Trustees has approved a budget without major cuts or class size 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we will not have to make additional cuts for the next three 
years," said district Assistant Supt.Donald Zimring. "Then, we might be able to 
add things that were cut back to the budget at a modest rate." 
</P>
<P>
 The $42-million spending plan approved at a regular board meeting Tuesday 
night also includes the establishment of a fund to bring down the number of 
students per class at the middle school and high school levels. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only about $12,000 has been raised from corporations, individuals and 
others. But that could change dramatically, Zimring said, if the state relaxes 
restrictions on the way school districts transfer funds between spending 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $40,000 was set aside for increased campus security. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimring said the brighter economic picture this year is due, in part, to a 
windfall in state funding held from 1991. Also, the district's enrollment was 
150 students higher than expected last fall, bringing in more state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The prestigious Las Virgenes district, which serves more than 10,000 students 
between the city of Los Angeles and the Ventura County line, was forced to 
raise class size limits at middle and high schools last year from about 36 to 
about 40 students. KURT PITZER

 U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich has announced that the Clinton 
Administration will increase funding for displaced workers in California from 
$59 million to $158 million, which will go toward facilities such as the 
Glendale Community College's adult training center. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase did not come as surprise for center officials, who heard the news 
first-hand Wednesday afternoon as Reich used their operation as a backdrop for 
the announcement.But the increase was significantly larger than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Reich and gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown met with a 
small roomful of job recruiters, students, staff and graduates of the center, 
located at 1122 E. Garfield Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The cabinet official hailed the site as one of the most advanced facilities 
for displaced workers in the country, offering a variety of classes, 
state-of-the-art computers and low registration fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, all we need is a governor who's really our partner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, state treasurer and the Democratic nominee for governor, used the visit 
as an opportunity to show concern for displaced workers in an uncertain job 
market, and to highlight the role she played in opening the center with state 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale center serves 600 to 800 students over the age of 18 who study 
English and office skills, among other things. Many are unemployed or thinking 
about switching jobs. Center officials boast of an 85 to 90% job placement 
rate. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CONEJO VALLEY; TELECOMMUNICATIONS CENTER SLATED FOR '95

 Thousand Oaks will soon boast the state's first telecommunications test 
center, a high-tech research facility that will offer residents the chance to 
consult doctors, question teachers or train employees simply by tapping a few 
computer keystrokes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pilot project administered by Caltrans, the federal government will put 
up $1.2 million for an Advanced Telecommunication Center designed to evaluate 
the practical applications of emerging technology. 
</P>
<P>
 By stacking the center with dozens of cutting-edge programs, Caltrans 
officials hope to make it easy for residents to transact daily business through 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Caltrans wants to persuade residents to go on-line rather than on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, teen-agers might be able to view the hottest fashions by tapping into a 
computer video hooked up to the mall. Families might be able to organize 
virtual-reality reunions with distant relatives. And accountants might be able 
to check their clients' books through the magic of video conferencing. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will contribute $14,000 to the telecommunications center, plus space 
at the Civic Arts Plaza now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Slated to open early next year, the Advanced Telecommunications Center will 
feature several components. Most will be set up in the Civic Arts Plaza, but 
officials also envision some mobile units that will travel to classrooms, 
businesses or individual homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The telecommunications center will include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A teleconference room allowing business people to hold cross-country or 
overseas meetings through video screens, providing their contacts have access 
to compatible software. 
</P>
<P>
 * A mobility management program offering up-to-the-minute information, in both 
English and Spanish, on traffic, road conditions and public transit options. 
</P>
<P>
 * A job training center allowing business owners to teach their employees at 
various sites through a single video program. STEPHANIE SIMON

ART, POLITICS MESH IN TEEN ANTI-VIOLENCE PLAN; CRIME: NEW GRANTS HELP TEACH 
GANG MEMBERS HOW TO USE THE BALLOT BOX AND CREATIVITY INSTEAD OF HOSTILITY.

 Betting that paintbrushes and petitions can persuade teen-agers to lay down 
guns and knives, a Woodland Hills-based health foundation has awarded $700,000 
to community groups that work with gang members in the crime-torn Blythe Street 
and Delano Street areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Van Nuys neighborhoods are the only ones in the San Fernando Valley to 
benefit from grants from the California Wellness Foundation, which is spending 
$24 million on violence prevention throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really unique and interesting project," said Crystal Hayling, program 
officer for the Wellness Foundation, which was created two years ago by Health 
Net as part of a state-brokered deal that allowed the Woodland Hills health 
maintenance organization to drop its nonprofit status. "It's really looking at 
a community that is underserved and affected by violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Community Youth Gang Services, the lead organization in the four-year project, 
plans to reduce youth and sexual violence by encouraging teen-agers and adults 
to take charge of their crime-plagued neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Through discussion groups in schools and voter registration and education 
efforts, the project's directors aim to mobilize residents to fight violence at 
home, at school and on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The areas selected are some of the poorest and most overcrowded in the city 
of Los Angeles, where violence is endemic," said project coordinator Anthony 
Borbon. "We looked at this as an opportunity to get involved in the root causes 
of the violence." Part of the grant will be spent in the Pico-Union district. 
</P>
<P>
 After nine months of study involving several dozen community members, the 
directors stitched together a network of community and school organizations 
that will work together to promote alternatives to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 A major component of the plan is school-based discussion. Groups that 
encourage interracial communication, anger management and leadership skills 
will be formed at Van Nuys Middle School, Fulton Middle School in Van Nuys and 
James Monroe High School in North Hills as well as three Pico-Union schools. In 
addition, the grant will pay for creation of an arts project in conjunction 
with the Chicano studies department at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Velasquez, a veteran Valley gang counselor, will head the arts project, 
which will include comic books, street theater productions, mural painting and 
newsletters, all with the message of violence prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are real non-traditional approaches," Velasquez said. "We wanted to do 
something different." 
</P>
<P>
 Program directors also plan to educate low-income residents in techniques of 
grass-roots political action. For example, a community group could decide that 
a billboard in the neighborhood promotes violence against women and organize a 
boycott or petition against the advertiser, said Borbon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a top-down program," he said. "If adults and youth have an idea, 
they will make a decision what they want to do. We are just the conduit."  
</P>
<P>
 Also included in the proposal is a child-care cooperative at the Monroe High 
School family center to teach parenting skills to teen-agers.

6-YEAR-OLD IS REVIVED AFTER POOL ACCIDENT; ARLETA: THE BOY'S BROTHER AND A MAN 
RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS FROM A 911 DISPATCHER. THE CHILD WAS UNDERWATER TWO TO 
THREE MINUTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 6-year-old boy who nearly drowned in an Arleta pool was revived by his 
15-year-old brother and a man who received over-the-telephone instruction from 
a 911 dispatcher, family members and authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thuyen Dao was underwater for about two to three minutes before he was pulled 
out, not breathing, from the pool on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The child's brother, Thang Dao, told reporters he performed impromptu 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him, assisted by an unidentified man. 
</P>
<P>
 Thang Dao of Boyle Heights said he tried to beat the heat on Tuesday by taking 
his little brother and a group of friends and relatives to a pool near a 
friend's Arleta home.  
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday, I didn't want him to go really," said the boys' mother, Ba Nguyen, 
who did not accompany her boys on their excursion. "But he cried so I said 'OK, 
take care of him, be careful.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thang said he set his brother on the side of the pool, his legs dangling in 
the water, in an inflatable doughnut-shaped life preserver that fit around the 
little boy's waist. When Thang headed to rest on a nearby bench, he said, he 
was certain that a friend at the crowded pool was watching the younger boy. 
</P>
<P>
 After Thuyen entered the pool, a friend noticed a small hand reaching up from 
under the water, jumped into the pool and pulled Thuyen out. By the time Thang 
saw the commotion, his brother was stretched out on the pavement, not 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started pounding on his stomach and opened his mouth so he could breathe," 
Thang said at a news conference outside Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. "I saw 
people doing it on TV and I read instructions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While an unidentified man got over-the-phone life-saving instructions from 
Patrick Perry, a Los Angeles 911 emergency dispatcher, Thang continued to 
breathe into his brother's mouth. Using Perry's instructions, the man helped 
Thang tilt the boy's head back and clear his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the little boy began to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Nancy Schonfeld, the hospital's head of emergency and transport medicine, 
said the boy arrived at Childrens barely conscious, meaning he likely was 
underwater for two to three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another couple of minutes and he could have been in full arrest, he could 
have died," Schonfeld said. "There were 27 other people in the pool, but 
someone needs to be watching the child and that person needs to be a 
responsible adult." 
</P>
<P>
 Schonfeld said Thuyen's story should alert parents to the importance of pool 
safety. She urged that pools be equipped with fences, a motion sensor to detect 
if someone falls in and a self-locking gate. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Thuyen told his mother that he fell in the water and somehow 
lost his flotation device. He also said he does not want to try swimming again. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see he got life, I'm so happy we got him back," Nguyen said, just 
before taking her son home on Wednesday. "Almost I lost him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials, noting that more children die each year as a result of 
accidents than from all childhood diseases combined, offered more sobering 
remarks.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the hospital treated 22 drownings and serious near-drownings. So far 
this year, doctors at Childrens have handled 16 such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "This had a really happy outcome, but many drownings around the holidays don't 
have such happy endings," Schonfeld said. "He's a lucky boy."

AROUND THE VALLEY: LAND OF THE FREE NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE GRATEFUL NEW CITIZEN 
</P>

<P>
 The Fourth of July will be different this year for Dara Chuop. 
</P>
<P>
 Because, a few weeks ago, she raised her right hand and pledged allegiance to 
the United States of America, a thrilling moment for her. 
</P>
<P>
 She had escaped the murderous Khmer Rouge in her native Cambodia. She had 
endured refugee camps in Thailand and the Philippines. She arrived in this 
country at 13, knowing only a few words of English. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the words she did know, even then, was free .  
</P>
<P>
 Now she's 20 and a newly minted U.S. citizen. "I am very excited to have 
become an American," she said, her English just fine now. "This is my home." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Fourth of July approaching, it's worth remembering that there's more 
to the holiday than hot dogs, parades and fireworks. It's a celebration of the 
essential reason people from all over the world are still clamoring to get 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this country," Chuop said, "you have freedom. Freedom to make money. 
Freedom to say what you want. Freedom to think what you want. Freedom to pray 
the way you want. You have all this freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not that way in Cambodia once the Khmer Rouge began its rampage, 
destroying the serenity of her little girl's world. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers being hidden in a big ceramic vase with orders to be quiet so 
she wouldn't alert the gunmen outside. "Very scary," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, she said, she and her mother fled the family home near Phnom Penh, 
the capital. The escape paths through deep jungle were lined with bones: "They 
were human. People the Khmer Rouge had killed."  
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, a shot passed so close to her mother's head "it sliced through 
a few strands of her hair," the daughter said. 
</P>
<P>
 They ended up at a camp on the Thai-Cambodian border. Her mother went back to 
get her father, who had remained behind. For three months, she stayed with 
other relatives at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents reappeared. A brother was born. The family moved to another 
refugee camp in Thailand. There was a roof over their heads. Once a month, 
officials passed out food. "We would wait in line and wait in line," Chuop 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To pass the time, there was a TV. The little girl was fascinated by American 
TV shows, by images of what seemed to be a very attractive life in big cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the pictures were nice. Beautiful. The buildings. The skyscrapers. 
And the streets were so clean." 
</P>
<P>
 An aunt in the San Fernando Valley, her mother's sister, was trying to get 
them to the United States. After three years, she got them to another refugee 
camp, in the Philippines. Back to the food lines for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, paperwork completed, the family flew to Los Angeles, to be welcomed 
by their extended family in the Valley. Her first impression of her new home 
still lingers: "I thought it was so beautiful. In my country everything was so 
. . . poor." 
</P>
<P>
 She learned English by planting herself in front of the TV. "Sesame Street" 
became a quick favorite: "I learned English from Big Bird, Kermit the Frog and 
Miss Piggy." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not so hard, she said, to assimilate. In high school, she made friends 
and adopted an Americanized name, Shauna. "It's good to be in L.A., even though 
there are all kinds of bad things going on," she said. "There's a lot of good 
going on, too. I like being a part of it. It's fun."  
</P>
<P>
 It was also, she said, liberating. In Cambodia, she probably would have been 
engaged at 15 and wed at 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "An arranged marriage? No, no, no, no, no!" she said, laughing. "Here, a 
family gives a daughter freedom to go out. At 18, you've got that freedom. 
Shopping. The beach. Magic Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my country, you have to put on a costume. A big skirt. Ugh. In the United 
States, you can wear whatever you want," like leotards and jeans. "Why not be 
comfortable?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Mainly, though, over here you've got opportunity. You could work at a big 
company. Maybe work with computers. Whatever, as long as you have the strength 
and work hard. Over there, if you're from a poor family -- nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Chuop graduated from Canoga Park High. Now she works full time at a 
family owned Sherman Oaks doughnut store, saving cash for college, where she 
hopes to study nursing. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the citizenship test, she said, was the next logical step. Her mother 
said she would wait to take the test. But to her delight, her father, Sam, said 
he wanted to take it, too.  
</P>
<P>
 For the daughter, the material was easy. "I had learned it all in high school. 
George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, the Constitution, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 But for her father, working long hours at the family's other doughnut store, 
in Encino, it was tougher. She undertook the task of tutoring him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd ask: 'What about the Bill of Rights? Who was the first president? Who 
discovered America? How many stars on the flag?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tutoring never stopped. Amid the racks of eclairs and croissants, she kept 
the questions flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the highest court in the land? Who's the mayor? How many senators from 
each state?" 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, father and daughter took the test -- and passed handily. 
Then, on the last day of March, at the downtown Convention Center, they were 
sworn in as new citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 A country singer sang. The American flag was waved about. There were corn dogs 
and cold cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt so proud to be an American," she said. "It's not silly. It's not 
corny. It's just, I feel so proud to be an American." 
</P>
<P>
 This Fourth of July, she said, the family will probably have a barbecue at 
home, then check out the fireworks, maybe at one of the piers. "I made it 
here," Dara Chuop said. "I'm alive. And this country just amazes me."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; IMPROVEMENTS SPEED METROLINK; TRANSPORTATION: 
RIDERSHIP STILL OUTSTRIPS PRE-QUAKE LEVELS. AGENCY HOPES FURTHER UPGRADES WILL 
PROMOTE GREATER USE. 
</P>

 When commuter trains first began rolling here a week after the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake, Antelope Valley residents came aboard by the thousands. 
Although the 78-mile ride from Lancaster to Downtown Los Angeles took 2 hours 
and 25 minutes when the emergency service started, riders considered the 
Metrolink a comfortable way to avoid driving in a region where freeways had 
been crippled by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 About 21,000 people a day rode the rails but Metrolink officials knew the 
trains were too slow to keep people from returning to their cars once the 
freeways were fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to hold onto its newfound customers, Metrolink has spent tens of 
millions of dollars on track improvements, slicing 30 minutes off the commute 
time. And officials hope they can trim another 15 minutes in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The track improvements are very important to the continued success of the 
line because very soon (the freeway) will be back to the speeds before the 
earthquake," said Richard Stanger, Metrolink executive director. "We want to be 
in a situation where our travel times are competitive with the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 "With these speed improvements we will definitely be competitive, besides 
being more convenient and less stressful." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridership on the line from Lancaster to Los Angeles has averaged 3,900 per day 
in June, including 450 from the Antelope Valley, Stanger said. While the number 
of passengers has plummeted because of freeway improvements, the line is still 
carrying four times more than it had prior to the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The travel time reductions should boost ridership, Stanger said, adding that 
he expects passenger loads out of the Antelope Valley alone to reach 1,000 by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 A mailer recently sent to all Antelope and Santa Clarita valley residents that 
offers four free tickets has pushed up ridership by 500 to 700 daily, he said, 
noting the goal is that some of those passengers will get hooked on trains by 
trying them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanger said some people have been waiting for the length of travel to drop 
before trying out the trains. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with the Federal Emergency Management Agency footing the bill, Metrolink 
is spending $43 million on track improvements and another $7 million to upgrade 
a mile-long tunnel in the Newhall area, Stanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key improvements Metrolink has made is the installation of 10 miles 
of track between Lancaster and Palmdale, he said. The trains were traveling on 
freight track before the faster commuter tracks were put in. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor in reducing travel time has been the straightening or banking 
of curves along the 33 miles of track between Palmdale and Santa Clarita. 
Stanger said even more track improvements are planned through Soledad Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, speeds have increased from 10 to 25 m.p.h. in the Newhall tunnel as a 
result of track upgrades and reduced water leakage inside the tunnel, Stanger 
said. The plan is to get train speeds up to 40 m.p.h. through the tunnel, with 
additional work. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is pleased with what has been done, Stanger said he had hoped the 
improvements would have come sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not as good as it will get," he said. "This is a big step forward but 
we want to approach an hour and 40 minutes from Lancaster to Los Angeles. 
That's 100 minutes to go 78 miles, which is pretty good considering stops."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TEACHER RETIRING AFTER 32 YEARS; GRADUATION: 
AFTER WATCHING HER CLASS MOVE ON TODAY, SHE SAYS SHE WILL BE READY TO SEE 'WHAT 
ELSE IS OUT THERE.'

 Carolyn Brenneman will watch the last of her 30 children graduate from 
Pinetree Community School today. 
</P>
<P>
 It's her last class. Brenneman is retiring from the Sulphur Springs Union 
School District after 34 1/2 years of teaching, 32 of them here. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been an active, nomadic presence in the district, working at all seven 
schools and seven grade levels. She has served repeatedly on advisory 
committees that guide curriculum decisions and trained other educators with new 
programs and teaching techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 That desire for new experiences has prompted her to retire at 55, the minimum 
age allowed by the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a wild, wacky 32 years and I never got into a rut," said Brenneman. 
"I just figured it's time to see what else is out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of her work as a teacher has been as a reading specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a kid goes from 'I don't know how to read' to 'I got it' and the light 
bulb goes on is the most exciting thing," Brenneman said Wednesday, relaxing in 
the Pinetree staff room to avoid sweltering temperatures outside. 
</P>
<P>
 She has just finished opening cards and presents from her students, a group 
she affectionately describes as "rambunctious" and with "more energy than they 
know what to do with." 
</P>
<P>
 Her original students are about 40 years old now. She taught kindergarten and 
first grade at a private school for 2 1/2 years before county education 
officials assigned her to the Sulphur Springs district in rural Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brenneman arrived for her first morning of teaching in the district, she 
was approached by a 10-year-old girl on horseback who asked where to tie the 
mount while she attended class. 
</P>
<P>
 "That should've given me a clue," Brenneman said. "I got out here, and it was 
nothing like I had ever seen before. It was totally rustic."

CARJACKERS DIE AS CRASH ENDS CHASE; CRIME: A KNIFE AT HIS THROAT, A MAN 
DRINKING COFFEE IN A RENTAL CAR IN CAMARILLO GETS OUT AND RUNS TO CALL 911.

 Two young carjackers died in a high-speed crash Wednesday when the car they 
had stolen at knifepoint in Camarillo skidded out of control in Simi Valley 
during a police chase and smashed into another car. 
</P>
<P>
 The other driver, William Velasquez, 35, of Port Hueneme, was rushed to Los 
Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, treated for a cut knee and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the carjackers was pronounced dead at the accident scene outside the 
Wood Ranch subdivision, and the other died at Simi Valley Hospital shortly 
after he was airlifted there by a sheriff's helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 The county coroner's office withheld the men's names pending notification of 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday, Ventura County sheriff's deputies and Simi Valley police were 
still piecing together the carjacking and chase, which crested the Conejo Grade 
at more than 80 m.p.h. and ended in a deadly wreck that backed up traffic for 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime began about 3:25 p.m. in the parking lot of the McDonald's 
restaurant at Daily Drive and Las Posas Road, Sheriff's Sgt. Keith Lazz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two young men walked up to a rental car where Paul Castriades, 53, of 
Camarillo sat drinking coffee, according to deputies' reports. One pulled a 
knife, held it to Castriades' throat and ordered him out of the car, Lazz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two then hopped into the car -- a maroon Nissan Altima -- and drove south 
on the Ventura Freeway, he said. Castriades ran into the restaurant and called 
the 911 emergency number to report the robbery, Sheriff's Sgt. David Paige 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies, who had taken up positions along the freeway, spotted the men 
traveling southbound at Ventu Park Road at about 3:30 p.m., Paige said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four cruisers gave chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing they had been spotted, the carjackers pushed the Altima faster, at 
times reaching nearly 100 m.p.h. as they turned north onto the Moorpark Freeway 
toward Moorpark, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several more sheriff's cruisers joined the chase, and the men exited onto 
Olsen Road and turned east toward Simi Valley, speeding past the east valley 
sheriff's station and weaving between cars, Paige said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were cutting in and out of traffic, just crazy, to the point where our 
units dropped back to where they briefly lost sight of the vehicle," Paige 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 By the time the deputies caught up, the Altima had already careened out of 
control and crashed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police determined that the car had skidded across the Olsen Road median in 
front of the Wood Ranch area at high speed and hit a foot-thick oak tree 
broadside, snapping it off at ground level. 
</P>
<P>
 The car then barreled across the westbound lanes and into the path of a car 
driven by Velasquez, smashing its front end, and came to rest on the far curb, 
Paige said. 
</P>
<P>
 The carjacker who had been driving lay outside the vehicle, his head bleeding, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies hustled him aboard the sheriff's helicopter for the ride to Simi 
Valley Hospital. He was pronounced dead by an emergency room physician shortly 
after he arrived, said JoLynn de la Torre, a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to treat the other carjacker who was trapped in the crumpled wreck, 
deputies gingerly pulled him out a window and tried to revive him, Paige said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PROPOSED BUDGET CUT THREATENS TO CLOSE CASTAIC 
ANIMAL SHELTER; GOVERNMENT: THE FACILITY SERVES ABOUT 250,000 PEOPLE. THE 
AREA'S OTHER CENTER IS IN LANCASTER, 60 MILES AWAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Employees at the Castaic Animal Shelter take in thousands of stray creatures a 
year, hoping their owners or a kind soul will claim them before they have to be 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the shelter faces the same fate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control plans to close 
the shelter if a proposed 7% cut in the department's 1994-95 budget stands, 
said Bob Ballenger, executive assistant for the department. He said a 19% cut 
in the 1993-94 budget was absorbed by all six county animal facilities, but 
such measures won't work this year. Because the Castaic shelter is the smallest 
in the county system, it's the most endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the least amount of damage we could do," he said. "It's like being given 
a choice between cutting off your left arm or your left foot." 
</P>
<P>
 The Castaic shelter serves about 250,000 people in a 250-square-mile area, 
including the Santa Clarita Valley and unincorporated sections of the northwest 
part of the county, Ballenger said. If closed, the nearest facility would be 
the Lancaster Animal Shelter, about 60 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 employees in Castaic would probably be transferred to other county 
shelters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballenger said the department has asked the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors for an extra $207,000 to continue operating the shelter, which took 
in about 6,500 of the 96,000 animals housed at county shelters last year. The 
supervisors will begin the budget approval process July 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials have commented privately that they doubt the Board of 
Supervisors will allow the shelter to go unfunded, despite a shortfall of at 
least $184 million in the 1994-95 county budget. But shelter officials and 
Santa Clarita animal lovers, who watched last year's cuts force local libraries 
into part-time operation and the Mira Loma jail facility in Lacaster to close 
its doors, said they won't be reassured until the money is provided. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking it completely seriously because I know how desperately underfunded 
the county is," said Laurene Weste, parks commissioner for the city of Santa 
Clarita and a member of the Los Angeles County Animal Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 About 62% of dogs and 36% of cats at the Castaic shelter were placed in homes, 
about two to three times the usual number for comparably sized shelters, 
Ballenger said. But residents said those figures probably would plummet if 
people had to go look for their pets in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would mean commuting an hour to Lancaster to look for your animal," said 
Rick Kerr, founder of Citizens for Sheltered Animals, which houses and tries to 
find new owners for unclaimed animals at the shelter. "Probably 70% of the 
people would say it's not worth the effort to go out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The distance would also have a devastating impact on response time to 
emergencies, Weste said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no ability to respond if you have a vicious animal -- say you have a 
child cornered by a pit bull," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter also responds often to wild animals such as bears, coyotes and 
bobcats that have wandered out of nearby mountains, officials said. In 
addition, employees have coped with some bizarre situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one time we had 9,000 chickens here," said Lt. John Rozier, an employee 
who was at the shelter when it opened in December, 1972. "A chicken truck 
turned over right here in Castaic about 12 to 14 years ago. We had eggs coming 
out of our ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids would come up here in the morning with boxes, and we'd tell them they 
could gather the eggs," he added. "We didn't want them to go rotten." 
</P>
<P>
 Weste said she and other volunteers collected more than 10,000 signatures on 
petitions submitted to the Board of Supervisors asking that the Castaic shelter 
remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gathered those signatures in a couple of weeks or less," she added. The 
Department of Animal Care and Control has a proposed $2.1-million budget for 
the 1994-95 year, compared to $2.3 million during 1993-94, Ballenger said. He 
said the department needs $591,000 -- including the $207,000 for the Castaic 
shelter -- to keep all services at the level they were this year, and more than 
$1 million to restore services provided two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some indication government officials are sympathetic to the shelter. 
Peter Whittingham, deputy to Supervisor Michael Antonovich, said the Castaic 
shelter is the "No. 1" priority on a list of several items the supervisor wants 
to preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Santa Clarita, which paid the shelter about $80,000 this year for 
animal control services within the city limits, may also be willing to 
contribute extra money to keep the shelter open, said Jesse Juarros, the city's 
general services manager. He said city officials are waiting for the county's 
decision before taking any action. 
</P>
<P>
 "How we would do that, we're not quite sure," he added, stating the city has 
its own budget problems.LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF AN

GIANTS GET A DOUBLE DOSE OF MARTINEZ, 6-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 About the time when the giant inflatable hot dog suddenly appeared in the 
stands, and the beach ball came tumbling over the reserve section, it was time 
to take a step back and look at the game at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it really that boring? 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of a matchup with the San Francisco Giants lost its luster 
momentarily for some in the crowd of 46,020 at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday 
night, but never for long. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Martinez, who must have enrolled in a batting camp over the winter, hit 
and pitched the Dodgers to a 6-2 complete-game victory to take the three-game 
series from the Giants, two games to one. 
</P>
<P>
 That is always significant. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the standings, winning a series from the Giants is meaningful 
for the Dodgers, but especially this season. With a strike looming, teams are 
cognizant that whoever is in first place when, and if, the players strike, 
might just end up in the playoffs. The Dodger objective? Not to let the Giants 
back in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we're doing right now is maintenance," Brett Butler said. "This is not 
who's in second or who's in third, it's maintaining our place in first." 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, the Dodgers increased their lead in the National League West 
to 4 1/2 games over the Colorado Rockies and 7 1/2 games over the Giants. It is 
the farthest back the Giants have been all season, and dropped them to 12 games 
under .500, equaling their lowest point this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Martinez (7-4), who was not only helped by the Dodger offense but 
can now be considered a part of it, held the Giants to five hits, walking only 
one batter. 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest mistake was giving up a home run to Matt Williams in the fourth 
inning, and it was one that made history. Williams hit Martinez's 2-1 pitch 
into the left field pavilion for his 29th home run to set a new National League 
record for most home runs hit before July. Willie Stargell had 28 through June 
30, 1971.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams said at this point the record didn't mean a lot. "Our objective at 
this point is to win, but I'm sure that I'll think about (the record) down the 
road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Williams' homer, the Dodgers still had a 5-1 lead. They scored all 
five runs against Giant starter William VanLandingham (3-1), who didn't make it 
past the third inning.  
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who has never been confused with Orel Hershiser with a bat, hit two 
doubles and scored a run, giving him three multi-hit games this season. He has 
hit .333 in his last eight starts and is batting .273, tops among the pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working on my hitting during batting practice, and I even went to 
Lasorda University once," Martinez said. "I just go out and swing and I feel so 
comfortable at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also feel so good pitching, I know I'm healthy and I'll keep pitching 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 The respect shown to Mike Piazza reached a pinnacle in the third inning, when, 
with one out and Delino DeShields on second after a run-scoring double, Dusty 
Baker ordered Piazza intentionally walked with Tim Wallach on deck. Piazza, a 
torment to the Giants, had homered in four consecutive games before Wednesday 
and had singled and scored in the first inning on a homer by Wallach, his 18th. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez led off the third inning with a double and went to third on a 
sacrifice bunt by Butler. DeShields, who entered the game batting .414 since 
his return nine games ago, hit an opposite-field double that bounced just past 
the third base bag and rolled to the left field wall.

CHANG UNABLE TO PALATE WHAT SAMPRAS SERVES UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This just in: Pete Sampras does have a weakness. . . . Repeat. . . . Sampras 
does have a weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't cook well, I can tell you that," Michael Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, it depends on your appetite. Sampras has a taste for Wimbledon 
championships and proved it Wednesday by flicking away the usually tenacious 
Chang, 6-4, 6-1, 6-3, to advance to Friday's semifinals. He will play fellow 
American Todd Martin, who beat Wayne Ferreira, 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 5-7, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other half of the draw, No. 4-seeded Goran Ivanisevic will play No. 7 
Boris Becker. Ivanisevic slipped past France's Guy Forget, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 
(7-3), 6-4, while Becker, the subject of yet another mini-controversy, disposed 
of Christian Bergstrom, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, the tournament's top-seeded player and closet perfectionist, didn't 
merely beat his longtime friend; he dominated him. Chang scored only 17 points 
against Sampras' vapor serve -- five in the first set, two in the second and 10 
in the third. He didn't break Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel like I was in a zone, but I was getting there," Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any closer and Sampras would have been holding hands with perfection. He 
hasn't lost a set in his five matches. Two more three-set victories and he 
joins exalted company, such as Becker, the last men's player to win consecutive 
Wimbledon championships (1985-86), and Bjorn Borg, the last male player to win 
this tournament without losing a set (1976). 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th-seeded Chang, who has known Sampras since he was 7, began the match 
with an overall lead in head-to-head meetings. But they had never played each 
other on grass, Sampras' best surface. Nor had Chang, making his first 
Wimbledon quarterfinal appearance, seen Sampras like this . . . like, well, not 
of this tennis world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete's at the moment (where) I think he's really reached the peak of his 
career." 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, Chang used to tinker with Sampras' mind. No matter how hard 
the serve, Chang somehow would find a way to get it back. No matter the Sampras 
lead, Chang would close the gap and more times than not, overcome it. No matter 
the situation, Chang's unrelenting style would expose cracks in Sampras' 
psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was able to beat him mentally, to be honest with you," Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras barely needed a sweat towel Wednesday. He had eight aces to Chang's 
three. He won 89% of his first-serve points. He volleyed with ease, hitting 17 
winners, compared to the baseline-happy Chang, who ventured close enough to the 
net for only five volley points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's match was pretty much flawless on my side," Sampras said. "I really 
didn't give him a chance to get into his game." 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, it was a performance good enough to give almost everyone else here 
a case of the Sampras willies. They can read a scoreboard. They have seen the 
three-set romps. They've seen him extended to only two tiebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for anyone to beat Sampras it's going to be very tough," said 
Sweden's Bergstrom, "and he's probably the favorite, for me, to win the 
tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 The vote isn't unanimous. Ivanisevic, who usually says exactly what's on his 
mind, wasn't conceding a thing. Sampras has a big serve, but Ivanisevic has a 
bigger one. He blasted a screamer past Forget that registered 136 m.p.h. on the 
radar gun. 
</P>
<P>
 And enough already with the unbeatable Sampras stuff, said Ivanisevic. First 
he has to make it past No. 6 Martin, who beat Sampras in the Queen's Club final 
on grass. Then Becker, the three-time champion, or Ivanisevic, the 1992 
finalist, awaits. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't have any tough guy to beat him," Ivanisevic said. "Today . . . I 
was just wondering how long that match is going to last, because Chang is a 
great player, but he can't beat him on grass. He can maybe win a set, but it's 
very tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "So Sampras didn't have any tough matches. Now we see. I mean, I hope I'll get 
with him in the final. We'll see. He doesn't like to play lefties. He doesn't 
like lefty serves." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic, a left-hander, didn't exactly have a marathon match Wednesday. 
There were the two tiebreakers and a few tense moments during the third set, 
but that was it. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin should have been so lucky. Four of his five Wimbledon matches have gone 
five sets. If you count the hours played, Martin has spent more than double the 
time on the court than Sampras during the fortnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the fatigue factor, there was the Ferreira factor. The unseeded South 
African began the match with a 3-0 record against Martin and beat him in the 
semifinals at Queen's Club last year. 
</P>
<P>
 This time Martin took a two-set lead and then held on as Ferreira nearly 
pulled off the improbable comeback. Now he gets Sampras. On Centre Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's like my second-favorite dream come true," Martin said. "Maybe a couple 
days after that I'll have my first dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, no Wimbledon day would be complete without the obligatory Boris 
boo-boo. So far he has been accused of cheating, of stalling and after 
Wednesday's match, of purposely disrupting the concentration of Bergstrom on 
set point in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score 6-5 in the first set tiebreaker, Bergstrom hit a high volley 
that Becker thought landed long -- and gestured so to the chair umpire just 
after returning the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergstrom then missed the return and immediately claimed he was distracted by 
Becker's raised hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little bit disturbed," Bergstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not half as disturbed as Becker in the post-match news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make one thing clear: I don't like what's going on for the past two 
or three days," Becker said. "I'm doing the same things for the past 10 years. 
All of a sudden, this is not supposed to be fair play." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker had two theories for the sudden inquiries about his playing tactics. 
The first: "Maybe the main reason why they speak up is because they lost," he 
said. The second: "The main problem is Andre Agassi is out and (the newspapers) 
got to find a guy to fill in the space. You've found one here, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Wimbledon Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Today's women's singles semifinals is the first time in the open era (since 
1968) that two unseeded players (Americans Lori McNeil and Gigi Fernandez) have 
advanced this far at Wimbledon. . . . With her Wednesday doubles match, Martina 
Navratilova broke Billie Jean King's record for most matches played at 
Wimbledon. Navratilova, who made her first appearance here in 1973, has played 
266 matches. She plays Fernandez today, and McNeil faces Conchita Martinez of 
Spain.

CAREW BLASTS ANGELS AFTER LATEST SETBACK; BASEBALL: HITTING COACH CRITICIZES 
HITTERS FOR SELFISHNESS AFTER FINLEY'S IMPRESSIVE OUTING IS WASTED IN A 1-0 
LOSS TO A'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Chuck Finley, who has lost his last two starts despite giving up a total of 
three runs, was not allowed to talk about Wednesday's 1-0 loss to the Oakland 
Athletics. But hitting instructor Rod Carew vented enough frustration for the 
whole team. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley's 1-2 forkball to Scott Brosius in the ninth inning hung a bit high, 
and the A's third baseman sent a towering fly ball into the left field seats 
that sent the Angels to their third consecutive defeat and most of the 25,010 
fans in the Oakland Coliseum home happy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, however, left for a 10-game road swing through the East in a foul 
mood. After the game, Manager Marcel Lachemann told reporters that Finley would 
not be available. "It's my decision, and don't push me on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carew, however, had plenty to say about the Angel batters' selfish approach. 
The Angels have not scored a run in the last 22 innings, and Carew says too 
many hitters are putting more emphasis on their statistics than winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have too many guys who are not willing to give themselves up for the 
team," Carew said. "There are a few who are selfish. Damion Easley, Chad 
Curtis, all the little guys on this club want to be the big swingers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chili (Davis), Timmy (Salmon) and Bo (Jackson) aren't going to be asked to 
give themselves up, but everybody else on this club should. Those guys can hit 
home runs. The rest shouldn't even be trying to. I just don't understand it 
because it's just common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, one run can mean an awful lot to a ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
 Finley can relate to that. He gave up only four hits in 8 1/3 innings and 
"threw as well as I have ever seen him at any time," said Lachemann, the former 
Angel pitching coach who has seen most of Finley's best performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels certainly didn't have many baserunners. Substitute Oakland starter 
Carlos Reyes gave up two hits and two walks in eight innings, and Dennis 
Eckersley retired the Angels in order in the ninth to earn the victory, the A's 
seventh in a row and 13th in their last 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Spike Owen began the game by reaching second base on Oakland shortstop Mike 
Bordick's throwing error. Owen was stranded, though, as he was after his 
one-out single in the sixth.

 "You shouldn't have to wait for the manager to give you a sign," Carew said. 
"I just sit there and wonder what they're thinking. I don't understand the 
pitches they swing at or the pitches they take in certain situations. And don't 
tell me they're young players. I don't buy that. They've been playing this game 
all their life and if they don't know it by now, I don't know what else we can 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take extra batting practice every day and we're not just out there 
swinging the bat. We're calling situations, a guy is on second with no outs, a 
guy is on third with one out. I don't mind preaching this stuff every day if 
they would execute it. But this is frustrating, very, very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, not one to openly criticize his players, said he was partly to 
blame for not finding a way to shake his team out of the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very tough to lose a game when a guy pitches as well as Chuck did," he 
said. "You don't want to get into a state of panic, but we scored only two runs 
in three games here and I've got to consider ways to shake things up." 
</P>
<P>
 If he takes Carew's advice, he'll put more veterans in the lineup and bench 
some of his young free-swingers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You give me a Spike Owen or a Rex Hudler or a Harold Reynolds," Carew said. 
"If something needs to be done for the team, they'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
 With designated hitter Davis out of the lineup because of a groin injury 
during this series, the Angels' offense was clearly flailing and failing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys who aren't paid to hit home runs should be worrying about getting on 
base," Davis said.

<P>
 A special panel appointed by the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. gathered Wednesday 
in Colorado Springs, Colo, to consider disciplinary action against Tonya 
Harding for her role in one of the most bizarre episodes in American sports 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the panel may decide to take away the national title 
Harding won in Detroit this year and ban her from the association for life. It 
also could ask her to return training funds, since some $6,000 of that money 
was used to finance the attack on Harding's rival, Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel met for two hours before adjourning for dinner. A decision is 
expected sometime today. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing comes nearly six months after Kerrigan was whacked above the right 
knee Jan. 6. The injury knocked Kerrigan out of the competition, clearing the

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SAUDIS' OWAIRAN HAS THE RUN OF THE PLACE; 
GROUP F: MIDFIELDER BEATS FOUR DEFENDERS ON DAZZLING 65-YARD SCORING JAUNT THAT 
PUTS HIS TEAM INTO SECOND ROUND. BELGIUM DROPS TO THIRD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Saeed Al Owairan had finished a 65-yard run that will be relived for 
years, scoring a goal that children will be scoring in their back yards 
forever, he did the only appropriate thing. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw the fans standing and screaming as if they had just seen a movie star. 
He saw that this was, after all, America. 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of lifting his hands to Allah like his Saudi Arabian teammates, he 
ran to a corner of the field where he was by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Once there, he boogied. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a dance to say to the world, 'Here we are,' " Owairan said after his 
team's stunning 1-0 victory over previously unbeaten Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 The world no longer needs reminding. Owairan's memorable score in the sixth 
minute before 52,959 at RFK Stadium enabled the Saudis to advance to the second 
round in their first World Cup finals appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 With their only loss in three games coming in the final five minutes to the 
Netherlands, the Saudis have become this tournament's lucky charm. 
</P>
<P>
 They face powerful Sweden on Sunday in Dallas in what appears to be another 
mismatch. This, of course, only means trouble for Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows what happens?" forward Sami Al Jaber said with a smile. "This is 
football. This is one tournament. There are no big teams or small teams." 
</P>
<P>
 There are only teams that can have their will stolen from them in 10 dazzling 
seconds. This is what happened to Belgium, which fell from first place to third 
in its group and now faces a probable second-round game against defending 
champion Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 That chore was supposed to go to the Saudis. But there was that matter of 10 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 That was all the time Owairan needed to make memories with a scoring run in 
which he eluded four defenders and a goalkeeper. They were part of the only 
World Cup defense that had yet to allow a score. 
</P>
<P>
 "An amazing goal, just amazing," said Franky Van der Elst, Belgian midfielder. 
"I have never seen anything like it before." 
</P>
<P>
 You know when Charles Barkley orders his teammates to the side of the court so 
he can face a man one-on-one? That was this. 
</P>
<P>
 Except it was one-on-five. Covering two basketball courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest soccer comparison anyone could muster was to Argentina's Diego 
Maradona and his two long scoring runs in the 1986 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was Maradona, and this was, well, a 26-year-old midfielder who is 
best known for his bad defense. 
</P>
<P>
 His defense was so bad, in fact, that coaches didn't even trust him to remain 
on the field Wednesday for more than 61 of the 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But all he needed were those 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The run started when Owairan took a pass from Hamzah Saleh about 10 yards into 
the Saudi side of the field. The Belgian defense spread out to cover Saleh and 
dangerous Majed Mohammed, leaving a seam down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Owairan found that seam and began to sprint. 
</P>
<P>
 He sprinted through a sliding tackle attempt by Dirk Medved. He sprinted over 
another tackle attempt by Michel De Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearing the penalty box, he juked Rudy Smidts and kept sprinting. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen yards from the goal, he leaped over a final tackle attempt by Philippe 
Albert and kicked the ball toward the far post while falling in the other 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 That the ball went in is something he still doesn't believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot describe what happened to me," Owairan said. "It is beyond words." 
</P>
<P>
 The Belgians certainly talked about it, with a fervor usually associated with 
somebody who has witnessed something far more serious. Say, an unidentified 
flying object. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let him go, and go, and go, and go," said Belgian captain Georges Grun, 
who sat out this game because he was worried about picking up a second yellow 
card and being suspended from the first second-round match. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, a player cannot run that far," Grun said. "But nobody tackled him. 
We were too confident. We have to play harder." 
</P>
<P>
 The Belgians played hard for the rest of the first half, recording 14 of the 
19 shots taken in the half. They had 12 second-half shots, most of them badly 
missed headers or kicks that landed in the 10th row. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very aggressive and very fast, very fast," Van der Elst said. "In 
the locker room, we never think that anything like this can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saudis have become dangerous because they are starting to believe 
something like this always happens. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by hot lights and cameras and questioners yelling at him in a 
variety of languages, Owairan suddenly doubled over in laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said when he started this game, he was playing in his back yard," an 
interpreter explained. "That's funny now, isn't it?"

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; WEARY NETHERLANDS SHOWS ITS STAYING POWER; 
GROUP F: A LOSS FROM ELIMINATION, DUTCH INSTEAD SWEAT OUT 2-1 VICTORY OVER 
MOROCCO THAT CLINCHES TITLE. ROY BREAKS TIE IN 78TH MINUTE.

<P>
 One by one, they trudged toward their bus, their faces grim and their 
shoulders sagging under the weight of their bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a smile among the 22 players. 
</P>
<P>
 And these were the members of the winning team. 
</P>
<P>
 On a scorching day when simply breathing was an effort, the Netherlands found 
itself squarely on the hot seat. One defeat from an embarrassing exit from the 
World Cup, the Dutch had to survive on their grit, which has never matched 
their formidable talent. Sweating together instead of taking separate star 
trips, they defeated Morocco, 2-1, Wednesday at the Florida Citrus Bowl. It was 
no Dutch mastery, but it was enough to earn the Group F championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play very well, but the most important thing was that we won," said 
second-half substitute Bryan Roy, who scored the game-winner in the 78th minute 
with a left-footed nudge of a pass from Dennis Bergkamp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we are happy, but we are too tired to show it right now," Roy said. 
"The important thing was that we advanced to the second round. The way Morocco 
was attacking (early in the second half), I thought we might lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland won the game -- and the group -- on Roy's goal, scored 11 minutes 
after he replaced winger Peter van Vossen. "It was pretty simple," said Roy, 
who plays for Foggia of the Italian League. "I made myself available in front 
of the goal and it was passed in to me. The rest was easy." 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, none of it was easy. To make himself available, he had to outrace 
several defenders. To set it up, Bergkamp -- who had scored Holland's first 
goal -- had to keep the ball in the goal area after Morocco failed to clear the 
ball, and he had to sacrifice a scoring chance. To get the pass to Roy, 
Bergkamp had to cut sharply around defender Smahi Triki. 
</P>
<P>
 And Roy had to get just the right bounce on his shot to fool goalkeeper 
Zakaria Alaoui, which he did. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal turned the group standings upside-down. The Netherlands, Saudi Arabia 
and Belgium were 2-1 with plus-one goal differentials, but Belgium was 
relegated to third place because it had scored only two goals and had given up 
one. Holland and Saudi Arabia had each scored four goals and had given up 
three, but Holland won the head-to-head matchup, 2-1, to win the group title 
and gain a round-of-16 meeting with Ireland on July 4 in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we played our best game today. We played our best game against 
Belgium and didn't win," defender Frank De Boer said. "But that happens 
sometimes. We are very glad to stay here and play against Ireland because we 
don't have to travel." 
</P>
<P>
 Said midfielder Jan Wouters, who earned his second yellow card and will sit 
out the Ireland game: "Nobody expected us to finish in first in this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Dick Advocaat anticipated criticism for not having finished first in the 
group more easily, but he made no apologies for his team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only very few countries that managed to win two matches in this 
tournament, even the big countries that were expected to win the title, so we 
didn't do too badly," Advocaat said. "We know the way we like to play in Europe 
is here verboten , impossible. . . . The heat has hurt the play for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't evaporate the spirits of the below-capacity crowd of 60,578, 
including fans who wore curly wigs and painted their faces in honor of their 
beloved Orange. They sang and waved their bedsheet-banners when Bergkamp took a 
pass from van Vossen and sent a left-footer inside the right post in the 43rd 
minute, for his first World Cup goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a fluke that the ball came to me," he said. "I then took 
immediate action, and that's how we scored. . . . I created many chances and I 
felt good about those chances." 
</P>
<P>
 But Morocco (0-3) created some chances too. Coach Abdellah Ajri's lineup 
changes produced a feisty team -- it collected four yellow cards -- and a 
persistent effort. It paid off in a tie in the 47th minute, when Hassan Nader 
got behind defenders Ronald Koeman and De Boer and converted a square pass from 
Mustapha Hadji, who had entered the game moments earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we deserved better for the way we played in these games," Ajri said. 
"At least today, we lost to a great team."

 The Oakland Athletics are finding ways to win. But given the way Chuck Finley 
was pitching Wednesday, they didn't figure to pull this one out with a home run 
by the No. 9 hitter who was down in the count 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a weird one," Oakland third baseman Scott Brosius said after his 
ninth-inning shot down the left field line lifted the A's to a 1-0 victory. 
"When I got two strikes, I was just trying to hit the ball up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I hit the ball, I didn't feel anything and I looked up there and said, 
'That ball can get out of here.' I was just hoping it wouldn't hook foul. It 
was probably one of two forkballs he got up all day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about the unexpected, Oakland starter Carlos Reyes had a no-hitter going 
into the fourth inning when Bo Jackson broke it up with an infield single . 
Jackson hit a sharp grounder that bounded off a diving Mark McGwire at first 
and caromed toward second baseman Brent Gates. Gates' throw to Reyes covering 
was a little behind the A's pitcher and he couldn't hang onto the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Spike Owen made the official scorer's ruling on the play a moot point in the 
sixth when he grounded a single into right field. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Julio Valera, who had reconstructive elbow surgery last July, 
made his second start with double-A Midland Tuesday night and went six innings, 
allowing six hits and four runs. "Preston (Gomez, special assistant to the 
general manager) is down there with him and says he's sound and healthy, but he 
definitely looks like he needs to pitch," Manager Marcel Lachemann said. . . . 
A's catcher Terry Steinbach, who singled in the second inning Wednesday, has a 
career .432 average with four home runs in 44 at-bats against Finley. . . . 
Lachemann's record since taking over as manager is 16-22. Former Manager Buck 
Rodgers was 16-23 before he was fired. JOHN WEYLER

 Fernando Valenzuela will be honored tonight in ceremonies before the Dodger 
game against the Philadelphia Phillies. The event will mark the return of 
Valenzuela to Dodger Stadium for the first time since the 1990 season, after 
which he was released.

 Tickets for Sunday's game, when Valenzuela will pitch against Orel Hershiser, 
are still available, but are selling rapidly.

 Rafael Bournigal said when he got the news he was called up to Los Angeles, he 
didn't know who he was replacing until he showed up at the Dodger clubhouse. 
Bournigal, who was playing his fourth season in triple-A, has spent eight years 
in the Dodger farm system, with periodic call-ups to Los Angeles the past three 
seasons. He says he knows he was called up because of his defense, but says he 
is working hard on his offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to say I can hit 100% but I just want to work hard, come to the 
park early for hitting and keep improving," said Bournigal, who relaced Jose 
Offerman. "If you do the best you can, then when the results come you can't be 
ashamed."

 Shortstop Mike Metcalf, the Dodgers' third pick in the June draft, is already

five runs batted in and six stolen bases. MARYANN HUDSON

ninth-inning shot down the left field line lifted the A's to a 1-0 victory. 
"When I got two strikes, I was just trying to hit the ball up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I hit the ball, I didn't feel anything and I looked up there and said, 
'That ball can get out of here.' I was just hoping it wouldn't hook foul. It 
was probably one of two forkballs he got up all day." JOHN WEYLER

LOCAL NOTES: TITAN BASEBALL COACH HORTON REJECTS WASHINGTON STATE OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The head baseball coaching job at Washington State was George Horton's if he 
wanted it. But Wednesday, the Cal State Fullerton associate head coach decided 
to remain with the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton said contract negotiations broke down over money matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it was a money thing," Horton said. "They (Washington State) just 
couldn't come up with something to my liking." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Horton had expressed concerns about his family, which includes his 
wife, Francie, and three daughters, living on one salary in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the factors to be considered is that my wife has a great job here as 
an office supervisor for a dental group," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton, who would have replaced the retiring Bobo Brayton at the head of the 
Cougars' program, had said the weather would also affect his decision. He was 
concerned about how much time his players would have on the field at Pullman. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton, who lives in Yorba Linda, said he has received a lot of support from 
the Fullerton community, many people indicating they wished he would stay. He 
called the negotiations a "win-win" situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough decision," Horton said. "I'm a Titan and always will be. I 
went to school here. I have a lot of feelings toward Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton joined Coach Augie Garrido's staff in 1991, after heading the Cerritos 
College program for six years. He led Cerritos to three State community college 
championships and a 226-53 record. 
</P>
<P>
 During his time at Fullerton, where he has been primarily responsible for the 
pitchers, the Titans have reached the College World Series twice (1992 and 
'94). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Michelle Gromacki, a former all-conference catcher at Cal State Fullerton and 
a member of Team USA, has been appointed assistant to softball Coach Judi 
Garman, the school announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Gromacki, 30, replaces Kathy Van Wyk, another former Titan who resigned in 
April after nine seasons to seek a head coaching position. 
</P>
<P>
 Gromacki was a reserve for Fullerton in 1985, then started the next two 
seasons when the Titans won the national championship in 1986 and finished 
third in '87. She won All-Pacific Coast athletic Assn. honors in 1987, when she 
batted .288. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, with only three seniors, was 35-29 last season and reached the 
final game of the NCAA regional at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs and Sports on Wheels, a newly formed non-profit organization 
that helps fund disabled youths and adults who compete in sports, will have a 
wheelchair exhibition game during halftime at the Bullfrogs' game July 17 at 
The Pond of Anaheim, and at 1 p.m. July 24 at the Anaheim Convention Center.

<P>
 Valencia quarterback Rob Petko has been named to replace Los Alamitos' Mike 
Good on the North's roster for the Orange County All-Star football game July 8 
at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>

Katella's Aaron Marsh (offensive tackle) and Buena Park's Wali Sibrie (tackle). 
Dropped from the team: Sunny Hills' Craig Borsari (receiver) and Esperanza's 
Jimmy Stewart (linebacker). 
</P>
<P>
 Added to the South squad: University's Jaime Polidore (receiver), Marina's 
Eric Fegley (tackle), El Toro's Jeff Fackrell (linebacker) and San Clemente's 
Jeff Javorsky (center). Dropped: Newport Harbor's Wade Tift (running back),

THE LINE THAT ROARS; MARCH OF 'THE LION KING' CHARACTERS IS ON AS DISNEY 
UNLEASHES ITS NEWEST PARADE ATTRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To paraphrase a passage from Disney's new animated film, "The Lion King," the 
dancing leop ards are in a bit of a spot, the monkeys make apes of themselves 
on the floats, and you just can't forget the "puppetronic" elephant. 
</P>
<P>
 And those are just some of the noteworthy elements in "The Lion King 
Celebration" parade, which will be presented twice daily at Disneyland 
throughout the summer starting on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never used an Audio-Animatronic (character) in a parade before," said 
show director Robert Ponce. "That's Zazu the bird. We have two 10-foot-long 
remote-controlled crocodiles and three remote-controlled bugs including a 
scorpion and a dung beetle. We've got probably the most extensive puppets ever 
built, worked by a puppeteer so movements are more fluid than robotic-type 
puppetry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also have waterfalls on the floats, and a release of white pigeons every 
day. We stock about 400 homing pigeons to be able to do it. Actually, they go 
to La Habra Heights and they're shipped back in the mornings." 
</P>
<P>
 If you thought the "Aladdin" parade was magic, a banner quoting the genie at 
the end of that procession says it all: "I'm outta here!" The Aladdin version 
makes its final run today. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie "The Lion King" opens with the presentation of the newborn Simba, 
heir of Mufasa, king of beasts. It isn't long before Simba's evil uncle, Scar, 
is getting the young lion cub into all kinds of trouble, with lifelong 
repercussions, despite the watchful eye of major-domo Zazu, a hornbill. Scar's 
henchmen include a trio of hyenas. 
</P>
<P>
 When Simba's father dies, the cub flees in undeserved shame, but he is lucky 
enough to meet a pair of "no-worries" sidekicks, wart hog Pumbaa and meerkat 
Timon. Rafiki, the shaman-like baboon, gets Simba back on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
 Each section of the "Lion King" parade -- which is a street show representing 
the African continent from the rain forest to the Serengeti -- represents a 
different passage in Simba's life from cub to king. The production features 
more than 85 performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Zazu and Rafiki lead the parade. Disney-adorable puppetronic characters 
include walk-about blinking rhinoceroses and 17-foot-tall ear-wiggling 
giraffes. (Puppetronic refers to both electronic and manual moving parts, the 
latter worked by a person inside the costume.) Rain sticks, gourds and drums 
are handed out to parade-watchers, to make the production interactive. You do 
have to give the instruments back, though. 
</P>
<P>
 The tropical rain forest float actually "rains," but there were even more 
realistic touches at a preview on Sunday. It seemed hot as a savannah, for 
instance, and Whoopi Goldberg, the voice of one the film's hyenas, was among 
spectators who baked in the afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Disney spokesman John McClintock, Goldberg expressed 
disappointment that the parade didn't feature hyenas. But, McClintock 
explained, "The parade all takes place after the story is over, at which point 
the hyenas have been driven from the pride lands." Cheech Marin, who also 
played a hyena, and Ernie Sabella, voice of wart hog Pumbaa, also attended. 
</P>
<P>
 A 650-member choir singing the African-style songs lent the preview event the 
air of a roof-raising gospel celebration, but the parade will have to settle 
for humbler backup on an everyday basis. A studio mix of the music is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade route runs from Small World past the Matterhorn and down Main 
Street U.S.A. The song "Just Can't Wait to be King," from Simba's carefree cub 
days, accompanies the parade as it travels, while the more emotional "Circle of 
Life" plays out in stationary presentations along the route.  
</P>
<P>
 The music by Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice proved so infectious that, even 
at a truncated version of the parade contrived for media photo opportunities 
earlier that afternoon, park visitors fell in behind like a scene right out of 
"The Music Man." 
</P>
<P>
 The parade tries to provide something for all ages. At the preview, youngsters 
delighted in the crocodiles, who came up to them jaws agape, and gazed up in 
wonder and admiration at Simba and Nala (his girlfriend), on their 31-foot-high 
float. Adults universally seemed taken with the dancing. By comparison, the 
"Aladdin" parade looked positively static. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the "Lion King" parade is a spin-off from the movie, one spectator, 
Donna Fiske of Fountain Valley, felt it actually eclipsed the screen version. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the movie, too, but the parade was better," Fiske said. "It generated 
more of a feeling of excitement." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: "The Lion King Celebration" parade.  
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday, July 1, through Sept. 5, at 2 and 4:30 p.m daily. (Call for time 
after Sept. 5.)  
</P>
<P>
 Where: Disneyland, 1313 Harbor Blvd., Anaheim.  
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the Santa Ana (5) Freeway to the Harbor Boulevard exit and 
head south.  
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: Free with Disneyland admission: adults, $31; children, $25.  
</P>
<P>
 Where to call: (714) 999-4565.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: BRUCE DAIGREPONT "PETITE CADEAU" IMAGO  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Daigrepont has long been one of the finest accordionists in Cajun music, but 
with this album his instrumental prowess is matched note for note by his 
songwriting and his band's driving support. The result is an all-around 
appealing album that puts him in a league with Beausoleil's genre-transcending 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10 songs Daigrepont wrote, he has created several that should quickly 
join the ranks of decades-old songs that form the heart of traditional Cajun 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 There are songs that celebrate the simple joys to be found on the streets of 
New Orleans ("Tipitina Two Step") or a visit to a favorite uncle's place ("Nonc 
Willie"). 
</P>
<P>
 His love songs are honest and unadorned ("La Clef De Mon Coeur"). 
</P>
<P>
 The non-originals include two instrumentals from other master accordionists 
(Wade Fruge and Aldus Roger) and Creole fiddler Canray Fontenot's prison lament 
"Barres de La Prison." 
</P>
<P>
 The wry ode he sings to his young daughter in "BeBe (De La Famille)" becomes 
all the more poignant with the album closing "Le Tempos Est Apres Marcher," 
which notes the all-too-quick passing of time. 
</P>
<P>
 The aural ambience on several of the tracks recalls a vibrant country dance 
hall, which makes the tunes feel all the more rooted to the rural area in which 
this music was born. RANDY LEWIS

TALKING UP TO THE KIDS; THE CAT IN THE HAT IS SERIOUS ABOUT EDUCATIONAL, 
SOCIAL, RACIAL ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for the Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a comedian, James Stephens III can be a pretty serious fellow. 
</P>
<P>
 Take kids. He thinks children are the future (though he has none). He wants 
young blacks to get an education, and his involvement starts close to the 
heart, with his 15 nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always push education with them," he said by phone Monday afternoon from 
Los Angeles, where he was preparing to tape a show for A&E's "Evening at the 
Improv." "I'd take $100 in ones, and we'd go out on the lawn, and they'd answer 
questions. And I'd give them a dollar. A couple of them are in college, and 
they still like to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also have them write three- to five-page essays for $5. I correct them and 
send them back. Black kids' writing and verbal skills aren't up-to-date. We're 
not really there. I'm realistic about a lot of things. There's only a handful 
of black people in this country who are able to compete. We're not 
fundamentally sound when it comes down to education. We need to compete in the 
world, not just in the neighborhood. . . . There's just not enough black 
businesses (to support blacks)." 
</P>
<P>
 To help get the word out, Stephens, who spends about half the year on the road 
doing clubs and colleges, makes a point of calling ahead and asking owners and 
promoters to contact schools to let them know he's available. Generally, he 
said, he does about two shows a week for schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are important to me," said Stephens, who plays Fullerton's Standing Room 
Only through Sunday. "It's like my childhood. Children are real to me. These 
kids are going to be in government in 20 years and maybe they'll (crack down) 
on drugs. I really believe that." 
</P>
<P>
 And the students, it seems, believe in Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had kids cry and come up to me after the show, saying (what I've talked 
about) is happening to them. I tell them they can talk to a counselor or let 
them know about the different avenues they can take." 
</P>
<P>
 This son of an Air Force pilot also uses his time on the road to help battle 
anti-black feelings, which he experienced as a child, splitting time between 
Washington, D.C., and the Carolinas. He could do a lot more with his white 
friends in Washington, he said, than he could in the Carolinas. But there were 
other areas with problems too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gone to Iowa, where they never get a chance to reach out and touch a 
black person. I'm saying, 'Hey, you don't have to run.' It's little changes 
like that. That's all. I've been blessed and have an opportunity. I make a lot 
more money than a lot of my old law school classmates. This is my way of giving 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up, Stephens was around kids a lot: He is the youngest of seven 
children. He also had an ear for music and impressions and learned to play 
several instruments, including trumpet, piano, guitar and bass guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 With a degree in political science from Georgetown University behind him, he 
was working toward a law degree at Seattle's University of Washington in the 
mid-'80s when he got the break that brought him to Los Angeles, where he just 
bought a home in Ladera Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a small role in Beau Bridges' 'Seven Hours to Judgment,' a low-budget B 
movie. I was doing stand-up up there. They were looking for some black comic 
relief. I stood in front of Beau Bridges and told him, 'I gotta get this part.' 
It was a small role to them, but to me it was big." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens never figured he could make a living entertaining people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed something of substance, like a lawyer. Being an attorney, I was 
going to try to create change," he said. Ironically, he's found he can do the 
same thing as a comic. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens' act is a blend of stand-up, impersonations (including a mean Louie 
Armstrong and Elvis) and song parodies, all of which he is trying to 
incorporate into a one-man show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making it a little more dramatic, talking a lot about serious things -- 
social changes and things like that," said Stephens, who continues to be the 
"cat in the hat" in his trademark Stetson with the brim flipped up because he 
likes the vaudeville effect. "Then we sum it up with the Louie Armstrong thing 
('What a Wonderful World')." 
</P>
<P>
 He draws from perceptions and experiences, which he weaves into his act for 
laughs, while simultaneously trying to deflate myths and stereotypes. In the 
parody "I'm a Negro," Stephens mentions the cultural differences among groups 
but also points out that people are the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the usual cable comedy shows, Stephens also appeared in the New Line 
film "Talking Dirty After Dark," and he recently finished touring with Aretha 
Franklin. His latest efforts focus on a sitcom ("Ruby's Refill") he is peddling 
to a network. 
</P>
<P>
 His work to promote self-esteem in kids and keep them off drugs is colored by 
his own experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never smoked, drank or did drugs in my life. My father was in an alcohol- 
and drug-related wreck when I was young. He went through the windshield. He was 
there, but he wasn't there. You know what I mean? 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was very strong. She was 35. When I was 8, she told me to get my 
act together or she was going to slap the black off of me," he said, before 
slipping into his act and recalling that he scanned his six older siblings to 
see whether she had ever made good on the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then a neighbor came over and said, 'Slap me. I need a job.' One guy was so 
black she had to hit him five times. He came back and said, 'Hit me again. They 
think I'm Mexican.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say this type of humor propagates stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens says hogwash. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedian sees such humor as a way to deal with and break down stereotypes. 
He also says he's just drawing on his culture, the same as white comics. And it 
upsets him that he should be scolded for talking about what he knows best. His 
heritage. His family. His perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't agree with that. It's a cultural difference as far as blacks or 
Mexicans are concerned. They live in a culture and that's what they've got to 
talk about. Why do I say 'black' in my show? Because that's how I grew up. We 
draw from our experiences. At the same time, it's understood that a white 
comedian doesn't have to say 'white' because it's understood. If we knew each 
other's culture, it would be easier to get the other's jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of HBO's "Def Jam" comics accuse Stephens of selling out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I can cross over and make white and black audiences laugh? They can 
only work one-dimensional. But I'm making it. 'Def Jam' comics . . . say (I'm 
not) funny. They just aren't attuned to what they're talking about. Robin 
Williams can make black people laugh. We laugh all the time. It's all in fun. I 
try to write so everyone can get my stuff."

DO IT!; RACES WILL PUT A SPARKLE IN THE FOURTH

 Runners who want to celebrate Independence Day with a race will have a couple 
of choices Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 One is part of Huntington Beach's Fourth of July festivities, which also 
include the city's 90th annual parade and a fireworks show (story and listings, 
Pages 8-9). A 5K run/walk starts the day at 7:45 a.m., and an 8K run follows at 
8:05 a.m. (A stroller and wheelchair division of the 8K starts at 8:03 a.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 The 5K is an addition to the annual 8K run. The shorter course -- added so 
that more families can take part in the event -- is a single loop along Main 
Street, heading south to a turnaround at Acacia Avenue and then north before 
turning around at Clay Avenue. The start and finish is at 17th Street, near 
Huntington Beach High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the 8K takes runners on the same loop for one pass, then on a 
shortened loop for the final section. The course has been moved from years 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 Prizes will go to the top three finishers in each age group. Special prize 
divisions include Huntington Beach residents, runners with strollers, 
wheelchair athletes and corporate teams. All registered participants get a 
T-shirt and refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the proceeds from the race benefit the parade, with a portion going to 
the March of Dimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Down in Laguna Niguel, the South Coast YMCA will offer its 16th annual Run in 
the Parks, with 10K and 5K runs starting at 7 and 8:15 a.m., respectively. 
Organizer Tom Ashen said that about 3,000 participants are expected, including 
serious and recreational runners as well as walkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both courses in the scenic, early-morning event follow paved paths and 
roadways through neighboring Crown Valley Community Park and Laguna Niguel 
Regional Park. The courses are described as relatively flat, following creek 
beds and skirting a lake.

 In these parts, coffeehouses are no more a new trend than shaved heads and 
pierced bellybuttons (both styles that have become mainstream among O.C. kids). 
But restrict the list to coffeehouses that are truly an alternative to 
nightclubs, and the names of qualifiers barely fill an espresso cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Further narrow that list to places that are also alternatives to traditional 
post-club hangs like Denny's or we-never-close Norm's, and you're likely to 
spend the hour between 2 and 3 a.m. stuck with a low-grade cup of joe and 
greasy chow.

 Tired of such a predicament and the indigestion that goes with it, longtime 
club promoter Dan Barrett (Indigo, Avalon, No White Pumps and disco Thursdays 
at Roxbury South) decided to do what he does best: identify a good thing and 
improve on it. This month Barrett and partners Robert Hamparyan and Tony Lopez 
debuted their new concept in coffeehouses: Not Just Java in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 On the edge of hot Lido Marina Village (home to Visions, Atlantis and the 
soon-to-reopen Bacchus), Not Just Java combines the Bohemian cool of 
coffeehouses with nightclub elements that have become de rigueur in the '90s: a 
luxe interior complete with Roman statues, nonalcoholic beer and bottled water, 
pool tables and a sound system spewing out alternative grinds -- via CD, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most nightclubs, Not Just Java doesn't charge exorbitant hourly rates 
to play pool (games at the two tables are $1), lets you satisfy the munchies 
throughout the night, and, best of all, doesn't kick you out at 2 a.m. On the 
weekends, this coffeehouse closes around 3, or whenever patrons disperse; 
during the week, closing time also depends on the crowd, anywhere from 11 p.m. 
to 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett and Hamparyan say they wanted to provide more than the average 
coffeehouse, which is usually the choice for a mellow night out. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Barrett's intentions have manifested themselves into the energy and 
attitude found in nightclubs, and the fashionable set that sometimes comes with 
it. But patrons can talk without screaming over the music or without the 
influence of alcohol (although a triple espresso can animate a conversation). 
</P>
<P>
 On that note, coffee drinks start at $1 and can rise to $5.25 for a triple 
dose. The cappuccino is among the lowest priced in town, at $1.50 for a small, 
$2.65 for large; come in between 6 and 8 a.m. Monday through Friday and pick 
one up for 99 cents. The popular house drink is the ice-blended mocha at $3.25; 
house-flavored coffees also sell fast, at $1 for a small, $1.25 for large. 
</P>
<P>
 Truly decaffeinated drinks are also available: herbal tea, $1.25; bottled 
water $2; Snapple, nonalcoholic beer, fruit juices and chocolate milk are 
$1.50; sodas and milk are $1. 
</P>
<P>
 If the mochas don't satisfy your sweet tooth, indulge in the cake and pastry 
selection. Most come courtesy of West Coast Productions, the pastry supplier 
for Bistro 201, Diva and Topaz. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's real food you're hankering for, try the sandwiches, meat or 
vegetarian, from $4.50 to $4.75. Salads, lasagnas and quiches will join the 
menu soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,000-square-foot space also boasts a small boutique (about 600 square 
feet) filled with handcrafted items for home and wardrobe: sarongs, bustiers, 
unisex shirts, picture frames and jewelry. Open the same hours as the 
coffeehouse, the shop has rung up some of its biggest sales late at night -- 
especially for swimsuits. The wee hours always did give one a different 
perspective on the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of offering acoustic entertainment or poetry reading sessions, as 
other coffeehouses do, Not Just Java will follow the cue of many clubs and hold 
weekly pool tournaments (a regular night will be announced shortly) and theme 
nights, such as Harley-Davidson Sundays, which kicked off last weekend.

REGRESSING: PLEASANT WAY TO PAST THE TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, David Haldane is a staff writer for the Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The truth is, I don't know whether I actually got run through by a Spanish 
sword on a Samoan beach at age 15. It's quite possible that I never worked as a 
manservant on a naval vessel in the 1830s. And I may just have been fantasizing 
when I remembered being a Dutch aviator in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether any of these things really happened might never be known. This much I 
do know, however: "Remembering" them during a past-life regression therapy 
session recently felt strangely gratifying. And it provided enough 
conversational material to last several lifetimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury is out for me as far as whether it's really reincarnation," Donna 
Kannard, my past-life regression hypnotherapist, said before introducing me to 
the misty nether world of my own subconscious. "Probably won't know until I'm 
dead. It may be just a metaphor; I know it works as a therapeutic tool." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it wasn't to deal with some pressing psychological problem that I 
decided to submit to the vagaries of hypnotherapy. Rather, it was for what 
Kannard described as a bit of "recreational" regression. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience began with me sitting on a couch in her Santa Ana office. "You 
are totally and completely relaxed," she told me in a gentle yet convincing 
voice. "Oh, it feels so wonderful to release all that tension and care. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, I'd been hypnotized before. Years ago, I'd dabbled extensively in 
what later came to be known as the human potential movement. Among other 
things, I'd experienced hypnosis and discovered that I made an excellent 
subject, as does almost any fool with a good imagination and weak will. So when 
Kannard suggested that we enter a tunnel, I was ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to begin to move backward in time," she instructed, "backward in 
time to one of your previous lifetimes. I want you to step into a tunnel to 
your own past. Create a vivid mental impression of a tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
 There it was, a sort of brown and earthy pathway through a mountainside. As 
she counted backward from 15 to one, I felt myself slowly, inexorably, drawn 
into it as Indiana Jones is into quicksand; if he knew what was good for him, 
he wouldn't be there in the first place. At the end of the tunnel, she told me, 
would be a past life. Suddenly it was there, that infernal island dotted with 
coconut trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on a beach," I told Kannard. "I'm about 15. A bunch of men on boats are 
rowing ashore. They have swords." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't feel like I was making it up. It was as if the images were just 
popping into my head; as if they were happening in a movie, coming from 
somewhere outside myself. The best way I can describe the experience is to say 
that it felt like a dream, yet one happening while I was fully awake and able 
to provide an ongoing narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 After that first life, the one in which the soldiers killed me on the beach, 
it was fairly easy to flit back and forth in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, it seems, I had been a servant aboard a ship in the 1800s. My master was 
a handsome young naval officer wearing a black uniform with plumes on its 
shoulders. Later I had visions of having been an astronomer living alone in a 
book-lined house in some quaint European town. And, finally, I got images of a 
pilot in the 1930s walking around in baggy pants somewhere in Holland. That 
life sprang to mind complete with a touching picnic scene in which I said 
goodby to a sad-eyed girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 There didn't seem to be any connecting theme to the images; if there was some 
karmic message in all of it, it went over my head. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there did seem to be an odd sense of relief in the experience, a sort of 
unburdening as if the very act of "remembering" had a liberating effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein, Kannard explained later, lies the therapeutic value of past-life 
regression; its apparent ability to give rest to otherwise restless souls and, 
in some cases -- especially when directed at particular questions or issues -- 
provide insight into unresolved problems of the present. "Most people feel 
better walking out than walking in," she said of the 90-minute sessions, for 
which she charges $60 to $75. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time, I decided, I'll try to enter the fray with a specific issue in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Like why is it that I hate tuna so much? Or why do I have such a hard time 
getting up in the morning? Or, most important, why oh why do I keep coming up 
with such wacky self-deprecating ideas for stories? 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be that I am a former sadist working out his karma from a past life 
by being masochistic? Perhaps a one-time convict inflicting penance on himself? 
</P>
<P>
 If I go back far enough, I figure, I'll probably discover some horrible truth. 
Like maybe I once was an editor.

GIVE US LIBERTY, GIVE US BLASTS; THIS 4TH FEATURES SPEECHES, BATTLES AND OTHER 
FIREWORKS

<P>
 For the tradition-minded, this Fourth of July will offer plenty of comfortably 
familiar events to mark the independence of the United States: 
community-oriented fairs, picnics, parades and, of course, fireworks shows. 
</P>
<P>
 One event, however, presents a new twist, at least for these parts. Patrick 
Henry will deliver his "Give me liberty or give me death" speech, Gen. George 
Washington will review his troops, and the battles of Lexington and Concord 
will again be fought. 
</P>
<P>
 The replica of Independence Hall at Knott's Berry Farm will be the site of 
what is being called an American Revolutionary Encampment, Friday through 
Monday, with a variety of historical re-enactments, craft and cooking 
demonstrations and actors presenting the words of such figures as Henry, 
Washington and Thomas Paine. All the presentations will be offered several 
times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrations include drill and musket firing by the Southern California 
Colonial Arts Council. Presentations of 1770s-era cooking (bean soup, corn 
bread, guber peas and boiled potatoes with stew), weaving, spinning, leather 
crafting, woodworking, tin-smithing, blacksmithing and violin-making will be 
offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's is offering the event as part of its Adventures in Education series 
for Southern California schools, although the public is invited, with free 
admission and three-hour parking. Hours are Saturday through Monday, 9 a.m. to 
6 p.m. Independence Hall is across the street from the main Knott's entrance. 
Knott's also offers fireworks shows nightly through the summer, beginning 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Huntington Beach will again be the site of a Fourth of July parade 
-- just as it has been every year since 1904, when the city celebrated the 
opening of Henry Huntington's Red Line, the Pacific Electric Railway. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade will start at 9:30 a.m. at Main Street and Acacia Avenue and wind 
up about two hours later at Main Street and Clay Avenue. About 200 entrants 
have signed up for the parade, including drill teams, bands, equestrian units, 
color guards, floats and antique autos. TV personality Sarah Purcell will be 
celebrity grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers predict some 300,000 spectators and say the event is the biggest 
Fourth of July parade west of the Mississippi, both in length and in number of 
spectators. The city is also offering a Fourth of July fair Friday through 
Monday at Worthy Park, at the corner of 17th and Main streets. A city fireworks 
show begins at 7 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Centennial Park in Santa Ana will be the site of a three-day Independence Day 
fair beginning Saturday, with entertainment, food booths, carnival rides and, 
on Monday, a fireworks show. Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley will also see 
the return of the Fiesta Friday through Monday, with carnival rides, live music 
and a Monday fireworks show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garden Grove Lions Club will offer a musical variety show Monday at 7 p.m. 
at Bolsa Grande High School Stadium, followed by a fireworks show at 9 p.m. 
Fullerton offers its Community Fireworks Show and Festival beginning at 4 p.m. 
Monday at Fullerton Union High School Athletic Stadium, with fireworks at 9 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, the Pacific Symphony returns Monday to open 
its summer series with a swing-oriented program, along with picnicking and 
fireworks. The Angels, alas, will be out of town on the Fourth.

CARE TO SHARE THE JOKE?; IT'S OK TO LAUGH IN THESE CLASSES . . . IN FACT, SUCH 
IMPROVISATION IS ENCOURAGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken covers children's events for The Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If your kids think lunch and recess are the only part of school worth smiling 
about, imagine how they'd grin if Cherie Kerr sat in the principal's chair. 
</P>
<P>
 The director of the Orange County Crazies comedy troupe, Kerr thinks humor, 
specifically improvisational comedy, should get as much attention from school 
administrators as readin', writin' and 'rithmetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, improv classes would garner a lot more laughs than, say, basic 
trigonometry, but it's more than that. Kerr maintains that children who are 
given formal training in comedy can enhance concentration, problem-solving and 
interpersonal skills they can use throughout their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 She plans to demonstrate that in two improvisational workshop series at Orange 
Coast College: "Fun and Gains" for children 8 to 13 and "Spontaneous Comedy" 
for youths 14 to 18. The sessions began June 28, but students will be accepted 
late and will be given makeup classes; the program continues through July 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will learn improvisational technique through exercises and 
onstage interaction with their peers and possibly members of the Crazies 
troupe. In addition to helping youngsters develop their own sense of comedy and 
timing, the classes can also sharpen students' ability to think on their feet, 
Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of what we do in these classes is mental aerobics," she said during a 
recent phone interview from the Crazies' Santa Ana headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think about it, there isn't a day in our lives that everything comes 
out the way we planned it; almost everything in life is improvised," she said. 
"If you have greater mental agility, you can be more spontaneous (and) more 
creative in your problem-solving." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerr cited an exercise she commonly uses in her classes: from a bowl, students 
draw slips of paper -- each with a different, unrelated word on it -- then 
build a routine about a fictitious company using the words. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll come up with something like 'X-Ray Topless Tennis Shoe Company' and 
they have to explain to a caller on the phone what their company is and why 
that person should buy their product," Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids just go off into the wild blue yonder. The end result is something 
funny and very creative because there are no limits to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerr said she is convinced that a young person who studies improv will be 
better equipped for any career as an adult. Her own start in improv came at the 
ripe age of 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "My older sister looked just like Shirley Temple; everybody fussed over her," 
she recalled. "My parents -- my mom was a dancer, and my dad is a musician -- 
told me that one night, my sister started to do her cute little dance bit and 
out of nowhere, I took off on this nonstop stand-up routine; I was 
impersonating their friends and everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "They couldn't leave; I even made them late for their gig." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she may have only planned to steal the spotlight temporarily, Kerr's 
comic explosion as a child was just the beginning. With only a few years' 
hiatus during junior high and part of high school ("We had moved to a new area, 
and I was afraid my peers wouldn't think comedy was so cool," she said), and 
occasional career detours into journalism and copy writing, Kerr said she has 
been learning, performing, writing or producing comedy ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 A founding member of the popular L.A. comedy troupe the Groundlings, she 
established the Crazies in Orange County in 1989 and continues to serve as its 
head writer and artistic director. Through the Crazies and on her own, she has 
led classes for more than 20 years in improv comedy for adults, including a 
10-year-old series designed to teach business executives to "be more human" and 
workshops for aspiring professional comics. She has also worked with children 
through schools and community groups around Southern California. In the near 
future, she said, she hopes to establish an improv performance troupe for 
children and youths, as well as a program for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 During the course of her career, Kerr said, she has worked with such 
successful comics as Lorraine Newman and Phil Hartman but added that she's been 
most inspired by the effect comedy has had on the lives of her own students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember one kid I worked with -- he's a theater major now -- who was 
definitely on his way to self-destructing before 18," said Kerr. "He wasn't 
interested in anything, not sports, not schoolwork . . . but he was kind of a 
(wise guy). 
</P>
<P>
 "I started to pull it out of him and put him in parts that play to his 
character . . . and he just ran with it. Comedy really turned him around." 
</P>
<P>
 What: Improvisational comedy workshops for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 When: "Fun and Gains" for ages 8 to 13 meets Tuesday and Thursday from 9 to 
10:20 a.m. through July 14. "Spontaneous Comedy" for ages 14 to 18 meets 
Tuesday and Thursday from 10:30 to 11:50 a.m. through July 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Business Education Building, Orange Coast College, 2701 Fairview Road, 
Costa Mesa. "Fun and Gains" is held in Room 101A; "Spontaneous Comedy" is in 
Room 102. 
</P>

REWIND: HESTON PLAYS DRIFTER 'WILL PENNY' RIGHT ON THE MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a moment in the thoughtful, touching 1968 Western "Will Penny" when a 
young man asks the title character how he knows so much about frontier 
survival. "Well," the aging, aimless ranch hand responds, "even a blind hog 
roots up an acorn now and then." 
</P>
<P>
 The proverb sums up the wayward life of Will Penny (Charlton Heston), a 
simple, kind-hearted drifter whose years have somehow slipped away during the 
treks from one range job to the next. Almost 50, his body is weary of the hard 
life. But with no family, home or stake, all he can do is ride forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny doesn't think much about what his life could have been until he meets 
Catherine Allen (Joan Hackett), an educated Easterner trying to make her way to 
San Francisco with her young son. When the two are deserted by their hired 
escort, Penny reluctantly becomes their protector. 
</P>
<P>
 The unlikely threesome grows close, and for the first time in his life, Penny 
feels a sense of belonging, a connection. But while he truly loves his newfound 
family, he is nagged by questions of whether he deserves -- or can handle -- 
this new lifestyle. But before Penny can resolve these anxieties, the homicidal 
Preacher Quint (Donald Pleasence) arrives on the scene to settle a score with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackett's strong performance as an independent, resourceful woman seeking a 
better life gives the film a dimension that many Westerns lack, while the 
genre's all-important bad guy quota is filled menacingly by the wild-eyed 
Pleasence and Bruce Dern, who plays the preacher's dim, malevolent son. 
</P>
<P>
 The requisite gunfights are executed dramatically, but the film's most 
compelling conflict is in the heart of Penny. After the dust settles, he must 
decide whether he will take the terrifying step of leaving the only life he has 
ever known, or whether he will abandon the only love he has ever found to ride 
off into the lonely, lonely sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will Penny" (1968), directed by Tom Gries. 109 minutes. Not rated.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: DANDY CAGNEY GOES TO TOWN WITH ROLE IN 'YANKEE DOODLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Cagney wasn't the only actor to swaddle himself in the American flag. 
Orange County's own John Wayne, for one, wrapped the Stars and Stripes around 
so tightly in his many war movies that some of us wondered how he could breathe 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 But he-man patriotism was Wayne's calling card. You couldn't say the same for 
Cagney early in his career, and that's what made "Yankee Doodle Dandy" such a 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Cagney, with his grapefruit-in-your-face machismo and alley-wise smarts, was a 
gangster, pure and simple. He may have been a personable, even lovable, one -- 
but a bad boy nonetheless. From "Public Enemy" in 1930 and onward through a 
handful of crime pictures, Cagney etched his screen persona. 
</P>
<P>
 He took a screeching right turn in 1942, the year "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (which 
screens for free at the Cypress Senior Citizen Center on Wednesday and July 8 
afternoons) came out. In this sentimental Michael Curtiz-directed picture, 
Cagney portrays George M. Cohan, Broadway's red-white-and-blue darling during 
the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohan made his reputation by writing musicals with homey values and often 
bulging with patriotic songs. Among others, he penned "Over There," the 
unofficial anthem of World War I. "Yankee Doodle Dandy" begins at the 
triumphant end of Cohan's career, in a White House meeting with F.D.R., where a 
series of flashbacks takes us through the many ups and few downs of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtiz sets the tone by dwelling suggestively on Cohan's birthday on the 
Fourth of July. We know right off that the plucky Cohan (played as a boy by 
antsy child actor Douglas Croft) is destined to be America's sweetheart, 
whether dressed in a kid's short pants or the numerous costumes he sheathed 
himself in as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 There's mawkish romanticism in Curtiz's and screenwriters Robert Buckner's and 
Edmund Joseph's hero-worship, but it rarely annoys as much as it should. Credit 
Cagney's performance with literally dancing us over these rough passages. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences of the day tended to forget that Cagney started in theater as a 
song-and-dance man, but they were soon reminded of it in "Yankee Doodle Dandy." 
He's a thrill to watch, jumping, wiggling and lurching through some of the most 
athletic and idiosyncratic steps ever captured on film. When the movie starts 
to fade, Curtiz just puts Cagney back on stage, and our interest is revived. 
</P>
<P>
 His latent edginess, which made him the consummate gangster, is here too. Even 
when Cohan is trying to be gentle and generous, the quirks in Cagney's 
personality spit through. That deflates enough of the arch melodrama and keeps 
us wondering what Cohan is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" is short on answers -- picture biographies 
from the '40s tended to ignore facts, opting instead for more emotional 
entertainment -- but that doesn't dissuade us. Curtiz and Cagney make their 
point, that dreamland America can be a helluva place, especially for gutter 
snipes (like Cagney) turned glitter stars (like Cohan). 
</P>

NEWSBITES: CUISINE FROM ALL OVER THE MAP (OF CHINA)

 P.F. Chang's China Bistro, a popular Scottsdale, Ariz., restaurant, recently 
opened in Newport Beach. It serves selections from the major regions of China 
-- Canton, Shanghai, Szechwan and Hunan -- and from Mongolia. The owner, 
Arizona restaurateur Paul M. Fleming, also owns Ruth's Chris Steak Houses in 
Beverly Hills and Palm Desert, Z'Tejas Grills in Scottsdale, Austin, Tex., and 
Las Vegas, and several other restaurants in the Southwest and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 The new P.F. Chang's has entered the location vacated by Michael Kang's Five 
Feet Too, between the Cheesecake Factory and California Pizza Kitchen, at 
Fashion Island. Among the entrees ($8 to $13) are orange peel shrimp, spicy 
ground chicken with eggplant, Paul's catfish in black bean sauce and lemon 
scallops. Appetizers include Peking ravioli, minced chicken in a lettuce cup 
and sesame shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
 The decor was designed by the owner's wife, Kelly Fleming, and combines the 
influences of ancient China and contemporary America. A historic mural, 
miniaturized from a mid-12th-Century screen painting, tells the stories of 
emperors, gods and guardians. Slate and hardwood floors, high ceilings and a 
color scheme of mustard, mauve and dark purple add a modern feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours are 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 11:30 a.m. to 
midnight Friday and Saturday, and noon to 11 p.m. on Sunday.

SAVOR THE RENAISSANCE OF ROMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

weekly for the Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 Hold the Borgia and pass the De Medici. At Ti Amo, an unusual new Laguna Beach 
dinner house, chef Peter Higginson is having fun with what he terms 
"Renaissance Italian cuisine." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you remember this spot when it was called Monique. If so, you won't 
recognize it. Co-owners Robert Castoro and Martine Hermansen have refurnished 
it with a roaring fireplace, Spanish tile floors, high-backed tapestry chairs 
and a trompe-l'oeil fresco painted by Hermansen. Its rich Renaissance style 
makes it one of the loveliest and most romantic restaurants in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, you might also eat in the partially cloistered patio. It's 
delightful to dine in this sunken space surrounded by lush plants, fresh air 
breezing in off the ocean and caressing your skin. The music out here is 
soothing, almost narcotizing: maybe mournful, Celtic-flavored ballads by Enya 
or (in keeping with the restaurant's antique theme) a haunting Gregorian chant. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Unusual as the food may sometimes be, it wouldn't be accurate to say it 
represents what Italians -- or anyone, for that matter -- ate in the 15th and 
16th centuries. A good number of Higginson's dishes are made with tomatoes, 
which were newcomers from the Americas in 16th-Century Europe and not yet part 
of the diet (they were usually grown as ornamental plants, and when eaten at 
all they were picked green and fried). Largely this "Renaissance" menu is an 
anthology of Italian dishes fashionable on Melrose Avenue, 1994: bruschetta, 
ahi, carpaccio, gnocchi. 
</P>
<P>
 Higginson will be the first to admit that he is cooking in the spirit of fun 
rather than as an academic exercise. Taken that way, the concept becomes more 
palatable. After all, Renaissance food is probably not for everybody. In the 
15th Century, people thought nothing of flavoring a dish with ginger, pepper, 
clove, mustard, vinegar, dried fruits and cheese, a combination that would 
rapidly cloy the modern palate. 
</P>
<P>
 On this menu, look for subtler dashes of saffron, mint, sage, lemon, walnut or 
pistachio instead. Culingiones di melanzane e noci , for instance, is billed as 
Sardinian ravioli with eggplant, walnuts, ricotta, Romano cheese and mint in a 
chunky tomato sauce. It turns out to be chewy noodle pockets with a grainy, 
eccentric filling. Pistachio d'agnello con peperoni arrostiti salsa al Madeira 
is pistachio-crusted medallions of tender lamb with roasted peppers and a wine 
sauce. It's a complex, heavy dish you can really picture on a Renaissance 
table, and Higginson does a beautiful job with it. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best appetizers is goose carpaccio. It's dark red smoked meat, 
sliced thinner than prosciutto and richer-tasting than country ham. In this 
dish the topping (red onions, raisins, citrus juices and shaved Parmesan) 
happens to adds a proper Renaissance touch of sweet and sour. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be put off by the appearance of the (irregularly available) wild boar 
sausage. It may look like a Farmer John patty, but its gamy complexity and 
intense flavor make it a nearly perfect match for the crisp, mildly spiced 
peaches on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Minestrone di fagioli alla Milanese is the hearty bean and pasta soup eaten 
all over present-day Italy, and this one contains no major surprises. On the 
other hand, gnocchi alla Romana turn out to be nutmeg-scented semolina crab 
cakes served with lemon aioli , not the potato-based dumplings we associate 
with the term gnocchi. The cakes are dense and good, and though they are 
slightly one-dimensional, Higginson still gets an A for effort. Nutmeg, lemon 
and semolina were all big-time Renaissance ingredients.  
</P>
<P>
 Other than those ravioli, the pastas don't venture much into terra incognita. 
There is the inevitable version of angel hair pasta, cappellini di verdure , 
with seasonal veggies and a basil tomato sauce. I enjoyed my fettuccine 
carbonara, a rich, cream sauce pasta made with prosciutto, pancetta , 
scallions, peas and the oddball addition of hot pepper. Linguine alla Bolognese 
arrosti is your standard dish of noodles with meat sauce, but a satisfying 
version that adds roasted peppers, mushrooms and sausage. 
</P>
<P>
 Anytime I come back, I intend to order pears ripiene alla Gorgonzola as an 
intermediate course. This dish is truly a refresher. It is composed of pears, 
Gorgonzola cheese, romaine lettuce and walnuts in a delicious balsamic vinegar 
dressing.  
</P>
<P>
 That should lighten the palate sufficiently to take on something like the 
pollo affumicata . The best thing about this monstrously large half chicken, 
smoked and flavored with fresh herbs, is that it has a persistently smoky 
aftertaste (well, the potato cake on the side is deliciously aromatic). The 
skin, unfortunately, is flaccid.  
</P>
<P>
 The menu lists cusinetti di vitello made from free-range veal (I do suspect 
most 15th-Century veal was free-range). You may know this dish of pounded veal 
sauteed with prosciutto, Fontina cheese and a powerful sage demi-glace sauce 
under a more familiar name, saltimbocca.  
</P>
<P>
 And now to the menu's infamous tonno : sashimi-sized chunks of raw ahi 
arranged in a row. It looks rather Japanese at first, but the tuna sits on a 
bed of mildly caramelized onions, and at each of the four corners of the 
rectangular dish is a bit of tasty red pepper puree mingling with lemon 
shavings. This is truly exotic. 
</P>
<P>
 The desserts are standards such as tiramisu, chocolate torte, blueberry creme 
brulee (rather eggy) and assorted ice creams, all reasonably well executed. But 
the best dessert is probably the romantic mood an evening here should put you 
in.  
</P>
<P>
 It worked for owners Castoro and Hermansen. The day before the restaurant 
opened, April 1, Castoro proposed to her, and she accepted. Ti amo is Italian 
for "I love you," and reportedly that has been true since well before the 
Renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ti Amo is moderately expensive. Antipasti are $3.95 to $8.95. Pastas are $8.95 
to $14.95. Secondi (main courses) are $14.95 to $18.95.

LOST IN O.C.: METAPHORS BE WITH YOU ON DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Washburn, Jim Washburn is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly 
to the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I went to bed last night wondering just what I'd be writing about in this 
column today. That might seem a bit last-minute, but I find a deadline is like 
a thick window I can't see through unless my head is slammed right up against 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before I woke up this morning, I had a nightmare. I was in a college 
class and about 15 years older than anyone else in it. The dream came with the 
background that I'd probably been able to coast along in the class with a 
minimum of information and a nasty wit. What made it a nightmare was that this 
was the put-up-or-shut-up time of a final exam. I wasn't wearing pajamas, but I 
was otherwise wholly unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a test on the writings of the German philosopher/author dude Goethe. I 
had trouble with the first two questions, the second of which was some sort of 
Goethe in-joke that the professor -- a woman in an old-fashioned print dress -- 
and all the students except me had a big laugh over.  
</P>
<P>
 On the third one, an essay question, I encountered a real problem. I'd written 
my first sentence, "I believe Goethe used the devil as a metaphor for mankind" 
and then noticed someone had inked smutty drawings on the lower part of the 
page. 
</P>
<P>
 I crumpled it up and started over, first on wax paper that my ballpoint pen 
skidded over, then using a red Crayola, which crumbled instead of wrote. Then I 
rifled through stacks of my reporter's notebooks, but every page was already 
filled. The other students were chugging along. A clock showed 25 minutes had 
passed, and I was still trying to get this one dumb sentence down on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 I should point out that I have no particular opinion regarding Goethe using 
the devil as a metaphor for mankind. For all I know he used him as a credit 
reference. My knowledge of German literature was chiefly limited to what the 
Krauts were saying in Sgt. Fury comic books. What they usually said was "Gott 
in Himmel!" right before Sgt. Fury or one of his Howling Commandos bayoneted 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dream, finally, I found myself in an anteroom to the classroom, rolling 
modeling clay into worm shapes that I then made into letters. On tables running 
the circumference of the room, I placed the words, letter by letter, on top of 
clay figures. I made a devil that looked like Don Knotts and recall placing the 
word "metaphor" on a clay steer with big gonads and a duck on its back. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought, "Maybe I can fob this off as folk art." Then the class bell rang, 
and I woke up. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd be interested in any good interpretations you might have on this dream. 
Me, I think dreams are like cable theft: It's free entertainment, but you're 
never sure when they're going to come break the door down. 
</P>
<P>
 I find most of my nightmares are deadline- or preparation-oriented. There's 
some small irony to me being a journalist -- a profession in which deadlines 
are constant, absolute and unforgiving -- because I used to dread deadlines 
like nothing else when I was in school.  
</P>
<P>
 I got skipped a grade for a while in elementary school -- skipped right past 
the part when kids learned the multiplication tables, and am still fuzzy on 
them. I became further addled because a kid had told me about fractions, and I 
didn't quite get it. I thought they were perhaps something like germs, 
sinisterly sticking unseen to a number. Hence, if I had to add 4 + 7 + 11 + 9, 
I'd come up with 32 because I'd figure that with four numbers all those 
invisible fractions had probably added up to another 1.  
</P>
<P>
 When it came time every day to do math, I literally would hide under my desk. 
I tried to give the impression -- should the teacher spot me -- that there just 
happened to be something really interesting going on down there that had 
diverted my attention, and head, below the desk. Given that I'd still get 
called on, I suppose it was a hard impression to maintain for 45 minutes every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus began a pattern of avoidance that became so strong by the time I was in 
college that I even successfully avoided graduating. With term papers, I'd 
never start writing them until the night before they were due, or sometimes on 
the morning they were due. I got so bad at deadlines that at the end of one 
term a sympathetic writing teacher just asked me what grade I needed to stay 
afloat and let me to get my overdue papers to him that summer.  
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, though, I'd be up all night, bugged to distraction by the 
insistent hum of an electric typewriter. I'd write dreadful careening stuff, 
like one English Lit paper about "Wuthering Heights" where I took the premise 
"What if Heathcliff had had antlers?" I thought at the time that all this 
procrastination was my way of not taking "the system" seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 On reflection, I think it was my way of being terrified of my limitations. By 
turning in stuff written in a caffeinated stupor, I could divorce myself from 
it. If I got an A, the professor was an idiot. If I got a D, I wasn't 
perturbed, since it was done under insane conditions. In either case, I never 
had to say, "This is me. This is the best I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 The weird thing that's transpired over the years is I think I like deadlines 
now. The wonderful musician Captain Beefheart once said, "A little paranoia 
makes a good propeller." I think that if you have to grab at straws at the last 
minute, you can sometimes pull a thick malted along with them. Writing gets to 
be more immediate, more like improvised music.  
</P>
<P>
 I find the same can be true doing some other things, like cooking while your 
guests wait. The last minute is as good as any, as long as you're willing to 
pass a botched souffle off as flan, or as a metaphor for mankind.  
</P>

3-HOUR TOUR: MAKING A CASE ON KATELLA FOR THE BEER NECESSITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to the Times Orange County.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hooked on trout or stout? A visit to Katella Avenue in Orange can be a reel 
experience. Barbecued fish is another lure. 
</P>
<P>
 11 to noon: "When brewing is outlawed, only outlaws will brew beer," reads a 
sign on the door at Fun Fermentations. In the meantime, it's open season, and 
the store offers everything you need to make your own at home. 
</P>
<P>
 You can make like a mad scientist with floating thermometers and lots of clear 
plastic tubing, or depending on your inclinations, pick up Epsom salts, 
licorice or a slide rule-like apparatus called Brewers Buddy Ready Reference 
Calculator. Bottle labels include Old Froth and Slosh; Laid Back Beer, 
featuring a naked woman on the label; Black Death Beer, with a skull and 
crossbones, and more wholesome Upstream Beer, depicting a creek and mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 A beginning beer kit, about $50, includes a six-gallon fermenter, Fun Beer 
mix, yeast, a home beer-making book with recipes, air lock, rubber stop, 
siphon, bottle brush, caps and capper. According to "utility player" Dana 
Jordan, the kit makes a "good pale ale, nothing slicked up about it. First 
thing is to get the confidence going. If (people) feel comfortable with the 
process the first time through, next time we tell them to shoot for the moon." 
</P>
<P>
 For those shooting for the moon, malt extracts cover some of the possibilities 
with unhopped dark, unhopped amber, light amber, light hopped, dark hopped and 
amber hopped varieties. Hops range from Styrian Goldings to Tettnang to Czech 
Saaz. Or you can throw in some fruit extracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Home brewing isn't limited to beer: You can home-brew soda pop in a variety of 
fruit flavors. Bread lovers can take advantage of sourdough starter packages, 
and winemakers (kits also available) can use juice concentrates from 
Johannesburg Riesling, Chenin Blanc and Zinfandel grapes; oak chips will help 
make yours a show-stopping Chardonnay. Titles include "Making Vinegar at Home," 
"Sweet and Hard Cider" and "Cheese Making Made Easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 12:30: Beer and fishing go together like -- well, like hooks and bait. 
Phenix Rod & Bait Co. doesn't look like much from the outside; inside it's a 
similarly unassuming combination office/showroom/mini-factory, where you can 
watch the staff pouring hooks with molten lead or making colorful lures as 
beautiful as any earrings. 
</P>
<P>
 The store offers a cornucopia of baits. Plastic baits alone come in 12 
different shapes, including Saturn salt leech, weedless spider skirt and mighty 
tubes, and more than 80 colors such as firecracker, bubble gum, pumpkin, motor 
oil, june bug and oxblood, many with metal flakes and available in a 
bewildering array of combinations; 1,500 can be ordered by number. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract bass, for instance, you might try No. 629, an electric-blue salt 
lizard; salt is added to release flavor when fish bite. But precisely what 
shape and color to choose depends on weather, type of lake, condition of water 
and time of day. Phenix is not open on weekends. "Uh- uh, " confirmed owner 
Larry Howard. Presumably they're gone fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 12:30 to 1:30: Just the thought of fishing can work up an appetite. At the 
Asian Deli, specialties include pempek, fried egg in fish cake appetizer 
($3.75), and ikan bakar pedes, whole barbecued fish ($5.50), both very spicy 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The establishment bills itself as Chinese-Indonesian fast food, but the fare 
is far more Indonesian than Chinese, and the emphasis on takeout belittles the 
quality. Don't let the limited atmosphere -- a few Indonesian dolls and golden 
elephants for sale on the counter -- fool you: It's not only worth a sit-down 
meal, but as many visits as it takes to get through the 60-item menu. 
</P>
<P>
 1:30 to 2: If you want to make your mark in life, stop in next door at Stamp 
Fever, where "Under the Sea" is but one category of rubber stamps. There's also 
"School Daze," "Dinos and Dragons," 'Abbott and Costello" and "Classic 
Winnie-the-Pooh Rubber Stamp Sets for Stationery, Parties and School." 
</P>
<P>
 People use the stamps, colored ink pads and marking pens to design their own 
greeting cards, gift tags and invitations. Teachers make flash cards and stamp

VIOLENCE INTRUDES ON POOL, AN OASIS FOR YOUTHS IN WATTS; PARKS: SIX LIFEGUARDS 
ARE HURT, ONE CRITICALLY, AT WILL ROGERS PARK. NEW FEES THAT EXCLUDE SOME ARE 
ALSO CITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Watts, where escapes from the summer heat are comparatively few, the pool 
at Will Rogers Park has been an oasis of sorts, a place where parents could 
drop off the kids and know they were safe and having fun. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last three days, six lifeguards have been attacked -- and one 
critically injured -- in two separate violent outbreaks by teen-agers. All of a 
sudden, with Los Angeles still simmering in the first hot blast of summer, 
residents of the lower-income community are left wondering if there are any 
havens. 
</P>
<P>
 "This pool is a place where everyone would come to cool off," said Veola 
Williams, a grandmother whose children grew up using the pool. "Mothers would 
bring their children down here and let them play all day. But now they can't do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities cited several possible contributors to the unusual violence: gang 
hostilities, the heat, the youthful zeal that always accompanies the opening of 
public pools for the summer, and new admission fees imposed to keep the pool 
operating. For the first time in more than a decade, residents must pay to take 
a dip -- $1 for children, $2 for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, the lifeguards are respected," said Samuel V. Jones, assistant 
director of the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation, who 
blamed the violence mainly on unruly gangs but conceded that the new fees might 
have aggravated tensions. Jones said he could not recall any previous incidents 
in which lifeguards were so vigorously assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't, to my knowledge, had a lifeguard beaten to within an inch of his 
life," he said. "I feel angry. There is something that we should be able to do 
to deal with this type of problem -- not just in the parks, but in the 
community in general. We are letting a very small number of people set the 
agenda for the way we live." 
</P>
<P>
 The first attack Monday, on the pool's first day of summer swimming, occurred 
after a lifeguard came off his stand and dunked a teen-ager who had been 
performing "cannonballs" off the diving board, senior lifeguard Arten Thompson 
said. At that point, several suspected gang members jumped the lifeguard and a 
melee erupted as other lifeguards tried to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 One lifeguard suffered a broken nose and another required stitches for a cut 
on his foot suffered during the scuffle, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, more serious violence began with the apparent hazing of a 
13-year-old who was being initiated into a gang, Thompson said. As one 
lifeguard tried to protect the teen-ager from excessive roughness, lifeguard 
Paul Alba pulled another attacker away, then was beaten. During the fight, one 
lifeguard said, about 10 older gang members -- all 16 or older, he estimated -- 
scaled the 10-foot-high fence to join in. 
</P>
<P>
 Alba was stomped and severely beaten, and was listed in critical condition 
Wednesday at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. He had not regained 
consciousness after gashing his head on the concrete pool deck, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital, family members gathered around his bed in the intensive-care 
unit, encouraging him to emerge from the coma while he awaited surgery to 
relieve pressure on the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Alba's wife, Veronica, tearfully remembered how she had warned him against 
working at Will Rogers pool this summer for fear of gang violence. The veteran 
lifeguard, who had worked there for three summers, had been hired at another 
park, but decided to return to a place where he was known. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want him to go back because I thought it was too dangerous there, 
but he told me nothing was going to happen," she said. "He said he would be all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Alba had coached the swim team at Will Rogers. He is a graduate of Huntington 
Park High, where he swam the 50- and 100-yard freestyle events. He and Veronica 
have a 9-month-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loves kids and he loves swimming," his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although outbreaks of teen-age violence are most common when pools open for 
the summer, county officials acknowledged that the new user fees have been a 
sore point. Lifeguards, in fact, were counseled about the potential for 
trouble, said Jones, the assistant county parks director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew there might be problems with the new fees and we have included them 
in the training sessions with the lifeguards, making them aware of the types of 
complaints and frustrations (that they might face)," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some staff report incidents where some kids were beginning to act 
up and, when the staff tried to stop it, they were told, 'Now that we're 
paying, you can't tell me anything,' " Jones added. "I don't know if it's 
widespread or just a couple of incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the violence, four Park Police cars were stationed outside the pool 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Located at 103rd Street and Central Avenue, only blocks from the flash point 
of the 1965 Watts riots, Will Rogers pool is one of the county's most heavily 
used. It serves Watts and adjoining unincorporated county territory, where many 
families cannot afford outings to the beach or to indoor, air-conditioned 
recreational spots. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the new fees, the wrought-iron fence bordering the pool has 
become a harsh dividing line between the haves and have-nots. Inside, the 
swimmers splash and cavort, while outside others only watch and endure the 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, one neighborhood resident, a 25-year-old who called himself 
Bronco, sat on a bench outside with a small crowd of those who could not afford 
to swim. A onetime member of the pool's diving team, Bronco said he would love 
to be out there, if only he had $2 to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my life I've been going to this pool for free," he said. "I'd be in there 
now if I had the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Netherly, whose 10-year-old son was frolicking in the water, said he had 
been approached by several children asking for quarters, trying to raise the 
dollar they needed. "Many of the families are indigent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, the senior lifeguard, said many parents leave their children at the 
pool five days a week, using it as a child-care center. But some parents cannot 
afford the new $1-per-child rate, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have been very tense since we opened with the new fees," Thompson 
said. "The first thing people say is that they don't like the new fee." 
</P>
<P>
 The fees were instituted by county officials to avoid closing the pool because 
of budget shortfalls. So far this year, attendance is down about one-third from 
last year's daily average of 500 to 600 swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Carlo Ponce, a member of the county sheriff's Operation Safe Streets 
program, said Will Rogers pool has been relatively free of trouble in past 
years, even though the park and surrounding community have a high incidence of 
robbery. A gang is active in the area, but its members generally leave the park 
alone, Ponce said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know that if there are problems in the parks, we are going to step up 
our proactive policing," which means a crackdown on all dubious activity in the 
area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred MacFarlane, a spokesman for Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who 
represents the neighborhood, said Burke is concerned about the condition of the 
injured lifeguard and the remainder of the staff. Burke is also concerned about 
the effect of the admission charges on poorer families, he said. "We're . . . 
looking at ways to subsidize some of these fees, to help defray some of the 
expenses -- not just at Will Rogers, but at other pools," he said. "We want to 
keep the pools . . . (available) at a time when the heat is raging. We don't 
need tempers to flare any more than (they have) already."

SIMPSON LAWYERS MOVE TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE; SLAYINGS: INITIAL SEARCH OF 
DEFENDANT'S ESTATE CHALLENGED. POLICE ANALYSTS STUDY NEWLY SEIZED MATERIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With police analysts scouring a new pile of material seized from O.J. 
Simpson's Brentwood mansion, prosecutors and defense attorneys spent Wednesday 
laying final plans for what promises to be the most closely watched preliminary 
hearing ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday afternoon, Simpson's lawyers took the only official action of 
the day, filing a motion that could radically alter the shape of the upcoming 
hearing. Their motion, the latest in a series of almost daily challenges 
mounted by Simpson's highly touted legal team, seeks to suppress all evidence 
seized from the football great's home on the day after the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the motion, detectives searched the grounds of Simpson's home 
after scaling the fence and ejecting the occupants early in the morning of June 
13. In the process, according to the motion, the police improperly viewed the 
premises without a warrant, which was not obtained until nearly six hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion further contends that the warrant itself was obtained under false 
pretenses because police asserted that Simpson had left town unexpectedly, 
though detectives were allegedly aware he was on "a planned business trip." 
</P>
<P>
 If the judge agrees, a number of pieces of evidence important to the 
prosecution case would be dropped from the hearing, including a work glove that 
matches one found at the murder scene. And even if the motion is denied, it may 
force prosecutors to explain what evidence they had to justify that search -- a 
tactical move that could give the defense a glimpse of information that might 
not ordinarily be presented during the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion would not affect items carted off from Simpson's house Tuesday, 
however. According to law enforcement sources, the newly seized material 
consists largely of drainpipes, sink traps and other pieces of plumbing. 
Authorities suspect that Simpson washed himself and his clothing on the night 
of the murders, and the plumbing will be tested to determine whether it 
contains fibers or blood samples linking him to the slayings of his ex-wife, 
Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a new warrant, police also were hunting for the murder weapon -- a 
long knife that a tipster told them might have been buried in a sandbox on 
Simpson's property. Sources said the hunt came up empty but police have not 
abandoned their search for the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tuesday searches were conducted less than 48 hours before two of the most 
highly regarded prosecutors in the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office, Marcia Clark and William Hodgman, are scheduled to begin presenting 
their case in public for the first time. The hearing will be broadcast live 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a drama like no other," said Barry Levin, a criminal defense 
attorney and former LAPD officer. "It's going to be gripping." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Clark and Hodgman were ensconced Downtown, avoiding reporters as 
they prepared for the hearing. The two prosecutors have been putting in long 
hours since Simpson was taken into custody June 17 after he led police on a 
low-speed pursuit across Orange County and into Brentwood before eventually 
surrendering to a police SWAT team. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark joined police on their search Tuesday evening, prepping for the hearing 
by familiarizing herself with Simpson's home and the grounds around it, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Simpson's attorneys, led by Los Angeles lawyer Robert L. Shapiro 
and including some of the country's best-known legal talent, gathered to plot 
strategy for a hearing they had aggressively sought. Shapiro has said he may 
use the preliminary hearing to present Simpson's defense, a highly unusual, 
high-risk gambit that could set his client free without a trial but could 
expose the defense strategy and make it more difficult to fight the charges if 
Simpson is bound over for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite saying he is considering that strategy, Shapiro could still choose a 
more traditional course, questioning prosecution witnesses but declining to put 
on a case of his own at this stage. 
</P>
<P>
 With the lawyers out of sight for most of the day, reporters and camera crews 
from around the country descended on the Downtown Criminal Courts building, 
clamoring for the few available seats to cover the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 10 people from the general public will be given seats to view the 
preliminary hearing, which is being held in a high-security courtroom. Eighteen 
seats will be set aside for family members of the victims and 25 seats will be 
filled by news media representatives. The defense will be given five spectator 
seats and the prosecution will be given two. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past two weeks, reporters have deluged the district attorney's 
office and the LAPD with phone calls and requests for interviews. At times, the 
LAPD's press relations office has been so overwhelmed that even the addition of 
several extra officers could not handle the hundreds of calls an hour pouring 
into the Police Department from people around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's staff has been similarly deluged, as hundreds of 
callers from faraway places every day offer suggestions on the case. Among them 
are many self-described psychics and others with tips on where to look for the 
elusive murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 With such attention focused on the case, letters commending and condemning the 
decision to arrest and prosecute Simpson have poured in to Los Angeles 
authorities from around the globe. Simpson himself has received so much mail -- 
about 3,500 letters a day -- that the Sheriff's Department set up a special 
post office box for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Simpson was first said to be deeply depressed and under a suicide 
watch, Sheriff Sherman Block said Wednesday that his condition appeared to have 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is no longer under what we call a suicide watch, and this is based upon 
the recommendation of the mental health professionals who are assigned to the 
jail," Block said. "From all the reports I've received, he is what we would 
call a model inmate. In his dealings with the deputies, he's very courteous, he 
doesn't make demands." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is housed in a high-security wing of the jail and originally had a 
noteworthy neighbor, Erik Menendez. But Block said Wednesday that Simpson was 
moved to another cell so that the two famous inmates could not overhear each 
other's telephone conversations and talks with doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the crush of media, official representatives of the LAPD and the 
district attorney's office have for the most part declined to comment on 
evidence in the case, leaving many to speculate about just what evidence led 
authorities to arrest and charge Simpson for the grisly double murder committed 
late at night on June 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, prosecutors will begin unveiling their case for the first 
time, laying out a combination of witnesses and forensic evidence that they 
believe will be enough to convince a judge that Simpson should stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only portions of the evidence so far have been publicly confirmed, 
much of it consists of items recovered from the scene of the crime and from 
Simpson's property and possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a matching pair of gloves -- one recovered at the crime scene, the 
other at the football Hall of Famer's home. There are blood samples from the 
area where Nicole Simpson and Goldman were slain, more blood from Simpson's 
Ford Bronco and still more from the driveway outside his home. Prosecutors will 
attempt to use results of blood tests to show that Simpson was at the scene of 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution may call police to explain their investigation and expert 
witnesses to discuss the significance of the test results. Shapiro may counter 
with experts of his own. Other witnesses, including friends, relatives and 
associates of Simpson and the two victims, are under subpoena and could be put 
on the stand as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what evidence will be considered, however, remains another open 
question. If Simpson's lawyers convince the judge that the initial search of 
Simpson's home was improper, items such as one of the matching pair of gloves 
-- the one found outside the celebrity's home -- could disappear from the list 
of evidence admissible in the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Harland W. Braun, a noted criminal defense attorney, said motions to suppress 
evidence seized under search warrants are rarely granted, but he added that in 
a case of this magnitude, lawyers need to press for every advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stakes are very high," Braun said. "You have to make a motion for almost 
anything that's arguable." 
</P>
<P>
 With tension surrounding the case building and the long-awaited hearing just 
hours away, television networks prepared to carry the event live to the nation, 
and virtually all those associated with the case braced to stand at the center 
of a riveting moment of courtroom drama. Even in a city whose recent history 
has been defined by a series of high-profile trials, the Simpson case has 
riveted public attention to a degree that astonishes even those who have been 
in the center of the storm before. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible," said Braun, one of the lawyers in the federal trial of the 
four LAPD officers charged in the beating of Rodney G. King. "There's a weird 
fascination with this case unlike anything I've ever seen."

U.S. WILL TAKE BALD EAGLE OFF ENDANGERED LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American bald eagle, the majestic bird of prey that is a national symbol, 
will be removed from the list of 255 animal species hovering at the brink of 
extinction, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will announce today. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which will be celebrated with the release of a captive-bred 
eagle named Hope on Maryland's eastern shore, marks a milestone in the recent 
history of a species whose population fell to about 800 birds in the Lower 48 
in 1963. Overcoming pesticide and lead poisoning and the progressive loss of 
treetop aeries to human development, that population has increased more than 
tenfold. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials and conservationists said the proposed change 
in status represents a pivotal success not only for the eagle but for the 1973 
Endangered Species Act, the controversial cornerstone of environmental 
legislation. The act is expected to draw heavy fire next year when Congress 
considers its reauthorization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bald eagle is now the symbol not only of our country but of the vitality 
of the Endangered Species Act," said G. Jon Roush, president of the Wilderness 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the change, the bald eagle will be moved from the list of species 
considered to be "endangered" to the list of those deemed to be in slightly 
less peril -- the list of "threatened" species. The Fish and Wildlife Service's 
recommendation will become final after 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The improved status will apply in all areas of the nation but the Southwest, 
which is defined as including Arizona, New Mexico, western Texas, Oklahoma and 
a very small part of southeast California. There, populations of eagles have 
risen to 29 nesting pairs -- from a low of 11 in 1979. But officials said the 
status of the eagle cannot be upgraded in that area because the bird remains 
vulnerable to the ravages of harsh weather and human activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the Lower 48, the Fish and Wildlife Service said, the bald 
eagle's removal from the list of endangered species is justified because the 
bird has rebounded to recovery levels established in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the Endangered Species Act have argued that the Interior 
Department, under the leadership of Secretary Bruce Babbitt, is reluctant to 
remove any species from the protected lists. Just five species, including most 
recently the California gray whale, have been removed from the endangered or 
threatened lists because their populations have been judged to have recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other animals -- the American alligator, the Aleutian Canada goose and 
the Arctic peregrine falcon -- have been moved from the endangered list to the 
threatened category. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, however, the "downlisting" of the bald eagle would have little real 
effect on its federal protection. The move means that the Interior Department 
will have greater latitude in allowing the use of individual birds for 
educational or scientific purposes. But federally funded and permitted projects 
still will have to be designed in ways that ensure that the eagle and its 
habitat are protected from harm. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, landowners would still be barred from interfering with or 
cutting any tree on their property if a pair of eagles is nesting in the tree's 
boughs. Such federal prohibitions on use of private property have become a 
rallying point for many opponents of the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The American bald eagle is by far the nation's most protected bird, enjoying 
special status under four other federal laws in addition to the Endangered 
Species Act. But while the other laws were more narrowly drawn, the Endangered 
Species Act provided more sweeping protection for the eagle's habitat and 
prompted other steps that are credited with saving the eagle from extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 The act, which provides criminal penalties for those who would harm or harass 
a protected animal, is credited with reducing the shooting of eagles, which was 
widespread into the late 1960s larely because ranchers feared that the bird 
would attack their livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 The act similarly prompted the federal government's decision to ban the 
pesticide DDT. The chemical, which was sprayed on crops and neighborhoods as 
late as the early 1970s, caused the eggs of many birds, including the bald 
eagle, to become thin and break, and scientists concluded that its widespread 
use had accelerated the decline of the bald eagle and other bird populations. 
</P>
<P>
 It had a particularly dramatic effect on so-called top predators like the 
eagle, which were not exposed to the chemical directly but consumed great 
concentrations of it through its diet of fish and small mammals that had been 
contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the Endangered Species Act moved officials to ban the use of 
lead in gunshot. The heavy metal was found to cause abnormalities in eagle 
populations, which consumed it through its prey. 
</P>
<P>
 Protections for the eagle, which biologists call an example of "charismatic 
mega-fauna," have been widely supported by Americans who do not share Benjamin 
Franklin's characterization of the national symbol as "a bird of bad moral 
character" that does not "get his living honestly." (Franklin favored the 
turkey as the national bird.) 
</P>
<P>
 Officials responsible for carrying out the requirements of the Endangered 
Species Act praised the law's effectiveness in saving the eagle and defended 
its aims, which have come under attack in recent months by many congressional 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pollution that threatened the bald eagle was a threat not only to the 
nation's symbol but to the nation itself," said Mollie Beattie, director of the 
Fish and Wildlife Service. "People need to understand that when species become 
endangered, it is a signal that our environment and our own health are at 
risk." Soaring Again 
</P>
<P>
 The stately bald eagle -- which only appears bald from a distance because its 
head is covered by white feathers -- is rebounding and is about to be removed 
from the endangered species list. 
</P>

ARAFAT TO VISIT JERICHO, GAZA THIS WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of hesitation, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat announced Wednesday that 
he will visit the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho this weekend, a 
historic return inaugurating the new Palestinian Authority that now governs the 
regions after 27 years of Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am coming!" Arafat excitedly told Nabil Shaath, now the authority's senior 
minister in the Gaza Strip, in a pre-dawn telephone call from the Tunis, 
Tunisia, headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization. "I am going 
back home!" 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's visit -- his first to the Palestinian territories since 1967 -- 
should bring hundreds of thousands of people into the streets and galvanize 
Palestinians' efforts to establish their own government in Gaza and Jericho, 
then extend its authority across the whole West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a historic day that Palestinian people have waited for a long 
time," said Dr. Ahmed Tibi, an Arafat adviser in Jerusalem. "It symbolizes the 
beginning of a long trip for reconstruction and independence." 
</P>
<P>
 The suddenness of Arafat's decision, catching PLO and Israeli officials alike 
by surprise, initially put the timing in doubt, as the Israelis scrambled to 
make security arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 But Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, committed to honoring Israel's accord with 
the PLO on Palestinian self-government, agreed to a three-day visit. He 
reportedly told his generals and security chiefs that the question was not 
whether Arafat would come but how Israel would cope with the visit. He then 
gave them until this morning to develop a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prime minister decided to allow this visit after considering all security 
considerations, and the visit will take place starting this Saturday," 
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid announced on Rabin's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's right-wing opposition, including Jewish settlers from the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip, began, in turn, to plan massive demonstrations in Jerusalem 
that they said would paralyze the capital -- even though Arafat has not asked 
to come to pray at the Islamic shrines here. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a national embarrassment, allowing a murderer to enter Gaza and 
Jericho," said Benjamin Netanyahu, chairman of the opposition Likud Party, 
predicting Arafat will try to come to Jerusalem. "The people feel this is a 
humiliation. With this visit of Arafat, the countdown begins toward a 
Palestinian Arab state whose goal is the destruction of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert also said he believes Arafat might try to sneak 
into the holy city on Saturday, the Sabbath, when religious Jews could not 
organize a demonstration. Settler groups already have plans to bring more than 
100,000 protesters to Jerusalem starting today to prevent such a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat is the master terrorist, and we will do what we can to make sure that 
life in this country will be disrupted," Aharon Domb of the Council of Jewish 
Communities of Judea, Samaria and Gaza said. "We don't mind Arafat visiting the 
Land of Israel, but in handcuffs and on his way to trial as an arch-murderer." 
</P>
<P>
 The group offered a $33,000 reward for Arafat's "capture" but withdrew a mock 
"wanted poster" that put a price on his head "dead or alive" after Israeli 
authorities ruled that it amounted to an incitement to murder. A former chief 
rabbi, Shlomo Goren, citing the PLO's past terrorist acts, again called on Jews 
to kill Arafat as a religious obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 An Arafat visit to Jerusalem could trigger violence because of emotions that 
surround the city, regarded as sacred by Jews, Muslims and Christians. 
Jerusalem's future will probably be the most serious, sensitive issue in 
negotiations on a full peace settlement, with both Israelis and Palestinians 
claiming it as their capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat decided to come to Gaza and Jericho despite concerns -- among them 
numerous assassination threats -- about his own security, Shaath said. "Mr. 
Arafat took a lot of risks in the struggle to go home, so this will not be a 
deterrent," he said. "But our police are preparing for all the security 
requirements as are the Israeli army and police on their side." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat had been expected to arrive in Jericho and the Gaza Strip earlier this 
month but put off the visit, apparently to pressure Western donors to provide 
$600 million they had promised to underwrite the Palestinian Authority in its 
first year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last week, some PLO officials had grown less optimistic about his 
early arrival in the autonomous regions; Shaath on Tuesday said he thought 
Arafat would come no earlier than mid-July and maybe much later. 
</P>
<P>
 But others -- including Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Maazen), an architect of the secret 
talks in Oslo that produced the breakthrough peace agreement with Israel -- 
have urged Arafat to make good on his pledge to come home to the Palestinian 
territories, Palestinian sources said. To delay, while demanding more money 
from the international community, made it appear that the PLO chairman is "for 
sale," one PLO official said in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Palestinian observed, "It's a political statement -- that he's there 
for his people. Once you announce you're going to go, you have to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, who is scheduled to meet representatives of donor countries in Paris 
next week, will insist on stronger international backing before he returns to 
Gaza and Jericho to stay, PLO officials said. So far, donors have offered to 
release $42 million to last through August. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat received letters Wednesday from Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
and Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown assuring him of U.S. support for West 
Bank and Gaza Strip development. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath, minister of planning and international cooperation in the Palestinian 
Authority, did not explain the eight-week delay from the signing of the 
self-government agreement with Israel, but said Arafat felt the moment was 
right for his arrival in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many positive signs" in recent days paved the way, Shaath said, citing talks 
Tuesday on extending self-rule to the rest of the West Bank and the easing of 
travel restrictions on PLO officials moving from Jericho to Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Israel freed about 400 of the 4,000 to 6,000 Palestinians it is 
still holding in its prisons and detention camps, a key step toward widening 
the scope of its peace accord with the PLO. Israeli authorities say they have 
now freed about 4,000 of 5,000 prisoners they promised to release under 
autonomy agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrangements for Arafat's visit were uncertain Wednesday because of the haste 
with which it is being arranged. Egyptian officials said Arafat would likely 
fly from Cairo to a military airfield near the Egyptian-Israeli border at 
Rafah, then drive the short distance across the border to the Gaza Strip. But 
Israeli officials said he would probably arrive by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials said Arafat would travel to Jericho, but Israeli authorities 
said they have not been notified of that plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat and Rabin are unlikely to meet during the visit, but they plan to hold 
talks next week in Paris, where they will jointly receive a peace prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks reported from Jerusalem, Murphy from Cairo.

SOCIALIST NAMED PREMIER IN JAPAN; ASIA: TOMIICHI MURAYAMA IS CHOSEN WITH 
SUPPORT OF HIS PARTY'S ARCHENEMIES. ANALYSTS EXPECT GREATER STRAIN ON U.S. 
TRADE RELATIONS, WHILE TOKYO BUSINESS WORLD IS SHOCKED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's wild politics took a stunning turn Wednesday as Socialist Tomiichi 
Murayama withstood the vigorous opposition of two former prime ministers and 
won this nation's top job -- with the support of his party's archenemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama's election as prime minister -- he is the first Socialist to hold the 
position since the postwar poverty and confusion of 1947 -- sent shocks through 
the Japanese business world and was expected to raise alarm in Washington as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Japan's Socialists have espoused views that disturb many, both 
here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 They have, for example, held the Communist government of North Korea in warm 
regard and have demanded that Japan reject any sanctions against Pyongyang over 
its resistance to inspections of its nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists have advocated the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, 
though they have tempered their position. They argue that Japan's own armed 
forces are "unconstitutional but legal," and they oppose opening their nation's 
agricultural markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Murayama's election will place new strains on U.S.-Japan trade 
relations because his government will probably be even less accommodating to 
the United States and largely unwilling to dismantle regulations that protect 
farmers' -- or workers' -- jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 As he began work to form a Cabinet this morning, Murayama acknowledged "the 
selection of me, a person with no experience, has created a feeling of 
uneasiness in various circles." He said he wanted to "put people's minds at 
ease." 
</P>
<P>
 The left-leaning Socialists, of course, will be reined in as they try to 
translate their ideology into practice and as they became part of a 
once-unimaginable coalition that will now attempt to govern Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Their most powerful partners will be members of the conservative Liberal 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The Liberal Democrats have been the Socialists' bane, often ridiculing them, 
and key LDP leaders -- including the two former prime ministers -- fought a 
pitched battle Wednesday to prevent the ascension of Murayama, 70, the seventh 
of 11 children of a fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Liberal Democrats approved Murayama as their candidate to succeed 
Tsutomu Hata, who resigned as prime minister Saturday, former Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu suddenly declared himself a candidate for Japan's top job. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolting the Liberal Democrats less than two hours before the election, Kaifu, 
who was known as "Mr. Reform" when he served from 1989 to 1991, said he was 
acting to "preserve political reform." 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot bring myself to write the name of Murayama on the ballot," Kaifu 
said of his opponent, who entered politics after a career as an activist and 
leader, first in a fishermen's union and then in the All Japan Prefectural and 
Municipal Workers Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Yasuhiro Nakasone, another former prime minister, noted the significant 
foreign policy challenges looming now for Japan, including a July 8-10 economic 
summit of major industrial nations in Naples, Italy, and the continuing North 
Korean crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 He declared that he could not back a Socialist like Murayama because it "runs 
counter to the national interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the balloting, Nakasone declared: "To protect Japan's destiny, I 
support Kaifu." 
</P>
<P>
 But by a vote of 261-214 (with 29 void ballots), Murayama -- who has served as 
a city and prefectural assemblyman, a member of the lower house of Parliament 
since 1972 and chairman of his party since September -- won the runoff 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe said in advance that he would vote 
against Murayama -- and he did. In all, 42 members of the Japan Socialist 
Party, the Liberal Democratic Party and the New Party Harbinger that joined the 
new coalition failed to follow party orders in the runoff, conducted 2 1/2 
hours before Parliament ended its session. 
</P>
<P>
 Morihiro Hosokawa, another former prime minister, called the newest coalition 
government "an illicit union," noting that it links two parties with almost 
diametrically opposing views. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Socialists, who had long been staunch opponents of the LDP, 
gave the Liberal Democrats back a chunk of the clout they lost last summer 
after 38 years of unilateral rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "At last, we have returned to power," declared Yoshiro Mori, the LDP's second 
in command. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting that ended at almost 4 this morning, Murayama, Masayoshi 
Takemura, the Harbinger leader, and Yohei Kono, the LDP president, agreed to 
dub Murayama's government "the dove Cabinet" to promote peace. 
</P>
<P>
 They also agreed to end decision-making by bureaucrats and run a government 
led by politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 They rejected a Finance Ministry demand to guarantee to legislate by the end 
of the year a future increase in the 3% consumption tax. Instead, they promised 
only to "make efforts" to pass tax reforms by December. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Hata supporters predicted that Japan's newest prime minister, the seventh 
in the last five years, will preside, as his immediate predecessor had, over an 
unstable, short-lived government. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata served 63 days, the briefest period of any prime minister under the 
postwar constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the Liberal Democrats accepting all Socialist demands on immediate 
policy issues, the first foreseeable clash of interests may not come until next 
summer, when an upper house election is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 A large number of Socialists and Liberal Democrats will be running against 
each other at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before then, Murayama -- who has never before served as a Cabinet 
minister -- will be forced to tackle utterly unfamiliar challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 He is, for example, to meet with President Clinton -- who issued a statement 
saying he looks forward to working with the Murayama government -- before the 
Naples summit to discuss the North Korea issue and U.S. demands for a framework 
governing U.S.-Japan trade. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be Murayama's first plunge into international diplomacy -- and may 
give the earliest indications of what many analysts predict may be the single 
area of greatest change under the Socialists: foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Socialists and the New Party Harbinger oppose Japan's joining the 
U.N. Security Council as a permanent member with veto rights, saying to do so 
would force Japan to develop a coherent foreign policy and take clear stands on 
a host of issues it now often ignores. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama and Takemura have expressed particular concern over the possibility 
that Japan would be coerced into dispatching Japanese troops to participate in 
U.N. peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. issue is just part of a broader debate over foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata's forces -- especially Ichiro Ozawa, his chief strategist -- strongly 
sought a permanent Security Council seat and advocated that Japan assume more 
international responsibility and play a greater global role, including in U.N. 
peacekeeping missions. 
</P>
<P>
 Takemura, a former Liberal Democrat who bolted the party in June, 1993, 
clashed with both Ozawa and Hosokawa, under whom he served as chief Cabinet 
secretary. Although he and his party voted for Hata as prime minister in April, 
he refused to join Hata's Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaifu insisted that he had consulted no one before hurling his bombshell and 
condemning the party in which he served for 35 years. But the instant support 
he won from all seven parties and splinter groups of Hata's coalition belied 
his disavowal. 
</P>
<P>
 His action bore the marks of a plot by Ozawa, who has long advocated splitting 
the Socialists and the Liberal Democrats to create a viable system of two 
parties -- instead of the current 15 -- capable of changing government 
periodically. 
</P>
<P>
 All Wednesday, Ozawa stubbornly insisted that the Socialists specify the 
percentage to which they would agree to raise the current 3% consumption tax 
three years from now in exchange for implementing income tax cuts to spur the 
economy now. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand, which went unmet, appeared designed to shove the Socialists, who 
walked out of Hata's coalition in April, into the arms of the Liberal Democrats 
-- and precipitate precisely the rebellion that occurred in the ranks of both 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The only trouble was that the rebellion, carried out without a head count, 
fell short. 
</P>
<P>
 NHK, the semi-governmental television network, calculated that 61 rebels, 
including 36 Liberal Democrats, voted against their party's orders on the first 
ballot, which required a majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama won 241 votes, 12 shy of the required majority; Kaifu polled 220, 
precipitating the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the lower house recessed, a pro forma ballot in the upper house gave 
Murayama an overwhelming victory of 61% of the votes, or enough to deflate the 
uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the defeat doomed Hata's coalition to opposition status, the fight 
added 31 votes to its ranks and created a pool of potential defectors within 
the incoming coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we have a healthy opposition party," declared Kozo Watanabe, a member of 
the Renewal Party led by Hata and Ozawa. "I don't really feel like we were 
defeated."

ROUTINE HEARING EXPECTED TO BE ANYTHING BUT ROUTINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All that stands between O.J. Simpson and a murder trial is a routine legal 
proceeding called a preliminary hearing whose purpose is to eliminate "utterly 
groundless" cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Used in California since 1880, most "prelims" are held with no audience and 
last 30 minutes or less. Some can be completed in 10 minutes with only one 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Not this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers are estimating that Simpson's preliminary hearing will last a week, 
maybe two, and it will be covered gavel to gavel on nationwide television. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the hearing is expected to be lively, even hard fought, many 
legal experts believe Simpson probably will be held for trial. That's because 
the basic legal standard -- whether there is probable cause to believe that a 
crime was committed and that the defendant committed the crime -- is so easy to 
meet that charges are rarely thrown out at a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a dramatically lower standard than the one for convicting a defendant 
at trial -- guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica criminal defense lawyer Charles L. Lindner and others noted that 
only perhaps 5% of defendants have their cases dismissed at the preliminary 
hearing level. 
</P>
<P>
 All prosecutors have to do is "throw the ball into the ballpark; they don't 
have to throw a strike," Lindner said. 
</P>
<P>
 For defense attorneys, the tactics at a preliminary hearing are not as clear. 
Obviously, the best result from their point of view would be dismissal of all 
the charges. Failing that, defense lawyers try to find out as much as possible 
about the evidence against their client and to assess the strength of witnesses 
for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 However, defense attorneys must be careful not to overplay their hands. As a 
consequence, it is often difficult to assess how the defense performs during 
the hearing, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is impossible to judge what a defense lawyer is doing at a prelim," said 
Los Angeles criminal lawyer Harland W. Braun. By not asking certain questions, 
for instance, "a lawyer could look like a nitwit at a prelim and in reality be 
brilliant" for not revealing his strategy, Braun said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, defense lawyers go on the offensive, putting on an "affirmative 
defense." They call their own forensic experts to attempt to cast doubt on the 
state's findings. Simpson's lead defense lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, has 
indicated he may pursue that option. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether he takes that approach, Shapiro -- joined by colleagues 
Gerald F. Uelmen and Sara L. Caplan -- issued a strong signal Wednesday that he 
will aggressively challenge the prosecution's case: He filed a motion seeking 
to keep out of evidence everything taken by police during a search of Simpson's 
house in the hours immediately after the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how long and hard such issues are fought in the Simpson preliminary 
hearing, it is unlikely ever to overtake the 18-month record set in the 
McMartin Pre-School case. 
</P>
<P>
 The multimillion-dollar proceeding spawned efforts to change the preliminary 
hearing process, which culminated in 1990 when voters passed Proposition 115. 
The ballot measure streamlined the hearings by enabling police officers to give 
hearsay testimony; for example, a detective might describe a witness's account 
of a burglary suspect running out of a house with a television set. 
</P>
<P>
 That cannot be done at trial. The witness would have to testify directly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the streamlining allows for such shortcuts during prelims, Deputy 
Dist. Attys. Marcia Clark and William Hodgman are expected to go well beyond 
the minimum requirements because of the extraordinary nature of the Simpson 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 It is anticipated that they will call to the witness stand police officers, 
forensic experts and the person who discovered the bodies of Simpson's ex-wife, 
Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a case of this notoriety, I would expect the prosecution to put on a solid 
outline of the case and do their best to present a solid outline of the 
inferences that the accused did it," said Curt Livesay, a San Pedro attorney 
who was one of the top officials in the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Livesay also said he expects "some searching cross-examination" of prosecution 
witnesses by Simpson's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense team's motion challenging the prosecution's right to introduce the 
fruits of the search of Simpson's house shortly after the killings may afford 
the defense an opportunity to question police about their actions in the first 
24 hours after the bloody bodies were found outside Nicole Simpson's Brentwood 
condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers, however, noted that it has become increasingly difficult to 
prevail on such motions in recent years. "The law used to (be) better for 
defendants than it is now," said veteran criminal defense lawyer Gerald 
Chaleff, who is president of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell could consider the motion at the start 
of today's preliminary hearing or she could take it up when prosecutors first 
seek to introduce any evidence recovered during the contested search. 
</P>
<P>
 The overwhelming volume of media coverage may also be a factor in prosecution 
and defense strategies during the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public opinion is an issue," Los Angeles criminal lawyer Marcia Morrisey 
said. "You choose your jury from the public, so you have to be mindful of what 
the publicity is. You may make decisions about what to do because of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's defense team has at least one advantage that their counterparts in 
other preliminary hearings usually do not have. In most instances, the defense 
goes into a preliminary hearing knowing little about the prosecution's case, 
defense lawyers noted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simpson case, though, Shapiro and his colleagues have had the benefit 
of reviewing the transcripts of hearings before the grand jury that was taking 
evidence before the presiding judge of the Los Angeles County Superior Court 
disbanded the panel, ruling that it may have been tainted by publicity about 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the odds are against it, charges are occasionally dismissed after 
a preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it happens when a prosecution witness simply fails to show up, said 
Deputy Public Defender Jeffrey R. Graves, who does hundreds of preliminary 
hearings a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, the key witness is unable to identify the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 In still other instances, a judge may choose to whittle a case down. In fact, 
Kennedy-Powell did that in a case just two months ago, said Deputy Public 
Defender Thomas B. Ahearn, who is representing a man accused of kidnaping for 
robbery and carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell ruled that there was insufficient evidence that Ahearn's client 
intended to steal the car and she dismissed the carjacking count, Ahearn said. 
"It was a courageous decision," he said. "She's not unduly pro-prosecution or 
pro-defense. She'll call (it) like she sees it."

CITY COUNCIL OKS RAISES FOR POLICE, OTHER WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that ends months of labor strife but potentially creates new 
problems down the road, the Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday approved 
salary increases for police officers and unexpectedly gave slightly smaller 
raises to the rest of the city work force as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they have the money in city coffers to give all workers raises 
in the fiscal year that begins Friday but will have to make difficult choices 
next year to sustain the hikes -- such as tax increases or service cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may have to do things that are unattractive," Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg 
said. "Yes, we will find the money. Do we know where? No." 
</P>
<P>
 The raises are the first granted to employees in two years and mark a 
turnaround for a city that has long told labor unions that it was too broke to 
boost salaries. Several unions had recently agreed to forgo raises, but they 
complained to council members when they learned that the city had found tens of 
millions of dollars for police pay hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The $50-million police pact, overwhelmingly ratified by union members last 
week, gives all 7,400 officers ranked lieutenant and below a 7% raise, a 2% 
patrol incentive and a $1,500 cash bonus -- spread over the next 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-3 vote for the police raise -- with council members Marvin Braude, Rita 
Walters and Zev Yaroslavsky dissenting -- ends a sometimes chaotic two-year 
standoff that included mass sickouts, picketing, job slowdowns and billboards 
knocking the city's image. 
</P>
<P>
 "This puts behind a roller coaster of negotiations that has not been healthy 
for the city but ends with a fairly good result," Mayor Richard Riordan said at 
a news conference announcing the council's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 14 to 1 to give 19,000 other city employees, excluding top 
managers, 2% raises in each of the next two years. That will cost the city an 
additional $12 million this year and $24 million in 1995-96, according to 
official estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the raises are expected to cost about $52 million this fiscal year -- 
more than double the $25 million allocated in the city's $4.3-billion budget. 
Most of the money needed to cover the difference will come from the Police 
Department. The LAPD did not hire as many officers last year as planned and as 
a result has about $18 million in salary savings and millions more in unpaid 
pension contributions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salary increases for firefighters and police officers ranked captain and above 
are still undetermined, although the unions representing those groups are 
pushing for the same deal offered to rank-and-file police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's effort to hold the line on salaries started to break down last fall 
when Department of Water and Power workers won a 9% pay increase after staging 
a nine-day strike. The police union then demanded a comparable settlement, and 
intensified its campaign to pressure the city into a favorable contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the council felt obligated to give the rest of the city work force a 
raise as a matter of fairness and to prevent future labor strife. As a result, 
council members are bracing for tough choices head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for me to imagine that we won't have to review the issue of cutting 
costs or increasing revenues," said Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who 
supported the raises. "The more unpleasant way of saying that is: layoffs or 
taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders representing janitors, sanitation workers and clerk typists were 
thrilled with the raises. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're beyond happy -- but I suspect that our members feel that they deserve 
what everyone else got," said Julie Butcher, spokeswoman for Local 347 of 
Service Employees International Union, which represents 5,500 blue-collar 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan went along with the additional civilian raises, although he said he 
considered them excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's being overly generous," Riordan said, "but I'm realistic and a 
team player and I went along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the raise, Los Angeles police officers are paid less than their 
colleagues in many departments elsewhere in California. But city statistics 
indicate that the city's civilian workers earn salaries roughly equivalent to 
or greater than those received by government workers in Long Beach, San Diego, 
Glendale and Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of some city unions disputed those statistics, saying that the 
salaries of Los Angeles' blue-collar workers do not compare as favorably with 
those in big cities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude, chairman of the council's Public Safety Committee, was the sole member 
of the council to vote against both the police and civilian raises. He called 
his colleagues irresponsible for approving raises without any firm idea where 
the money is coming from. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the police officers deserve $75,000 a year," he said. "I'd like 
to pay them more. But where's the money going to come from?" 
</P>
<P>
 The police deal -- which is significantly higher than the offer voted down by 
the union last month -- may require that the city tap into money that had been 
set aside to beef up the number of police officers on the streets, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially opposed to tampering with his police expansion plan, Riordan now 
argues that giving the current force a solid raise is just as essential to the 
city's public safety. One concrete result of paying officers more, he said, 
will be a decrease in the number of officers who retire or leave for other 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan also said the patrol bonus included in the contract is an important 
innovation, one first proposed by the Christopher Commission to give officers a 
financial incentive to remain on street patrol rather than move on to 
specialized units. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the increased financial commitments approved by the council, Riordan 
said he remains hopeful that he can come up with enough money to prevent any 
reduction in his police expansion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we'll reach those goals," Riordan said. "It will be a little 
tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, doubted that. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, chairman of the council's budget committee, predicted that the 
police contract would result in as many as 600 fewer officers on the street 
next year than planned. He predicted that increased taxes could be avoided but 
said: "I think it requires further constricting the city's expenditures. It 
means a reduction in service to the general public in some measure." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the police union hailed the council's vote, saying it was a first 
step toward improving officers' morale. 
</P>
<P>
 For many officers, the contract fight began to transcend dollars and cents, 
the union said. Their image battered by the beating of Rodney G. King and the 
subsequent civil disturbances, officers said the deal gave them something not 
spelled out in the contract language -- respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the average officer will begin to feel appreciated and respected," 
said union President Danny Staggs. "This is a sign from City Hall that they are 
appreciated."

COLLECTED MILLIONS OF DOCUMENTS ON LIFE IN THE THIRD REICH. NOW THEY ARE 
RETURNING TO GERMANY'S CONTROL, AND SOME FEAR LOSING ACCESS TO THEIR TELLING

<P>
 Forty-nine years ago, the U.S. Army treated Kurt Rosenow, then a technical 
sergeant, to one of the finer karma warps of the 20th Century: Ordered back to 
his native Berlin, he was put to work sifting the rubble of what had been Adolf 
Hitler's capital, trying to assemble a paper trail of the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
 Who, exactly, had belonged to the Nazi Party? What had made the joiners join? 
How could the newly victorious Allies identify Nazi war criminals among the 
many Germans who were now protesting their innocence? How to amass the evidence 
needed for successful prosecutions at the Nuremberg trials, just getting under 
way that summer? 
</P>
<P>
 Into the shattered streets went Rosenow, a German Jew who had wisely taken 
ship for America in the summer of 1939, just weeks before Germany separated 
itself from the civilized world in earnest. A successful Berlin lawyer, he had 
been working as a butler in New York when he was drafted in 1944 and assigned 
to Army intelligence. Now back in his native city, he and a small group of 
colleagues began going from house to house, bombed-out ministry to bombed-out 
ministry, trying in each place to build enough confidence among the shaken 
survivors to make them tell him where the evidence lay. 
</P>
<P>
 And tell him they did. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were overwhelmed by the mass of paper that came in, before we actually 
knew what had happened," says Rosenow, today a sturdy 88-year-old who lives 
with his wife in the northern German city of Hanover. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenow didn't know it at the time, but the papers he and his team were 
putting together would eventually make up one of the most extraordinary 
archives in the world: the most complete documentation of the Nazi era ever 
produced. Rosenow went on to become the archive's first civilian curator, after 
he was discharged from the Army in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 Which puts him in a special position today, for now the archive, known as the 
Berlin Document Center, has become the focus of a controversy stretching across 
the Atlantic, from Germany to the United States. On Friday, Berlin's trove of 
one-of-a-kind documents will pass from American administration to German hands. 
Some researchers have argued that under German stewardship, the unique files 
will be less accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 What, say the critics, will happen when someone wants to look into the past of 
a prominent German politician or his family? Will German archival authorities, 
uneasy about naming Nazi-era names, be willing to open incriminating files for 
all to see? Privacy laws in Germany are, after all, far stricter than in the 
United States, proscribing the publication of certain pivotal information until 
a person has been dead at least 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I'm afraid" about future access to the Berlin Document Center, 
says Anna Rosmus, a woman from the city of Passau who has made a career of 
ferreting sensational information out of various German archives and publishing 
her findings. Her tribulations were portrayed in the film "The Nasty Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure I'll have the opportunity to see those files again," says 
Rosmus, 34. "For years and years, I've had firsthand experience of how much 
easier it is to get information from the Americans than from the Germans." 
</P>
<P>
 The Berlin Document Center stands today just where it did at the end of World 
War II: in a barracks-like complex surrounded by barbed-wire fencing that 
contrasts unpleasantly with the comfortable and well-landscaped residences 
nearby. During Nazi times, these barracks and the vast chambers beneath them 
housed an immense telephone surveillance center run by Field Marshal Hermann 
Goering. Rosenow can still remember how eerie it was when the Americans moved 
in and found the basements filled with eavesdropping devices, the wires all 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, during late 1945 and early 1946, Rosenow and his colleagues filled 
these rooms with hundreds of tons of documents -- 75 million pages, or enough, 
he says, to reach eight miles into the sky if stacked one atop the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there are nearly 11 million files on members of the National Socialist 
German Workers' Party -- an estimated 85% of the total membership -- still 
arranged in the original wooden file cabinets from party headquarters. There 
are 600,000 files on the members of the SS, each with a Lebenslauf , or 
autobiographical statement, and more than half a million files on the 
Brownshirts, the organized street bullies who promoted Hitler in the years 
leading to his assumption of dictatorial powers. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75,000 files track the careers of assorted Nazi doctors, some of them 
mere opportunists and not particularly interesting but some of whom went on to 
become part of the Hitler killing machine and case studies in the human 
capacity for fiendishness. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are Nazi Party membership card No. 6,421,477, belonging to the 
now-celebrated Oskar Schindler; Goering's suicide notes, scribbled before he 
took cyanide in 1946; SS chief Heinrich Himmler's meticulous expense accounts, 
and the SS papers of Erich Priebke, now awaiting extradition from Argentina on 
charges that he helped murder 335 prisoners in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, too, are files that can only be described as bizarre: thousands of 
marriage applications, for instance, filed with the SS by eager couples who 
hoped to work as breeders for the racially pure Aryan nation that Hitler wanted 
to build. These lovers had to persuade their SS superiors to check "Ja" after 
the question, "Is procreation by this person desirable for the nation?" They 
did so by submitting proof of their worthiness: handwritten autobiographical 
sketches, medical records, dental charts, photographs and exhaustive, 
church-registered pedigrees dating back six generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Such obsessively detailed information is tailor-made for social historians 
trying to learn more about Germany in the years before Hitler rose to power. 
But it has also been invaluable to Nazi-hunters trying to locate their aging 
quarries. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most celebrated example arose when a skeleton, believed to be that 
of the Auschwitz doctor Josef Mengele, was found in Sao Paulo in 1985. Forensic 
scientists turned to the Berlin Document Center's files and found, in Mengele's 
marriage application, information about his teeth and bone marrow, scarred as 
it had been by a childhood infection -- the only reliable such information in 
the world. The details were then cited as conclusive proof that the skeletal 
remains were, indeed, Mengele's. 
</P>
<P>
 The center has been used in every major and minor war crimes investigation 
since the Third Reich fell, says David Marwell, the outgoing American director, 
himself a historian and former chief of the Justice Department's Nazi-hunting 
unit. "Not because we have specific war crimes information, but because we have 
key personnel files that show where people were and when." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a quarter-century, American and German officials have been 
debating, on and off, who the rightful stewards of the Berlin Document Center 
ought to be. Other Nazi archives once in Allied hands have, after all, long 
since been microfilmed and passed back to the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the Berlin Document Center it has taken longer to decide because the 
papers are so personal and so revealing. Americans were concerned about access 
under German law, and many Germans were content to leave such sensitive papers 
in foreign hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had politicians in Germany who were also members of Nazi 
organizations," notes Siegfried Buettner, vice president of the German Federal 
Archives and the man directing the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the unification of the former East 
and West Germanys and the subsequent stand down of the American forces in 
Berlin that led to the decision to hand over administrative control to the 
Germans. According to Buettner, the files will be incorporated into the German 
Federal Archives but kept as a free-standing set of documents within the 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a complete set of microfilms is being shot -- 38,000 rolls at a 
cost to Germany of more than $8 million. Under the terms of the transfer 
agreement, these microfilms will be kept on file at the National Archives in 
Washington, in case Germany goes back on its repeated assurances of free 
access. 
</P>
<P>
 But these plans have left Jewish organizations, historians and other 
researchers unsatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a practical level, we have gone a long way toward getting written and oral 
assurances from the (German) government," says Elan Steinberg, executive 
director of the World Jewish Congress, who cites pledges from Bonn that the 
Nazi records will be readily available in Germany until the microfilmed copies 
are ready in Washington. "We will continue to monitor the situation," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he adds, "There is also a moral issue, and I'm afraid it cannot be 
resolved. These are documents that belong to the United States, because we paid 
for them with the most precious commodity we have: the blood of young American 
soldiers. Why give back these documents? I see no reason why the Germans can't 
have the (microfilm) copies." 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Rosmus, the self-made historian in Passau, says American attitudes have 
made her work possible. In her first project, 11 years ago, she says, she 
wanted to write a school paper on what Passau's town fathers had been up to 
during World War II. When she ran into a wall of stone at the municipal 
archives -- no one wanted to reveal the Nazi activities of local leading lights 
-- she sued. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge in the case said that if the Americans at the Berlin Document Center 
were willing to let Rosmus study their supersensitive files -- which they were 
-- then the local authorities would have to let her look into the city 
archives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got free access (in Passau) because it was the Americans who got to 
decide," Rosmus says. "I am sure that if it had been up to the German 
authorities, I would not have been given access." Although the Passau dispute 
involved municipal archives, Rosmus says she has encountered bureaucratic 
obstacles at the federal level too. 
</P>
<P>
 Access problems arise mainly about files that name people still living, or 
dead less than 30 years. Such information falls under Germany's data protection 
laws, which instruct federal authorities to balance the researcher's right to 
know against the individual's right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to check (the researcher's project) and balance it against the 
legitimate interests of the person concerned," says Buettner, adding that the 
law gives officials latitude to decide in researchers' favor. "I don't feel 
(excessively) powerful, I feel responsible," he says, "to make adequate 
compromises and find the right balance. The German privacy law gives us the 
responsibility to discern correctly. We find it rather handsome." 
</P>
<P>
 Buettner says German archivists sometimes give researchers only a summary of a 
file's contents; in other cases, they may let the researcher view the file. In 
the most liberal decisions, the researcher may even make and distribute 
photocopies. But photocopying is limited, Buettner says, to protect innocent 
third parties who are sometimes named in files -- spouses, lovers, children -- 
who were never Nazi Party functionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosmus argues, however, that the inability to make copies can sometimes 
jeopardize researchers and their work. In one case, she says, she found out 
that the mayor-elect of her hometown had been a Gestapo informant, and she 
thought her fellow citizens had a right to know. But since the politician was 
still alive, German privacy laws prohibited her from copying the archival 
evidence, and the politician was able to deny her charges -- at least initially 
-- and to threaten to sue her for slander. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosmus protected herself, she says, by persuading a German television crew to 
go into the archive and make an illegal videotape of the incriminating 
documents. Then, once the mayor-elect made his denials, the television crew 
broadcast the proof, and he had to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this file had been in any American archive, I wouldn't have had to use 
such a trick," Rosmus says. 
</P>
<P>
 True enough, Rosmus concedes, there will always be those microfilms of the 
Berlin Document Center on file in Washington; a researcher who can afford the 
trip will be able to make photocopies. 
</P>
<P>
 At his temporary offices in Potsdam, housed in a pleasantly ramshackle 
compound that used to house the central state archives of East Germany, 
Buettner sighs. "You have to be aware that this is an old discussion," he says. 
"These arguments are not new. They have only been sharpened" by the Berlin 
Document Center transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, I see some distrust of the German government, the German 
bureaucracy and German society," he says. "This is a political question and 
difficult for me to respond to. It is a problem that we will have to deal with 
for decades, and I would not want to respond to it with aggression. I can try 
to imagine how these people are feeling. But there is an inability to 
differentiate between Germans in general and Nazis." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hanover, Rosenow, the original curator of the Document Center, has similar 
feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate these expressions: The Jews. The Germans. The Communists. The 
Russians," he says. "There were members of my wife's and my own family who came 
to death. But I have never blamed 'the Germans.' In my work, I have found out 
that you cannot say, 'This one is a black sheep, but that one has a clean 
coat.' The area in between black and white is very, very wide." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenow goes to his home office and returns with a record of the work that 
taught him such lessons: a diary of those street-to-street searches that he 
made in 1945. Each day, with lawyer-like precision, he kept a detailed log, in 
English, of his impressions and findings as he made rounds to what he called 
"targets" -- buildings where the Army thought there might be Nazi documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the entries say simply, "Target completely destroyed," but for other 
days there is a wealth of recorded revelations. Here is the 39-year-old Rosenow 
interviewing the ear, nose and throat specialist who X-rayed Hitler after the 
failed assassination attempt in July, 1944, that left the Fuehrer with ruptured 
eardrums and a damaged jaw. There he is on another day, charging into a 
basement on a tip and finding a weird collection of carved stones assembled in 
connection with Ahnenerbe -- the Nazis' pseudoscientific effort to identify a 
noble Germanic tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were surprised by the extent of (the Nazi terror)" as the documents began 
to accumulate, Rosenow recalls. "We had already learned about the mass 
executions, either by firing squad or gas, shortly after the war. But the 
numbers were shocking. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1946 . . . we got the special reports of the Einsatzgruppen," he says, 
naming the group that conducted the evacuation and killing of Jews in the 
Baltic republics and Poland. "These were plain statistics -- officers reporting 
back to their commanders that so-and-so many Jews from the following towns were 
liquidated. That was the expression used, liquidated. The numbers went into the 
tens of thousands. That was shocking. And there was no doubt in my mind that 
these documents were real, not falsified."

HOUSE VOTE KEEPS SPACE STATION, O.C. JOBS ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In another brush with death for the embattled space station, the House voted 
late Wednesday to retain $2.1 billion in funds to continue research and 
construction of the orbiting laboratory next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the station argued for the termination of one of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration's premier projects, branding it 
"half-baked science" and an "orbiting boondoggle" that has already cost 
taxpayers $11.4 billion with nothing under construction to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
 But space station advocates prevailed, defeating by a vote of 278 to 155 a 
bipartisan amendment that would have ended the project once and for all and 
taken with it thousands of California jobs. Among the hardest hit would have 
been McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. in Huntington Beach, whose 
3,000-member space-station team was cut in half after budget reductions last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 A version of the $90.5-billion Veterans Affairs Housing and Urban Development 
appropriations bill, which includes the space station funds, must still pass 
the Senate. But the space station's toughest test came Wednesday night in the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 "The space station represents the expansion of the human spirit and the 
continuation of the human drive to explore Earth and the universe around it," 
Rep. George E. Brown (D-Colton) told the chamber as the emotional, 2 1/2-hour 
debate ran late into the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA has been forced to go begging year after year to a Congress increasingly 
resistant to funding the space laboratory. Last year the project survived the 
House by a single vote. Even Brown, the godfather of the project, threatened to 
withdraw his support last month if it appeared that continued budget cuts would 
make further research fruitless or if the space station appeared to be raiding 
funds for other NASA projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But after heavy lobbying by the Clinton Administration, sufficient funds were 
recommended by appropriators and Brown gave the station his most needed 
endorsement. The White House has called the space station as much a diplomatic 
tool as anything else since the Russians were brought into the program under a 
unique agreement last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore has traveled to Capitol Hill three times in the past 
two months to garner support for the space station, and both he and President 
Clinton worked the phones Tuesday and Wednesday in attempts to convince 
wavering lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 But foes argued that the orbiting laboratory was siphoning away too many 
scarce tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Nydia Vasquez (D-N.Y.) called the space station a "luxury hotel in the 
sky" built at the expense of the nation's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the lawmakers could not bring themselves to eliminate the most 
ambitious project since the development of the space shuttle, particularly on 
the eve of the 25th anniversary of man's landing on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't take the sparkle out of our children's eyes," Rep. Gene Green (D-Texas) 
implored, as several other lawmakers invoked the spirits of Christopher 
Columbus and Lewis and Clark in arguing that the space station was truly 
pioneering research. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of the space station project would have sent California's already 
crippled aerospace and defense industries further reeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the space station's prime contractors -- McDonnell Douglas and the 
Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International in Canoga Park -- together hold 
contracts worth more than $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 First announced with great fanfare by then-President Ronald Reagan in 1984, 
the space station has been the victim of continued redesigns and budget cuts 
almost ever since. Because of the delays, it has yet to begin construction. And 
one of its worst threats has been the yearly struggle for funds, experts have 
long complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad for science to keep debating it," Brown said, calling for an 
overwhelming vote of support not just for 1995 but for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said the House's action "clears the way for a new era of space 
exploration and cooperation with our international partners, including Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 "This signals the end of doubt about America's commitment to space 
exploration," the vice president said in a statement released after the vote.

NAVY MEMO STILL SEES CHANCE OF SAVING EL TORO

 The Navy is studying the possibility that some naval and Marine Corps bases 
slated for closure could be kept open if Congress can be persuaded that the 
military installations are vital to national defense or closing them would be 
too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 A June 1 Navy Department memo told base commanders they are welcome to 
"propose changes to the previously approved . . . base recommendations of the . 
. . (congressionally appointed) commissions." 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in Orange County is among the bases 
scheduled to be closed by 1999. The Marine Corps is a part of the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Base Closure and Realignment Commissions have made recommendations to 
Congress in 1988, 1991 and 1993 on which military bases are the least vital to 
national defense and could be closed as a means of reducing defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress will appoint a new commission in 1995 to recommend additional 
closings of military bases, and the Navy Department memo raises the possibility 
that some Navy bases that are still operating but scheduled for closure could 
eventually be put on a list of bases to be "reconsidered" by the new 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo, which was obtained by The Times, instructs officials at bases 
scheduled for closure or realignment that they must give "compelling reasons" 
for saving the installations. It notes that changes in the base-closure plans 
could be made if "significant revisions to cost-effectiveness . . . have 
occurred since the relevant commission recommendation was made." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the memo states that a reconsideration request should address a 
base's "clear military value" and "significant savings" that can be realized by 
keeping the installation open, rather than closing it. But any request for 
reconsideration should "be submitted with full objective justification," said 
the memo. 
</P>
<P>
 A Navy official familiar with the memo said it opened "a Pandora's box" in the 
case of the El Toro base. Marine Maj. Gen. P. Drax Williams, commander of El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station, and other supporters of the base have argued in 
the past that closing the base and moving the Marines to Miramar Naval Air 
Station in San Diego is not cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Williams raised eyebrows in Washington by publicly questioning 
whether it wouldn't be cheaper to keep El Toro open. In March 1993, Williams 
told a Leisure World audience: "We are not going to make a stupid decision 
here. If in fact this is too hard to do or it's too expensive, or if it's 
immoral to dump 4,600 Marine families on the economy in San Diego . . . then El 
Toro will not close." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, some supporters of El Toro said the Navy's apparent willingness 
to take another look at the decision to close the base shows that Williams was 
correct when he argued that it was cheaper to keep the Marine installation 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the memo vindicates (Williams') earlier position," said Art Bloomer, 
former commanding general at El Toro and Irvine city councilman. "Closing El 
Toro is a dumb move. It's not cost-effective, and the decision to shut it down 
should be reversed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Williams has expressed concern about how Marines could be housed 
in San Diego, where there already is a shortage of military housing. The 
Marines Corps would have to subsidize the housing of Marine families who would 
be forced to rent homes. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Marine figures, closing El Toro and the Tustin Marine Corps Air 
Station, which is scheduled to be closed by 1997, will cost about $1.6 billion. 
Lt. Brad Bartelt, a Marine spokesman at El Toro, said it costs about $46 
million annually to run the El Toro base. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartelt said the Marines have not seen the Navy memo and declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials in Washington ignored requests for comment on the memo. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon spokesman Glenn Flood said that "anything is possible if it gets into 
the 1995 commission's hands." But he said that Navy and Marine officials would 
have a "tough selling job ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Navy and Marine officials wish to put El Toro on a reconsideration 
list in 1995, they still would have to convince the Defense Department that the 
Marine base should be saved. If Defense Secretary William Perry agreed that El 
Toro should remain open, then he would ask the yet-to-be-empaneled 1995 
commission to consider keeping the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the secretary (of defense) doesn't buy it, then the base will be closed as 
planned," Flood said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is precedent for putting bases on a reconsideration list. The Marine 
helicopter base at Tustin was recommended for closure by the 1991 commission, 
which also suggested sending Tustin's helicopters to the Marine base at 
Twentynine Palms. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 commission agreed that the Tustin base should be closed, but canceled 
the transfer to Twentynine Palms and redirected the helicopters to Miramar 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), whose district includes the Marine 
base, said "the possibility that El Toro would be put on the reconsider list in 
1995 has always existed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cox, a supporter of the Marine base, said he is "90% sure" the 
recommendation by the 1993 commission to close the installation "will stick. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy still wants to close El Toro, but they haven't been able to find the 
$1 billion needed to move the Marines to Miramar," said Cox. "That is the only 
reason for the Navy's reconsideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of a November ballot advisory measure in favor of converting the El 
Toro base into a commercial airport said it is unlikely that the Pentagon or 
the 1995 commission would reverse course and work to save the Marine air base. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be all kinds of reasons for keeping El Toro open, but it's unlikely 
once they make a decision to close the base they will make another decision to 
reopen it," said Garden Grove City Councilman Mark Leyes. "The base is going to 
close, and if we're wise, we'll use it as a commercial airport."

LAWYER-TURNED-BIKER GETS 3 CONSECUTIVE TERMS FOR MURDERS 
</P>

 Orange County's longest-running criminal case came to a close Wednesday as a 
biker leader and former counterculture lawyer was sentenced to three 
consecutive prison terms of 15 years to life in the execution slayings of two 
bikers and the daughter of a Los Alamitos police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas F. Maniscalco, a Westminster attorney who co-founded the Hessians 
motorcycle club, had protested his innocence throughout the 10 years since his 
arrest in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Maniscalco sat impassively as Orange County Superior Court Judge 
Kathleen E. O'Leary sentenced him. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco, 49, was convicted of three counts of second-degree murder for the 
shooting deaths of fellow Hessian Richard (Rabbit) Rizzone, 36; Rizzone's 
bodyguard, Thomas Monahan, 28, and Rizzone's girlfriend, Rena Miley, 19. Miley 
was also raped during the killings, which took place on Memorial Day in 1980 in 
Rizzone's Westminster home. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Miley's father, now retired from the Los Alamitos force and 
living in Riverside County, told the judge that his family has never recovered 
from their loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one only needs to use their imagination to understand the devastation 
to the entire family," Gary Miley said, adding that nine months after the 
murder he suffered a major heart attack that doctors attributed to stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco, the son of a retired police sergeant, was convicted March 15, 1994 
-- 10 years after the date of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 During a tortuous odyssey through the legal system, there were two trials and 
numerous bizarre twists in the case -- including the suicide of one of 17 
judges involved in the case over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Maniscalco ordered the killings after a dispute over 
counterfeit money and drug profits that Rizzone allegedly skimmed from the 
motorcycle club. Defense attorneys, however, contended that Maniscalco was 
framed. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was always troublesome for police, who suspected that Maniscalco was 
involved but could not piece together enough evidence to make an arrest until 
four years after the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco and fellow biker Daniel M. Duffy of Long Beach were charged with 
the murders. A separate jury convicted Duffy in 1992, and he was sentenced to 
life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco's first trial lasted 17 months, and jury deliberations spanned 26 
days -- a state record -- before jurors deadlocked. During the second trial, 
jurors deliberated 24 days before convicting him of three counts of 
second-degree murder.

CYCLING REACHES 'CRITICAL MASS'; TRANSPORTATION: BIKE RIDERS REVEL IN THEIR 
MONTHLY GROUP PROTEST AGAINST CARS IN SAN FRANCISCO. BUT ANGRY RUSH-HOUR 
DRIVERS BLARE HORNS AND SHOUT CURSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It is half past 5 on the final Friday evening of June, and hundreds of people 
have gathered in the heart of the financial district, filling a public plaza 
beside San Francisco Bay. Some wear suits and ties. Others sport Day-Glo 
spandex. All share one thing in common -- a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and old, fit and flabby, they have come together for "Critical Mass," an 
extraordinary monthly happening that clogs San Francisco's busiest downtown 
streets with bikes during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 At the stroke of 6, the ting-a-ling of bicycle bells rings out. Then, with 
loud whoops and whistles, the riders set forth, oozing onto Market Street as a 
phalanx of motorcycle cops block traffic and clear their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long live pedal power!" shouts one cyclist astride a battered, fat-tired 
beach cruiser. "Death to cars!" cries another aboard a more upscale Italian 
two-wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretching five or six city blocks in length, the colorful caravan has the 
giddy feel of a parade. There are cyclists in top hats and tails, cyclists 
towing toddlers in wagons and cyclists wearing gas masks in a silent statement 
against air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 But Critical Mass is more than a two-wheeled party. It is, in essence, a 
moving sit-in -- a friendly seizure of space by those who believe cars should 
not always rule the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "The typical urban experience on a bike is that you are alone, cars are 
exhausting on you and drivers are honking and threatening you and basically 
treating you like scum," said Chris Carlsson, who owns a typesetting business 
and never misses a ride. "That's why Critical Mass is so euphoric. You don't 
have those worries, and bicycling becomes a social experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneered in San Francisco, the Critical Mass concept has quickly spread 
beyond the Bay Area, prompting duplicates in Manhattan; Austin, Tex.; Eugene, 
Ore., and other cities. Rio de Janeiro has a weekly ride that draws 5,000 
cyclists. And next month, the ritual will invade Southern California with a 
ride in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants call the excursions an innocuous celebration of cycling, and 
tourists and downtown pedestrians seem charmed by the festive affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But car-bound commuters delayed by the cyclists often take a different view. 
In a recent letter to the San Francisco Chronicle, one critic declared himself 
"sick and tired" of being inconvenienced. The bikers, he said, are "ignorant, 
backward-headed thrill-seekers" who belong in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Parking and Traffic Commission agrees. Earlier this month, members 
dubbed the event a "sophomoric prank" and urged police to arrest the cyclists 
for breaking traffic laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In most instances, motorists angered by the riders vent their outrage by 
shouting curses and blaring their horns. Some, however, go further. In one 
incident last year, an impatient driver allegedly hit the gas and slammed into 
a cyclist holding a sign saying "Thank You for Waiting." She was not injured, 
but her bike was crushed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They disrupt a lot of traffic, and people get steamed because this is peak 
drive time," Officer Doug Clennell said as he prepared to mount his motorcycle 
and escort the swarm of cyclists at last Friday's ride. "But they're peaceful. 
I don't have any complaints about that." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Carlsson who conceived of the monthly rides in September, 1992. An avid 
cyclist, Carlsson commutes across San Francisco by bike and only bought a car 
when his daughter became too heavy to tote about on two wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 The term Critical Mass, Carlsson said, was plucked from a documentary on 
bicycling elsewhere in the world. It was used to describe urban cyclists in 
China, who must gather in significant numbers before they can safely cross busy 
intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty cyclists turned out for the first San Francisco ride, many of them bike 
messengers accustomed to the city's narrow, traffic-clogged roadways. The crowd 
quickly doubled, then tripled. Last week's ride -- which included a 
hair-raising descent down the famous twists of Lombard Street -- drew an 
estimated 1,500 riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know so many people who were inspired to try cycling because of this ride," 
said Dave Snyder, executive director of the San Francisco Bike Coalition. 
"People want to ride, but a lot of them are afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 They are afraid, cyclists say, because San Francisco, like many big American 
cities, can be a pretty inhospitable place for those seeking to navigate 
without gas-powered acceleration. The city, Carlsson said, "would be a great 
place to walk and bike if you weren't fighting for your life on the road. This 
place is completely dominated by the need to move large numbers of cars through 
small spaces." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisbet Engberg, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Parking and 
Traffic, said efforts are under way to make San Francisco more 
bicycle-friendly. Plans are afoot to create bike routes, re-stripe traffic 
lanes and install bike racks in parking garages. 
</P>
<P>
 But that, many Critical Mass devotees say, is not enough. The Bike Coalition 
favors the creation of a citywide network of "traffic-calmed" thoroughfares 
reserved for cyclists and pedestrians. The only cars permitted would be those 
owned by residents of the immediate neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 In advocating such goals, San Francisco's bicycle activists are in step with a 
nationwide explosion in bicycling. Over the past decade, the number of 
Americans who commute by bicycle has increased nearly threefold, to 4.3 
million. Every state has a bicycle coordinator, and new laws permit the use of 
federal funds traditionally reserved for highways to be used for biking, 
pedestrian and transit improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are rediscovering the bicycle," said David Cohen, a Critical Mass 
rider and member of the Auto-Free Bay Area Coalition. "For years we've viewed 
it as nothing more than a toy. But it's the most efficient machine we've ever 
made."

BUDGET STALLS IN ASSEMBLY AFTER SENATE OK; GOVERNMENT: GOP MEMBERS SAY THAT TOO 
MUCH WOULD BE SPENT ON SOCIAL SERVICES AND NOT ENOUGH ON PRISONS. CONTROLLER 
PREPARES TO START ISSUING IOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The state Senate on Wednesday passed a $57.3-billion state budget for the 
fiscal year that begins Friday, but Republicans in the Assembly blocked it from 
reaching the governor's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Also stalled in the Assembly were two competing bills that would trigger 
automatic spending reductions or tax increases if the state's fiscal condition 
worsens after a budget is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The discord sent budget negotiators back to the bargaining table to try to 
craft a compromise spending plan and stave off the issuance of IOUs to pay the 
state's bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget bill failed in the Assembly after Republican lawmakers, acting in 
concert with Gov. Pete Wilson, complained that the measure would spend too much 
on welfare and too little on prisons, and could lead to higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This budget is closer to being in a form where it could be supported by 
members of both parties in this house," said Assembly Republican Leader Jim 
Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga. "It's not there yet." 
</P>
<P>
 But Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) warned that he 
did not see much room for further compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't going to get any better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked afterward whether a new budget would include deeper cuts in welfare, 
Brown said, "No way. No way. This is it." 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere in the Capitol was markedly different from the past two years, 
when the budget was negotiated in tense sessions with a sense of urgency. On 
Wednesday, there seemed to be little concern about the consequences of the 
deadlock even as Controller Gray Davis warned that he will begin using IOUs as 
early as Tuesday if a budget is not in place by then. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street kept a close eye on the budget deliberations, waiting to see what 
kind of spending plan the state would adopt before going to investors for a 
planned $7 billion in loans, the largest amount ever sought by any state 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Moody's Investors Service warned that it probably would downgrade the state's 
credit rating if a budget along the lines of the one being negotiated now 
ultimately becomes law or if the talks break down and produce a protracted 
delay. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, Moody's said, is that lawmakers appear headed toward passage of a 
two-year plan that relies on a $2.8-billion federal bailout the year after 
next, an unlikely prospect. Instead, the firm said, it was looking for a plan 
that honestly acknowledged the state's ongoing deficit and enacted a long-term 
strategy to retire it. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower the state's credit rating, the more it will pay to borrow money it 
needs to keep the state running for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget rejected in the Assembly would cut welfare grants 2.3% and reduce 
aid to the aged, blind and disabled by the same amount. Republicans want a cut 
of at least 5% in these grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would boost prison spending about 7%, but Republicans say a 10% 
increase is needed to keep pace with the rapid growth in the number of inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Kindergarten through 12th-grade education would get enough to keep up with 
climbing enrollments but would lose ground to inflation. Community colleges 
would be squeezed a little, but student fees would remain at $13 per unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher education would get a small increase, but the state's two university 
systems still would be expected to raise fees by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are no new taxes in the proposed 1994-95 spending plan, the 
budget is linked to legislation that would affect levies paid by tenants and 
high-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Renters would lose a $60 tax credit that has been suspended for the past two 
years but is scheduled to return in 1995. And the wealthy would see the top 
personal income tax rates -- enacted temporarily in 1991 -- remain in place 
beyond their scheduled 1995 expiration date. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans -- including the governor -- generally favor deleting the renters' 
credit but oppose extending the top rates on the affluent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly vote was 41-34, 13 votes short of the 54 required for a 
two-thirds majority. All the votes in favor of the budget were cast by 
Democrats and all but one of the votes against the bill were cast by 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, however, Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno agreed to vote 
for the budget bill and ignore the Democrats' planned extension of the higher 
income tax rate. The extension, he said, would not take effect until 1996 and 
thus would have no impact on the budget bill voted on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no tax increase in this budget," Maddy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddy and four other Senate Republicans voted for the budget bill, along with 
21 Democrats and two independents. Nine of the 10 votes against the budget were 
cast by Republicans, most of whom demanded deeper spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The only state Senate Democrat to vote against the budget was Sen. Tom Hayden 
of Santa Monica, who complained that it would damage public education, 
universities and the poor while protecting business and the wealthy from higher 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You begin to wonder whether, at least in the urban areas of California, we 
have not already become a Third World state," Hayden said. "There is nothing in 
this budget to resist the general decline of the state into that condition over 
the next 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hayden said he understood why his Democratic colleagues would vote for the 
budget, given threats from Republicans that any revised spending plan would 
only include more cuts in spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, state Sen. Daniel Boatwright of Concord spoke for many Democrats when, 
after criticizing the proposal, he said: "I'm going to hold my nose very 
tightly and vote for this budget." 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly also rejected two different versions of the standby legislation 
that banks have demanded to ensure that the state will repay its debts even if 
the governor's hoped-for $2.8 billion bailout from the federal government does 
not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 A Republican version of the legislation would trigger across-the-board budget 
cuts if the state's cash flow falls behind projections and the governor and the 
Legislature could not agree on a solution. A Democratic version included cuts 
and a narrowing of a business tax break.

 Rarely has the Legislature met the constitutional deadline of June 15 for 
passing the state budget. Lawmakers assess themselves no penalty for their 
tardiness, but state finances begin to feel effects of a budget stalemate when 
the new financial year begins on July 1, a situation that forced the state to 
pay some bills with IOUs two years ago. YEAR: TIMING 1977-78: 9 days late

CAPITOL JOURNAL: DANCING CLOSE TO THE FIRE AT BUDGET TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today is New Year's Eve in the Capitol -- the end of another fiscal year -- 
and again they're doing "The Dance of Death" trying to concoct a state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody dances around the fire. They throw stuff at us. We throw stuff at 
them. Everybody falls over dead and we start all over," a legislative 
strategist once told me in explaining this ritual that the lawmakers believe is 
necessary to break gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 The dance began Monday night in the Senate. The house leader, Sen. Bill 
Lockyer (D-Hayward), proposed something that Republicans instinctively 
rejected. More important, he warned that Democrats won't dance to the 
Republicans' tune and threatened to stay in session all summer -- forcing 
another embarrassing round of state IOUs -- if there's no compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) declared: "We're 
up a creek without a paddle. I'm serious. . . . I don't see a budget solution." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, the dance continued with less stuff being thrown. The Senate 
narrowly passed a budget, while leaving for today a crucial decision on backup 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
 That was clear progress, although in the Assembly, where the dancing was just 
beginning, everybody fell down and started all over. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A new, intriguing twist has been added to this year's dance: The tune really 
is being called by a syndicate of international bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 California is in the role of a Third World country begging the superpowers for 
a bailout. The financiers -- led by Bank of America and including Japanese, 
Canadians, French, Swiss -- are in town closely watching the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting through the jargon, the state is asking this syndicate to co-sign a 
$4-billion loan from Wall Street, which is nervous about Sacramento's ability 
to repay the money when it comes due in April, 1996. The syndicate is demanding 
that the Legislature pass a "trigger" bill that will automatically set in 
motion a predetermined repayment method if revenues again fall short. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats don't want to take the money only from health care, welfare, prisons 
and universities. They're demanding revenue increases, which Republicans call 
the T-word -- taxes -- although it's only the richest people the GOP is 
protecting. Republicans are eager to eliminate the renters tax credit, used 
mostly by low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of this can get very complicated, but some important facts for taxpayers 
are these: The syndicate is charging roughly $30 million to co-sign the loan. 
That's on top of interest to be charged by the lenders. Actually, the state 
needs to borrow $7 billion in all over the next 22 months. And this will cost 
Californians roughly $500 million in interest. 
</P>
<P>
 State government is in a lousy mess. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is reaping what it sowed," says Controller Gray Davis, the 
Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor. "It lived beyond its means for 
more than a decade. And the banking community is saying enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis must certify the feasibility of any backup financing plan -- or trigger 
bill -- and he warns, "I'm not putting my name on any turkey. A wink and a nod 
is not going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the Dance of Death continues, Democrats will enjoy pointing their fingers 
at Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer offered a preview Monday night of what the Republican governor can 
expect if he and the Legislature get bogged in another summer budget deadlock, 
as they did for 63 days in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have before us is the price of procrastination, the price of 
postponement and avoidance of tough decisions -- starting with the captain of 
the ship," Lockyer said loudly and slowly for emphasis. "We all know it. 
Everyone here knows that we have not had adequate executive leadership to 
address our fundamental problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, no Republican stood to defend the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically, Wilson is perched in the best position he's been in since that 
disastrous IOU summer of 1992. After trailing Democratic Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown by landslide margins last year, the governor has steadily pulled even and 
clearly has the momentum in his reelection drive. But the situation still is 
precarious. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown couldn't ask for a better political gift than a summer stalemate that 
again raised questions about Wilson's leadership and reminded Californians of 
why they've given him the lowest job ratings of any modern governor. 
</P>
<P>
 With the dance, there's a game of chicken. Wilson and the GOP believe 
Democratic legislators have the most to lose if voters rebel against 
Sacramento. That's because more Democrats face tough reelection races. But 
Democrats know the governor is vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 They're all dancing dangerously close to the fire.

 The house where former President Richard Nixon lived the last four years of 
his life is for sale at an asking price of $995,000. Nixon's two daughters, 
Julie Nixon Eisenhower and Tricia Nixon Cox, inherited the four-story, 
3,500-square-foot townhouse when Nixon died earlier this year.

AMERICAN ALBUM: ANTE RAISED IN TOWN'S FIGHT AGAINST GAMBLING; COLORADO MAYOR 
THREATENS CIVIL INSURRECTION IF STATE MEASURE TO OUTFLANK CITY PASSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN ROVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A mayor is the last person one might expect to threaten civil insurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 But Manitou Springs Mayor Bud Ford vows to "personally man the barricades" if 
a knot of mostly local investors succeeds in "cramming gambling down our 
throats." 
</P>
<P>
 Twice before, this summer-tourist community of 4,500 people in the shadow of 
Pikes Peak has fended off attempts to bring slot machines and card tables to 
town. They reiterated that stance last November in an advisory election, when 
an overwhelming majority said they did not want gambling here. Locals thought 
that was the end of the matter. Too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Five investors have managed to put an initiative on next November's state 
ballot that will let Coloradans decide whether this placid nest of 
bed-and-breakfast inns, art galleries and antique shops could become one the 
largest gaming resorts in the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsfolk are hopping mad that the fate of their community is tucked inside a 
broader measure designed to allow gambling specifically at Manitou Springs and 
at municipal airports statewide, ostensibly to raise funds for public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors call their political action group the Committee for Better 
Schools. 
</P>
<P>
 A local group -- Citizens Opposed to Gambling With Manitou Springs (COG) -- 
that is trying to sink the initiative calls it Slots for Tots. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, the five businessmen, referred to by state revenue analyst Susan 
Conwell as the McSlot Kings, would be guaranteed rights to all gaming licenses 
in Manitou Springs. They are planning a $60-million to $100-million gaming 
center here with a maximum potential of 10,000 gaming devices. 
</P>
<P>
 That compares with the 11,100 games now operating in Colorado's three gaming 
towns -- Central City, Cripple Creek and Black Hawk. 
</P>
<P>
 Old-timers here say that big-time gaming would undermine a local economy that 
for over a century has banked on its gurgling mineral springs, historic hotels 
and spectacular mountain setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Manitou Springs' downtown sector is on the National Register of 
Historic Places, a drawing card for tourists who flock here from June through 
September to ride the cog railway to the 14,110-foot summit of Pikes Peak and 
browse for art and antiques in the downtown shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "The customers who come to play the quarter slot machines won't come to shop 
for art or antiques," Ford said, standing beside one of 22 sculptures the city 
leases from local artists for public display throughout town. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, says investor Harvey Blasdale, who argues that the gaming -- proposed 
for outside the historic district -- would increase everyone's business. 
</P>
<P>
 With the gambling town of Cripple Creek planning to add substantial new 
lodging facilities only 35 miles southwest of here, he said, "this town better 
do something quick." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the businesses that stand to benefit is Blasdale's new Super 8 motel, 
which is in the middle of the proposed gaming district. 
</P>
<P>
 Blasdale's colleagues are quick to remind that there is more at stake than 
Manitou Springs' prosperity. Investor E. Malcolm Guthrie, who has an option on 
11 acres of commercial property in the proposed gaming district, figures that 
separate gambling at up to 16 municipal airports statewide could generate 
between $50 million and $150 million a year for Colorado schools. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials are less optimistic and project a best-case scenario of $13 
million. Some officials even doubt whether the measure would add a cent to the 
school fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's why. The measure, they say, places no ceiling on the amount that 
airports could reinvest in their own operations. "Frankly," said state 
budgeting analyst Carol Poole, "if it were my airport, I wouldn't want any 
money left over for taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Colorado Department of Education finance consultant Don Herman: "Nobody 
over here is excited about this being a potential source of revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 The investor group insists that detractors are being myopic. But local antique 
store operator John Roberts scoffs at suggestions that the town needs the kind 
of business that gaming would bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a recent city study showed local sales revenues increasing 52.5% over 
the past five years. Real estate agents say there are 40 buyers for every house 
that hits the market in the town that has become a bedroom community for nearby 
Colorado Springs, home of the Air Force Academy. "Look," said Roberts, co-owner 
of Firefly Antiques, with a wave of the arm on the main drag through town, "90% 
of the businesses have 'No Gaming' signs in their windows." 
</P>
<P>
 Others here are even more aghast at attempts by the investor group to 
interpret the results of the advisory vote last November to their own 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Blasdale insists that people were only voting on an "idea," not a specific 
proposal when 88% of those who went to the polls said they did not want gaming 
here. "The number who voted," Blasdale said, "compared with the total number of 
registered voters amounts to only one-third of them saying no." 
</P>
<P>
 "Using that logic," snickered Manitou Springs City Councilman John Shada, 
"George Bush really won the last election." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a laughing matter for Ford. If the measure passes, Ford said, pulling 
a pocketknife out of his jeans to scrape gum off a storefront, "I'll encourage 
everyone to join me in civil disobedience."

YELTSIN SEES RUSSIA BECOMING STABLE; ECONOMY: PRESIDENT SAYS WORST OF 
REFORM-ERA SPASMS ARE OVER. OTHERS CALL OUTLOOK GRIMMER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin asserted Wednesday that Russia, which has enjoyed 
relative political and economic calm for the last few months, is on its way 
toward real stability, with the worst of reform-era spasms over. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is gradually stabilizing. By the end of the year, we expect a 
stable inflation rate of 5% to 6% a month," he told workers in a Moscow suburb. 
"The political situation is also stabilizing. . . . Life has become more 
tranquil." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's claims echoed assurances poured on at a recent meeting of major 
Western companies by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who derided 
investors' reluctance to risk their money in the Russian economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia is a different country today," Chernomyrdin told business leaders from 
the likes of Coca-Cola and United Technologies. "The peak of Russian chaos is 
behind us, and I'm sure this is irreversible." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, of course, are less sanguine. It was just this kind of a suspiciously 
quiet period that preceded the attempted Soviet coup of 1991; Yeltsin's fateful 
decision to disband Parliament last year also came as the brief northern summer 
-- when Russians are too busy toiling in country gardens to play politics -- 
surrendered to autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who see a grimmer outlook point to the new state budget finally approved 
by Parliament last week. It includes a deficit of 70% that is likely to go 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
 They also note the continuing drop in industrial production, which fell by 26% 
in the first half of this year, the Economics Ministry reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, the pessimists say, faces big problems now as it tries to help 1.4 
million registered unemployed workers, up by 600,000 since December. The 
pressure from stalled factories, the jobless and the cash-strapped military 
makes Russia's nascent stability far from guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 But what does appear certain is that Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin are happily 
using the recent peace to embark on a broad image refurbishment meant to 
encourage the foreign investment Russia desperately needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials say foreign investors have injected only about $1 billion 
this year, showing less faith in the prospects of mighty Russia than in the 
economy of the tiny Baltic state of Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kremlin is only beginning active work to attract more foreign money, 
promising tax breaks and long-term land leases to major investors. Investment 
is becoming especially critical for Russia because the Kremlin has curtailed 
its subsidies to industry while selling off thousands of factories to private 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step in revamping Russian industry calls for extensive private 
investment in modernizing factories that show potential, while those that do 
not will be allowed to go bankrupt. But Russians clearly lack the billions upon 
billions of dollars that will be needed to upgrade an industrial base that, at 
many factories, has not been touched for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the foreign investor, and Yeltsin's assertion this week to a group of 
them that "the recent months were the quietest in the political sense during 
the whole period of reforms." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, since the October tumult that left almost 140 people dead in fighting 
between pro-Yeltsin forces and pro-Parliament rebels, Russia has gotten a new 
constitution, a new Parliament and a "Civic Accord," an agreement by political 
parties, unions and regional leaders to try to work together in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's image as a somewhat more civilized place has also been bolstered in 
the last two weeks by its entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 
"Partnership for Peace" program and an agreement with the European Union 
lifting most trade barriers to Russian goods and recognizing Russia as no 
longer a state-run economy but rather one "in transition." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin on Wednesday pointed to dropping inflation -- now at 9% a month 
compared to 26% at the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some state statistics also indicate that Russians' real income has grown by 
about 10% this year. Virtually all statistics in Russia are considered somewhat 
dubious. But the signs of some economic easing are visible even on the streets 
-- if only in the floods of bananas, once rare luxuries, now being hawked in 
Moscow and much of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the signs of a possible economic end of the tunnel, government and 
opposition economists agree Russia has a long, long way to go before it will 
enjoy Western-style, stable prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent economist Pavel Bunich cast doubt on whether the government can 
continue to keep inflation low, noting that the new budget calls for pumping up 
the money supply to cover promises of funding for culture, science and an 
increase in the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most quietly ominous denial that Russia has entered a period 
of stabilization came from the chairman of the Moscow branch of 
ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky's party. The recent period of calm, 
said Viktor Bogaty, means that "Russian people still haven't decided what to 
do. Now is a period of thinking things over, and then we will act."

THE COURT OF RUSSIAN PUBLIC OPINION; POLITICS: NATIONALIST LEADER ZHIRINOVSKY 
IS SUING REFORMIST CHIEF GAIDAR FOR SLANDER. ASIDE FROM THE THEATRICS, THE REAL 
ISSUE IS THE 1996 ELECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some day soon, the bad boy of Russian politics, ultranationalist Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky, and the good boy, reform economist Yegor T. Gaidar, will lock 
horns in the courtroom in an epic battle of darkness and light. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, they are playing hide-and-seek. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yegorushka! Yegorushka!" Zhirinovsky called -- using the affectionate 
diminutive of Yegor to increase the mockery -- as he pretended to look around 
for Gaidar on Wednesday at Moscow City Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's afraid," Zhirinovsky concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 That is much what Gaidar said of Zhirinovsky when the raspy-voiced populist 
failed to show up at their last court date. At issue is Zhirinovsky's claim of 
500 million rubles (about $250,000) from Gaidar for calling him a fascist and 
worse in print. Zhirinovsky hates to be called a fascist, even though some of 
his views -- on Russian nationalism and military strength -- fit the dictionary 
definition. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real issue goes deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky's pandering promises of everything from cheap vodka to the return 
of the Russian empire captured the biggest share of voter support in December's 
parliamentary elections, raising the grim specter that Russia's next president 
could be a man with territorial ambitions and an erratic nature. 
</P>
<P>
 While President Boris N. Yeltsin has remained largely silent on Zhirinovsky, 
Gaidar and his pro-reform party, now known as the Democratic Choice of Russia, 
have borne the brunt of the fight to persuade Russians that they should not 
succumb to facile promises of law, order and easy money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gaidar-Zhirinovsky faceoff symbolizes the probable choice Russian voters 
will face in the 1996 elections -- whether they will opt for ugly truths and 
difficult reforms or pretty promises and a regime likely to smack of 
dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 In past weeks, there have been indications that Zhirinovsky's support might be 
flagging, but he has mounted a new cavalcade of scandals lately to regain the 
limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, he reportedly took over the office of the governor of the 
Nizhny Novgorod region -- a young reformist star, Boris Nemtsov -- and claimed 
that Nemtsov had hidden in another office for fear of meeting him. Adding to 
the unsavory incident were reports from Nemtsov's staff that about $50 went 
missing after the visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky was also refused access this week to Arzamas-16, a formerly secret 
city of atomic-bomb builders that still requires special permission for entry. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, he and his Liberal Democratic Party of Russia were given 
permission to rent a choice building in central Moscow in a move that hinted at 
support among city authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready to kick up as big a fuss as he could manage, Zhirinovsky arrived at 
Moscow City Court on Wednesday morning with his usual bevy of young male 
backers and bodyguards in flashy, double-breasted jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 He never got the chance to make his case in court, because Gaidar's lawyer had 
sent a request asking that the hearing be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as usual, Zhirinovsky made his case on the street amid a crowd of 
supporters and press. 
</P>
<P>
 "How are we fascists?" he demanded in his hectoring, rapid-fire style. "Did we 
kill anyone, deprive anyone of work, deprive anyone of freedom, what did we do? 
We're an opposition party." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time a court date was set, June 14, Gaidar came and Zhirinovsky did 
not -- he had withdrawn the suit, only to renew it days later. This time it was 
the other way around; the next time, set for July 7, probably Gaidar will show 
up and Zhirinovsky will not, Zhirinovsky predicted.

U.N. DEMANDS YEMEN HALT ATTACK ON REBEL CITY ADEN; MIDEAST: CIVILIAN 
CASUALTIES, WATER SHORTAGES PROMPT SECURITY COUNCIL TO URGE A CEASE-FIRE. 
</P>

<P>
 Alarmed by reports of heavy civilian casualties and dangerous shortages of 
water, the U.N. Security Council demanded Wednesday that the government of 
Yemen halt its offensive against the main rebel city of Aden on the edge of the 
Arabian Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Security Council, in a resolution approved unanimously, took no action 
to punish the government of Yemen or to attempt to stop the 2-month-old civil 
war by force. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the ambassadors urged both sides to sign a cease-fire, accept 
international observers to monitor it and begin talks to settle their 
differences peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 The council seemed most concerned about the fate of Aden, the largest city in 
southern Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The military assault on Aden continues," said Madeleine Albright, U.S. 
ambassador to the United Nations. "We are alarmed by reports of a northern 
ground offensive, renewed shelling of civilian areas and heavy casualties. We 
are further alarmed by the humanitarian situation in Yemen, including the 
interruption of water supplies to Aden and the potential outbreak of disease." 
</P>
<P>
 North and South Yemen united into a single state in 1990. But the union has 
been a difficult one, with leaders of the less populous south, which had been a 
Marxist state, accusing the other Yemeni leaders of repression. 
</P>
<P>
 The southern leaders proclaimed secession in late April, and the civil war 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has vowed to seize Aden, a famous port of 
call during the days of the British Empire. His heavy weapons have the city of 
250,000 in range, and U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali reported to 
the council Wednesday that "a major crisis is imminent unless a political 
solution is found, or at least a cease-fire is put into force as soon as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 A special U.N. envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister, has 
tried to negotiate a truce, meeting with both sides in Yemen and at U.N. 
headquarters in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the vote, in fact, a southern Yemen representative pledged to 
Brahimi that the secessionists would respect a 48-hour cease-fire called for by 
the International Committee of the Red Cross to let relief supplies into Aden. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as British Ambassador David Hannay told the Security Council, "so many 
cease-fires have been proclaimed and quickly abandoned" since the fighting 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 In the negotiations, Brahimi has found that the two sides cannot agree on the 
nationalities of the observers who would monitor a cease-fire. The government 
at first resisted any observers at all. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the White House, which is attempting to limit peacekeeping 
operations, did not want a standard U.N. force. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of these objections, the resolution leaves the makeup of the observer 
force somewhat vague, not even calling it a force but only a "mechanism." 
</P>
<P>
 Ambassador Albright made it clear that the United States does not want the 
Yemeni mission to be paid for as a regular U.N. peacekeeping operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government pays almost a third of peacekeeping budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 She said "those nations closest to the conflict in Yemen have the greatest 
stake in resolving this conflict" and that the United States looks to them "and 
others who might be interested to offer on a voluntary basis the resources 
needed to implement a mechanism that would supervise a cease-fire." She 
evidently had Saudi Arabia, which dominates the peninsula, in mind as the main 
contributor.

CONTINUED HAITIAN EXODUS EXPECTED, U.S. SAYS; CARIBBEAN: WHITE HOUSE PREPARED 
TO SHELTER UP TO 12,000 REFUGEES AT GUANTANAMO BAY IN CUBA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Clinton Administration officials said Wednesday that they expect refugees to 
continue flooding out of Haiti as long as the military rules there, and they 
announced that they are preparing to house as many as 12,000 Haitians at a 
newly reopened tent city at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Coast Guard picked up at least 521 more refugees in boats Wednesday, 
bringing the number rescued over the last five days to more than 3,500 -- a 
total that exceeds the number picked up in all of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they have concluded that there is little hope of stopping 
the exodus, which they acknowledge has been spurred by the Clinton 
Administration's tighter economic embargo on Haiti and its promises of more 
humane treatment of refugees, as well as by military repression on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers appealed again to Haitians to stay 
in their homeland, but another senior official said that the refugees have 
"many good reasons" for fleeing by boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell us why they came" in interviews with the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, the official said. "There is a combination of factors: 
the fact that we have put a system in place that is a humane way to process 
people, the increasing pressure of sanctions, the pressure of military abuses, 
their concern with a hopeless situation in Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's appeals to Haitians to remain on the island and apply for 
refugee status there have failed for two reasons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 First, some applicants have been stalked and persecuted by those in power in 
Haiti. Second, refugees who leave by boat "are out of Haiti immediately," while 
those who apply on the island face a delay of uncertain length before they can 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, we're offering them three square meals and a shower," the official 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, Clinton Administration spokespersons say that the main factor 
prompting increased emigration is worsening repression by the Haitian military. 
But other officials say that is not certain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, what we are seeing is a continuing deterioration of the human rights 
situation in Haiti . . . and surely we believe that the reason for these 
outflows is connected to that," President Clinton's special ambassador for 
Haiti policy, former Rep. William H. Gray III, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 At a formal briefing at the White House, Gray insisted several times that this 
week's sudden flood of refugees has come as no surprise to the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 And he predicted that the exodus will continue until Haiti's military regime 
is toppled. 
</P>
<P>
 But other officials, in both Washington and Port-au-Prince, Haiti, said that 
the human rights situation in Haiti appears to be a less important factor than 
reports of relatively comfortable refugee facilities for those who flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, human rights organizations in Haiti report that repression appears to 
have eased, at least in the short run. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of this year, the human rights groups estimated an average of more 
than 50 political murders each month in Port-au-Prince alone -- but they have 
recorded six killings this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, what appears to have happened in part is that the INS interviewers 
who ask Haitians to prove that they suffer "a well-founded fear of prosecution" 
have become easier to convince as a result of earlier reports of mounting 
repression. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray confirmed that the percentage of Haitians approved by the INS for refugee 
status -- which means eventual resettlement in the United States, Canada or 
elsewhere -- has climbed from about 5% last year to "between 20% and 30%" 
today. In some periods, other officials have said, the percentage approved has 
been as high as 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers approved are still relatively small, however. 
</P>
<P>
 White House spokeswoman Myers said that of 697 Haitians interviewed aboard the 
U.S. Navy hospital ship Comfort in recent weeks, 211, or about 30%, were 
approved for refugee status, and 161 of those have already been moved to 
Guantanamo for "final resettlement processing," which includes an AIDS test 
required by the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 486 people denied refugee status already have been returned to 
Haiti by the Coast Guard, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another move to increase sanctions against wealthy Haitians, the State 
Department revoked all U.S. visitors' visas issued at Port-au-Prince and the 
nearby island of Curacao. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is meant to target people who are close to the privileged class, who 
have supported the de facto government, who have supported the military 
regime," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The order does not affect Haitians who are permanent residents of the United 
States, who hold immigrant visas or who are residents of countries other than 
Haiti and obtained their U.S. visas there. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitians who are now in the United States on visitors' visas will not be 
deported, she said, but if they leave the country they will not be allowed back 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House official also said that Air France, the sole major air carrier 
still landing in Haiti, is expected to cut off service soon. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and Canadian airlines were ordered by their governments to end service to 
Haiti this month, but the French government has not pressed Air France to stop 
its flights until now. 
</P>

PERRY BEGINS OVERHAUL OF DEFENSE PROCUREMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of criticism that the defense procurement system is grossly 
inefficient and wasteful, Defense Secretary William J. Perry on Wednesday took 
the first step in a major overhaul intended to save billions of dollars 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry signed a directive Wednesday that requires Pentagon weapon buyers to use 
commercial standards rather than the lengthy and detailed military 
specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 The specifications have perpetuated a defense industry that increasingly has 
grown isolated from the mainstream of American business, Perry said, resulting 
in higher costs, slower responses and the use of technology in defense systems 
that is older than new commercial products on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen many examples of semiconductor chips where the commercial version 
cost a few dollars and where the military (version cost) $10 or $20," Perry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reform "turns the present system upside down," Perry said, forcing program 
managers to justify why the government should pay extra for buying 
non-commercial products, rather than the past system requiring exemptions every 
time a manager wanted to stray from defense specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry in the past has cited estimates that as much as one-third of defense 
acquisition spending is wasted through inefficiency. But industry leaders are 
uncertain whether these reforms will solve the inefficiencies that increasingly 
make weapons unaffordable. 
</P>
<P>
 Many layers of defense regulations will remain intact. Ultimately, the reforms 
may address only a small part of what causes weapon costs to be so high, 
industry executives have said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a sense of urgency today that we need to do something," said Peter 
C. Scrivner, vice president at the American Defense Preparedness Assn., which 
has lobbied hard for major reforms. "This is not the total answer. It is not 
going to eliminate the 35% that is wasted. It is only a part of the attempt to 
modernize the acquisition system." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry could not estimate exactly how much the revisions will save, though he 
said the goal is to save billions of dollars every year. Just in purchases of 
electronic systems, he estimated, the measures would cut costs by $700 million 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, military specifications were seen as necessary to set standards 
for products that had no commercial equivalent. But in many areas, commercial 
technology now eclipses military technology, and the specifications are 
virtually obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some military specifications went to absurd lengths, such as an 
Army recipe for cookies that exceeded a dozen pages and Navy standards for 
soldering electronic connections that involved appearance more than function.

CUOMO SEEKS HEALTH BENEFITS FOR GAY WORKERS' PARTNERS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 New York would become the second state to provide health benefits to the 
partners of homosexual state workers under a plan announced by Gov. Mario M. 
Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuomo made the announcement Tuesday at a reception commemorating the 1969 
Stonewall riots at a New York City gay bar, considered the beginning of the gay 
rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said they did not know how many people would be eligible or 
how much the plan would cost. Details must be negotiated with unions 
representing 162,000 state workers. 
</P>
<P>
 New York would become the second state, after Vermont, to offer homosexual 
partners the same benefits as spouses of state workers, said Dick Dadey of the 
Empire State Pride Agenda, a statewide gay lobby.

FILIBUSTER AGAIN DEFEATS PRODUCT LIABILITY REFORM; DAMAGES: SENATE BLOCKS 
EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH UNIFORM STANDARDS. BILL WAS BACKED BY BUSINESS INTERESTS, 
OPPOSED BY CONSUMER GROUPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Business groups suffered a major defeat in the Senate on Wednesday when an 
unusual coalition of liberals and conservatives from both parties voted to 
block any changes in the nation's patchwork of product liability laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest in a series of efforts to establish uniform federal standards for 
the lawsuits that consumers bring against the manufacturers of dangerous 
products was shelved for the year after proponents fell three votes short of 
the 60 they needed to break a filibuster that paired such unlikely allies as 
liberal Democrat Barbara Boxer of California and conservative Republican Whip 
Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming. The vote was 57 to 41. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 13th straight year that one form or another of the Product 
Liability Reform Act had been stymied in Congress, and the sponsors of this 
year's bill, Sens. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.) and Slade Gorton 
(R-Wash.), vowed to try again next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Same time, same place, next year. We'll be back. One of these days we are 
going to win it," added Gorton. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill had been supported by a wide array of business interests, including 
pharmaceutical manufacturers, insurance companies and auto makers who have long 
complained that state courts handle liability claims in unpredictable ways that 
often raise product costs, undermine competitiveness and make insurance 
unaffordable for smaller businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 It was strongly opposed by consumer groups, trial lawyers and labor unions, 
who particularly objected to provisions that would have restricted the right to 
sue or limited damages in cases where consumers have been injured by drugs or 
other medical products approved by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's groups also strongly opposed those provisions, which would have denied 
women harmed by such products as the DES pregnancy drug, silicone-gel breast 
implants and the Dalkon Shield the right to sue for punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rockefeller agreed at the last minute to drop the FDA provision in an 
effort to get more votes, consumer advocates continued to fight another 
controversial reform that would have protected gun dealers against lawsuits 
brought by people injured by guns sold illegally to felons or minors. 
</P>
<P>
 "By defeating the product liability bill, the Senate has successfully derailed 
the 'Gun Dealer Protection Act,' " said Josh Sugarmann, executive director of 
the Violence Policy Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's defeat, added Kristen Rand of Consumers Union, is "a huge victory 
for American consumers and a narrowly averted disaster for victims of gun 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
 While the new focus on women's health added an extra layer of controversy over 
what has been a perennial congressional debate, this year's fight also had 
another unusual twist. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the debate over consumer safety versus industrial competitiveness 
and tort reform was always a partisan issue, with Republican administrations 
siding with business groups in pressing the reforms and a Democratically 
controlled Congress siding with consumer advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year a number of changes incorporated by Rockefeller and other 
Democrats scrambled the normal partisan divisions even as the Clinton 
Administration declined to take sides in the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 While most Democrats voted to filibuster the bill, some liberals became 
passionate supporters of what Connecticut Democratic Sen. Christopher J. Dodd 
argued was a "moderate" reform proposal that "puts an end to the game of 
Russian roulette that our product liability system has become." 
</P>
<P>
 California's Senate delegation split, with Boxer voting against the bill and 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein joining the 19 Democrats who voted with 38 of the 
Senate's 44 Republicans to end the filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
 A product liability bill has not gotten out of committee in the House this 
year.

HEAT IN SOUTHWEST SETS BLAZING RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The thermometer hit 125 degrees Wednesday in this gambling resort town on the 
Colorado River. The previous record of 124, the all-time record for the entire 
state of Nevada, had been on the record books for just one day. 
</P>
<P>
 And Laughlin wasn't even the hottest point in the region. A few miles 
downriver, Lake Havasu City, Ariz., fried at 128 degrees, a record for Arizona 
and the town's fifth day above 120. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters blamed the inferno on a vast bubble of hot air stuck over the 
Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat records have toppled from the Southern California desert to Texas and 
Oklahoma. Along the California side of the Colorado River, Blythe and Needles 
both hit 121, as did Palm Springs. Elsewhere in California, Death Valley hit 
126.

SPECIAL COUNSEL TO REPORT TODAY ON FIRST PART OF WHITEWATER PROBE 
</P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. will issue his first report 
today, giving his findings on Vincent Foster's death and contacts between 
regulators and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the report will reaffirm the police conclusion that Foster, the 
deputy White House counsel who was found fatally shot in a suburban Washington 
park last July, committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The interim report comes as Fiske is wrapping up the Washington phase of his 
investigation. He next turns his attention to various Arkansas business 
dealings involving President and Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske's office declined Wednesday to describe the contents of the report. But 
the Associated Press previously reported that Fiske's review of forensic 
evidence reaffirmed the suicide conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske has said the report also will address: 
</P>
<P>
 * The handling of documents that White House officials removed from Foster's 
office in the hours after his death. Some of those documents involved the 
Clintons' Whitewater land development venture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Contacts between the White House and Treasury Department on the status of a 
federal probe of a failed Arkansas savings and loan owned by James B. McDougal, 
the Clintons' Whitewater partner.

24 FOREIGN CRIMINALS DEPORTED TO MAKE SPACE IN FLORIDA PRISONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Florida sent home 24 foreign criminals on Wednesday, the first group of 
immigrant inmates deported to free up space in the state's prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The prisoners were granted clemency and then put on planes home under an 
agreement between the state and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I keep them here, then I'm having to turn out a violent Floridian or U.S. 
citizen," Gov. Lawton Chiles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen men in handcuffs and street clothes were paraded single file in front 
of the governor and reporters, then taken to the airport. Nine women prisoners 
were processed separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the first group came from Colombia; the rest were from the Dominican 
Republic, Grenada, Jamaica, the Bahamas, Honduras, Peru, Mexico and Nicaragua. 
All were drug offenders who were serving sentences ranging from three to 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminals receive clemency in exchange for agreeing to be deported and 
never to return. That means they do not have to be jailed in their homelands. 
The deportations involve only nonviolent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 If the prisoners return to the United States, they will be subject to federal 
charges for returning illegally and will be sent back to prison. They also will 
lose credit for any time they served before they were deported.

 Television news crews from near and far were gathering around the Criminal 
Courts Building in Downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday, preparing to make today's 
preliminary hearing for O.J. Simpson one of the most-watched live news events 
in history. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:30 a.m., the former football star and actor is scheduled to face charges 
that he murdered his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald 
Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, news crews from around the world and two dozen satellite-feed 
trucks set up equipment in the parking lot of the Criminal Courts Building. A 
chorus line of TV news reporters lined up outside the courthouse in the 
oppressive heat, rehearsing their lines out loud or videotaping remote reports 
and promotional spots, as a city worker posted temporary no-parking signs 
around the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most sensational celebrity murder trial in United States 
history," said Dana Adams, a reporter from WNBC-TV in New York. "I talked to a 
reporter from Germany . . . and he said this story typified the shattering of 
the American dream." 
</P>
<P>
 In air-conditioned offices, meanwhile, local TV station executives were making 
plans to wipe out most of their scheduled programming today and beyond -- while 
assessing the severe financial consequences -- to provide uninterrupted 
coverage of the proceedings, which may last for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 No fewer than seven local TV stations will broadcast the same live signal, 
provided by Court TV's pool camera inside the courtroom, even though the 
resulting loss of advertising revenue may cost each station $100,000 to 
$200,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the country will receive live coverage from the networks and from 
cable outlets. The networks are using their top guns -- Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather 
and Peter Jennings -- as in-studio hosts from New York. Cable News Network has 
assigned 40 reporters, producers and crew members to follow today's events. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest press contingent to cover a news story in this city, 
probably ever," said Joel Tator, executive producer of "KTLA Morning News." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the preparations, however, none of those providing coverage know 
what to expect this morning, or how many hours or days they will follow the 
proceedings inside the courtroom before returning to regular programming with 
routine news updates. Regular programs are normally preempted only by news that 
is a public service to viewers, such as that concerning natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, however, news directors and station executives say they have 
cleared out their schedules because the Simpson case is simply good TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in the business for a long time, and this is one of the most 
compelling stories that has ever come along," said Alan Nesbitt, general 
manager of KABC-TV Channel 7. "The whole country is carrying this live. It's of 
such a compelling nature that it precludes not carrying it." 
</P>
<P>
 The A.C. Nielsen Co. reported that 95 million people nationwide watched police 
pursue Simpson on Southern California freeways June 17. In addition, prime-time 
news magazines featuring the subject soared in the ratings last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This station covered the Rodney King trial, and I thought when we did that, 
that was most definitely a public service," said Jose Rios, news director for 
KTTV-TV Channel 11. "There was a very large impact on this entire region, and 
airing that was a public service in every sense of the word. In this case, I 
think it's more an issue of high interest." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we can find the truth to whatever the story is now," said Greg 
Nathanson, general manager of KTLA-TV Channel 5. "In some ways, you hope to 
stop the rumor mill and show the actual facts. The camera won't lie, and for 
the first time the story won't be filtered through 50 reporters and writers." 
</P>
<P>
 KCOP-TV Channel 13 is the only major TV station in the Los Angeles market not 
providing live coverage of the hearings, choosing instead to stick to regular 
programming with news cut-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to minimize the death of these two people or the fact that this 
is a big story," General Manager Rick Feldman said, "but to some extent, I 
really do believe people have lost perspective on this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand -- why don't seven stations ever blow out all their 
programming for (positive news)? I know it's somewhat self-serving, but there's 
no reason for seven stations to carry the same feed. I don't think any of those 
stations doing this are offering any kind of service to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy of most local TV stations will be to stick with courtroom 
coverage as long as it's interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lord knows what is going to be disclosed for the preliminary hearing. If it 
makes for compelling television, we will stay with it," said Bob Jordan, news 
director at KCBS-TV Channel 2. If it turns into a dry court hearing, we will go 
back to our regular programming." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be several breaks during the day when stations plan to run 
commercials to make up for some of the lost revenue. For the anticipated long 
lunch break at noon, KCBS plans to run soap operas, and KNBC-TV Channel 4 will 
broadcast highlights of Wimbledon tennis matches, which NBC had scheduled to 
cover through the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 All three network affiliates will feature their own local news coverage of the 
Simpson hearings, instead of the network feeds. 
</P>
<P>
 The networks are taking the same wait-and-see approach as local stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to take the temperature of it," said David Bohrman, executive 
producer of special events for NBC. "Will the hearing be really interesting and 
compelling? Maybe. Will it be really arcane and overly complicated and obtuse? 
Maybe. We need to see what it looks and feels like. Then we will determine what 
the coverage will be."

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY; SHAPING THE NEWS MEANS 
SHAPING MINDS OF JURORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As I joined the crowd of reporters questioning O.J. Simpson's defense 
attorney, Robert L. Shapiro, I thought about the powerful role the media play 
in the criminal justice system, just as he does. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro knew it, too. Friendly, knowing the reporters by name, he talked to 
them as if they were the most important people in his life -- and at that 
moment they were. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned to one, his face reflecting none of the tension of the case. "Back 
from vacation," he said with a smile, looking delighted that the reporter was 
there. He urged another reporter, impatient for answers, to relax. He'd answer 
her questions. He did, with courtesy and respect. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney's helpful manner, during an informal question-and-answer session, 
in a Criminal Courts Building hallway after a hearing Tuesday, illustrated the 
way the prosecution and defense are trying to influence, or "spin," the 
coverage of the Simpson murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do they care how the case is covered? Because they know the men and women 
who will be chosen to determine the fate of O.J. Simpson, America's most famous 
murder suspect, are probably watching. By spinning the press, Shapiro was 
trying to influence the jury pool, in the same way politicians and their 
consultants manipulate the media in an effort to influence voters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro's performance has its roots not in the law, but in the maelstrom of 
American politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Spin has been a powerful force in that arena since the advent of televised 
presidential debates. The process can be seen on television when, after the 
debates, campaign handlers swarm into the press room, trying to influence the 
reporters' stories. The spinners figure if they hammer the press enough, the 
stories will proclaim a victory for their candidate, influencing the electorate 
-- and the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The first spinners were guided by gut instinct. But they were also shaped by 
social scientists engaged in increasingly sophisticated research into how 
communities and voters behave. The scholars' research showed political managers 
the correlation between the presentation of news, especially on television, and 
voter decision making. 
</P>
<P>
 Other social scientists figured out ways to use the research in the selection 
of criminal trial juries. These were political activists assisting with the 
defense in some of the great political trials of the 1960s and '70s, including 
those resulting from Vietnam War protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendants were unpopular and were different from the vast majority of 
the jurors," said Terri Waller, managing partner of the National Jury Project, 
which figured out how to gauge community sentiment and analyze jurors' 
backgrounds to determine their prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar firms are operating around the country. In fact, what began as an 
attempt by anti-war activists to beat the system is now a growth industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is applying the skills of a political campaign to a courtroom," said 
Jo-Ellan Dimitrius of Trial Logistics, a Pasadena firm that worked for the 
defense in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case, the "night stalker" murder 
trial, and the Rodney G. King and Reginald O. Denny beating cases. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This background helps explain why Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti mounted an 
unusually vigorous campaign on national television after Simpson's arrest. He 
may have learned from the Menendez brothers' murder case, in which his team was 
outclassed on television and in court by defense attorney Leslie Abramson, a 
pro herself at the spin game. 
</P>
<P>
 On "This Week With David Brinkley," Garcetti pushed spin to the limit when he 
said "Well, it's not going to shock me if we see an O.J. Simpson, sometime down 
the road -- and it could happen very soon, it could happen months from now say, 
'OK, I did it but I'm not responsible.' We've seen it in Mendendez. It's going 
to be a likely defense here, I believe, once the evidence is reviewed by the 
lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure, too, that Garcetti, as well as Shapiro, are aware of polling figures 
that show Simpson is much more highly regarded than the usual murder suspect. 
"The traditional view is that 80% of the public that walks into a courtroom 
believes the defendant is guilty because they think: 'Where there's smoke, 
there's fire,' " said jury consultant Dimitrius. "But because of his 
(Simpson's) name recognition, because we have all grown up with O.J. in our 
lives, I believe the ultimate judgment is being suspended by a lot of the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
 A Times Poll of 1,023 Los Angeles adults, taken last week, showed how Simpson 
is benefiting from his fame. A total of 48% of those interviewed said "yes" 
when asked if they were sympathetic toward him. 
</P>
<P>
 These numbers are shaping the case, both in the attorneys' words to the press 
and in their courtroom behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a complicated process. During the televised preliminary hearing, which 
begins today, instead of my regular column, I'll write daily pieces focusing on 
the extraordinary efforts by all parties to mold the opinions of a public 
gripped by every twist of the case. Together, we'll try to figure out the daily 
spin.

EVANGELIST ORDERED TO REPAY HEIRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge ruled Wednesday that an evangelical 
preacher had conned an heiress out of nearly $500,000 and ordered him to repay 
the money plus $250,000 in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Tari, 48, of Dana Point, an evangelist and author, must repay Christine 
Kline, 41, of Denver for the small fortune that she signed over to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Kline, who had inherited Capital Printing Co. stock from her grandmother, led 
a different life before she became a Christian, once touring for several years 
with the Rolling Stones, according to her lawyer, Paul Roper of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 She then became a trusted friend of Tari, who also is an executive vice 
president of All Seasons Resorts, a Costa-Mesa based company that owns resort 
campgrounds in several states. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Byron K. McMillan found that Tari conned Kline out of $475,000 by 
offering to put her inheritance in a trust that he promised to manage. Instead, 
Tari invested the money in All Seasons Resorts, the judge found.

FUNDING FOR SPACE STATION SURVIVES HOUSE VOTE; SCIENCE: A BIPARTISAN ATTEMPT TO 
END THE PROJECT FAILS, 278-155. THE MEASURE, WHICH INCLUDES $2.1 BILLION TO 
BUILD AN ORBITING LABORATORY, NOW GOES TO THE SENATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The embattled space station project survived another brush with death when the 
House voted late Wednesday to retain $2.1 billion in funds to continue research 
and construction of the orbiting laboratory next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the station argued for the termination of one of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration's premier projects, calling it "half-baked 
science" and an "orbiting boondoggle" that already has cost taxpayers $11.4 
billion with nothing under construction to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
 But space station advocates prevailed, defeating by a vote of 278 to 155 a 
bipartisan amendment that would have ended the project once and for all and 
taken with it thousands of California jobs. Among the hardest hit would have 
been McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. in Huntington Beach, whose 
3,000-member space-station team was cut in half after budget reductions last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 A version of the $90.5-billion Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban 
Development appropriations bill, which includes the space station funds, must 
still pass the Senate. But the space station's toughest test came in the House 
on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The space station represents the expansion of the human spirit and the 
continuation of the human drive to explore Earth and the universe around it," 
Rep. George E. Brown (D-Colton) told the chamber as the emotional 2 1/2-hour 
debate ran late into the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA has been forced to go begging year after year to a Congress increasingly 
resistant to funding the space laboratory. Last year the project survived in 
the House by a single vote. Even Brown, the godfather of the project, 
threatened to withdraw his support last month if it appeared that continued 
budget cuts would make further research fruitless or if the space station 
appeared to be siphoning off funds from other NASA projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But after heavy lobbying by the Clinton Administration, sufficient funds were 
recommended by appropriators and Brown gave the station his endorsement. The 
White House has called the space station as much a diplomatic tool as anything 
since the Russians were brought into the program under a unique agreement last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore has traveled to Capitol Hill three times in the past 
two months to seek support for the space station, and both he and President 
Clinton worked the phones Tuesday and Wednesday to convince wavering lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 But foes argued that the orbiting laboratory was taking up too many scarce tax 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Nydia Vasquez (D-New York) called the space station a "luxury hotel in 
the sky" built at the expense of the nation's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the lawmakers could not bring themselves to eliminate the most 
ambitious project since the development of the space shuttle, particularly on 
the eve of the 25th anniversary of man's landing on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't take the sparkle out of our children's eyes," Rep. Gene Green (D-Texas) 
implored, as several other lawmakers invoked the spirits of Christopher 
Columbus and Lewis and Clark in arguing that the space station was truly 
pioneering research. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of the space station project would have sent California's already 
crippled aerospace and defense industries reeling further. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the space station's prime contractors -- McDonnell Douglas and the 
Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International in Canoga Park -- together hold 
contracts worth more than $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 First announced with great fanfare by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, the 
space station has been the victim of continued redesigns and budget cuts almost 
ever since. Because of the delays, it has yet to begin construction.

 A man charged with raping his wife's 7-year-old daughter at his wedding 
reception and passing on the virus that causes AIDS has been sentenced to 38 
years in prison. Frank C. Bridges, 43, pleaded guilty to felony rape, sexual 
penetration with a foreign object and three counts of forced lewd acts with a 
child.The charges included special allegations of inflicting great bodily 
injury and committing a sex offense while knowingly infected with AIDS. 
Bridges, a former county juvenile probation officer, was immediately sentenced 
by Riverside Superior Court Judge W. Charles Morgan. Bridges was accused of 
raping the child Jan. 15 in the Canyon Crest home where he had exchanged 
wedding vows with the victim's mother earlier in the day. The 37-year-old 
mother faces trial next month on charges of felony child endangerment and being 
an accessory after the fact. A month later, the child tested positive for the 
human immunodeficiency virus. The girl is living with relatives in the Midwest 
and has not been told she is HIV positive.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former white supremacist was sentenced to 6 1/2 years in prison for his role 
in the bombing of an NAACP meeting hall in Washington state and for other 
explosives and weapons charges. Jeremiah Gordon Knesal, 20, had pleaded guilty 
to a conspiracy charge in the July 20, 1993, bombing, which the FBI alleged was 
part of a plot to ignite a race war.He also had pleaded guilty to the other 
charges, which stemmed from his arrest in California six days after the 
bombing. The blast at the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People's hall in Tacoma, Wash., cracked two plate-glass doors but caused no 
injuries. FBI agents testified that the bombing was the start of a planned 
terror campaign intended to set off a race war. The plan included bombing 
synagogues, civil rights organizations and military installations as well as 
attacking rap singers Ice-T and Ice Cube, according to court documents. In 
February, Knesal pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the civil 
rights of African-Americans and Jews by engaging in acts of violence. He had 
pleaded guilty to the explosives and weapons charges two months earlier.

3 FUNNEL CLOUDS CAUSE DAMAGE IN DESERT HOT SPRINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three funnel clouds tore through this tiny town Wednesday, ripping off roofs, 
knocking down power lines and toppling trees, authorities said. No injuries 
were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Lozano said she watched one cloud advance down Palm Drive, the city's 
main street, and then head off over a mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you could see is dirt," she said. "It was very dark, just dust and trash 
and tumbleweeds. Rocks were hitting our windows. It swept right down our main 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 The funnel cloud tore the tar paper roof off the building next door to the 
realty office where she works, Lozano said. 
</P>
<P>
 The whirling clouds of trash, dirt and debris were reported just after 2:30 
p.m. They followed a thunderstorm that briefly interrupted days of scorching 
heat that further south was blamed for two deaths Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service predicted excessive heat in the deserts through 
Friday, reaching 125 degrees in places.

CRASH ENDS CHASE, KILLS 2 CARJACKERS; SIMI VALLEY: MAN DRINKING COFFEE IN A 
PARKED RENTAL CAR RUNS TO CALL 911 AS VEHICLE IS TAKEN AT KNIFEPOINT IN 
CAMARILLO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two young carjackers died in a high-speed crash Wednesday when the car they 
had stolen at knifepoint in Camarillo skidded out of control in Simi Valley 
during a police chase and smashed into another car. 
</P>
<P>
 The other driver, William Velasquez, 35, of Port Hueneme, was rushed to Los 
Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, treated for a cut knee and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the carjackers was pronounced dead at the accident scene outside the 
Wood Ranch subdivision, and the other died at Simi Valley Hospital shortly 
after he was airlifted there by a sheriff's helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 The county coroner's office withheld the men's names pending notification of 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday, Ventura County sheriff's deputies and Simi Valley police were 
still piecing together the carjacking and chase, which crested the Conejo Grade 
at more than 80 m.p.h. and ended in a deadly wreck that backed up traffic for 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime began about 3:25 p.m. in the parking lot of the McDonald's 
restaurant at Daily Drive and Las Posas Road, Sheriff's Sgt. Keith Lazz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two young men walked up to a rental car where Paul Castriades, 53, of 
Camarillo sat drinking coffee, according to deputies' reports. One pulled a 
knife, held it to Castriades' throat and ordered him out of the car, Lazz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two then hopped into the car -- a maroon Nissan Altima -- and drove south 
on the Ventura Freeway, he said. Castriades ran into the restaurant and called 
the 911 emergency number to report the robbery, Sheriff's Sgt. David Paige 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies, who had taken up positions along the freeway, spotted the men 
traveling southbound at Ventu Park Road at about 3:30 p.m., Paige said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four cruisers gave chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing they had been spotted, the carjackers pushed the Altima faster, at 
times reaching nearly 100 m.p.h. as they turned north onto the Moorpark Freeway 
toward Moorpark, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several more sheriff's cruisers joined the chase, and the men exited onto 
Olsen Road and turned east toward Simi Valley, speeding past the east valley 
sheriff's station and weaving between cars, Paige said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were cutting in and out of traffic, just crazy, to the point where our 
units dropped back to where they briefly lost sight of the vehicle," Paige 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 By the time the deputies caught up, the Altima had already careened out of 
control and crashed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police determined that the car had skidded across the Olsen Road median in 
front of the Wood Ranch area at high speed and hit a foot-thick oak tree 
broadside, snapping it off at ground level. 
</P>
<P>
 The car then barreled across the westbound lanes and into the path of a car 
driven by Velasquez, smashing its front end, and came to rest on the far curb, 
Paige said. 
</P>
<P>
 The carjacker who had been driving lay outside the vehicle, his head bleeding, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies hustled him aboard the sheriff's helicopter for the ride to Simi 
Valley Hospital. He was pronounced dead by an emergency room physician shortly 
after he arrived, said JoLynn de la Torre, a hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to treat the other carjacker who was trapped in the crumpled wreck, 
deputies gingerly pulled him out a window and tried to revive him, Paige said. 
The man was pronounced dead shortly thereafter, Paige said. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Hall, 35, a Wood Ranch resident, said the Altima had zoomed past him 
just before the crash, narrowly missing a car in the next lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking to myself, 'There's going to be an accident,' and as soon as I 
topped the hill, I saw all the traffic stopped," Hall said, as he watched Simi 
Valley police examine what was left of the stolen car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see the guy laying on the curb. . . . He was in real bad shape," Hall 
said. "You could barely see him breathing." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the carjackers was wearing a seat belt, but Velasquez was wearing 
his, Paige said. Neither car was equipped with an air bag, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paige said that if the stolen car had not hit the oak tree before hitting 
Velasquez's car, the crash probably would have killed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies in Camarillo are investigating the carjacking, and Simi 
Valley police are looking into the crash.

MENTAL HEALTH BUDGET CUTBACKS COULD RISK LOSS OF FEDERAL FUNDS; FINANCES: 
COUNTY PROGRAMS COULD FACE RESTRICTIONS AS STATE AND LOCAL BUDGET WOES COMBINE 
TO CREATE A DISMAL OUTLOOK. 
</P>

 Hit by the one-two punch of state and local cuts, Ventura County's mental 
health programs could be forced to give up some federal funding because the 
county cannot find the money to match it, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, programs for desperately ill children and the homeless could be 
cut, and the Ventura County Medical Center could lose up to $3 million of its 
county funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will obviously survive," county Health Care Agency director Phillipp K. 
Wessels told the Board of Supervisors. "(But) we're going to have to make some 
serious budget cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors sat through three hours of grim testimony Wednesday in the 
fourth of six hearings where department heads explain the consequences of cuts 
that must be made to balance the county's 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Wessels predicted what would happen in the worst case, if the state proceeds 
with $10 million to $12 million worth of cuts and the county lops 18% out of 
its health-care budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at a situation in mental health where they could be wiped out, 
their services reduced by a half," Wessels said. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that ongoing lobbying efforts could soften the blow of state 
reductions and that the supervisors could back away from their most severe 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wessels pointed out that many of the state's cost-cutting initiatives are 
aimed directly at the low-income health care programs the county provides. 
</P>
<P>
 One proposal, for instance, would take as much as $1.8 million from the county 
hospital's $100-million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Another would take away federal funds meant to reimburse counties for 
processing Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
 And the county's 18% health-care reduction -- the same proposed for most other 
departments -- would cut another $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's something we have to address," Supervisor Susan Lacey said. 
"We're clearly seeing what impact an 18% cut would have, and these are vitally 
important services." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit could be Mental Health Services, which, according to Director 
Randall Feltman, might lose so much funding that it could no longer match part 
of the $10.6 million expected in federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The portion not matched would be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you take out a little bit of yeast, you know what happens," Feltman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county hospital could lose about $1.2 million with county cuts on top of 
the potential $1.8-million loss from the state. Hospital Administrator Pierre 
Durand said he did not anticipate layoffs, but said that the hospital and its 
clinics would have to draw in more patients to make up for losses. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the cutbacks should not have any impact on a planned outpatient wing, 
which would be financed with long-term bonds and largely paid back with state 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The county submitted its plans for the $38-million addition to the state 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Public Health Services, state and federal funds pay completely for services 
such as immunizations for children and care for pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few programs are vulnerable to cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the $76,000 homeless treatment program, a $82,000 fund for family 
preventive care and a $4-million program to help physically disabled and 
catastrophically ill children. 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious choice for cuts, Public Health Officer Gary Feldman said, is the 
children's program, because it is so large. 
</P>
<P>
 But for every dollar the county cuts from its share of the children's care 
program, it loses $3 in state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we find a child who needs care, we may have difficulty paying for it," 
Feldman said.

BOXER, CLUB SURVIVE NEAR KO BY GUNMAN; OXNARD: NEAR FATAL SHOOTING OF RUBEN 
JUAREZ ALSO SENT A BOXING PROGRAM REELING. BUT NEARLY A YEAR LATER BOTH ARE 
RECOVERING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When an assailant shot Ruben Juarez in the stomach last July, the gunman also 
delivered a near fatal blow to the boxing program at Ventura's Westpark 
Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez -- a 22-year-old reformed gang member -- coaches the program and serves 
as a role model for its 50 or so young participants. 
</P>
<P>
 He was shot outside a convenience store in Ventura after an argument with 
Oxnard gang members, police said. During his recuperation, many of the young 
fighters lost interest in boxing. Their attendance at the club fell off and 
many had doubts whether their coach would live, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the shooting, however, Juarez and the boxing club have made nearly full 
recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 And after a long investigation, authorities were able to get an indictment 
last month against the alleged gang member accused of shooting Juarez. Pedro 
Valadez, 25, of Oxnard has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon. His 
arraignment Wednesday was continued until July 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting shed light on the efforts of Juarez and others at the Westpark 
Recreation Center to keep young people off the streets and out of trouble 
through boxing programs boxing and other events. 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez was hired to coach boxing at the club after he nearly made the U. S. 
Olympics team in 1992. Before, he had spent a lot of time on the streets 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 It started when he was 13, after the boxing club at the center had closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the boxing club shut down, I hit the streets, got a girlfriend, wrote 
(graffiti) on walls, got tattoos and started hanging on the Avenue," the 
soft-spoken Juarez recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 His quest to hang out with older boys often landed him in and out of juvenile 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
 They got into trouble, especially after hanging out at teen-age night clubs on 
Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the way home, we'd come down the streets and knock over trash cans, turn 
over bus benches. It was just something to do," Juarez said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10th grade, he dropped out of Ventura High School and soon fathered a 
son. When he was 18, he was arrested for stealing a car, something he had done 
numerous times before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got caught by a cop who I almost hit in the alley in the projects," Juarez 
said. "The guys who were with me, they split, just left." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez said he decided to change his life while in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just sitting in my cell, thinking that I still wanted to go to the 
Olympics. But I knew I couldn't get a gold medal by sitting there. So I just 
gave it up." 
</P>
<P>
 He lifted weights and started running until he regained his form. "Little by 
little, I started getting back into it," he said of boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Juarez entered some amateur fights in Los Angeles and across 
Southern California in the 125-pound division. He kept winning, but never 
thought much of it. He gained confidence by training with some professional 
boxers who would come to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "By training with the pros, I felt I could win some tournaments," Juarez said. 
"I started winning tournaments in Los Angeles. It was no big deal to me. Back 
at home, I had hundreds of trophies in my garage." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the American Boxing Federation asked Juarez to compete for a spot on 
that year's Olympics team. At the Olympics Training Center in Lake Placid, 
N.Y., he won all three matches and moved closer to his dream of earning a spot 
on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 At another Olympics tournament in Los Angeles, he won two more fights. 
Finally, he was pitted against a young hotshot from Los Angeles, 17-year-old 
Oscar de la Hoya -- now the World Boxing Organization's lightweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The two fought for three rounds, toe-to-toe; De la Hoya won on points. Juarez 
was crushed. He and his manager split. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Juarez went on to sign a professional contract, but nothing much ever came of 
it. He said his manager did not get him any fights, and he just wound up 
working construction for the man. That lasted two years -- before he got a call 
to start coaching at the Westpark center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruben was like a little local celebrity because he had gone to the Pan Am 
games and almost made the Olympics," said Roberta Payan, the Westpark program 
coordinator who brought Juarez in in a volunteer capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Juarez took over, the club was foundering. Under Juarez, it is one of 
the fastest-growing boxing clubs in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he was shot in front of the Stop 'N' Go Market at 1007 E. Main St. 
during the early morning of July 24 last year. It happened after Juarez and 
some friends got into an argument with Valadez and three other alleged Oxnard 
gang members, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting caused interest in the boxing program to nose-dive. But Juarez 
returned several months later. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never once discussed it with the kids," Payan said. "He just said he was 
sick." 
</P>
<P>
 But the story hit the local media, and many of the youngsters stopped coming 
to the recreation center. Juarez speculated that their parents probably thought 
the center was not safe, even though the shooting happened off the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went dead around here," said Juarez, who lost a portion of his stomach to 
the bullet and now can digest only one small meal at a time. "Everybody stopped 
coming. They thought I was going to be gone." 
</P>
<P>
 "They missed Ruben," Payan said of the young boxers. "They figured since he 
wasn't there we weren't going to continue the program. We tried to keep it 
going. But Ruben is the biggest motivator to keep it going." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Juarez has returned, however, boxing is again the biggest program at 
the center, which also offers classes in ceramics, poetry, music, as well as 
other sports, including basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing inside the boxing club's weight room, Juarez pointed to some photos. 
They are of his childhood friends, all ex-boxers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy here, he's in prison for life," he said. "This guy here, he's 
gettin' in and out of trouble. This guy here, he hit the streets. I don't know 
why. He said boxing is boring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want these kids experiencing what I did in the streets," Juarez said 
of his proteges. Under Juarez's direction, many of the students have traveled 
throughout the state and beyond to participate in -- and often win -- boxing 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps you out of trouble," said Omar Uribe, 13, of El Rio, who also dreams 
of going to the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of fun," added 8-year-old Daniel Cervantes of Ventura. "You can 
win a belt and a lot of trophies." 
</P>
<P>
 These youths also learn how to avoid a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It teaches you self-defense outside the ring," said 10-year-old Ruben Luna, 
an 85-pounder. "But you can't use it unless you're in real danger."

AREA STORY TIMES AVOID SAD ENDING; LIBRARIES: ATTENDANCE AT SUMMER READING 
PROGRAMS HAS DROPPED, BUT ONE ACTIVITY HAS MANAGED TO STAY ALIVE -- BUT BARELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite three years of cutbacks, Ventura County libraries from Simi Valley to 
Port Hueneme are still offering story times and other summer programs to get 
children interested in reading. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's nothing like it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Christine Culver, senior children's librarian for the Ventura County 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver is the only staff person left in the 15-branch county system whose job 
is to present story time for children. This summer she will be able to visit 
each of the county's 15 libraries only once a month, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And she worries that attendance at the programs may dwindle to an all-time low 
because libraries were not able to hold puppet shows promoting their programs 
unless they managed to scrape up outside donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Culver said, all but five of the county's libraries had their own 
children's librarian to read stories aloud to their young patrons -- some as 
often as three times a week. Also, she said, 28 puppet shows were held 
countywide last June to kick off story time and the summer reading program for 
preschoolers and elementary schoolchildren. This month, one puppet show was 
performed at the Simi Valley Library, which gathered outside money to pay for 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
 And attendance at library summer programs has been dropping, said Julie 
Albright of the county library system's children's division. In fiscal year 
1993, the total attendance for the programs was 42,429; in the nearly completed 
1994 fiscal year, attendance is 9,070. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal opinion is that all the children are at risk," lamented Culver, 
dressed in a black-and-yellow pirate costume after leading the story time at 
the Ray D. Prueter branch in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 "By reading to them, they have a better chance of being lifelong readers. . . 
. But by coming just once a month you just don't build that consistency." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Culver typically reads a few stories, then leads songs and a dance or two 
before ending the 45-minute programs with some sort of craft period. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Prueter Library, she read the colorful children's book "The Rainbow 
Fish," shifting the tone and intensity of her voice to make the story of an 
ostracized fish come alive. With 19 children ranging in age from 2 to 8 seated 
around her on the floor, Culver constantly hoisted pictures to illustrate the 
tale. 
</P>
<P>
 During one emotional moment, the storyline turned sad, and expressions quickly 
turned glum. 
</P>
<P>
 "From then on, no one would have anything to do with the Rainbow Fish," Culver 
read aloud. "They turned away when he swam by." 
</P>
<P>
 The story ends happily, however, when the rainbow fish learns the importance 
of sharing his brightly colored scales. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver wrapped up the program by having the children sing songs and wave 
streamers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have music and movement, and I try to incorporate poetry," she said later, 
adding that it's important to have "up and down" time for the often restless 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Albright and Culver are not the only ones upset about the summer reading 
cutbacks. Parents and their children -- from 2 years of age to the early 
teen-age years -- seem equally dismayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is always ranting and raving about the school system going down the 
tubes and illiteracy being a problem, and it just seems to be that the first 
thing (county government) cuts is the libraries," said Mary McCool, 34, of 
Silver Strand, who brought her 4-year-old daughter to the Prueter story time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me angry," she said. "I had my own library card since I was 6 years 
old, and I have gotten so much from books in my life. To see the budget cut in 
this area surprises me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County system's summertime cutbacks have been more severe than 
those at other libraries. Although Thousand Oaks had to cut a small amount of 
programming a few years ago at its libraries and Oxnard had to slightly limit 
its reading materials, their programs remain for the most part healthy and 
intact, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley this week, librarians, parents and children expressed relief 
their branch is well supplemented by donations from an active Simi Valley 
Friends of the Library. 
</P>
<P>
 As her 21-month-year-old son's attention swung from an awe-struck gaze at an 
elaborate puppet show to fidgeting restlessly in her arms, Kimberly Barron, 29, 
of Simi Valley, said: "I feel very fortunate, very blessed that they are still 
doing (most activities) here. People in this community want it, so they're 
going to get it. They're not going to let the state get in their way." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Lee, a Moorpark 6-year-old, said she would miss the summer programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would feel lonely 'cause sometimes no one comes to my house, because they 
can't play," Grace said sheepishly.

STATE BOARD APPROVES EXTENDING BAILARD LANDFILL PERMIT TO '97 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying its closure is guaranteed within three years, a state board Wednesday 
gave unanimous approval to extending the life of Bailard Landfill until May, 
1997, despite neighbors' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-0 vote by the state Integrated Waste Management Board followed the 
landfill operator's detailed rebuttal to community objections over noise, dust, 
stench and scavenging sea gulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in opposition, Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn warned the 
board against continuing a pattern of discrimination by granting another 
landfill permit in the most racially diverse area of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an accident that all those landfills were put in Oxnard," Flynn said 
after the vote. "This kind of environmental discrimination occurs throughout 
California, and they've got to start talking about that issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Flynn said he did not view the board's vote as a defeat since the 
permit extension allows Bailard Landfill to operate only until May, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to get it shut down completely, but we got some guarantees here," 
Flynn said. "It's a partial victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to open a landfill to eventually replace Bailard -- in Weldon Canyon 
between Ventura and Ojai -- moved forward Tuesday as the county voter registrar 
confirmed that proponents had submitted enough valid signatures to place the 
matter before voters. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 12 Registrar Richard Dean will bring the issue to the County Board of 
Supervisors, whose vote is required to place the initiative on the November 
ballot. Ojai leaders have said they expect to file suit to block what they 
consider a legally flawed measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailard's permit contains two key provisions that may actually throw the 
switch on the dump before its deadline. Those provisions place limits on the 
weight and height of garbage piles that can amass in the landfill by the Santa 
Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Clint Whitney, general manager of the Ventura Regional Sanitation 
District, told board members that the landfill will very likely hit its 
elevation limit in September, 1996, triggering an automatic shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is it," Whitney said, vowing not to seek another extension. "We're 
closing at one of those three triggers." 
</P>
<P>
 In a lengthy presentation, Whitney denied what he called "the very serious 
allegations about nuisance issues" aired by dozens of residents who protested 
the extension at a hearing last week in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Displaying a video of the landfill site, Whitney argued that the problems 
actually stemmed from passing traffic, surrounding agricultural fields and 
nearby sewage treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This picture says it all," Whitney told board members, while narrating 
panoramic shots of Bailard Landfill and its surroundings. "You don't hear the 
noise, you don't see any dust, you don't see any birds lining up on rooftops." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that Whitney -- who had lobbied board members in advance of 
Wednesday's meeting -- was preaching to the converted. Top board staff members 
had already reported back to the panel that, in their opinion, the landfill was 
in compliance with government rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "The staff has determined that these issues are being addressed 
appropriately," said Douglas Okumura, deputy director of the board's permitting 
and enforcement division. He noted, for instance, that landfill operators dealt 
with the sea gull problem by building an on-site pond to help keep the birds 
from straying into nearby neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 But Flynn got the biggest chuckle of the meeting when he recounted a story to 
show that Bailard's plan is far from fail-safe. While walking precincts one day 
in the River Ridge development, Flynn said he was startled when "a pork chop 
fell down right in front of me, dropped by a sea gull." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn also spoke up on behalf of the nuns of Sister Servants of Mary, who have 
fought the extension because their convent is situated across Victoria Avenue 
from the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with seeking assurances of the landfill's 1997 shutdown, the supervisor 
asked that the portion nearest the convent become the first of four segments to 
be phased out. Officials agreed to alter Bailard's closure plan to reflect that 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nuns are not in the business of opposing landfills," Flynn said. "This 
whole issue has frightened them to death." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the Weldon Canyon proposal has stirred strong emotions, particularly 
in the Ventura and Ojai Valley communities nearest the site. With county 
supervisors lined up against the project last summer, Waste Management of North 
America withdrew its plan. This year, another firm decided to circumvent the 
board by taking the issue directly to the voters.

<P>
 In a three-week petition drive this spring, Taconic Resources Inc. of San 
Diego gathered about 32,000 signatures, 75% more than needed to put the 
initiative on November's ballot. This week, the registrar's office tested a 
small sample of the petitions and found enough legitimate signatures to 
validate the entire set of petitions.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MUSEUM LETS CHILDREN MEET THE CHUMASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Children from across Ventura County are spending part of their summer learning 
about the Chumash and their history in a program sponsored by the county's 
Museum of History and Art. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth- and fifth-grade students, who gather at the Ventura museum during 
the morning, are finding out about games Chumash children played and how to 
make arrowheads, whistles and Chumash musical instruments, said Gerry Browning, 
director of the museum's Chumash youth program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the ages when they are interested in making things," Browning said. 
"It is the best time for them to learn, and they love the Indians." 
</P>
<P>
 The program began in 1987, when the museum's docents decided to emulate a 
program sponsored by the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. "We have 
extended that program to be more in-depth," Browning said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has become so popular in the last few years, Browning said, that 
they decided to hold two sessions this year instead of one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a very long waiting list because we can only take 20 children in each 
session," Browning said.  
</P>
<P>
 During the hands-on program, two Chumash descendants and other museum docents 
show the children how to make clapper sticks out of elderberry wood, from a 
tree the Chumash called the music tree. Clapper sticks were used by the Indians 
as a percussion instrument, Browning said. 
</P>
<P>
 The children are also taught how to make string out of yucca and beads out of 
soapstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Docents strive for authenticity even in the refreshments they serve, 
concocting them with ingredients that the Chumash used in cooking. The 
delicacies include corn cake, pine nut cookies and chia muffins, Browning said. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum charges $25 a student, but that fee barely covers the expense of 
putting the program together, Browning said. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtney Arthur, 9, is attending the program this week, said she enjoys the 
program because of its learning opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it because I learn new things every day," Courtney said. "We do fun 
things." CHRISTINA LIMA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EXXON LAYOFFS TO AFFECT AT LEAST 45

<TEXT>
<P>
 At least 45 Exxon employees in Thousand Oaks will lose their jobs as part of 
the company's nationwide effort to cut costs and improve efficiency, company 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Unocal Corp., which was founded in Santa Paula in 1890, is offering 
its California oil and gas operations for sale, company officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcements are part of separate efforts by both companies to 
restructure, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Exxon, which is headquartered in Houston, Tex., spokesman Les Rogers said 
the company also is offering a voluntary separation package to all its 125 
employees in Thousand Oaks. Rogers said Exxon will make all layoff decisions by 
Sept. 1, after seeing how many employees take the voluntary offer. The company 
also is making an effort to transfer employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Project planning and engineering operations will move to Houston, while 
production operations and technical personnel will remain in Thousand Oaks, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Exxon announced it was selling its West Hillcrest Drive offices for 
$21 million and moving from the area. But a buyer has not been found for the 
building. Rogers said he did not know if the 80 remaining employees would 
continue to work in that complex. MARY F. POLS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FIRED PRINCIPAL WANTS JOB BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A week after being fired by his rival in a close race for county schools 
superintendent, Principal Dan Flynn Wednesday urged school board members to 
reinstate his job and investigate his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued by his lawyer, Flynn called the firing "politically 
vindictive" and asked the county board of education to take up the issue in an 
emergency session. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the county, however, said late Wednesday that the school board 
has no authority over such matters. According to the state education code, only 
the superintendent has jurisdiction over employee issues, said Melodie Kleiman, 
chief assistant county counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 County schools Supt. Charles Weis announced last Wednesday that he had decided 
not to renew Flynn's $62,000 annual contract as director of the county's three 
Juvenile Court schools. Weis narrowly defeated Flynn in the June 7 election. 
The contract ends today. 
</P>
<P>
 Weis said the decision to drop Flynn's contract was prompted by poor job 
performance. But Flynn, 42, said he received satisfactory or superior ratings 
on every job performance except for a review conducted June 21 -- two weeks 
after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 In that appraisal, Flynn received low marks in every category. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn's attorney, Glenn J. Campbell, said his client is appealing to the 
county board of education before taking other action, including possibly filing 
a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said the board has the authority to overrule Weis' decision because 
Weis is still serving as an appointed, interim superintendent. In January, his 
term as elected superintendent begins. But Kleiman said Weis' status as interim 
superintendent would not make a difference. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO RAISE MOTEL BED TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ojai City Council has voted to increase its resort and motel bed tax from 
8% to 10% in a controversial move aimed at paying for a steep hike in the cost 
of law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the higher tax Tuesday evening as it approved a 
$6.39-million budget for the fiscal year beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai motel and resort owners were granted one concession by the council, a 
30-day delay before collections of the new tax begin in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Upset business owners during Tuesday's public hearing argued for at least a 
90-day reprieve. Owners said they expect to have to absorb increased costs to 
customers who have made advanced reservations at their lodges. They pleaded for 
time to print up new materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed," said Ben Larner, owner of Best Western Casa Ojai. "Thirty 
days will help, 90 days would be better." 
</P>
<P>
 The bed tax increase was expected to bring $170,000 to the city, more than 
covering a projected $130,000 jump in law enforcement costs. It has not been 
calculated how much revenue will be lost because of the 30-day delay. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten Ojai hotels will be affected by the tax increase, officials said, adding 
between $1.10 and $5 per day to bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The council at first split on delaying implementation of the bed tax. Two 
members backed a 90-day reprieve, but two others said the city could not afford 
the loss of any city revenue, especially since Ojai is planning costly 
litigation to challenge the Weldon Canyon Landfill initiative. JASON GRANT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; RESERVE FUNDS OKD TO COVER PLAZA WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With just four months to go before the Civic Arts Plaza's grand opening, the 
Thousand Oaks City Council has agreed to borrow $13 million from city reserve 
funds to cover construction costs at the $64-million facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In drawing up an original financing plan, city leaders had counted on selling 
the former City Hall on Hillcrest Drive to raise money for the new cultural and 
government center. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the sour economy dragging down real estate prices, council members 
have decided to hold on to that property until the recession ends. In the 
meantime, they must borrow from seven different city accounts to pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Director Robert Biery assured the council at Tuesday's meeting that he 
would dip only into funds held for future projects, and would not take money 
from day-to-day operating budgets. As soon as the city sells the Hillcrest 
Drive parcel, or any other surplus property, the funds will be replenished, 
with interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a loan," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "These are not gifts of public 
funds." 
</P>
<P>
 That argument did not reassure Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski, who cast the only 
dissenting ballot in the 3-1 vote. Councilwoman Elois Zeanah was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski said she could not approve the internal loans before seeing a 
detailed list of the city's property holdings and each parcel's estimated 
worth. She has also expressed concern that such borrowing could leave reserve 
funds short. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending his proposal, Biery said the city would save $400,000 a year by 
borrowing internally, instead of taking out a bank loan. The city can charge 
itself lower interest rates and set more flexible payment schedules, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the council's authorization, Biery will borrow $4 million from the asset 
replacement fund, $2.5 million from capital funds, $2 million from the 
insurance reserve fund, $2 million from waste-water funds, $1 million from 
water funds, $1 million from the golf course fund, and $500,000 from the low- 
and moderate-income housing fund. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; NEW BUDGET MAKES ROOM FOR ROAD WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After dipping into its reserves to pay for repaving of city streets, the Simi 
Valley City Council has unanimously adopted a budget for the fiscal year that 
begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying street improvements are a top priority, the City Council agreed to take 
$237,900 out of the city's reserve fund to help cover the cost of a 
$1.78-million citywide road resurfacing project it had postponed earlier in the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The road work, which includes stripping and repaving thoroughfares across the 
city that were damaged by rain or during the recent earthquake, is scheduled to 
begin in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The $28.5-million spending plan approved by the council represents an 8.7% 
increase from fiscal year 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 City Budget Director Ken Schechter said the increase was caused mainly by the 
cost of the road project and a drop in a surplus retirement revenue fund the 
city had relied on in past years to offset rising expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overall budget increase is a little bit bigger than what you would 
normally see from one year to the next," Schechter said. "But the city is in 
good shape financially." SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COUNCIL REVOKES CITY DISABLED-ACCESS 
CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cutting red tape for developers and architects, Thousand Oaks council members 
have revoked seven disabled-access policies that either conflicted with or 
replicated federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 The policies, enacted in 1989, were designed to make the city as accessible as 
possible to disabled residents or visitors.They detailed, for example, where 
builders should place parking spaces for the physically handicapped, when 
developers should build wheelchair ramps and how engineers should design curb 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the state of California adopted new Disabled Access Regulations this 
spring, city officials deemed their own codes unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had created a unique little circumstance in our city (by imposing a 
separate set of rules on developers)," said Barry Branagan, director of 
building and safety. "We were really being silly by creating another layer -- 
even if it was just a perceived layer -- of bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the city's now-rescinded rules were stricter than the state law. For 
example, Thousand Oaks had required that the grout between bricks be absolutely 
flush with the top of the brick, whereas California law allows a quarter-inch 
of slippage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mike Taylor, who sits on the city's disabled access advisory panel, said 
he thought the state laws will adequately protect all residents, including 
wheelchair users like himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just going to make things easier for people to interpret," he said. 
"Instead of having a double (city and state) law, one law will be the only 
law." 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 0 to rescind the policies. Councilwoman Elois Zeanah 
was absent. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COUNCIL WON'T FIGHT SCHOOL BUILDING 
PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recognizing the school district's power to control classroom construction, 
Thousand Oaks council members have decided not to challenge the building of a 
$1.7-million multipurpose room at Cypress Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Two irate residents had complained to the council that the multipurpose room, 
which will be two stories tall, will completely obscure the view from their 
back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But under state law, school districts have the authority to override city 
officials when constructing classrooms or related facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will ask them to consider if there's any feasible way to alter the design 
or move the building," City Atty. Mark Sellers said, after meeting with the 
council in closed session Tuesday night. "But any litigation filed (by the 
city) would be futile." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the city's request, the Conejo Valley Unified School District 
will hold an emergency board meeting next week, Assistant Supt. Sarah Hart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board will invite testimony from neighbors and will consider 
changing the landscaping outside the multipurpose room to satisfy the 
neighbors, Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board could even decide to scrap the project altogether, or move the 
two-story room elsewhere on the campus. But Hart predicted that the district 
staff would discourage such an action. Redesigning the project could cost up to 
$500,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Staff's recommendation will be that we continue with the project, meet with 
the neighbors and do anything we can to mitigate their concern, short of 
stopping construction," Hart said. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS STOLEN FROM SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The theft of nearly $14,000 worth of musical equipment from a Simi Valley High 
School storage room, which apparently occurred shortly after the Northridge 
earthquake, went undetected until a recent year-end inventory, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three French horns, two oboes, an amplifier and various drum accessories were 
taken from the school's unlocked music room sometime between Jan. 17 and 24, 
said Lt. Mark Layhew of the Simi Valley Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the burglary was not reported to the police until June 15 because the 
school's records and inventory were in shambles, Layhew said.  
</P>
<P>
 The damaged high school was closed for nearly two months after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The instruments were not in high demand because of low enrollment in the music 
program, school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not have great security at the school," said instrumental-music 
director Larry Elginer. 
</P>
<P>
 The alarm system was not working after the quake and some campus buildings 
were left unlocked during repairs, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stolen instruments were the latest blow for the high school, which is 
still trying to recover from the earthquake, Assistant Supt. Susan C. Parks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very disheartening. Part of you hopes that when everything is put back 
in place they'll show up," she said, adding that she was unsure whether the 
district's insurance would cover the stolen instruments. TRACY WILSON

 Thousand Oaks will soon boast the state's first telecommunications test 
center, a research facility that will show residents high-tech ways to consult 
doctors, question teachers or train employees simply by tapping a few computer 
keystrokes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pilot project administered by Caltrans, the federal government will put 
up $1.2 million for an Advanced Telecommunication Center designed to evaluate 
the practical applications of emerging technology. 
</P>
<P>
 By stacking the center with dozens of cutting-edge programs, Caltrans 
officials hope to teach residents how to transact daily business through 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Caltrans wants to persuade residents to go on-line rather than on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to study how to use telecommunications as a means of avoiding a 
trip," program Coordinator Margaret Moilov said. "How to bring services to you 
instead of having you drive to the services." 
</P>
<P>
 The technology on display, for example, could show teen-agers how to view the 
hottest fashions by tapping into a computer video hooked up at a mall. Families 
might be able to organize virtual-reality reunions with faraway relatives. And 
accountants might be able to check their clients' books through the magic of 
videoconferencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks leaders admit they don't quite understand the newfangled 
technology. But they know the Advanced Telecommunications Center will become a 
speedy on-ramp to the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city will contribute $14,000 to the telecommunications center, plus space 
at the Civic Arts Plaza now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very lucky to have this opportunity," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. 
"And the potential for improving our air quality (by reducing driving) could be 
a big secondary benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, private funds have wired part of the city for the 21st Century: GTE 
California has installed fiber-optic cables in a new development on the west 
end of town. 
</P>
<P>
 If GTE receives federal and state approval, the company could begin 
transmitting entertainment and information services over the fiber optics, 
which are capable of transmitting a huge volume of clear and crisp television 
and voice signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents hooked up to the system will someday be able to call up movies, 
monitor the stock market or pay their bills simply by pushing buttons on their 
TV remote controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those outside the GTE test neighborhood will be able to use computer 
modems to transact daily business, once Thousand Oaks' electronic bulletin 
board switches on-line this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulletin board will allow residents to read City Council agendas, register 
for marriage licenses, make building inspection appointments and even buy 
tickets for shows at the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think these things will change the character of this city, but (the 
technology) will cause us to think of new ways of doing things," said Shirley 
Cobb, the city's media services manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very exciting," Cobb added. "The cities that look at this developing 
technology now will be in a wonderful position to benefit" as the information 
superhighway expands. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Slated to open early next year, the Advanced Telecommunications Center will 
feature several components. Most will be set up in the Civic Arts Plaza, but 
officials also envision mobile units that will travel to classrooms, businesses 
and homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A teleconference room allowing business people to hold cross-country or even 
overseas meetings through video screens, providing that the partners have 
compatible software. 
</P>
<P>
 * A mobility-management program offering up-to-the-minute information, in both 
English and Spanish, on traffic, road conditions and public-transit options. 
</P>
<P>
 * A job training center allowing employers to instruct workers at various 
sites through a single video program. 
</P>
<P>
 * An exploratorium, featuring hands-on exhibits of the nation's most advanced 
telecommunication projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials will monitor each program, hoping to pinpoint the most 
popular technologies. By the end of the two-year pilot project, they should be 
able to advise cities throughout California about which communication systems 
nudge the most commuters out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 As they gear up for the Thousand Oaks center, officials said they have not yet 
determined whether to charge residents to use the technology. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But they emphasize that they hope to make the programs available to everyone. 
Indeed, plans call for setting up community test sites to evaluate how 
youngsters, disabled residents, health care providers and other individuals 
respond to the new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a few months of market research, Caltrans officials expressed 
confidence that Thousand Oaks residents will clamor to join the test groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have an exceptional community," Moilov told city leaders at Tuesday's 
City Council meeting. "Your residents are very receptive to new concepts and 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, Moilov said, Thousand Oaks residents have an incentive to consider using 
telecommunications instead of their cars: "You have a suburban community that's 
heavily impacted by congestion, traffic and air-quality issues."

U.S. GRANT TO AID SCHOOLS' BILINGUAL PROGRAMS; EDUCATION: SIMI VALLEY CENTERS 
WILL SHARE $160,000 PER YEAR TO TEACH THE MANY STUDENTS TO WHOM ENGLISH IS A 
SECOND LANGUAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two Simi Valley schools won a coveted federal grant for their bilingual 
programs that are trying to reach non-English proficient students who speak 18 
different native languages, educators said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal High School and Sinaloa Junior High School will share $160,000 each year 
for the next three years starting this fall, Simi Valley Unified School 
District officials said Wednesday. The grant money will be used for teacher 
training, new instructional materials, and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's award was one of only 32 grants given nationwide to school 
districts with special instructional programs.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very hopeful that this grant will have positive impact in our schools and 
in our community," district Trustee Debbie Sandland said Wednesday. "We have to 
realize we live in a society that is becoming more culturally diverse and we 
have to address the needs of each student." 
</P>
<P>
 With as many as 57 different languages spoken in the district, Simi Unified 
has struggled to provide services for its non-English speaking students, whose 
native tongues include Vietnamese, Korean, Spanish and Mandarin Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have three students who speak Mandarin, you're not going to go out and 
hire a teacher," said Rebecca Wetzel, coordinator of special programs for the 
Simi Valley district. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal grant, which could arrive as early as Friday, will provide 
training for general education teachers -- not just bilingual educators -- in 
how to teach students who speak various languages. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also plans to hire a community liaison to work with parents of 
bilingual students. The liaison will hold regular meetings with parents to 
discuss their child's academic progress, and help the families adapt to 
American-style education. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal and Sinaloa were targeted for the grant money because they had the 
highest concentration of students speaking a wide array languages at the 
secondary level. 
</P>
<P>
 "At those two particular sites, we have about 225 kids that are 
limited-English-proficient students," Wetzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 A study conducted by the district before applying for the grant showed some of 
those students were failing classes because of the language barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 On state standardized tests for reading, for example, seventh-grade students 
who speak English scored in the 61st percentile. But students who speak little 
or no English scored in the 19th percentile, Wetzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, 55% of those students received a D or and F in one or more 
academic subjects, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kinds of statistics are glaring," Wetzel said. School board president 
Carla Kurachi said the district has to address the needs of the quiet minority 
of non-English speakers in Simi Valley's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The population is growing with people coming from other countries and we need 
to do something to assimilate them into our school system," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials were surprised Simi Valley schools were awarded the grant, 
because this was the first time educators had submitted a grant proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (we won) because we're a large district, because we have multiple 
languages and because we've never had a grant before," Wetzel said. "And 
sometimes, it's luck."

BABY RESCUED FROM HEAT OF PARKED CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite sweltering temperatures that could have proven fatal, a 9-month-old 
infant survived seemingly unscathed when his father left him in a locked car in 
a Lancaster parking lot with the windows rolled up. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies, notified by passersby, rescued the child by forcing open a 
door of the car parked in front of the Costco store. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby's father, William Lynch, 27, was taken into custody when he came out 
of the store and returned to the car. He was arrested on charges of child 
endangerment and taken to Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station where he was held 
on $50,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred at 11 a.m., when temperatures had already reached 100 
degrees. The midsize car where the infant was discovered was completely closed 
up and parked on asphalt in an area without trees or shade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The child was extremely hot, he was sweating profusely," said Fire Capt. 
Justin Demello. "Other than those two things he appeared to be in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 A Sheriff's Department report said the infant, who was taken to Antelope 
Valley Hospital for observation, is believed to have been locked in the car for 
at least 20 minutes before being rescued. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities did not know whether Lynch forgot his son was in the car or 
thought he could do his shopping so quickly that the child would not be 
affected by the extreme heat. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lynch returned to his car, Demello said, he simply identified himself as 
the boy's father and began crying. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Wamsley, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles SPCA/SouthernCalifornia Humane 
Society, said the temperature inside a car can soar to 160 degrees in just 10 
minutes, even when a window is cracked open. 
</P>
<P>
 Such temperatures could cause "permanent brain damage or even death," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car did not even have a covering over the front window, Demello said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a car is closed up there's no way for the heat to dissipate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the infant had been left in the car much longer, Demello said, the outcome 
could have been tragic. "It's just lucky someone saw the child in the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Other shoppers saw the child, who was crying in a car seat positioned behind 
the driver's seat, and called for help, according to the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 After a sheriff's deputy was able to open the car, Demello said, the fire crew 
immediately worked to lower the child's body temperature by putting cool water 
on him and then placing him in the back of an air-conditioned ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a fair-skinned child and he was beet red," Demello said. "One of the 
good things was that he was still sweating. When you get to the critical stage 
you're not sweating." 
</P>
<P>
 The infant was released to his mother, who came from the family's Acton home 
to retrieve him.

BULLFROGS HOLD OFF PORTLAND; ROLLER HOCKEY: LATE GOALS HELP ANAHEIM PUT AWAY 
THE RAGE, 9-7, AND REMAIN ATOP THE PACIFIC DIVISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Fourth-quarter goals by Jim Brown, Ken Murchison and Savo Mitrovic helped the 
Bullfrogs hang on for a 9-7 victory over the Portland Rage before a crowd of 
9,318 Wednesday night at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalie Chris Gordon made some key saves in the final three minutes and Brad 
McCaughey had four assists for the Bullfrogs (7-1), who lead the Pacific 
Division of Roller Hockey International. 
</P>
<P>
 Murchison scored off an assist from McCaughey with 5:27 remaining for an 8-7 
Bullfrogs lead and Mitrovic added a goal with one minute remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland, tied for last in the Northwest Division, didn't figure to give the 
Bullfrogs many problems, but the defending RHI champions only breathed a sigh 
of relief after Mitrovic's goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullfrogs captain Kevin Kerr found his scoring touch early, notching a hat 
trick in the first 21 minutes to help the Bullfrogs to a 4-2 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerr finished with three goals and one assist, but left the game with 6:01 
remaining when officials whistled him for a five-minute major penalty for 
slashing Portland's Dennis Holland. The major penalty included a 
game-misconduct penalty to Kerr, and Portland's Vadim Slivchenko, who had two 
goals and an assist, scored on the ensuing penalty shot to tie the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland (1-6) lost its sixth consecutive game despite Chris Valicevic's four 
goals and one assist. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that kept the offenses quiet was the delay of 1 hour 15 minutes 
before the game because of a wet concrete playing surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon made 32 saves to post his third victory. Bullfrogs Coach Grant Sonier 
has alternated Gordon with goalie Rob Laurie in an effort to keep both fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie, who has won 14 consecutive starts, was named to play in the inaugural 
RHI all-star game. Laurie is second in the league in save percentage (.886) and 
has a goals against average of 4.75, fourth-best in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 And Gordon made some all-star saves Wednesday, posting the victory after 
taking the loss in the Bullfrogs' 9-7 loss to San Diego on June 25.  
</P>
<P>
 Sonier didn't fault his rookie goaltender for that loss. Gordon made 48 saves 
in the first regulation defeat of the franchise's 25-game history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got way too aggressive against San Diego," Sonier said. "It was a matter 
of the rest of the team not playing well in front of Chris." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs continued their spotty play and gave up too many odd-man rushes 
on Gordon, but had enough to remain unbeaten at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Victor Gervais, who had one goal and one assist, returned to action 
after missing two games with a moderate concussion he suffered June 23 in the 
7-6 victory over San Jose.  
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing 17-0-1 last season, the one blemish an overtime-shootout loss 
against the Blades, and starting this season with five consecutive victories, 
the Bullfrogs lost in regulation for the first time last weekend. "The streak 
put a lot of pressure on the guys," Bullfrogs Coach Grant Sonier said. "I think 
there was a certain amount of relief. They all hate to lose, but it made them 
realize they're human, and if we don't play hard every night we're going to get 
beat." . . . Defenseman Yuri Krivokhija, who had a goal and 11 assists in five 
games, remained sidelined with a bruised rotator cuff he suffered in the 7-6 
victory over San Jose, June 23. "We'll re-evaluate Yuri in a week," Sonier 
said. "We won't rush him back." . . . The Bullfrogs travel Saturday to San 
Diego and return to The Pond of Anaheim on Sunday to play host to Oakland in 
the team's final game before the RHI all-star game in Vancouver, July 9. ESPN 
will broadcast the all-star game July 11.

BEGGARS CAN'T BE COMBATIVE IF LAW PASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If you beg in this city, be polite. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has tentatively approved an ordinance that prohibits rude and 
aggressive behavior by people seeking alms or donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, approved by unanimous vote Tuesday, defines "aggressive" 
panhandling as threatening bodily harm, committing a criminal act, interfering 
with traffic or continuing to pester someone who has turned down a request. It 
covers individual beggars as well as representatives of charitable 
organizations seeking donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a ban against panhandling," said City Atty. Richard Jones. "It's a 
ban against aggressive panhandling." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said the ordinance is in response to complaints from residents 
who say they have been victimized by overaggressive beggars in shopping malls, 
streets, parks, parking lots and other places. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I have no heart for people who are begging, but they have 
abused people's generosity," said Councilman Tony Lam, who has advocated 
passage of the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance specifically prohibits touching another person in the course of 
begging. It prohibits washing vehicle windshields and soliciting donations from 
the owner as payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Also considered aggressive begging are blocking a person from entering or 
emerging from a vehicle while soliciting and stopping a vehicle for the purpose 
of asking for money from the occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 Lam said some business owners have complained about disruptions of their 
operations by "annoying and intimidating" people seeking handouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Tome, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union, said enforcing 
the ordinance could pose a problem for police officers, who may be required to 
make a judgment call on what is aggressive panhandling. 
</P>
<P>
 Tome said that asking for money or donations is part of free speech protected 
by the U.S. and California constitutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The right of a person to say, 'I'm homeless, please help me,' is protected 
speech," Tome said. "It's the behavior in threatening another person with 
bodily harm or blocking passage" that can be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the city of Anaheim passed an ordinance similarly prohibiting 
"aggressive" panhandling in response to demands from residents to restrict 
street begging. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Anaheim law, violators are fined $100 for the first offense, $200 
for a second infraction within a year and $500 for additional offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal to require beggars to obtain city business licenses was rejected 
about the same time because that would have been unconstitutional, according to 
Anaheim City Atty. Jack L. White. He said case law allows cities to regulate, 
but not ban, begging. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Lee Lescano, Salvation Army coordinator for Orange County, said the 
Westminster ordinance may have an effect on the group's solicitation 
activities, though he noted that the organization is not aggressive when its 
representatives solicit donations on the street, primarily during the Christmas 
season.

<P>
 "We think we're within the law," said Lescano. "But if it does restrict us, we 
would want to have discussions with the city. It's possible someone wants to 
restrain legitimate organizations. That intent is our concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said that panhandling would become a violation under the ordinance when 
the person asking for money, food or other donations "pursues it to the point 
that he infringes on the rights of the person being asked." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said a violation of the ordinance would be considered a misdemeanor 
punishable by a $500 fine or six months in jail or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will consider the ordinance for final approval July 12.

MANISCALCO GETS 46 YEARS TO LIFE FOR 3 MURDERS; COURTS: THE 14-YEAR-LONG CASE 
CLOSES WITH THE BIKER-ATTORNEY'S SENTENCE, BUT AN APPEAL IS EXPECTED. ONE 
VICTIM'S FATHER TELLS JUDGE THE PAIN CONTINUES.

<P>
 Orange County's longest-running criminal case came to a close Wednesday as a 
biker leader turned counterculture lawyer was sentenced to 46 years to life in 
prison for the execution-style slayings of two bikers and the daughter of a Los 
Alamitos police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas F. Maniscalco, a Westminster attorney who co-founded the Hessians 
motorcycle club, had protested his innocence during the 10 years since his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary said Wednesday she 
had little doubt of his guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally would find it very difficult to sentence someone to prison if I 
thought they were innocent," the judge said as Maniscalco sat impassively. "I 
don't think Mr. Maniscalco's innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco, 49, was convicted of three counts of second-degree murder for the 
shooting deaths of fellow Hessian Richard (Rabbit) Rizzone, 36; Rizzone's 
bodyguard, Thomas Monahan, 28; and Rizzone's girlfriend, Rena Miley, 19. Miley 
also was raped during the Memorial Day 1980 massacre in Rizzone's Westminster 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Miley's father, now retired from the Los Alamitos force and living 
in Riverside County, told the judge his family has never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one only needs to use their imagination to understand the devastation 
to the entire family," Gary Miley said quietly, adding that nine months after 
the murder he suffered a major heart attack that doctors attributed to stress.  
</P>
<P>
 Miley said Memorial Day is an especially painful reminder of the slaying 
because his daughter also was born on the holiday. When she was a child, her 
parents told her that the parades, banners and flags for the occasion were 
celebrating her birth, and it became a family joke as she grew older, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 'devastation' covers it all," he said, describing the heartache that 
never ends. "It's still going on today. It's been 14 years and it still goes on 
daily." 
</P>
<P>
 The case was troublesome from the start for law enforcement authorities. 
Police suspected Maniscalco and fellow biker Daniel M. Duffy of Long Beach were 
involved but could not piece together enough evidence to arrest them until four 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco and Duffy were arrested in 1984 and charged with the murders. A 
separate jury convicted Duffy in 1992, and he was sentenced to life in prison 
without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco, the son of a retired police sergeant, was convicted on March 15, 
1994, exactly 10 years after the date of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 During a torturous odyssey through the legal system, the case was marked by a 
mistrial, hundreds of legal motions and maneuverings and numerous bizarre 
twists, including the suicide of a judge presiding over the case, one of 17 
judges who has been involved over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Maniscalco also set the record for the longest inmate stay in 
the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Maniscalco ordered the killings after a dispute over 
counterfeit money and drug profits Rizzone was accused of skimming from his 
gang. Defense attorneys, however, claimed Maniscalco was framed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Rick King said Wednesday, "I don't ever want to see this 
case again. We're pleased this nightmare in the Orange County criminal justice 
system is finally over." 
</P>
<P>
 During the course of the case, King repeatedly accused Maniscalco's attorneys 
of filing frivolous legal motions that prolonged it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer a case ages, the better it is for the defense," King said outside 
of court, adding that Curt Livesay, Maniscalco's latest attorney, did not 
engage in such maneuvers. "Witnesses die, memories fade. The evidence is best 
when it's fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys, however, said they were simply doing all they could to 
prevent an innocent man from going to prison for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Joanne Harrold, Maniscalco's former law professor who has 
helped represent him for free because she believes in his innocence, said an 
appeal is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom believes, and I concur, that O'Leary didn't give him a fair trial," she 
said. Defense evidence that could have cleared Maniscalco was barred from the 
trial, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco's other supporters in the courtroom included his mother, sister and 
Jack Burnes, president of the Hessians bikers in Riverside County. Burnes said 
authorities have maligned bikers as gang members and said such stereotypes led 
to Maniscalco's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been his friend for 30 years, I consider him a brother, and I know he is 
not guilty," Burnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco kept paying his bar dues for the 10 years he was in jail because he 
believed in his innocence, Harrold said. Since Maniscalco's conviction, the 
State Bar of California has suspended him. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco's first trial lasted 17 months and jury deliberations spanned 26 
days -- a state record -- before jurors deadlocked. During the second trial, 
jurors deliberated 24 days before convicting him of three counts of 
second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing with his wife, Gary Miley said outside of court that even though the 
case dragged on for more than a decade he is pleased the system worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just glad this nightmare is finally over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he was leaving the courthouse, he acknowledged that he is still left to 
grapple with the memories. 
</P>
<P>

1 DEAD IN GANG AMBUSH; GIRLFRIEND WOUNDED, 2 CHILDREN HURT IN CAR RIDDLED WITH 
BULLETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 In a shooting brazen even for gang warfare, a young couple were ambushed as 
they drove up to the security gate of their apartment complex with their two 
children late Tuesday night, an assault that left one man dead and his 
girlfriend wounded, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen shots from semi-automatic weapons fired by at least two 
gunmen pierced the car driven by Mario Antonio Reyes, 20. The two children, 
seated in the back seat, suffered minor injuries when they were hit by flying 
glass.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a certain callousness with this that you don't typically see in gang 
shootings," Lt. Robert Helton said. "It's not gang style to jeopardize other 
people if they have a grudge or vendetta, so this is unique from that 
standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred just before 11 p.m. at the Vintage Woods Apartments in 
the 3900 block of 5th Street, stunning neighbors in the well-maintained 
security complex just west of Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've had trouble like this," said August Fiore, who 
manages the 172-unit complex. "We had like a little paradise here, and this has 
kind of spoiled it." 
</P>
<P>
 The gunfire shattered almost every window of the gray and black 1988 Ford 
Escort, leaving bullet holes in the seats, dashboard, doors, wheels and 
rear-view mirror. Shattered glass covered a baby bottle and a pair of a 
toddler's tennis shoes in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members said 1-year-old Monique Reyes was sitting in a baby seat that 
was sprayed with bullets, and bullet fragments lodged in her scalp. Mario Reyes 
died with the gate's remote control in his hand, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They started shooting on the passenger side of the car and the woman was 
struck first," Helton said. "Then, they moved to the back of the car, firing 
through the rear window, over the top of the kids in the back seat." 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said that as the couple "stopped for the gate to open, two or three men 
approached on foot and started shooting into the car. It is our belief that the 
suspects were lying in wait, waiting for them to show up." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes, a known gang member who Helton said may have been feuding with a rival 
gang, was driving the car and was shot numerous times in the head and the back. 
He died at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 His girlfriend, 20-year-old Vanessa Mendez, was sitting in the front passenger 
seat of the car and was hit in the back by a single bullet that went through 
her body. She is in stable condition at an undisclosed local hospital, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Mendez, 4, Mendez's son from a previous relationship, and Monique Reyes 
were examined at a hospital. Carlos was released to Mendez's mother and the 
baby girl was recovering Wednesday at the Reyes family home in south Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Family and friends Wednesday remembered Reyes as a talented boxer who loved 
restoring Chevrolet Impalas and had been trying to get away from gang life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had his baby. He had his wife. He was one of the coolest homeboys we had," 
said one 17-year-old gang member. "He would even lecture us. He would say, 'I'm 
kicking back. You guys should kick back, too.' No one was expecting this, but a 
lot of people all over Santa Ana wanted him, and they finally got him." 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes' father, 52-year-old Juan Reyes, said he had moved the family away from 
Cubbon Street to a well-kept middle-class neighborhood four years ago to get 
the kids away from the pull of the streets.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The father also quit his job driving a big-rig so he could work closer to 
home, but his son, one of six children, was in too deep. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes was shot in the legs by rival gang members a few years ago, and last 
year, someone set fire to two cars in front of his parents' home. Last month, 
the house was sprayed with 35 rounds of gunfire, shattering the television and 
sending pots and pans flying, Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, his son refused to talk to him about the problems he was having and 
wouldn't cooperate with police when his parents' home was sprayed with bullets, 
but he was eager to get away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him if he wanted to move to Ventura County, where we have lots of 
family, and he said 'Yes,' " the senior Reyes said. "But now it's too late."  
</P>
<P>
 A group of cousins who came to Santa Ana from Ventura County on Wednesday said 
Reyes planned to move today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Problems for the kids in Santa Ana are like a cancer right now," said Reyes, 
who plans to move the family out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said that after last month's shooting, Reyes "told us he would take 
care of matters himself. That leads us to believe that he may have suspected a 
certain gang. There may have been some kind of confrontation between that time 
and last night." 
</P>
<P>
 Two or three males were seen running from the area immediately after the 
shooting, police said. No arrests have been made and police had no suspects in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting was the city's 20th gang-related killing of 1994, bringing the 
city's overall homicide total to 38. Last year, the city experienced a 
record-shattering 78 homicides, 47 of which were gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers at Dick Cepeck Sport Truck Connection in Santa Ana, where Reyes 
worked, said the victim abruptly took two weeks off from work about the time of 
the shooting at his parents' house and took his family to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never said why he had to go, but there was a definite urgency to it," said 
David Rittenhouse, manager of the truck repair business. "When he came back, he 
got right back to work and he worked right up until (Tuesday) with no 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Service manager Ron Stobaugh, Reyes' direct supervisor, said the victim had 
been planning to move from his apartment but had not revealed why. 
</P>
<P>
 "He alerted us to his plans so he could use us as a reference," Stobaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Court documents show that Reyes had several criminal convictions in recent 
years. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of drinking in a Santa Ana park, 
and having a loaded weapon in his vehicle. This year he was sentenced to 30 
days in jail and three years' probation for beating his girlfriend Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His friend from the gang said Reyes had been in and out of Juvenile Hall about 
10 times before he decided to clean up his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Rittenhouse and others said Reyes would work through his lunch hour twice a 
week so that he could leave work early to meet with his probation officer. They 
said he appeared to be trying to leave a troubled past behind and seemed 
devoted to his family and his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a good guy, a solid guy," Rittenhouse said. "There was an indication 
that he may have been involved in some gang situation, but he never brought it 
to work. He was honest, never complained and was a very steady employee." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors at the family's apartment complex expressed shock over the 
shootings. Many said that although the apartments are located near a part of 
town that has had its share of crime, they felt protected inside the apartment 
complex, which is well-maintained with lush landscaping, a large swimming pool 
and security gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Another longtime resident who asked not to be identified said, "The 'hood is 
right across the street so we kept our gates locked. It's really a sad 
situation when it hits so close to home." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore said Reyes and Mendez had lived in the complex for more than a year and 
always paid their rent on time. They said the couple had not caused any 
problems in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were good tenants, but we didn't really know anything about their 
personal lives, so you never know," Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore was among the residents who heard the rapid gunfire and called police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran over there and saw (Reyes) slumped over in the seat," he said. "It was 
a horrible sight. It's frightening to see it happen in your own back yard. I 
hope it never happens again." 
</P>
<P>
 Dried bloodstains remained on the ground near the electronic gate on the west 
side of the large apartment complex Wednesday, drawing the attention of curious 
neighbors and family members of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad that someone would do this to a family," said Christina Lopez, 
Mendez's stepsister. "We are still trying to find out what happened."

GIVING DEVIL HIS DUE; SCHOOL'S NEW LOGO AIN'T HOT STUFF, AND THAT'S GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The devil logo that's been in a long and hot controversy at Mission Viejo High 
School has been changed again, probably for the final time. 
</P>
<P>
 The prankish little devil image looked too much like Harvey Comics' Hot Stuff 
character and the comic book company wanted a piece of the profits from the 
sale of school athletic team merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 So a committee assigned to solve the problem tinkered and came up a little 
devil that has a slightly more mischievous grin, just enough difference to set 
it apart from Hot Stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were notified of the new logo on the final day of school last week, 
according to Robert Metz, the school's former principal who was recently named 
director of secondary education for the Saddleback Valley Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some conflict on the copyright," Metz said Wednesday. "But our 
committee worked through that and came up with this depiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus ends another episode in a long dispute over the red-faced devil. 
</P>
<P>
 The school mascot got national press last year when students claimed they were 
being disciplined for wearing patches depicting a fierce devil logo that was 
the school emblem until administrators banned it in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials acted under pressure from some local fundamentalist Christians who 
objected to the devil image, but the old logo remained popular among many 
students who continued to wear it on caps and jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials denied that students were being punished for wearing the 
devil emblem, but agreed to hold an election for the student body to choose a 
new mascot. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates included the fierce devil, a raging bull, a bulldog that had 
replaced the Satan image in 1986, and a cute, impish devil. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of students favored the cute devil, but their choice drew 
immediate protest from Harvey Comics Entertainment Inc., which owns the 
trademark on a similar character known as Hot Stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 The comic book firm wanted 20% of revenue from sales of merchandise bearing 
the logo, such as school caps and T-shirts, said Terry Shepherd, a school 
instructor who initially headed the committee assigned to find a modified logo. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Comics "dropped it down to 10%," said Shepherd, who resigned from the 
committee and was not part of the group when it finally chose the new mascot. 
"But I think the (school athletic) booster club wanted to get a new logo." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest logo elicited more yawns than interest from students interviewed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone will immediately notice any difference," said Rob 
Weathers, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Olsen, 17, who graduated from Mission Viejo High School last year and 
whose father is a member of the logo committee, said "there will always be a 
few people who aren't going to be happy with it.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; COUNCIL OPTIMISTIC AS IT PASSES BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a $9.5-million budget for fiscal year 1994-95 
that will leave about $1.2 million in the city's treasury at the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In unanimously approving the budget Monday, council members said the city is 
in sound financial health, their optimism buoyed by projected increases in 
property and sales taxes for the first time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget contains a $5.9-million spending plan for operations and $2.7 
million for capital improvements, such as bridge seismic retrofits, street 
repairs and park upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
 However, city officials made no provision for the possibility that the state 
would take some of the city's property tax income to cover what Councilman 
Ronald Bates said is a potential $10-billion state deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of right now, we're in good condition, but all bets are off in November or 
December when the state finds itself in the red," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1993-94 fiscal year, the city lost $110,000 in property taxes to 
the state, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very cautious," City Manager Robert C. Dunek said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not balance this budget with a shift in mind. We'll have to evaluate 
our budget once the state deals with its deficit." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales tax income for the coming fiscal year is projected at $2.04 million, up 
from $1.8 million in fiscal year 1993-94. Property taxes are projected at 
$934,000, up about $70,000, 
</P>
<P>
 Total revenue for fiscal year 1994-95 is projected at $6.6 million, an 
increase of 1.9% from the last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 With expenses pegged at $5.9 million, the general fund balance at the end of 
the fiscal year is projected at $1.2 million, plus transfers from other funds, 
Dunek said. 
</P>
<P>
 A hiring freeze has been lifted, and the city has begun to fill positions that 
have been vacant for a while. A police officer, a city planner and neighborhood 
preservation officer have been hired, Dunek said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that contract negotiations will begin next month with the clerical and 
maintenance workers groups. 
</P>
<P>
 If those salaries increase, Dunek said, "we could accommodate that" by using 
money from the $1.2 million in the treasury and other sources. BERT ELJERA

<P>
 Skyline Drive, Ladera Vista Drive and the north tip of Acacia Avenue will be 
closed to the public for about six months beginning July 6.

 Construction crews will be grading and realigning Skyline and Ladera Vista as 
part of the Unocal Corp.'s efforts to sell custom-home lots along those 
streets, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the City Council gave Unocal the nod to develop the 300-acre East 
Coyote Hills area. Development plans call for the realignment of the roads and 
a public 18-hole golf course just south of Bastanchury Road between Brea and 
State College boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 The golf course and the realigned roads are scheduled to open in January, a 
Unocal official said. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; HOT-WEATHER PERILS TO PETS POINTED OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Veterinarians are warning pet owners that even simple activities such as 
afternoon walks can harm an animal during the current heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs and cats not only are saddled with fur all year, but they lack the sweat 
glands that regulate the body temperatures of humans. Heat stroke is a common 
result without shade, water and the common sense of their owners, according to 
animal shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people just don't realize that when they leave for work and tie 
their dogs up in the shade that in the mid-day that shade is gone," said Lt. 
Marie Hulett-Curtner of the Orange County Animal Shelter in Orange. "Then they 
come home in the evening and the shade is back again. So they just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs and cats both require at least double the water that they drink in 
winter, Hulett-Curtner said. Since dogs have been known to knock their bowls 
over, she advised putting a second bowl, or even a bucket, in another spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The best protection for dogs is access to a cool garage. And do not tie the 
dog up unless that is absolutely necessary, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 That afternoon walk, unpleasant for humans in the heat, can be overwhelming 
for dogs, said Eileen Pinder of the Orange County Humane Society in Costa Mesa. 
"Not only that, but the heat of the pavement is so hot on their little paw pads 
that it can actually burn the skin off," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 It is best to avoid any activity with the dog during the heat of mid-day. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the worst things an owner can do is lock a pet in the car, even for a 
short time. "A car becomes like an oven when it's parked," Hulett-Curtner said. 
"Dogs can suffer brain damage within minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter workers will come to a car as soon as called and will break the 
windows if necessary to rescue a pet. Owners can then face prosecution for 
cruelty to animals, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once heat stroke occurs, the dog or cat will pant excessively, collapse and 
may vomit or have diarrhea from the shock, dehydration and brain swelling, said 
veterinarian Thomas W. Beighlie with Norwalk's Animal Emergency and Referral 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners should treat this as an emergency, he and others said. Cool the dog 
down by putting wet towels on the legs, head and tail, but do not immerse the 
entire body, Beighlie said. That can send the body temperature below normal, 
which brings on a whole new set of complications. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal should then be taken to a veterinarian. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; PLANNING BOARD CUT FROM 7 MEMBERS TO 5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week reduced the Planning Commission from seven members 
to five during a study session. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also rejected a proposal to appoint an "alternate" after receiving 
a letter from one of the commissioners that said it would be unfair for someone 
to serve in a non-voting position. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will retain seven members until mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
 One commissioner has said she will step down. The City Council will have to 
decide which of the other commissioners to remove but it has not yet agreed on 
how the decision will be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members previously had considered creating an alternate position to 
avoid having to unseat anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 But a letter from Bob Niccum, a commissioner whose seat is up for 
reappointment, pleaded with the council member not to make that move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Expecting someone to keep his or her talents available, but only in the 
status of an alternate, is unworthy," wrote Niccum, who supported the 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the diversity of the city of Los Angeles can be reflected in a five-member 
commission, why not Buena Park?" he asked in his letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members had said in an earlier meeting that the commission should 
be reduced to be more in line with most other Orange County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Development Services Director Thomas E. Lynch said that nine cities have 
seven-member panels while 18 have five-member boards. 
</P>
<P>
 In three cities, the city council acts as the planning commission. Lynch said 
the city would save about $6,000 by reducing the number of commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission Chairman Larry T. Wieck said after the meeting that he opposed the 
reduction because each member on the board brings a different educational and 
professional viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Don R. Griffin agreed with Wieck and opposed the reduction. LESLEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY BACKS BUSINESS BREAKS FOR RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members have declared their support for a proposal to join a 
state program that rewards businesses that use recycled materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The council passed a resolution this week supporting the county's application 
with the California Integrated Waste Management Board to designate the county 
as a recycling market development zone, or RMDZ. 
</P>
<P>
 A RMDZ designation would encourage more local businesses to recycle, county 
officials said. Businesses that use recycled materials could apply for 
low-interest loans or receive technical and marketing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program would encourage recycled materials to be remanufactured into new 
products within the zone, thus closing the recycling loop," said Tanya Crail of 
the county's integrated waste management department in a letter to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the request for a RMDZ designation also will demonstrate the 
county and local cities' efforts to comply with a 1989 state law that requires 
cities and counties to reduce 25% of their landfill use by 1995 and 50% by 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Violators could be fined as much as $10,000 a day, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said that supporting the county proposal would help the city 
avoid the hefty penalties, while boosting its own recycling program. BERT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CUTBACKS NEEDED TO BALANCE CITY BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga told the City Council this week that at 
least $3 million in cutbacks is needed to balance next fiscal year's operating 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Uberuaga told the council that it would take an operating budget of $101.1 
million to maintain the current level of service, but that the city is 
projecting operating on a $93.1-million budget for 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 "The budget balancing this year will be difficult," Uberuaga said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city could lose $1 million in revenue if the state transfers 
$100 million in vehicle license fees from cities to counties as a way to 
balance its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Uberuaga said the city's revenue base has slowly eroded during the recession 
of the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad news is we don't have a revenue base to accommodate the needs this 
community is requesting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council recently approved changing the date of budget adoption from July 1 
to Oct. 1 in order to take into consideration state cutbacks in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Franz, deputy city administrator, said the city has lost a total of $15.3 
million in revenue due to state cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the council isn't expected to adopt a budget until Sept. 30, officials 
are reviewing options on how to reduce spending, Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uberuaga said that in making cutbacks to balance the operating budget, 
reductions in services to the public will be minimized. However, cutbacks in 
police and fire services may be considered, Uberuaga said. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce spending, officials will also review current and anticipated job 
vacancies. Currently, there are 25 vacancies with another 20 to 30 projected 
for 1994-95.  
</P>
<P>
 The city has 1,134 full-time employees and about 300 part-time employees, and 
$73 million is expected to be spent on salaries and benefits next fiscal year, 
Uberuaga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding new city fees to raise revenue, Uberuaga said the only possibilities 
are a charge for non-residents who use the city library and imposition of 
parking fees at the library. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; MEDIATOR TO REFEREE COUNTY SALARY TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County officials are at an impasse in salary negotiations with their 
largest employee union and have called in a state mediator. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Employees Assn. and its nearly 11,000 members have been 
negotiating since April as the county tries to finalize its $3.6-billion budget 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's existing contract was set to expire on Friday, but it has been 
extended for the mediation process. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last Friday, officials have reached agreements with both the 
1,271-member American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and 
the 123-member International Union of Operating Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of those agreements call for wage increases of about 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Davis, the county's chief of employee relations, said Wednesday that the 
impasse has caused no disruptions, except for some informational picketing by 
county Social Service Agency workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the unresolved negotiations, both Davis and OCEA General Manager John 
H. Sawyer declined to discuss outstanding issues in the negotiations. KEVIN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; SCHOOL BOARD VOTES TO CUT DARE POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a plea from its president, the Anaheim City School District Board of 
Education has rejected a proposal to reinstate a DARE officer cut from its new 
$65-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 4 to 1 Tuesday night to hire three part-time math and science 
teachers at a cost of $80,000 instead of retaining the drug education officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I say -- I think it's wrong," board President Lou Lopez, a city 
police officer, said after the vote. "The DARE program is an important role 
model for students." 
</P>
<P>
 But school administrators stressed that the drug education program, which 
still has three officers, will continue. Because of the lost position, however, 
some students will not receive DARE instruction until the sixth grade. 
Currently, students participate in the anti-drug program in the fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said he was kicked out of school for misbehaving in elementary school, 
but that a police officer helped reform him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was totally out of control -- you wouldn't have wanted me in your class," 
he said. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; COUNCIL POSTPONES CHOOSING A MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two new City Council members were seated this week, but the council postponed 
selecting a new mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional meeting Tuesday night, new council members Toni Gallagher and 
Harold R. Kaufman were seated along with Karen Lloreda, who was elected to a 
second term on the five-member panel. Outgoing members Mike Eggers and Eileen 
Krause, both part of the city's charter council, stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding back tears, Lloreda thanked Eggers and Krause for their help on 
council matters over the years and said she considered herself "fortunate" for 
their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eileen was there when I needed her," Lloreda said. "Mike pushed me to be 
well-prepared. . . . It was Mike who encouraged me to stand my ground." 
</P>
<P>
 In his first remarks as a councilman, Kaufman said he had "finally made it" on 
his third election try. He then added that the new council will be one of a 
different character. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this council will be more prone to listening to the people, not just 
the vocal majority but the silent minority we all spoke to during the 
campaign," said Kaufman, who promised to "fight crime, fight the El Toro 
airport and be a fiscal conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher, the leading finisher in the extremely close June 7 election, called 
her election a vote of "the people of Dana Point." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have any special interests and I didn't have any developer money 
behind me," said Gallagher, who lives on the Headlands and is an outspoken 
opponent of a pending development plan for that land near Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came to their election of a new mayor, the four members could not 
break a 2-2 tie, a deadlock considered a sign of the divisiveness of the new 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Judy Curreri was delayed in returning from a trip to England and was 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher and Councilman William L. Ossenmacher voted to name Ossenmacher, who 
is currently mayor pro tem, for the one-year mayor term. It has been customary 
in Dana Point that the mayor pro tem move on to become mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lloreda and Kaufman said they would rather wait for a full council to vote 
for mayor and blocked the Ossenmacher nomination. LEN HALL

<P>
 The Board of Education said farewell to acting Supt. Gretchen Hanson last week 
and welcomed Robert L. French, who will assume the same role. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have enriched the lives of 26,000 students with grace and courage at 
times and professionalism as well," Board President Maureen Aschoff told 
Hanson, who leaves today to marry and join her husband in Redding. 
</P>
<P>
 French, an assistant dean at the University of Southern California's School of 
Education, will move into Hanson's office July 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which has been without a permanent superintendent since 1991, 
lost its interim superintendent in April when Marilyn J. Corey resigned. Hanson 
became the ninth person to head the district since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy has plagued the district for years. In May, a two-week strike by 
non-teaching staff played havoc with the district's bus and child-care systems. 
A $2-million budget deficit may result in the elimination of bus service for 
high school students and another attempt to cut benefits for non-teaching 
employees and reduce the number of staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the board was faced with a sexual harassment suit against three top 
administrators filed last December. The administrators filed a countersuit 
against the district and Corey resigned in April after fighting with board 
members over payments for attorneys involved in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 But French, in his first public appearance at Thursday's meeting, told board 
members he was honored to be chosen for the post. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been aware of the reputation this school district has had as one of the 
finest in Orange County," he said. Later, when asked about some of the 
controversy surrounding the district and the board, he smiled and said, "We all 
have challenges." 
</P>
<P>
 French began his career in 1956 as a chemistry teacher in the Whittier Union 
High School District. He went on to serve in numerous administrative posts, 
including counselor and principal. 
</P>
<P>
 French has served as superintendent of districts in Beverly Hills and 
Piedmont, an Oakland suburb, according to a biography he distributed at the 
meeting. He holds three degrees from USC: a doctorate in education, and 
master's and bachelor's degrees in science. A Los Angeles native, French grew 
up in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 Aschoff said that the board selected French on the strength of recommendations 
from two education consultants and the "personal chemistry" board members felt 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a lot of compassion and experience," she said. "He seemed like a 
college professor guiding us through some difficult times." LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; THIS MOM IS FIRST IN HER CLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Naranjos Elementary School has been a part of Sue Williams' life since the 
campus opened nearly 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Over that time, at least one of her four children has always attended the 
school. Williams, too, has become a familiar face, volunteering her time to a 
variety of tasks from raising money for special programs to typing and 
collating files. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Education Foundation this month named Williams as the group's 
parent volunteer of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a mother with a lot of time or money on her hands," said 
Elizabeth Thomas, head of the foundation. "But she always has time to help the 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
 The association, a nonprofit organization that raises money for Irvine 
schools, presented Los Naranjos with a $500 grant in Williams' name. She was 
selected from about 20 parents nominated by teachers, school administrators and 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 51, lives in the Ranch village, where she runs a small day-care 
business out of her home. Her youngest child, 12, recently graduated from Los 
Naranjos, but Williams continues to volunteer at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important to help the community and the schools," she said. "You 
can't just take from a community. You have to give back, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has spent much of her volunteer time raising money. She's organized 
carnivals, jog-a-thons, book fairs and other events aimed at collecting money 
for classroom programs and field trips. She and other parents helped save the 
music program by purchasing instruments and loaning them out to students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the teachers can do it all anymore," Williams said. "We see all 
these cutbacks every year. The schools need help from the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said an added benefit of her volunteer work was getting to know her 
children's teachers and understanding the classroom curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps to know who the principal is and who the teachers are," she said. 
"It helps to communicate with them." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Williams, the Irvine Education Foundation selected three parent 
volunteer finalists. They are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Shari Bodensteiner, who works at the University High School switchboard two 
days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Donna Grady, who started a successful scholarship program at Bonita Canyon 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paula Ota, who helped create a center at Sierra Vista Middle School where 
parents can receive information on how best to deal with their teen-age 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Each finalist's school received a $300 grant.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; CITY MARKS OPENING OF MAINTENANCE YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city celebrated the opening of a $20-million maintenance yard Wednesday, 
the largest public works project it has funded in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 1/2-acre property will house the Public Works agency's field operations 
and water staff, provide fueling and maintenance services for all city, police 
and fire vehicles, and include a warehouse for all surplus city supplies, said 
Jim Ross, the Public Works Agency's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably one of the largest projects we've ever done," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just from a public works standpoint, it's consolidating our operation from 
three different locations down to one," he said. "It's putting us much closer 
to City Hall, so we expect to put fewer miles on our equipment, and it will 
provide state-of-the-art facilities for our staff that work out there to 
monitor our water system." 
</P>
<P>
 The yard at 220 S. Daisy Ave. replaces a 7.2-acre yard on Warner Avenue that 
is so cramped that firetrucks have to be serviced in the parking lot because 
they do not fit inside the maintenance facility, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new yard cost $12.4 million to build. More than $8 million in additional 
funds was spent to acquire property and make road improvements, Ross said. The 
Public Works Agency first began requesting a new yard in the early 1970s, he 
said.LEE ROMNEY

 The Santa Ana Unified School District board has named Don Champlin as interim 
superintendent to replace Rudy M. Castruita, who will leave the district in 
mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
 The board made its decision in closed session at its Tuesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Champlin, who now serves as assistant superintendent of personnel services, 
will take over effective July 18, district spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has worked for the district since 1986 and will replace Castruita, who has 
accepted a job as superintendent of schools for San Diego County. Castruita 
joined the district in 1985, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 As interim superintendent of the county's largest school district, Champlin 
will oversee 3,600 full-time and 500 part-time employees. The district serves 
nearly 50,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 A search firm was named last week to find a qualified candidate to take the 
$124,000-a-year job and district officials have said they expect the search to 
take about four months.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SCHOOL BOARD DELAYS VOTE ON BRIDGE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District has postponed a vote on whether to 
support completion of a controversial Caltrans pedestrian bridge project, which 
residents say would increase crime in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Transportation is building the bridge across the 
Santa Ana Freeway at 20th Street to replace a pedestrian tunnel that once went 
under the freeway.That tunnel was demolished as a part of Caltrans' 
freeway-widening project.  
</P>
<P>
 About 100 residents attended the board meeting Tuesday, and most opposed the 
construction of the bridge. Many told the board it would promote crime, 
graffiti and vandalism in their neighborhood in part by giving criminals an 
easy escape route. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents also said that crime dropped noticeably in their neighborhood when 
the tunnel was demolished and urged the board to formally request Caltrans to 
not replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has spent $600,000 on the bridge, which is about 60% complete, 
according to a report to the board. The bridge would be finished in January, 
1995, but residents said they received notice from Caltrans that the agency 
would stop construction if the school district opposed the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The crossing is intended to benefit 170 schoolchildren who live west of the 
freeway and attend Hoover Elementary School, which is east of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 District staff recommended that the board support completion of the bridge. 
Otherwise children would be forced to walk another half a mile on a busy street 
to get to school. 
</P>
<P>
 However, board members said they were uneasy with taking a formal position 
until hearing about safety and other concerns from the parents whose children 
would use the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will consider the item on July 12 at a meeting site which is to be 
determined, district spokeswoman Diane Thomas said.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY DECIDES AGAINST CLOSING NIGHTCLUB

 The City Council this week decided not to shut down the Bacchus nightclub, 
which has been criticized by police for lax security. The club's owners have 
agreed to provide tighter security, close by 1:30 a.m. and limit dancing to the 
first floor to avoid losing their operating permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The club has six months to show that it is complying with the new security 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had asked for the restaurant and nightclub at 3505 Via Oporto to be 
shut down after officers responded about 50 times to calls of excessive noise, 
public drunkenness, drug possession and fights, Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a March brawl, an unruly crowd at the club freed three people who had 
been arrested and were sitting in police patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new agreement worked out with the city, uniformed security guards 
must be inside and outside the club. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, which opened in September, is also required to take in more money 
from food sales than from the sale of alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 Management must pay entertainers a flat fee for performances rather than a 
percentage of cover charges or food and liquor sales. Officials said that would 
avoid overcrowding by eliminating outside promoters. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; DEADLINE TO LEGALIZE ADD-ON UNITS NEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Laguna Beach property owners who have second residential units -- also 
known as "granny flats" -- on their lots have until Oct. 3 to file applications 
with the city to legalize their units. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of legalizing such units has been controversial in the city, which 
lost a court battle on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the December, 1987, annexation of South Laguna, add-on apartments 
proliferated in that community under the county's more relaxed standards. 
</P>
<P>
 After annexation, the city demanded that the apartments, some of which were 
built in the 1930s, be dismantled or brought into conformance with city 
building codes, including making sure the properties provided adequate parking. 
</P>
<P>
 South Laguna property owners sued the city and won, forcing the city to pay 
$650,000 for the opponents' legal fees. The judge ruled in that case that the 
landowners had until Oct. 3, to apply for permits under the state's more easily 
met standards. 
</P>
<P>
 But some property owners have dragged their feet, a spokesman for their 
attorney said this week after releasing a statement reminding the owners that 
time is running out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of (the property owners) don't have it on the front burner," 
spokesman Tom Wilck said. "Our purpose is just to remind them, 'Hey, we've got 
a deadline here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have said there are between 100 and 600 illegal add-on 
residences in the south end of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, what they've got out there now has never been legalized," 
said Kathy Lottes, a city planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the court's ruling, the city has received 66 applications for 
"administrative-use permits" -- which confirm that the second residential units 
meet state planning requirements -- and about half of them have been approved, 
Lottes said. LESLIE EARNEST

NEW RULING ALLOWS BOY TO SUE IN TAINTED TRANSFUSION; COURTS: THE AIDS CASE, 
WHICH INVOLVES CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF ORANGE COUNTY, EQUALIZES KIDS' RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move to give California's children equal rights with adults in medical 
malpractice cases, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that a boy who 
contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion may sue the American Red Cross and 
Children's Hospital of Orange County even though a lower court ruled that the 
statute of limitations had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. District Court judge previously ruled that the boy's family had waited 
too long to sue. The lawsuit was filed in October, 1991, nearly eight years 
after the unidentified boy allegedly had received tainted blood during multiple 
transfusions at CHOC for a blood disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, the trial court said, a medical malpractice lawsuit on behalf 
of a child must be filed within three years after he is injured, whether or not 
the harm, such as an HIV infection, is discovered by then. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, state law gives adults three years to file a malpractice suit 
after they know that they have suffered harm. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena decided that it is 
unconstitutional for children to be treated differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one could have possibly intended that children have fewer rights," Circuit 
Judge Dorothy W. Nelson, who wrote the opinion for the three-judge panel, said 
in an interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said the ruling, since it was based on the U.S. Constitution's 
assurance of "equal protection," should establish precedent in state courts, as 
well as federal courts that interpret California law. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer representing the American Red Cross in the case was not available 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 David Ettinger, representing Children's Hospital of Orange County, said his 
client agreed with the federal court's "equal protection" interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ettinger added, however, that he does not believe the boy's lawyer has shown 
proof that the boy's immune system problems first became evident in August, 
1988, when a blood test revealed he was infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus. If symptoms were noticed earlier, he said, the case 
still may have been filed too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Berman, the lawyer representing the boy, said the appellate court 
decision "means children have a better break now than they ever had before." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, a state appellate court, in deciding the case of Torres vs. the 
County of Los Angeles, also said that the more restrictive statute of 
limitation for children was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berman said that "there were still some trial courts that were dismissing 
cases on the basis that the minors had not brought timely actions." 
</P>
<P>
 With Wednesday's federal appellate court decision, the boy's case was sent 
back to U.S. District Court. Berman said that through the discovery process he 
expects to learn more about how his client contracted HIV and whether there is 
strong enough evidence of negligence involving the screening of blood and blood 
donors to warrant going to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, who was 4 years old when he received the blood transfusions in 
December, 1983, is now living in the Midwest with his family, who moved from 
Orange County about a year ago.

STUDENT-WRITTEN ANTI-HATE SPEECH BILL PRESENTED; LEGISLATION: RECENT O.C. 
GRADUATES TELL SENATE PANEL THAT RACIST COMMENTS AT SCHOOL PROMPTED THEM TO TRY 
TO CHANGE THE LAW. BUT LEGISLATORS SEND IT TO BE REWORDED.

<P>
 Two recent Huntington Beach High School graduates told state legislators 
Wednesday that school administrators must be given the power to punish students 
who use offensive language against their classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brandy Marks and Joshua Holland, both African Americans who graduated earlier 
this month, told members of the Senate Education Committee that they were angry 
about the racist speech on their former campus and frustrated that there 
appeared to be little administrators could do to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 They asked legislators to pass a bill that they helped write, which would make 
it easier for principals to discipline students who say or write offensive 
statements that could incite other students to react with violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much that goes on on a school campus anyway," Marks told committee 
members at a hearing on educational issues. "When you're called obscene names, 
it makes it even harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland told legislators that he had been called derogatory names by other 
students but had felt powerless to fight back. He said gay and lesbian students 
have had more success at being protected from hate speech than other minority 
students, which he believes isn't fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say it's sexual harassment. But what's the difference between sexual 
harassment and regular harassment?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks pleaded with lawmakers to pass the bill so that minority students could 
focus on learning instead of being on guard against offensive comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just too much going on at school already to take this type of 
pressure coming down on you. . . , " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a short debate, legislators decided to send the bill, introduced by 
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), to a judiciary committee so lawmakers 
can reword it. 
</P>
<P>
 Marks, 18, and Holland, 17, were among about a half-dozen African-American 
students at Huntington Beach High who were angered by racist flyers that were 
dumped in a campus parking lot twice last year. They went to their principal's 
office to demand action. 
</P>
<P>
 But Principal Jim Staunton told them he felt constrained by state law. When he 
examined the state education code, Staunton said later, he found only a section 
that allows administrators to punish students for acts "disruptive to the 
school environment" but does not specifically address acts that denigrate 
people for their race, creed, gender or other characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 So Staunton, Marks, Holland and several other students decided to try to 
change the law. Teachers helped the students draft a resolution against hate 
crimes and speech, and Staunton approached Allen to ask that its ideas be used 
to amend the state education code. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very, very proud of the manner in which they handled this," Allen said of 
the students' legislative efforts. Offensive speech "creates an environment 
that is incompatible with the nature and intentions of our public school 
system."  
</P>
<P>
 Allen's legislation would amend the education code to include a section that 
allows administrators to suspend or expel any student who orally or through 
writing tries to incite a "lawless action." 
</P>
<P>
 That language spurred debate at Wednesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Lobaco, American Civil Liberties Union legislative director in 
Sacramento, told legislators he is concerned that the bill is vague and 
possibly limits the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. He also said 
the bill, as written, does not specifically accomplish what the students set 
out to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "The resulting bill has very little to do with comments made by the students," 
Lobaco said. "The bill doesn't define what 'lawless action' is." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Tom Campbell (R-Los Altos) said he was concerned that the language 
violated free speech rights and recommended that it be sent to the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, where it likely will be heard next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you put something in that's insufficiently clear, some people will be 
afraid to use their speech rights," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cecelia Williams, a retired Los Angeles Unified School District 
psychologist and spectator at the hearing, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody ought to do something about this going on in schools," Williams 
said, praising Holland and Marks. "You can't just walk around and let people 
say things to you that are not right."

COMPLAINTS BRING FREE PARKING BACK TO DANA POINT HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to complaints from customers and merchants alike, the Dana Point 
Harbor Assn. has agreed to raise the mechanical pay gates and return free 
parking to Dana Point Harbor on a limited basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting Tuesday, there will be free parking throughout the harbor on Mondays 
through Thursdays until 4 p.m. However, the rate of $2 an hour and $18 a day 
for the popular Mariner's Village and Dana Wharf parking lots will continue in 
the evenings and on weekends and holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The association's parking committee voted Tuesday to make the changes and the 
decision was immediately applauded by harbor merchants. Most merchants have 
said that their businesses have suffered since the pay-to-park policy began on 
April 15 after 21 years of free harbor parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Moore, who owns three harbor retail shops, including the Downstairs 
Store, a card and gift shop, on Wednesday called the move "a wonderful step. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how anybody would be unhappy with this," said Moore, a San 
Clemente resident who has been in business in the harbor for seven years. "I 
think this is fair, and it should work out really well." 
</P>
<P>
 But Moore believes some sort of paid parking program will remain at the 
harbor, noting that nearly every harbor and beach community in the state 
charges its visitor for parking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly believe (the parking gates) will never go away," Moore said. "I think 
we'll have to learn to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchant Peggie Pearson also applauded the move Wednesday. She said continuous 
complaints by local customers were responsible for the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The local voices of the people of Dana Point, Laguna Niguel and San Clemente 
have been heard," said Pearson, a Huntington Beach resident and owner of the In 
Thing shop. "They have been boycotting us. There weren't 25 cars in the parking 
lots today." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pearson said she would have liked to see more free time given to shoppers. 
The parking rules now allow restaurants to offer validations for two hours of 
parking, retail shops one hour and the sports fishing docks four hours of 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Couldn't they have given the retail shops just one more hour?" Pearson asked. 
"As it is, our customers are constantly checking their watches."

 A 21-year-old man poured gasoline on himself at a gas station Wednesday and 
then ignited it, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whose name was not released, walked to a service station in the 2400 
block of West Lincoln Avenue about 2:15 p.m. and paid for $1 worth of gas.He 
then placed everything from his pockets on top of a gas pump, pumped gasoline 
over his body and set it afire, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone put out the flames with a fire extinguisher, and the man was rushed to 
UCI Medical Center, where he was in critical condition.

 Petra Rojas, 18, who witnessed the scene from a subway shop next to the

saw a man sitting Indian-style on the ground, screaming. People were yelling 
out questions like, 'How old are you?' and he screamed back answers."

IRVINE STORE WILL BE HONORED FOR WORK WITH DISABLED EMPLOYEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Irvine discount store will be honored today by the Orange County Employment 
Advocacy Network at a luncheon held to recognize employers who hire people with 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Target store at 3750 Barranca Parkway will be named the most innovative 
employer of the year in Orange County for creating a position for a worker with 
a walking problem that included tasks he could accomplish despite his 
disability. 
</P>
<P>
 Store managers also modified the employee's hours so that he could take the 
bus to and from work, said Kathy Moore, coordinator of the luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's event will be hosted by KTLA-TV sportscaster Ed Arnold and will 
include a speech by Geri Jewell, an actress from the 1980s sitcom "Facts of 
Life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Employment Advocacy Network is a consortium of agencies that 
help disabled people find jobs and assist employers with special job training, 
Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Target, three other Orange County businesses will be honored 
for their work with disabled employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The luncheon begins at 11 a.m. at the Anaheim Marriott, 700 Convention Way. 
For more information, call (714) 724-6730.

POLICE DON'T NEED HOME WARRANT IF ABUSE SUSPECTED; DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: RULING 
BASED ON A NEWPORT BEACH CASE WHERE POLICE THOUGHT A WOMAN WAS BEING BEATEN BUT 
FOUND DRUGS. SOME THINK SIMPSON CASE SPURRED DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police officers may enter a home without a search warrant when they suspect 
someone may be in danger of domestic violence even if that person says 
everything is all right, a state appeals court ruled in a Newport Beach case. 
</P>
<P>
 In that 1992 case, police entered a home in the belief a woman had been beaten 
by her boyfriend, but found drugs instead and arrested the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal, in a 3-0 ruling issued Tuesday, upheld their 
subsequent drug convictions, saying the apparent domestic violence emergency 
authorized police to enter without a search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Past rulings, from California and elsewhere, recognize that "probable cause of 
ongoing spousal abuse at a residence warrants immediate police intervention," 
the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 The court didn't mention the heavily publicized case of O.J. Simpson, who is 
accused of killing his ex-wife and a friend were slain two weeks ago. But one 
defense lawyer said Wednesday the justices may have had the convicted wife 
beater on their minds when they decided to issue the ruling as a published 
decision that other courts can cite as a precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the O.J. deal went down, I knew this case was going to be a loser," said 
Brian P. Trela, whose client, Melissa Ayotte, tried to discourage police from 
entering the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this case is probably going to encourage police to enter a residence 
or at least make contact with all subjects in domestic violence cases," Trela 
said. That isn't necessarily a bad policy, he said, but "there is a Fourth 
Amendment right of people to be left alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Douglas Benedon, lawyer for co-defendant John Anthony Higgins: "It's a 
very sensitive area and I certainly understand the court's concern, but I don't 
think it warrants a wholesale writing off of the Fourth Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. General Warren Robinson said the ruling "may well help in 
situations of domestic violence."  
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that police don't have to blindly accept what the apparent victim 
tells them," he said. "They can look at the totality of the circumstances."  
</P>
<P>
 The case arose late one night in September, 1992 when Newport Beach police 
received an anonymous report of a domestic disturbance involving a "man shoving 
a woman around," according to the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers first went to the back door, but when no one responded, they walked 
to the front door. While doing so, one officer saw a man inside and heard a 
shout.  
</P>
<P>
 When the officers knocked on the front door, Ayotte answered. Officers said 
she was breathing heavily and appeared "extremely frightened." She had a 
"little red mark" under one eye and slight darkness under both eyes, according 
to the court. 
</P>
<P>
 One officer testified that based on his experience, he believed the red mark 
was caused by Ayotte being struck or slapped in the face. The officer told her 
why they were there and asked if she was all right. She said yes, and that the 
red mark was a birthmark. She also told the officers she had fallen down the 
stairs and the noise from the fall may have prompted someone to call the 
police. When asked if she was alone, the woman told officers she was, although 
she said her boyfriend had been there earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers knew she wasn't alone, and that battered women commonly deny 
being abused. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the house, they met Higgins and discovered marijuana and cocaine on the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 After Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Richard Aronson upheld the 
search, Ayotte and Higgins pleaded guilty and were given short sentences, which 
they have completed, their lawyers said.

TENNIS / DANA HADDAD; INCHING UP TOWARD THE TOP RUNG 
</P>

<P>
 Though not very tall, Lori Stern and Robert Yim have been taking some pretty 
big steps toward gaining stature in their sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern, of Ojai, finished second in last week's Southern California Junior 
Sectional tournament. Seeded No. 2 coming in, she remains the second-best 
player in the Southland in the girls' 10-and-under singles division. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the second time this year, Stern came close to defeating top-seeded 
Angela Haynes of San Clemente, who is ranked fourth in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's a little bit better than me," Stern said after her 6-1, 5-7, 
6-2 defeat to Haynes in the final at Los Caballeros Sports Village in Fountain 
Valley. "I'm happy. Once I didn't think I could split sets with her. I didn't 
think I could get a set off her." 
</P>
<P>
 This was the second time this year Stern pushed Haynes to three sets, losing 
4-6, 6-2, 6-1, in Fullerton in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Yim, of Glendale, is 3 feet 11 and weighs only 65 pounds. He's 9. But he has 
quickly earned the respect of the 10-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Yim reached the semifinals of boys' 10 singles in the sectional before losing, 
6-4, 6-3, to top-seeded and eventual champion Doug Stewart of Malibu. To get 
there, Yim upset No. 4 Aaron Yovan of Irvine, 7-6 (7-4), 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Yim is so small he has to keep his left arm bent at all times to avoid 
scraping his racket on the court. But he advanced through the 64-player draw by 
attacking his bigger, more-experienced opponents and has assured himself a 
top-five seeding in the section. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Stewart three sets to beat Yim, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, at a junior tournament 
in Long Beach in the spring. Yim lost to Yovan in Arcadia earlier this year and 
was down, 3-0, in the first set at Fountain Valley before he won five 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was going lose and then suddenly I caught up," Yim said. "I did a 
lot of topspin. He had a problem with that, so I just kept on doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern, beyond intimidation, routinely spars with men on the challenge court at 
Ojai Valley Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've hit with her; she's going to be a player," said Karl Pope, club owner. 
"She's got an incredible feeling for the game. She can serve and volley. That's 
very unusual for a girl." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Awesome Ania: Ania Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks went on a rampage in winning 
the Southern California girls' 18 singles championship. She didn't lose a set 
in five matches and dropped only 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 And she made it look easy, routing Violette Ahn of Los Angeles, 6-3, 6-2, in 
the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have guessed that Bleszynski, 17 and bound for Stanford on a tennis 
scholarship, was nervous? 
</P>
<P>
 "We both started off pretty nervous," Bleszynski said. But Ahn shook her 
jitters first, breaking Bleszynski's first two serves to lead, 3-1, in the 
first set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my God," Bleszynski blurted after she put a backhand into the net to give 
Ahn her second break. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Bleszynski won 20 of the next 24 points and the final five games of the 
set. She opened the second set winning 13 of 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 So why the jitters? Bleszynski might have been thinking about the 1993 
sectional, in which she was upset in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "Worst match of my life," Bleszynski said. "That match I hit two balls over 
the fence on the fly. No joke." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Second-best again: If the sectional tournament had been a wedding, Derek Pope 
of Ojai would certainly have the "best man" routine down by now. He's made it 
to the final three times in different age groups but has yet to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Pope, 17, had lost in boys' 12s and 14s finals, and on Sunday 
lost to his doubles partner, Jakub Pietrowski, in the 18s final. Top-seeded 
Pietrowski won handily, 6-3, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to win this tournament," Pope said before the final. "My junior career 
is almost over. I want to end with some good wins. I'm not playing for rankings 
now. I'm playing for pride and to work on my mental toughness." 
</P>
<P>
 Pope had a 7-5, 6-3 victory in the semifinals over Harvard-Westlake High 
graduate Philip Tseng, who will play in the U.S. Olympic Festival in St. Louis 
beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were recovering from injuries. Pope, a right-hander, suffered a hairline 
fracture in his left wrist in March. Tseng broke his left leg skiing in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Tseng was frustrated after the match, because he was physically and mentally 
off his game. Pope said he had the same experience a few weeks earlier in a 
team tournament in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost to Misha Palecek, who is No. 3 in Northern California -- but I'd never 
lost to him (before)," Pope said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Physically, I thought I was in shape. But mentally, I was not used to a tight 
match. I wasn't shape in my thinking and my strategy. I was rusty."

ON SOME JOBS, MISERY RISES WITH MERCURY

<P>
 So you think it's hot? 
</P>
<P>
 Just be glad you don't have to work all day on a tar roof, lifting heavy 
materials dozens of feet above the ground with absolutely no shade in sight.  
</P>
<P>
 In an informal survey of the "hottest" jobs in the sweltering summer heat, 
roofers topped the list, followed by other construction workers, dry-cleaning 
employees -- and Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who wears a costume -- like Disneyland characters -- classically loses 
five pounds of water or more in one shift," said Fred Dennis, a physician in 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's emergency room. "When you're in a closed costume, 
you lose your ability to sweat or lose heat by sweating, and that's when your 
temperature starts to go up." 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey and his buddies take frequent breaks and greet visitors in the shade or 
in air-conditioned rooms, Disneyland spokesman Jim McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 reason why people come to Disneyland is to meet Mickey Mouse," 
McClintock said. "Visitors are guaranteed to meet Mickey, even on a hot day." 
</P>
<P>
 Painters have it tough, too. Craig Henderson, owner of Craig Henderson Custom 
Painting in Rancho Santa Margarita, was sweating it out painting cabinets 
outdoors in San Clemente on Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty darn hot," he said. "We brought a whole jug of water, and it's 
almost gone. It was supposed to last us the whole day. We're a pretty tough 
group. I think we get more work done when it's hot because the paint dries 
faster." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roofers, however, are closer to the sun, said Dennis Chan, an emergency room 
physician at County USC Medical Center who regularly treats patients for 
heatstroke. "They're usually working with dark materials that absorb a lot of 
heat."  
</P>
<P>
 Because it takes time and effort to get on and off the roof, "they tend to sit 
up there for a long time instead of taking frequent breaks," Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is no official list of jobs that are particularly brutal in the 
summer heat, there are identifiable risk factors, said Carol Peterson, a 
medical epidemiologist with the Los Angeles County Public Health Department. 
They include working in closed spaces with poor ventilation and no air 
conditioning and performing a fair amount of physical activity, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 State and local government employees -- including firefighters and highway 
workers -- reported the most instances of on-the-job heat-related injuries in 
1991, the latest year for which statistics are available, said John Duncan, a 
spokesman for the California Department of Industrial Relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Government employees accounted for nearly a third of the reported injuries, 
followed by construction workers at 19%, farm workers at 13% and service 
industry workers at 13%, Duncan said. Service industry workers include people 
working at theme parks, fast-food restaurants and gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction workers such as roofers are prone to bouts of heat exhaustion and 
heatstroke, which cause high temperatures, nausea, dizziness, headaches, muscle 
cramps and seizures, said Christine Hayne, director of the emergency department 
at Queen of Angels Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually anyone who works outside can get it," said Catherine Montagna, a 
spokeswoman for California Medical Center in Los Angeles. "That includes road 
construction workers, linemen for the telephone or electric company, field 
laborers and police and firemen." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no escape from the heat at Bowers & Sons Cleaners in Los Angeles, 
where workers operate pressing machines for six hours a day in a back room 
without air conditioning, employee Nick Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be over 100 degrees in there," Carter said. "We've got three fans 
going and we keep the doors open. I don't think air conditioning would make any 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the fate of the sun-prone roofers, don't worry about them. They get 
used to it, said roofer Ron Gregory, owner of Star Roofing Co. in Los Angeles. 
Roofers become acclimated to the heat and drink plenty of fluids, he said. It 
helps to work in the early morning and late evening and take the hot afternoons 
off, Gregory said.

DELTA CUTS FARES TO FILL SEATS ON HOLIDAY FLIGHTS; AIRLINES: DISCOUNT PROMOTION 
REQUIRES TRAVELERS TO DEPART AFTER 6 P.M. SATURDAY AND CATCH RETURNS LEAVING 
BEFORE MIDNIGHT MONDAY. 
</P>

 Delta Air Lines is offering a Fourth of July weekend fare of $149 for 
coast-to-coast round trips -- for travelers who can leave Saturday evening and 
come back Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which was quickly matched by other major carriers, is aimed at 
filling seats during the slack periods of the busy holiday weekend, a Delta 
spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers must depart after 6 p.m. Saturday and catch returns leaving before 
midnight Monday. The deal applies to most of the 155 destinations that Delta 
serves directly, including Orange County, Los Angeles and Ontario. It does not 
include cities that can be reached only by the airline's commuter service. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta has seven direct flights from Orange County's John Wayne Airport. Three 
daily round trips are to Dallas, three are to Salt Lake City and one to Las 
Vegas. Passengers can catch connecting flights to the East Coast or other 
points to take full advantage of the low fares. 
</P>
<P>
 Round-trip fares are $99 on flights up to 500 miles; $129 on flights from 501 
to 1,000 miles; and $149 on longer flights. The non-refundable tickets are good 
for only a limited number of seats on flights. Advance purchase is not 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fares are offered in such a way as they don't compete with our other 
fares," Delta spokesman Clay McConnell said. "They fill seats that would go 
unfilled." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Howard, an airline economics consultant in Washington, said that even 
though airlines typically raise fares during the summer, when vacation travel 
is brisk, seats often go unfilled during the latter part of three-day holiday 
weekends. The late-Saturday-to-Monday offer is a way to remedy that. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta first tried such holiday discounts on Christmas Day last year. They were 
such a hit that the carrier repeated the offer for New Year's Day. A similar 
deal on Memorial Day, McConnell said, brought the airline an additional $2 
million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Thom Nulty, president of Associated Travel Management in Santa Ana, said the 
fares are so low that they are drawing some people who simply want to ride in 
an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Memorial Day promotion, Nulty said, one of his travel agency's 
clients flew to Chicago to have dinner with his mother and requested that he be 
booked on short-haul flights. "He even had a four-hour layover in Butte, 
Montana," Nulty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Requests by travelers for the few low-fare seats available, however, have 
swamped some travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tami Truong, manager of Colby Travel in West Los Angeles, said she has had 
difficulty booking the cheap seats. "All airlines are sold out," she said 
Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Some potential passengers get angry, she said, when they learn how limited the 
promotion is. She had to tell one customer seeking a $149 round-trip ticket to 
New York that the next-cheapest seat available would cost $1,386. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a good fare," she said. Cheap Seats 
</P>
<P>
 Delta Air Lines announced an air-fare war for this holiday weekend only. Other 
carriers have matched the offer. Here are some of the details: 
</P>
<P>
 * Travelers must depart after 6 p.m. Saturday and leave on their return flight 
before midnight Monday 
</P>
<P>
 * Round-trip fares are $99 on flights up to 500 miles; $129 on flights from 
501 to 1,000 miles; and $149 on longer flights 
</P>
<P>
 * Tickets are non-refundable 
</P>
<P>
 * Tickets good for only a limited number of seats 
</P>
<P>
 * Advance purchase not required

DOLLAR HITS ANOTHER LOW AGAINST YEN; MARKETS: GLOBAL CURRENCY TRADERS REMAIN 
UNIMPRESSED BY BENTSEN COMMENTS. DOW OFF SLIGHTLY; YIELDS EDGE DOWNWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. dollar plunged to another record low against the Japanese yen 
Wednesday, highlighting the growing inability of the United States and other 
nations to block the will of the world's vast and turbulent currency markets.  
</P>
<P>
 The day before, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen had proclaimed his 
support of the dollar in the strongest Clinton Administration statement to date 
on the greenback's travails. 
</P>
<P>
 But the high-level remarks failed to impress speculators in the global 
currency bazaar, which handles an estimated $1 trillion a day. Traders in Asia, 
Europe and North America drove the dollar down against the yen, though not 
against other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've seen such a successful, concerted attack on the 
dollar," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. in 
New York. "It's rather terrifying."  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed at 98.60 yen in New York, down from 99.95 on Tuesday, and at 
1.5855 German marks, up from 1.5795. It closed in early-morning trading in 
Tokyo today at 99.07 yen, down 0.20.  
</P>
<P>
 U.S. stocks, meanwhile, had an up-and-down day, with the Dow industrials 
falling 2.59 points to 3,667.05 after having risen more than 20 points earlier 
in the day. Other stock barometers rose moderately, and long-term interest 
rates edged downward. Gold prices fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Most attention was on the dollar, however, in which losses were focused 
against the yen. Indeed, the dollar edged up against the Swiss franc, French 
franc and British pound, underscoring the strength of the yen and concerns 
about the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news briefing Wednesday, Bentsen repeated his statement of support for 
the dollar, saying, "We believe a stronger dollar is better for our economy and 
better for the world's economy." 
</P>
<P>
 However, analysts said the market was more interested in the political and 
economic realities that have prompted the continuing shifts in currency values. 
They also expressed doubt that the White House can muster the will or financial 
firepower to prevail over the currency markets.  
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is an issue of confidence -- confidence in the Administration," 
said David Solin, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, a New York 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's trade surplus with the United States, which is running in the 
$60-billion annual range, is increasingly being seen as a reason for the 
strengthening yen and weakening dollar. In addition, the Japanese have become 
less inclined to invest their profits in U.S. bonds than in the past, fearing 
inflation and rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, U.S.-Japanese trade issues remain unresolved, and the emergence of a 
shaky new Japanese government with a Socialist prime minister suggests that 
such issues will smolder for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can they come to the table and talk about trade and make great strides if 
politically at home it's a mess?" Solin asked. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also unclear Wednesday how long it would take the political situation 
in Japan to sort itself out.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at two or three years of political uncertainty in Japan," said 
Lawrence B. Krause, a professor at the Graduate School of International 
Relations and Pacific Studies at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are looking to two events next week for further clues to the 
dollar's course. 
</P>
<P>
 The Group of Seven leading industrial powers is scheduled to meet in Naples, 
Italy. At the parley, global strategies to stabilize the dollar will be 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 An increase in short-term U.S. interest rates and a decrease in currently 
higher German rates, for example, would make American securities more 
attractive and stimulate demand for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board makes the decisions on U.S. interest rates, and its 
Open Market Committee is to meet Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of higher rates, which some experts think are unnecessary, would 
be to keep the U.S. economy on its current non-inflationary course and perhaps 
to change international sentiment about the dollar, which has lost about 10% of 
its value against the yen and mark this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has already raised interest rates four times this year, pushing up 
short-term interest rates 1.25 percentage points since February. Whether an 
interest rate increase would stabilize the dollar remains at issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at all the increases we've implemented this year -- and look at where 
the dollar is," said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president of a New York investment 
advisory firm. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stocks traded solidly higher for most of the day, with the Dow 
rising more than 20 points, then falling back. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, analysts said the market held up well given the dollar's record low 
against the yen. Winners topped losers by about 7 to 5 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, and most broad market indexes finished higher. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year issue eased to 7.51% 
from 7.52% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. markets may have been helped by strength in Europe. In London, the 
FTSE-100 index jumped 37.3 points to 2,946.3, its third straight advance 
despite global currency turmoil. In Frankfurt, the DAX average rose 28.04 
points to 2,046.30. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks in Mexico City also rebounded. The Bolsa index rose 38.70 points to 
2,270.93. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo stocks finished lower, but their selloff was muted even as the dollar 
sank. The Nikkei index eased 158.23 points to 20,481.00. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Retail stocks paced the broad market's advance, on expectations that sales 
are improving after a weak spring. Dayton Hudson jumped 2 to 81, Sears gained 1 
to 47 7/8, J.C. Penney surged 2 to 52 3/4 and Ann Taylor was up 3/4 to 39 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among industrial stocks bouncing back, Nucor rose 1 7/8 to 71, Cummins 
Engine gained 1 1/8 to 43 1/8, Parker Hannifin added 7/8 to 42 1/2 and Dover 
rose 1 1/8 to 59 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some telecommunications issues were also strong. LDDS Communications jumped 
1 1/2 to 16 3/4, General Instrument rose 1 1/2 to 57 3/4 and 3Com surged 1 3/8 
to 51 1/8.

FCC GIVES MINORITIES AN EDGE IN WIRELESS AUCTION; COMMUNICATIONS: AGENCY RULES 
WILL ALSO AID WOMEN AND SMALL BUSINESSES IN RADIO SPECTRUM BIDDING WAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an ambitious effort to assure women, minorities and small businesses an 
ownership stake in the burgeoning wireless communications industry, the Federal 
Communications Commission adopted rules Wednesday that will give those groups 
special treatment in a multibillion-dollar radio spectrum sale later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC will auction off coveted radio frequencies to be used for so-called 
personal communications services, which will provide a low-cost alternative to 
today's cellular telephone and paging systems. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 100 million Americans are expected to use various types of 
wireless communications within 10 years as competition and new technology drive 
prices down. The new PCS services alone are expected to generate as much as $50 
billion in annual revenues and 100,000 new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to fears that the FCC's new auction system would lock out all but 
the most powerful big businesses -- and eager to assure the disadvantaged a 
piece of a massive new business -- Congress mandated that the FCC find a way to 
assure women, minorities and small businesses a fair share of the PCS licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan approved Wednesday will allow small, minority-owned firms to win a 
license with bids as much as 25% below others, and it provides a range of 
bidding incentives and special financing and payment provisions for the other 
targeted groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half the 2,071 licenses up for grabs are reserved for medium-sized 
firms or those owned by women or minorities -- the most aggressive federal 
action ever to seek broad representation of ownership in an industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long and tragic history of inequality between the races and gender in 
America, today we are creating the greatest single opportunity made available 
to women and minorities," FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if past FCC minority incentive schemes are any measure, the new rules will 
trigger bitter controversy and possibly a court challenge by companies excluded 
from bidding for the reserved licenses, FCC staff members acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "The net effect of this policy will be to slow the development of the personal 
communications services industry by several years," said J. Gregory Sidak, a 
former FCC employee and an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidak also argues that the special rules will reduce the money raised by the 
auctions, which would go to the Treasury. As a result, he says, the special 
rules amount to a form of income transfer, rather than communications policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hundt cast the new rules in the context of a history-making breakthrough, 
noting that the 19th-Century railroad land grants that ceded a tenth of the 
public land of America resulted in no benefit to women or minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC plan does not set any quotas or goals for minority or women ownership, 
unlike other federal government programs aimed at disadvantaged businesses. 
Rather, FCC general counsel William E. Kennard said the measures are designed 
to create fair opportunities for broad representation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the FCC plan, the 2,071 licenses available nationwide will be divided 
into three groups or blocks. Bidding for 986 licenses, a so-called 
entrepreneurial block, will be open only to firms with revenue of less than 
$125 million and assets of less than $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 White-owned firms in that category get no special help in the bidding. Small 
businesses with less than $40 million revenue can bid 10% below a competitor 
and still win the auction -- a so-called bidding credit. Minority or 
women-owned business get a bidding credit of 15%, and a small business owned by 
a woman or a minority gets a 25% credit. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the FCC will defer payment for up to five years, charging 
interest at a rate equal to a 10-year Treasury note. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundt said the special incentives will not cost taxpayers anything, but 
critics say the program will undoubtedly reduce Treasury receipts in the 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
 The new wireless phones will operate on a segment of the microwave band 
formerly allocated to private communications systems. Compared to current 
cellular phones, the new system will produce much lighter-weight and 
lower-power phones that will fit into a small pocket. They are expected to one 
day be whittled to about the size of Dick Tracy's wristwatch phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the FCC plan, six license holders will compete in every geographic 
region -- compared to just two licenses per market in the cellular telephone 
business. Some experts expect the average cost of a wireless call -- now about 
40 cents per minute on cellular systems -- to be cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the federal auctions for 
licenses for wireless telephones and licenses for advanced technology pagers 
could generate $10 billion for the federal Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 The auction for the broad-band licenses will be conducted in three phases 
through an electronic marketplace before the end of the year. Another auction 
starting next month will cover narrow-band frequency for advanced pagers.

CUPPA WOE; BRAZIL COFFEE CROP LOSSES ARE TALLIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazilian growers are surveying the fields, manufacturers are burning up 
telephone lines and government officials have been meeting nonstop, all in an 
effort to minimize the damage of a three-day cold snap that wiped out at least 
40% of next year's coffee crop. 
</P>
<P>
 The official numbers aren't in yet, but preliminary reports are dismal at 
best. Virtually the entire harvest in Parana, one of three primary 
coffee-growing states, has been lost. Another 40% was destroyed in Sao Paulo 
State, and about 25% of the crop was lost in Minas Gerais, the nation's largest 
coffee-growing region. 
</P>
<P>
 The devastation has pushed raw U.S. coffee prices to their highest levels 
since 1986, sending retail prices upward. Kraft General Foods told grocery 
customers it will boost prices about 15% on its Maxwell House brand. A 13-ounce 
can of Maxwell House will cost $2.74, up 35 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Procter & Gamble said it will raise the price on a 13-ounce can of Folgers 
instant coffee by 40 cents.  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Ruiz, coffee buyer for Los Angeles-based F. Gavina & Sons, said the 
roaster has already raised prices to its customers, which include wholesalers 
and supermarkets. "We're taking it slow. We're really not sure where it will 
settle," Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee roasters who didn't immediately follow their lead, including giant 
Nestle, said they were watching the market closely. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very clear that prices are going higher and that consumers will have to 
pay more for coffee. But how much more and when is hard to say," said Mary 
Townsend, a coffee buyer at Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee Co.  
</P>
<P>
 The frost is the second jolt to the coffee market in recent months. In May, 
raw coffee prices rose due to shortages in Colombia, the world's No. 2 coffee 
producer, where disease wiped out much of the crop. 
</P>
<P>
 For Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, it is the biggest crop loss 
in 19 years, and it could get worse. Luis Cavalcante, chief meteorologist for 
the national weather service, said a second cold front is expected to send 
temperatures plummeting below zero early next week in the already-ravaged 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the National Coffee Council, an organization of 68 of the biggest 
coffee-growing collectives, were scheduled to meet in Sao Paulo today to piece 
together a strategy to deal with their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Much will depend on the government's willingness and ability to release the 17 
million bags of coffee it has on reserve in 46 warehouses in three southern 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 National manufacturers want to use much of the reserve to keep the nation's 
consumer prices relatively low. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want the prices to shoot up to the roof," said Luis Roberto 
Gonsolvaes, export manager for Cafe do Ponto, Brazil's second-largest coffee 
manufacturer. "It will depend on if the government uses the reserves." 
</P>
<P>
 In monthly auctions, the government has been selling part of its reserves in 
132-pound bags to manufacturers at below-market prices. This month, the 
government nearly doubled the amount available for sale by adding 200,000 bags 
to the load. But the government is limited by congressional mandate to sell 
only 2.8 million bags this year, far below what will be needed to stave off 
high prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, exporters want part of the reserves so they can take advantage of 
the world market's higher coffee prices. Even if the government releases all of 
its exportable coffee, however, the effect will be minimal, says Francisco 
Orique of Flavour Coffee, a trading company. Only 3 million of the bags the 
government currently holds in reserve are of exportable quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil normally produces about 31 million bags of coffee," he said. "We have 
lost between 6 and 10 million bags. There's going to be a huge deficit." 
</P>
<P>
 The freeze couldn't have come at a worse time for Brazil. After a four-year 
price slump that began in 1989 with the collapse of the International Coffee 
Agreement, coffee prices had begun to soar this year due to lower worldwide 
harvests. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as last July, the average world price of a pound of green 
(unroasted) beans stood at 52 cents. By last month, it had jumped to $1.28 a 
pound. Brazil was poised for an estimated $3.5 billion on next year's sales 
after years of averaging about $1.5 billion in coffee exports. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now, even though coffee prices are high, we will come to the market with 
less to sell," said Hercilio Amaral, general secretary of the National Coffee 
Council. The result, he said, is that Brazil could miss out on as much as $1 
billion in exports. 
</P>
<P>
 The question now is how the world's eighth-largest economy -- in particular 
the 7.5 million workers who depend on coffee production and export for their 
livelihood -- will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 If the government can work out a process for releasing the reserves, 
manufacturers say, plants will keep running and workers will keep their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 For those in the field, the cold snap could actually provide a small jump in 
employment. While growers won't be able to harvest the more than 20 million 
plants damaged or destroyed by the frost, they will need even more workers to 
plant new crops and trim the plants that were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 For Brazilians, who consume a third of the coffee the country produces, the 
freeze is -- at least symbolically -- a particularly sour note just days before 
the country is to embark on an economic program to halt spiraling inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The real, a new currency that will be pegged to the dollar, is to be 
introduced Friday in the hope that it will dramatically lower inflation, which 
last month was nearly 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeze is "another thing that will have a negative impact on the country," 
said Denise Cardosa Da Silva, an unemployed schoolteacher.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: BEHIND POLITICAL SMOKE, TOBACCO BIOENGINEERING 
SHINES AS MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As biotech breakthroughs go, Brown & Williamson's controversial efforts to 
genetically engineer a line of high-nicotine tobacco qualified perhaps as 
something out of "The Gang That Couldn't Splice Straight." So what's next? Pork 
genetically packed with extra lipids? Oranges engineered to be free of Vitamin 
C? 
</P>
<P>
 But blow away some of the smoke and what you'll find is an unusual case study 
in successful technology transfer, and a superb example of the role of 
serendipity in promoting biotech innovation. Now, it's probably not wise to 
rely on tobacco companies for medical advice or congressional testimony, but 
when it comes to exploring the market potential of biotechnology, the people 
who make cigarettes are not slow on the draw. 
</P>
<P>
 By sheer happenstance, it turns out that tobacco companies have the inside 
track when it comes to exploiting innovations in plant genetics and 
biotechnology. Why? Because tobacco is the scientific standard. For decades, 
tobacco has been the experimental plant of choice for researchers in the 
biotech community. Everyone who's anyone in plant genetics has done nicotiana 
tobacum . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a mouse," says University of Illinois plant pathologist Paul D. 
Shaw. "Almost everybody uses it one way or another. A lot is known about the 
genetics; it's easy to construct hybrids and crosses and it's a very easy plant 
to grow. The tobacco industry, whenever it has a serious disease problem -- on 
its plants, I mean -- can easily transform the plant and breed other varieties 
for disease resistance. It's just a great plant to manipulate." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tobacco happens to be an excellent plant to work on from a plant-biochemistry 
and -physiology point of view," agrees Howard Brooks, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's associate deputy administrator for plant sciences. "It's 
extremely useful as a model plant system." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, tobacco-based research has won the Nobel Prize: Nearly 60 years ago, 
Rockefeller Institute scientist Wendell Stanley's work crystallizing the 
tobacco mosaic virus offered powerful insight into the structural nature of 
viruses. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, scientists probably knew more about tobacco than any other 
plant in existence. That was the rich research context that would lure the 
tobacco companies into multimillion-dollar partnerships with so many of the 
budding young plant biotech entrepreneurs of the 1980s; it seemed a natural 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the early 1980s, we had already been using tobacco as a model system for 
experiments," recalls DNA Plant Technology's David Evans, the company's vice 
president for business development. "Our interest was more in tissue culture -- 
how to get whole plants from just a few cells -- and what we did worked better 
on tobacco than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we weren't using tobacco strains that were commercially viable. So 
several companies and us, we scratched our heads and said maybe we can make 
money off of this. I didn't have a clue. There was just the idea that there 
might be a marriage there. So companies like Crop Genetics and Calgene and us 
all had deals with tobacco companies in the early 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
 So Crop Genetics and Calgene hooked up with Philip Morris; Plant Genetic 
Systems went with Japan Tobacco. DNA Plant Technology became partner to the 
Louisville, Ky.-based, British American Tobacco-owned Brown & Williamson.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were among the best people we worked with," says Evans, who recalls that 
his company "floundered for a couple of years" trying to figure out which 
collaboration would make the most sense. Brown & Williamson declines to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon after, the tobacco giant came to DNA Plant Technology with a 
high-nicotine plant developed in concert with scientists at North Carolina 
State -- an excellent example of industry-academe collaboration and technology 
transfer -- and the company was able to use its tissue culture biotechnology to 
breed a "better" plant.  
</P>
<P>
 That plant, grown overseas, yielded the potent leaves that were dried and 
cured into Y-1, the high-nicotine "blending" agent that Food and Drug 
Administration chief Dr. David Kessler condemned as an example of improper 
manipulation of cigarette nicotine levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "My view was that we had a technical success, but the company (Brown & 
Williamson) wasn't able to commercially exploit it," Evans says. "A technology 
success, yes; a commercial success, no." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are other routes through which cigarette companies can 
exploit biotechnology for nicotine profit. Much as the National Institutes of 
Health is trying to sequence key portions of the human genome, Philip Morris is 
reportedly trying to map and sequence the vital parts of the tobacco genome: 
just which genetic instructions express themselves in the plant's tar and 
nicotine levels. Like other biotech firms, Philip Morris is trying to patent 
those sequences. It's far too early to say whether these approaches will be any 
more successful than Y-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, however, precisely at the moment when molecular biology and 
agricultural bioengineering assume even greater prominence, tobacco is dying 
out as the experimental plant of choice. Plant molecular biologists are 
flocking to arabodapsis -- a relative of cabbage and canola -- because it grows 
and reproduces faster and has a smaller and easier genetic instruction set than 
tobacco.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it will be used as much as an experimental model anymore," says 
Agriculture's Brooks. "In research, tobacco's best days are behind it." 
</P>
<P>
 But wait! DNA Plant Technology's Evans insists that tobacco still has great 
potential. "Since tobacco grows so fast and is so easy to grow and 
manipulate,it will be used to grow alternative materials," he says. "In five 
years, tobacco could be used as a medium to grow food flavoring and fragrance 
compounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Evans even predicts that tobacco might become a cash crop for 
"pharming" -- plants genetically engineered to contain life-saving 
pharmaceuticals than can be processed after harvest. "I think that would 
attract an awful lot of research," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, perhaps we'll even see a methanol-like subsidy that pays tobacco 
farmers to grow alternative materials just as grain farmers get one to grow 
crops for methanol production. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this the future of tobacco biotechnology? Or is the industry just blowing 
smoke? Don't hold your breath. . . . Sorry.

JAPAN'S ELECTION OF SOCIALIST RAISES THE SPECTER OF TURMOIL; TRADE: TOMIICHI 
MURAYAMA AS NEW PRIME MINISTER ADDS STRAIN TO U.S.-JAPAN RELATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Socialist party leader Tomiichi Murayama's election Wednesday as Japanese 
prime minister places new strains on U.S.-Japan trade relations and may derail 
Tokyo's efforts to carry out economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese business leaders and bureaucrats reacted with alarm to the prospect 
that the new government -- a coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party and the 
Socialists -- may be paralyzed by infighting between conservatives and 
leftists, who joined in an alliance of convenience to oust the reformist 
coalition of outgoing Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
</P>
<P>
 A Murayama Administration will probably be even less accommodating to the 
United States on trade issues and largely unwilling to dismantle regulations 
that protect farmers, retailers and industry from unfettered domestic and 
foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from supporting the interests of farmers and small shopkeepers, the LDP 
and the Socialists share few policies. The LDP was always seen as the 
representative of big business, while the Socialists depend on labor union 
backing. The LDP built up a large nuclear power industry in Japan, while the 
Socialists are anti-nuclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, however, the two parties represent the old, highly regulated Japan, 
and some commentators said Murayama's election means bringing back the old 
system in disguise. "Although Murayama will be prime minister, the Liberal 
Democratic Party will be the core of the Cabinet," said Kosaku Inaba, chairman 
of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. "I'm worried that on fundamental 
things, they won't be able to reach agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, setting the stage for a possible 
standoff on trade issues when President Clinton and Murayama meet in Naples, 
Italy, next week, cautioned against expecting any quick economic breakthroughs 
with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to be careful, cautious, realistic and pragmatic as we deal 
with these Japanese officials under a situation where we face the fourth 
Japanese government in less than a year," Kantor said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern that trade tensions may escalate again helped send the dollar to a 
post-World War II record low. The dollar opened in Tokyo today at a record-low 
98.83 yen, but closed in morning trading up slightly at 99.07 yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Without strong leadership in Tokyo willing to reduce the trade surplus through 
market-opening measures and economic stimulus, many observers see an even 
stronger yen as the key to cutting the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, which hit 
$60 billion last year. A strong yen makes Japanese goods less competitive 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 One area in which Japan's new government might take policy initiatives favored 
by the United States is tax reform and economic stimulus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has been pushing Tokyo to expand domestic 
consumption -- and thereby pull in more foreign goods -- by extending 
indefinitely an income tax cut that so far has been enacted only for this year. 
The Ministry of Finance opposes extending tax cuts without raising consumption 
taxes, but it's possible the politicians could extend the cut without acting on 
consumption taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is more likely, however, that sharp differences between the Socialists and 
powerful Ministry of Finance bureaucrats will merely produce deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama struck a noncommittal tone on economic issues in a news conference 
shortly after his election. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many things requested (of Japan), such as tax reduction and 
deregulation," he said. "I want to research such items sufficiently to 
cooperate internationally." 
</P>
<P>
 Some career civil servants, talking with Japanese reporters Wednesday, made no 
attempt to hide their disdain for the country's new leader, who has never 
before held a post in government. As a member of Parliament, Murayama 
concentrated on pension, welfare and labor issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "What? Mr. Murayama? I'm really surprised. What kind of person is he?" a 
high-ranking Foreign Ministry official, who was not identified by name, said to 
a reporter for Kyodo news service. 
</P>
<P>
 The disrespect appears to be mutual. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Murayama's election, Koken Nosaka, chairman of the Socialist's 
steering committee in the lower house of Parliament, complained bitterly about 
Ministry of Finance officials' opposition to cutting income taxes without a 
firm commitment to raise other taxes. He pledged that under Murayama, 
politicians will fight against such resistance to their policies.

 Bell Atlantic, Nynex Seek Cellular Merger: The two big East Coast telephone 
companies are expected to announce today a plan to merge their wireless 
communications businesses.If approved by regulators, the deal would result in 
the creation of the nation's second-largest cellular phone company and would 
help the two companies challenge AT&T and MCI for nationwide leadership in 
wireless communications. AT&T is seeking to acquire McCaw Cellular, the 
nation's largest cellular firm, while MCI has allied with Nextel 
Communications, which owns valuable wireless licenses. The Bell Atlantic-Nynex 
deal also marks the first time that any of the regional Bell operating 
companies created by the breakup of AT&T have sought a major alliance with one 
another.

OFFICIALS SAY NME-RELATED PROBE STILL ON; HEALTH CARE: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS 
IT IS INVESTIGATING BUSINESSES, INDIVIDUALS. FORMER EXECUTIVES COULD FACE FRAUD 
PROSECUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The U.S. government formally announced Wednesday that it has settled its giant 
fraud case with National Medical Enterprises, but it said it continues a 
far-reaching investigation into individuals and businesses suspected of 
accepting kickbacks and bribes from the Santa Monica-based hospital chain. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the record $379-million settlement at a Washington news 
conference, Justice Department officials said the NME investigation is one of 
about 1,500 health care fraud cases the Clinton Administration is pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let the message be very, very clear: We've made health care fraud a major law 
enforcement priority, and we're going to pursue it as vigorously as we possibly 
can," Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's statement that it is continuing the investigation raises the 
possibility that former high-ranking executives of NME will face prosecution 
for their role in what is perhaps the most massive health fraud scheme ever. 
Earlier this week, a former psychiatric division executive in Dallas pleaded 
guilty to arranging up to $40 million in bribes to doctors and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation largely focused on activities under the management of NME 
co-founders Richard K. Eamer and Leonard Cohen. The two resigned their 
respective positions as chairman and president last year. There is no 
indication, however, that either executive is a target of the federal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice Department source said the continuing investigation may take years 
to complete. "We are talking about a widespread scheme that involved a lot of 
people and a lot of money," said the source, who requested anonymity. "We are 
really just at the beginning of this investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement, which includes a $33-million criminal fine, settles charges 
that NME paid kickbacks and bribes to doctors, referral services and other 
people so they would refer patients to the company's psychiatric and substance 
abuse hospitals in 30 states, then fraudulently billed Medicare, Medicaid and 
other federal programs for those services. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the agreement, NME agreed to pay $324.2 million in civil penalties 
and damages. The remainder of the settlement includes $16.3 million to resolve 
potential claims in 28 states. Government officials said the civil fine settled 
fraud claims in which the company was accused of admitting and treating 
patients unnecessarily, keeping patients hospitalized longer than necessary 
until their medical insurance ran out and billing insurers several times for 
the same service or when no treatment was provided. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the cases that were investigated involved juveniles, a Justice 
Department spokesman said. The government investigation uncovered evidence that 
NME bribed school counselors to send children to psychiatric hospitals, where 
they were held against their will, and paid doctors who agreed to keep patients 
in the hospital longer than necessary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also found evidence that hospital employees used computers to 
track illegal payments to doctors and to measure "how productive" each doctor 
was at providing bogus referrals. "If you fell below the productivity level, 
you would be cut off from the bribes," a department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement requires NME to divest its psychiatric and substance abuse 
hospitals. The company had previously announced plans to sell those operations 
-- and has sold many of them -- but it was not previously known that the 
government had ordered the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 It also requires NME's remaining hospitals and other health services to take 
part in a "corporate integrity plan" to educate employees about fraud and write 
standards of conduct governing company behavior within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, an NME spokeswoman confirmed that the firm will soon announce a 
major layoff involving employees at its corporate headquarters and regional 
offices nationwide. The layoffs are mostly related to the sale of psychiatric 
and rehabilitation hospitals.

 Computer Associates Stung by Exodus: About half the 250 software engineers at 
Alameda-based Ingres Corp. have quit or been fired over issues stemming from 
the company's consolidation into Computer Associates International Inc. The 
exodus was prompted in part by a protest over Computer Associates' denial of 
benefits to unmarried domestic partners of employees and by an employment 
clause barring employees who leave from joining rival software firms, said Eric 
Carlson, former chief executive of ASK Group Inc., Ingres' parent. Computer 
Associates last month agreed to acquire ASK Group for $310 million. The exodus 
includes some of the company's top software designers, and it complicates 
Computer Associates' efforts to absorb the database software company, according 
to analysts and others familiar with Ingres.

 Stock, Bond Fund Cash Flow Improves: Inflows into stock mutual funds increased 
only slightly in May, and the outflow from bond funds shrank, according to the 
Investment Company Institute, the funds' trade group. The institute said net 
new cash flow into stock funds was $11.8 billion in May, compared to $11.3 
billion in April and $9.2 billion in May, 1993.Net new cash flow into bond 
funds was a negative $2.2 billion in May, compared to a negative $4.8 billion 
in April and a positive $10.2 billion in May, 1993. Cash flow figures measure 
new money inflows after accounting for redemptions and exchanges among related 
funds. ICI data show the improvement in stock and bond numbers in May was 
mostly a result of a drop in redemptions, not a rise in new purchases. The 
newsletter Mutual Fund Trim Tabs estimates that in June, stock fund inflows 
have declined from May but that outflows from bond funds have eased further.

 SEC Approves Nasdaq Improvements: The rules are aimed at making the stock 
market a fairer place for individual investors.Securities and Exchange 
Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. said the rules could "change the way 
trading is conducted in the Nasdaq market." One rule would prevent stockbrokers 
from trading ahead of a customer's order, a practice banned by the other major 
stock exchanges. The commission also approved a pilot project aimed at 
eliminating manipulation of stocks through the Wall Street practice known as 
short selling. Nasdaq's trading volume rose 37% to a record 66.5 billion trades 
last year, making it the nation's second-largest market behind the NYSE.

 Sanofi to Sell Winthrop for $450 Million: The drug, cosmetics and perfume unit 
of French oil group Elf Aquitaine said it will sell nearly all of Sterling 
Winthrop's diagnostic imaging business to Norway's Hafslund Nycomed for $450 
million.The sale follows Sanofi's agreement last week to acquire Sterling 
Winthrop, the prescription pharmaceutical business of Rochester, N.Y.-based 
Eastman Kodak, for $1.675 billion. At the time, Sanofi said it would sell 
Sterling Winthrop activities it considered non-strategic, for about $500 
million. Sanofi said in a statement that diagnostic imaging, which involves the 
production and sale of contrast agents used in radiology by hospitals, clinics 
and radiologists, is not the sort of business it wants to engage in.

 Machinists Union Sued Over UAL Buyout Role: A class-action suit filed in U.S. 
District Court in Chicago asks for a new vote by the union's members on 
participating in the proposed $4.9-billion employee buyout of UAL Corp., United 
Airlines' parent company.UAL shareholders are scheduled to vote on the proposal 
July 12. The suit contends that an earlier vote approving the buyout was taken 
before union members had time to fully understand details of the plan and that 
"many provisions were not clearly explained." Some shareholders previously sued 
UAL seeking to stop the buyout. A hearing on that suit is set for Wednesday in 
Delaware.

 Union Carbide Corp. Sells Smog Credits: The company's plant in Torrance became 
the first major participant in the state's controversial Regional Clean Air 
Incentives Market program, under which companies are given pollution credits 
that may be sold.State officials said the plant sold 3.4 million credits -- 
$1.2-million worth -- last week to Anchor Glass Container Corp., a private 
company in Huntington Park. A credit gives the owner the right to emit a pound 
of nitrogen oxide. The program, launched in October, aims to reduce total 
allowable emissions in coastal Southern California by 80% by the year 2010. An 
auction designed to handle high trading volume has twice been postponed for 
lack of demand.

ECONOMY GREW SOLIDLY, IF MORE SLOWLY, IN EARLY '94

 Led by surprisingly strong consumer spending, the economy grew solidly during 
the harsh winter of 1994, but at only about half the booming pace of the end of 
last year, the Commerce Department said Wednesday in a revised report. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the solid but unspectacular growth probably carried over to the 
current quarter before higher interest rates fully take hold to force a 
slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
 A final revision of quarterly gross domestic product shows economic output 
expanded at a 3.4% annual rate from January through March, up from estimates of 
3% last month and 2.6% originally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed at how resilient the economy was in the first quarter despite the 
weather and the California earthquake," said economist Sung Won Sohn of Norwest 
Corp. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the important thing is that the last hurrah for the economy is behind us. 
We are beginning to see some telltale signs of a slowdown," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration welcomed the latest report. "It continues to 
underscore our belief that we have stable economic growth with low inflation," 
White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 GDP, which measures the total value of goods and services produced in the 
United States, rose at a sizzling 7% rate in the final quarter of last year. 
For all of 1993, growth was 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although expansion has eased dramatically this year, the latest figures show 
Americans continuing to spend at a robust pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest revision in first-quarter GDP was caused by an additional $5.6 
billion in consumer spending and $2.3 billion in business investment, more than 
offsetting declines in government spending and exports. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't fundamentally change my view that the strength of the economy is 
dissipating somewhat," said economist Christopher Probyn of DRI-McGraw Hill, a 
forecasting service in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the data could lead the Federal Reserve Board and Chairman Alan 
Greenspan to tighten credit further. 
</P>
<P>
 The sizzling expansion in the last three months of 1993 -- the largest in a 
decade -- prompted the Fed to raise short-term interest rates four times this 
year to head off inflation.

HOMEOWNERSHIP RISING, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lower housing costs and renewed income growth will soon drive U.S. 
homeownership to an all-time high, according to a study released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeownership has been on the rise for most age groups, a reversal of the 
downward spiral of the 1980s, says the annual Ford Foundation-sponsored study 
produced by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
 Demographic trends, including the aging of the baby boom generation and 
immigrants' movement into the economic mainstream, should support strong 
home-buying potential throughout the rest of the 1990s, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not since the 1950s has single-family demand so dominated the housing 
market," said H. James Brown, the center's director. "The ingredients are in 
place to lift the national homeownership rate to an all-time high by the year 
2000."

SPECIAL HOLIDAY FARES PROVING POPULAR; AIRLINES: TRAVEL AGENTS SAY DEMAND IS 
HEAVY -- AND THE SEATS FEW -- FOR $149 ROUND-TRIP TICKETS TO THE EAST COAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Passengers were snapping up cut-rate airline tickets Wednesday after Delta Air 
Lines initiated a holiday fare war that allows passengers to fly coast-to-coast 
for $149 round trip -- as long as they leave Saturday evening and come back 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which was quickly matched by other major carriers, is aimed at 
filling seats during the slack periods of the busy holiday weekend, a Delta 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers must depart after 6 p.m. Saturday and catch returns leaving before 
midnight Monday. The deal applies to most of the 155 destinations that Delta 
serves directly, including Los Angeles, Ontario and Orange County. It does not 
include cities that can be reached only by the airline's commuter service. 
</P>
<P>
 Round-trip fares are $99 on flights up to 500 miles; $129 on flights from 501 
to 1,000 miles and $149 on longer flights. The non-refundable tickets are good 
for only a limited number of seats on flights. Advance purchase is not 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fares are offered in such a way as they don't compete with our other 
fares," Delta spokesman Clay McConnell said. "They fill seats that would go 
unfilled." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Howard, an airline economics consultant in Washington, said that even 
though airlines typically raise fares during the summer, when vacation travel 
is brisk, seats often go unfilled during the latter part of three-day holiday 
weekends. The late-Saturday-to-Monday offer is a way to remedy that. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta first tried such holiday discounts on Christmas Day last year. They were 
such a hit that the carrier repeated the offer for New Year's Day. A similar 
deal on Memorial Day, McConnell said, brought the airline an additional $2 
million in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Thom Nulty, president of Associated Travel Management in Santa Ana, said the 
fares are so low that they are drawing some people who simply want to ride in 
an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Memorial Day promotion, Nulty said, one of his travel agency's 
clients flew to Chicago to have dinner with his mother and requested that he be 
booked on short-haul flights. "He even had a four-hour layover in Butte, 
Montana," Nulty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Requests by travelers for the few low-fare seats available, however, have 
swamped some travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tami Truong, manager of Colby Travel in West Los Angeles, said she has had 
difficulty booking the cheap seats. "All airlines are sold out," she said 
Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Some potential passengers get angry, she said, when they learn how limited the 
promotion is. She had to tell one customer seeking a $149 round-trip ticket to 
New York that the next-cheapest seat available would cost $1,386. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a good fare," she said.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS / EXECUTIVE TRAVEL: SPOTLIGHT ON GERMANY; THE GERMAN 
ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Researched by KAREN KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the midst of western Europe's worst recession since the end of World War 
II, Germany is struggling with slack demand at home and abroad, high labor 
costs and the huge expense of unification with the former East Germany. The 
Economy 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the western German economy shrunk 1.9 percent, the largest drop in 
the postwar era. Nationwide, gross national product fell 1.3 percent from 1992 
to 1993. Unemployment has ballooned to a postwar high of 10.5%. Despite calls 
to help Europe's ailing economies, Germany's influential central bank has 
pursued a tight money policy and has cautiously reduced interest rates to avoid 
a surge in inflation. East-West Union 
</P>
<P>
 The unification of West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany) and East Germany 
(German Democratic Republic) in October 1990 joined one of the world's richest 
countries with one of Europe's poorest. Today, western Germany is still far 
more prosperous, with eastern Germany accounting for only about 7 percent of 
the total German economy. Since unification, eastern Germany has survived 
mainly on subsidies from the west -- totaling nearly $100 billion a year and 
more than 7,000 people migrate from east to west every month. Labor Force 
</P>
<P>
 German workers are among the world's most literate and highly skilled. The 
literacy rate is 99 percent. German law requires 12 years of compulsory 
schooling beginning at age 6. One third of German teens spend high school in 
vocational training while working part time as apprentices. Labor Costs 
</P>
<P>
 German wages have been rising faster than those of other major industrial 
nations and nearly twice as fast as Germany's own industrial output. From 1985 
to 1993, unionized workers' real hourly wages grew 23%, but growth in output 
grew 12%. In comparison, real wages in the United States fell 8.5% for the 
period. Trade 
</P>
<P>
 France is Germany's biggest trading partner, accounting for 12 percent of 
imports and 13 percent of exports in 1991. More than half of all German imports 
and exports are traded with fellow members of the European Union. Germany's 
principal imports and exports are machinery and transport equipment, 
manufactured goods and chemical products. Manufacturing 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly one in three Germans is employed in manufacturing, the country's most 
important sector. Germany is the world's third-largest car exporter, behind 
Japan and the United States. The country also produces transport equipment, 
non-electrical machinery, metals and metal products and chemical products. 
Total exports from Germany totaled more than $400 billion in 1992. Natural 
Resources 
</P>
<P>
 Germany has substantial deposits of hard coal, lignite, a low-grade soft brown 
coal, and salt. Copper, tin and nickel ores and potash salts are also mined. 
Western Germany mined 178 million metric tons of coal and 3.4 million metric 
tons of crude petroleum in 1991. Mining employs about 1 percent of the German 
work force and accounted for about 3 percent of GDP in 1991.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS / EXECUTIVE TRAVEL: SPOTLIGHT 
ON GERMANY; STAYING ON THE MARK IN GERMANY

<P>
 Business travel in Germany is increasing as more foreign investors look for 
ways to capitalize on the developing economy in its eastern regions, as well as 
those in other Eastern European countries. Here are some suggestions for making 
business trips to Germany go smoothly. Getting There 
</P>
<P>
 A number of U.S. and international airlines fly to Germany from Los Angeles. 
American flies through Chicago or Dallas-Ft. Worth to Munich, Dusseldorf and 
Frankfurt. Delta connects through Atlanta, New York or Cincinnati to Hamburg, 
Berlin, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Munich. Northwest flies through Boston or 
Detroit to Berlin or Frankfurt, or passengers can connect through Amsterdam and 
fly KLM to Frankfurt, Berlin, Dusseldorf and Hamburg. TWA connects through New 
York en route to Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Lufthansa, the German airline, flies direct daily from Los Angeles to 
Frankfurt, and the airline shares flights with Lauda Air, an Austrian carrier, 
on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays to fly directly to Munich. Another German 
airline, LTU, also flies direct from Los Angeles to Dusseldorf and Munich on 
Mondays and Thursdays. Frankfurt is the hub for trips to most of the country's 
smaller cities. Getting Around 
</P>
<P>
 Within Germany, both Lufthansa and LTU operate frequent flights among all 
major cities. If you'd rather take a train, Lufthansa runs the Lufthansa 
Express among Dusseldorf, Cologne, Bonn and Frankfurt exclusively for its 
ticket holders. (Baggage is automatically transferred between plane and train 
at the airport.) 
</P>
<P>
 German Railways operates a discounted "Rail and Fly" service connecting cities 
with 14 German airports. German Railways, one of the most extensive train 
systems in Europe, also connects all major cities in western Germany. In 
addition, high-speed express trains connect Hamburg to Frankfurt and Munich.  
</P>
<P>
 Driving in Germany can be an unsettling experience for Americans. Most Germans 
drive faster, particularly on the autobahns, where there's no speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
 For those renting a car, an international driver's permit is recommended but 
not required. However, you must have proof of liability insurance to drive, so 
double-check that it is included in your rental policy. National (known as 
InterRent and Europcar), Avis, Hertz, Thrifty, Dollar Rent a Car (known as 
Eurodollar Rent a Car,) and Budget operate in Germany. When getting quotes, 
remember that the figure will not include a 15% value-added tax. 
</P>
<P>
 For travel within cities, most business travelers prefer to take cabs. 
</P>
<P>
 It is customary to tip the driver by rounding up to the nearest full mark (or 
about 10%). In addition, expect to pay 50 pfennigs for each piece of luggage 
you carry. Money 
</P>
<P>
 German currency is based on the deutsche mark, which equals 100 pfennigs. 
Banks and bank-operated exchange booths at airports and railroad stations 
usually offer the best exchange rates. Hotels, stores and private exchange 
firms will charge more for the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveler's checks are widely accepted in all but the smallest cities or rural 
areas. Now that cash machines are proliferating throughout Europe, you may be 
able to get money through an international network such as Cirrus or Plus. If 
you use a credit card, the issuers typically charge 1% to convert a foreign 
purchase into a dollar amount. Telephones 
</P>
<P>
 The phone system was updated in 1992 and is now fully automated throughout the 
country. To reach an operator for an international call, dial 0010.  
</P>
<P>
 Avoid making international calls from a hotel room, however, since you'll be 
charged double or triple the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 Post offices have special booths for international calls, or you can make 
calls from public phones that say "Inlands und Auslandsgesprache." You can buy 
a phone debit card from most newsstands or post offices, for use in most public 
phones. If you purchase a phone card for 50 marks, for example, you can make 60 
marks worth of calls with it.  
</P>
<P>
 AT&T, MCI and Sprint have special services that will help you avoid hotel 
surcharges. Computers 
</P>
<P>
 German wall outlets require plugs with two round prongs rather than the two 
flat prongs that are standard in the United States, so an adapter is needed. 
Any appliance will also require a converter to operate on Germany's 220-volt 
circuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Older laptop computers may require a special transformer to operate in 
Germany. Newer models have built-in sensors that can operate with only the 
adapter plug. 
</P>
<P>
 If your computer was not made in the United States, make sure you register it 
with U.S. customs upon leaving to avoid paying an import tax. If it is 
American, check with the German Consulate to see whether it should be 
registered upon entering. Hotels 
</P>
<P>
 Although more business-class accommodations now have rooms with private baths, 
many hotels still have shared bathrooms, so make sure to request a room with a 
private bath if you want one. Remember that many German hotels do not provide 
soap. Tipping 
</P>
<P>
 For luggage, it is customary to tip a hotel porter about 2 marks per bag. In 
restaurants, service charges are included in the bill. "Tipping is not as 
strict as it is here," says Uwe Petri, a spokesman for the German Consulate in 
Los Angeles. "Only give a tip if you are very satisfied with the service." If 
you do choose to tip, give it directly to the person who waited on you; do not 
leave it on the table. Safety 
</P>
<P>
 Germany has a low violent-crime rate, according to the U.S. State Department. 
As in most countries, pickpocketing and purse snatching are most likely to 
occur in crowded urban areas.  
</P>
<P>
 When in Germany, you can get updated information on crime and security by 
calling the U.S. Embassy's toll-free, 24-hour hot line: 0130-826364.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS / EXECUTIVE TRAVEL: SPOTLIGHT ON GERMANY; WHEN DOING 
BUSINESS THERE . . .

<P>
 Business practices in Germany, a member of the Group of Seven industrialized 
nations, are similar to customs in the United States. But there are some legal, 
practical and cultural variations. DO: 
</P>
<P>
 * Expect German businessmen to speak and understand English. Although German 
is the official language, members of the international business community are 
invariably fluent in English, in addition to having a good command of at least 
one other foreign language. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be prepared to start your business day at 8 a.m. Generally, the workday ends 
at 5 p.m., but many businesses close early on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check to see which holidays are observed in the area you are visiting. 
Germany has 16 legal holidays a year, but not all are recognized in all parts 
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be punctual for appointments. In Germany, there is no such thing as 
"fashionably late," even for social functions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allow a third person to introduce you to people with whom you wish to have a 
business relationship. Germans prefer to meet strangers through another person 
rather than introducing themselves directly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Familiarize yourself with European Union regulations and procedures. Many 
aspects of German business, including international trade, are regulated by EU 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider investing in eastern Germany. The German government offers 
substantial incentives for moving capital into almost any sector of the 
depressed eastern German economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hire German legal and tax advisers at an early stage when forming a new 
business venture. Where you locate and the legal structure of your business 
will influence your overall tax burden. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apply for a residence permit if you plan to stay in Germany for longer than 
three months. A temporary residence permit may be obtained once you get there. 
DON'T: 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't bother to get a visa if you will be staying less than three months. 
Since the United States is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
your U.S. passport will suffice when visiting Germany on business. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't count on government offices being open in the afternoon. They are 
typically open to the public between 8:30 a.m. and noon. However, you may make 
an afternoon appointment in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't expect American banking hours. German banks are typically open from 9 
a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2:30 to 4 p.m. during the week. Some remain open longer 
on Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't write dates in the American order of month, day, year. The traditional 
German order is day, month, year, but many government offices and others follow 
the European Union style of year, month, day. For example, today's date would 
be written as 1994.06.30. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't expect special treatment as a foreign investor. The German government 
has no special programs to encourage foreign investment. Foreign companies 
receive the same benefits as domestic firms and are subject to the same 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't wait to be seated when dining at a German restaurant. Except in the 
most formal of restaurants, there are no hosts or hostesses to greet and seat 
you.

LONE STAR STEAKHOUSE CHAIN REALLY SIZZLING; RESTAURANTS: WICHITA PIZZA 
ENTREPRENEUR'S RESEARCH FOUND THAT WHILE BEEF CONSUMPTION WAS DOWN AT HOME, 
PEOPLE STILL WANT A GOOD STEAK WHEN THEY GO OUT TO EAT. HIS BUSINESS IS 
BOOMING. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It may be known for beef, but fast-growing Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon Inc. 
had its beginnings in pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 The steakhouse chain, which has expanded from eight restaurants to 75 in just 
three years, dates back to 1989, when Wichita native Jamie Coulter considered 
taking his 100 Pizza Hut franchises public. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coulter and his managers couldn't add enough Pizza Hut franchises to 
expand as they wanted. And when the Steak and Ale chain of Dallas was put up 
for sale, Coulter and his team started thinking beef. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here was a 150-unit chain doing $1.7 million per restaurant and they hadn't 
even reinvested to keep the concept fresh," said John D. White, Lone Star's 
chief financial officer. Steak and Ale and sister chain Bennigan's were 
eventually sold to a management-led investor group. 
</P>
<P>
 But a little research showed Coulter and his team that a reported drop in beef 
consumption that had spanned several years was mostly in home cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 When people went to a restaurant, they still wanted a good steak. 
</P>
<P>
 So Coulter had a talk with a longtime friend in North Carolina who said he'd 
converted one of his restaurants to a Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon, which was 
booming. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have taken us 12 to 18 months to refine our own concept and get it 
to the point the founders already were with Lone Star," said S. Douglas 
Glendenning, Lone Star's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Coulter joined forces with the North Carolina outfit and the new Lone Star was 
off and running. 
</P>
<P>
 With Coulter as chairman and chief executive, Lone Star grew rapidly. Last 
year, profits tripled to $14.9 million, or 46 cents per share, compared with 
$4.7 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales surged to $95.8 million in 1993 from $33.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Lone Star's steakhouse and saloon atmosphere includes a deli case full of 
steaks, cut by hand each day, and a mesquite-fired grill with a sign that 
encourages patrons to, "Take a look. Watch it cook." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiters and waitresses at Lone Star restaurants wear "Don't Mess with Texas" 
T-shirts. Customers are served buckets of peanuts as they wait and are 
encouraged to throw the shells on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like to do that," said White. "You don't get to do it at home. Maybe 
that's the allure." 
</P>
<P>
 Checks average $16 to $18 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Lone Star's restaurants are in the upper Midwest, with some in the 
deep South and the mid-Atlantic states. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're opening 45 more this year and another 45 next year," said Ron 
Tartaro, an investment analyst at Fred Alger Management in San Diego. "In 
excess of 50% growth? Nobody that's as big as Lone Star is doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 The company went public on the Nasdaq stock market in 1991, raising $16.5 
million in its initial stock offering and another $120 million in subsequent 
offerings. Lone Star has used the funds to fuel its growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The management had been working as a team at least 10 years prior to that," 
Tartaro said. "They had experience opening up a great many Pizza Huts in a 
short period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendenning cited various systems for measuring performance that have allowed 
Lone Star to keep its expansion on track. He said information is the key. 
</P>
<P>
 Every morning he and other top executives review a so-called flash report that 
contains daily meal counts, net sales, week-to-date sales, labor costs and 
other information on each of the 75 restaurants. Beef, which makes up 80% of 
each restaurant's sales, is inventoried daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to tweak and tune," White said. "We're always looking at how to 
do something better."

 MEXICAN STOCKS

<P>
 * The market staged a modest rally Wednesday as kidnapers released banker 
Alfredo Harp Helu. The Bolsa index gained 38.20 points to 2,270.93.Harp, head 
of Banamex-Accival, was freed for a $30-million ransom. For now, investors are 
happier about his release than they are worried about the huge ransom, which 
could encourage more abductions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Given the market's sharp decline last week, bargain hunters also may have 
been encouraged Wednesday as yields on one-month T-bills fell to 15.84%, the 
lowest since April 13. Many analysts see a strong chance that Mexican interest 
rates will plunge after the Aug. 21 election.

 The Dominican economy has had little growth in recent years, in part because 
of a slowdown in mining and agriculture. The nation, which shares the island of 
Hispaniola with Haiti, has been plagued by double-digit unemployment and a huge

BRIEFCASE: BANKING; DOWNEY BRANCHES OUT WITH A BUY-SELL EXPANSION STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With a new president and a mandate to increase its size, Downey Savings & Loan 
wants to do the same thing that one of its neighbors has been doing with great 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach thrift, with extra cash to spend, is looking to acquire 
branches that are located near its own 52-branch network so it can move the 
deposits to its own offices, then close the branches it acquires. 
</P>
<P>
 That would give Downey a more efficient network with a greater volume of 
deposits and no new office buildings to maintain or lease. The thrift also 
would likely take on many of the employees from the branches it buys. 
</P>
<P>
 American Savings Bank in Irvine has used that strategy well, especially in 
assuming the deposits from failed thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was only natural for Downey to raid American's talent pool to find 
William Bridges to help it launch its strategy. Bridges was senior vice 
president for retail banking at American Savings, in charge of 114 branches and 
involved in branch acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges joined Downey two weeks ago as its director of retail banking, a 
position vacant since last August. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to build our franchise quickly and effectively," said Stephen W. 
Prough, who started work last week as Downey's new president and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides buying existing branches, he said, the thrift will generate more 
deposits from its market, buy branches from failed thrifts and even build new 
branches, though most financial institutions shy away from new construction 
because of the cost.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: BANKS GIVE REIT $150-MILLION LINE OF CREDIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irvine Apartment Communities, a real estate investment trust, has obtained a 
$150-million credit line from a group of banks to fund construction of five new 
apartment projects in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sign that banks' confidence is back.This is good news for the 
economy," said Richard E. Moran, executive vice president with Irvine Apartment 
Communities in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The new apartment complexes, one of which is already under construction, will 
add 2,200 apartments to the company's portfolio. Three buildings will be 
located in Irvine, one in Tustin and one in the upscale Newport Coast 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co., Orange County's largest landowner, spun off its apartment 
properties last year to create the Irvine Apartment Communities REIT in a 
$200-million public stock offering. The REIT portfolio currently includes 43 
apartment complexes with more than 11,300 apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the company obtained a $50-million credit line from the 
same group of banks.

 Chapman General Hospital: Officials said Wednesday they will begin a 
$10-million expansion this summer to double the number of its operating rooms 
and intensive-care beds, and add some facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, a for-profit hospital owned by OrNda HealthCorp in Nashville, Tenn., 
said the expansion is intended to meet increased demand for patients seeking 
preventive medicine and specialty surgeries. The 104-bed Orange hospital said 
it will continue to operate during the expansion, which is expected to be 
completed in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 A hospital spokesman said Pepper West of Irvine will be the general contractor 
of the project, scheduled to begin in early July.

NEW INGRAM MICRO UNIT TO HANDLE HIGH-VOLUME SALES; COMPUTERS: THE CREATION OF 
THE SUBSIDIARY COULD MEAN THE ADDITION OF AT LEAST 50 JOBS AT FIRM'S SANTA ANA 
HEADQUARTERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Computer distributor Ingram Micro Inc. said Wednesday it will create a 
subsidiary to handle high-volume computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it expects the new unit to have annual revenue of $1 billion 
within a year and that its creation could mean the addition of at least 50 jobs 
at its Santa Ana headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidiary, which will start in August, will be called Ingram Alliance 
Reseller Co. Instead of focusing on Ingram's regular computer wholesale 
business, the new unit will specialize in selling computers to large retailers 
known as resellers, which repackage computer equipment with custom software. 
</P>
<P>
 David Dukes, co-chairman of Santa Ana-based Ingram Micro, said the new 
business will let Ingram Micro compete with so-called aggregators -- large 
resellers such as the Intelligent Electronics computer store chain. Such 
retailers, which have invaded the turf of distributors, order such large 
volumes of computers from manufacturers that they can get wholesale prices and 
distribute their goods to other computer resellers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ingram Alliance's mission is to provide resellers with a one-stop source for 
all of their product and service needs," said Doug Antone, a former executive 
at software firm Borland International who will serve as president of the new 
unit, which also will be based in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Dukes noted that Ingram Micro's conventional business -- distributing computer 
equipment to a wide variety of computer sellers -- is suffering from an 
ever-increasing squeeze on profits as PC prices fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram Alliance will offer large volumes of name-brand computer equipment at 
discount prices that otherwise aren't available in its general distribution 
business. It could also boost profits by charging fees for services such as 
configuring computers for custom settings, financing computer leases and 
providing technical support.

 No Deposit, No Return: Two financially troubled local banks -- CommerceBank in 
Newport Beach and Pioneer Bank in Fullerton -- revealed this week that they 
were having a tough time raising money to rescue their institutions, but that 
isn't stopping investors from putting money into other financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of Orange County, a small Fountain Valley bank, recently raised nearly 
$2.8 million from its directors and large shareholders to make it one of the 
area's stronger institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-branch operation wants to use the extra cash to buy a second office in 
the area, said Harvey Ferguson, the bank's president. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see signs of things picking up," Ferguson said, "though it's picking up 
more in the business sector than in the real estate sector." 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes that, with a loss of more than $200,000 expected this quarter, the 
bank can begin to post profits the rest of the year. It lost $442,000 last year 
and about $200,000 in this year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Being cautious, Ferguson said he is socking more money away in reserve to 
protect against possible loan losses in the future, an action that is causing 
the losses. But the bank is profitable every month on an operating basis.

 Preferred Provider: Orange National Bank, responding to the crash in mortgage 
refinancing, is beefing up its business lending instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank, based in Orange, has become a preferred lender under the U.S. Small 
Business Administration.That means it can make loans to small companies without 
first going to the SBA for approval to have 70% of it insured by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank, which began its SBA lending department in 1991, should now be able 
to speed up the approval process for business loans, said its president, 
Kenneth J. Cosgrove. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Orange National closed its mortgage brokerage subsidiary, ONB 
Mortgage Corp. and dismantled its mortgage banking division. Cosgrove said the 
boom in home loan refinancings went bust and sales of homes have not increased.

TOWERING TECHNOLOGY OF PAGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You call someone's pager and it beeps. Simple. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting the call to the pager is a technological achievement of towering 
proportions -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose you need to reach your spouse somewhere within the area covered by 
your local paging service. You dial your spouse's pager, a local telephone 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 The call is answered by the paging service company's computer. You punch in 
your phone number and hang up. The computer relays the information to a radio 
transmitter, which sends it to a local radio tower, which broadcasts it on the 
sliver of radio wave band reserved for your spouse's pager. The pager beeps and 
displays your phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 For regional and nationwide paging, the signal is sent into outer space to be 
bounced off a satellite and broadcast throughout the service area. 
</P>
<P>
 Alphanumeric paging -- words and numbers -- requires human intervention. The 
caller either types the message into a computer attached to a phone line or 
speaks with an operator who does the typing. 
</P>
<P>
 It can take as little as 15 seconds to transmit a phone number. Alphanumeric 
messages take longer, but not usually more than three minutes.

 An insistent sound from Allen Gordon's waist identifies him as part of a new 
movement in American society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beepbeepbeep." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the pager on his belt, telling the 30-year-old shipping clerk a buddy 
wants to go out for a beer or his girlfriend wants him to come home. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows it's not his boss because he doesn't know Gordon's pager number. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something goes wrong at work, they can call me at home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beepers aren't just for business any more. The little clip-on radio receivers, 
once the badges of service workers and professionals on call, are now marketed 
as communication tools for the masses.

 Motorola Inc., the largest manufacturer, predicts U.S. pager subscribers, 
currently about 19 million, will rise to 30 million by 1997 and 50 million by 
the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people forced to carry beepers for work consider them a pain. 
Technocritics call them strangling electronic leashes. But those who get 
beepers mainly for personal use -- about half of new subscribers, according to 
the Washington-based research firm Economic and Management Consultants Inc. -- 
say their beepers set them free. 
</P>
<P>
 Their spreading popularity is partly due to a multimillion-dollar industry 
campaign promoting beepers as a way for busy people to stay in touch with 
friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Motorola's pagers answer everyone's needs," the company boasts in a pamphlet 
that lists 100 possible beeper uses. ("When the baby sitter needs to reach you 
when you're out." "The golf course can notify you when your tee time is 
ready.") 
</P>
<P>
 Pagerman, a character in a Motorola comic-and-coloring book, tells readers: 
"Remember, kids -- pagers are the best way to stay in touch with the people you 
love." 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers and twentysomethings need no convincing. Colorful, affordable, 
available at malls and simple to operate, beepers are hip accouterments among 
the young. Marketers say people 35 or younger account for up to 80% of retail 
pager sales, a booming business that barely existed before 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of beepers' appeal for some is a gritty urban cachet derived from their 
use by drug dealers, an association the pager industry and parents detest. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-year-old Lila, who wouldn't give her last name, said she's on her third 
pager in two years. Her parents keep taking them away. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother thinks it's for drug dealers," sighs Lila, who uses her beeper to 
communicate with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 While kids are prohibited from wearing pagers in many schools for the same 
reason, some districts concede their usefulness. The school board in Manassas, 
Va., banned them last fall but makes exceptions for emergencies such as a 
student with a critically ill parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Busch's Seafood Restaurant in Delray Beach, Fla., is one of a growing number 
of eateries that hand pagers out to customers waiting for tables. Diners can 
visit nearby stores and still be reached when their tables are ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought it was a little strange at first. Now they're so common it's not 
a novelty," says Audra Branscombe, the restaurant's secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiters at La Casita restaurant in Milwaukee carry soundless vibrating pagers 
that tell them their orders are up. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Marks, co-owner with his father, Al, of a chain of pager stores in 
Chicago-area malls, said a customer bought a pair of beepers for his 4-year-old 
twins so he could page them in from the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Patti Edstrom of Elk Grove, Calif., uses her pager to stay informed about the 
blood-sugar levels of her diabetic 4-year-old daughter. The baby-sitter relays 
any unusual readings to Edstrom at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Her story won the $1,000 grand prize in an industry-sponsored contest to find 
novel uses for beepers. Among the other entries: a man whose martial arts 
instructor sends him codes that tell him which exercises to practice, and a man 
who put a beeper on his dog's collar to call the pooch home. 
</P>
<P>
 A basic pager is smaller than a cigarette pack and costs less than $100 plus a 
monthly service charge starting around $10. A caller dials the pager number and 
punches in his or her own phone number. The pager then beeps or silently 
vibrates and displays the phone number the wearer should call. 
</P>
<P>
 Costlier models display both words and numbers. Paging services also offer 
voice mail, which allows the caller to leave a recorded message that the pager 
subscriber can retrieve. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers face a dazzling array of pagers. Motorola, based in the Chicago 
suburb of Schaumburg, offers its Lifestyle Plus and Bravo Express units in a 
rainbow of colors like Bimini Blue, Totally Teal and Ultraviolet. 
</P>
<P>
 Users can choose plastic or leather holsters to protect their pagers and buy 
gold chains to secure them. 
</P>
<P>
 A Swatch wristwatch pager introduced in the United States this spring is 
selling phenomenally well, said Amy Edelson, a spokeswoman for the Swiss 
watchmaker.

PCS EVOLVING INTO INFORMATION FURNACES; TECHNOLOGY: EXPERTS PREDICT COMPUTERS 
ARE EVOLVING INTO CONTROL CENTERS, LINKING THE TELEPHONE, TV, THERMOSTAT AND 
OTHER HOUSEHOLD ELECTRONIC DEVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the metaphor-mad world of technology, there's a new phrase making the 
rounds, one that experts believe describes the direction that personal 
computers are taking. 
</P>
<P>
 After 20 years as an independent box, the PC is evolving into a control center 
that ties together the phone, TV, thermostat and other electronic devices in 
every room in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 An information furnace, they call it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's equivalent to central heating," said Avram Miller, Intel's vice 
president of corporate business development. "This analogy with power is very 
good. If you look at electricity, electricity was designed to do only one thing 
-- lighting. Clearly, there's a lot more to it than that now." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a furnace, the PC of the future could be hidden from view, in the 
basement, a closet or drawer. The devices it links would take different shapes 
depending on their use and location. A unit in the den might have a keyboard 
and screen while one in the living room might be a big screen with stereo 
speakers and a player for programs on compact disc. 
</P>
<P>
 The incorporation of telephone-answering machines into consumer PCs last 
summer was an early example of this trend, which will be a key topic at the 
annual PC Expo this week at New York's Jacob Javits Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel CEO Andrew Grove has titled his keynote speech for the show "The 
Ubiquitous Information Appliance." 
</P>
<P>
 The acceleration of the trend is important for Intel to drive demand for 
advances in its key product -- the microprocessor or "brain" of a PC. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell Inc. earlier this month rolled out PCs with built-in TV and radio 
receivers as well as phone answering and fax capabilities. With them, a 
technician played a Bach compact disc, the radio and TV and worked on a 
word-processing program simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just today's electronic items that could be hooked up but those on 
the drawing board of technologists and inventors. Last week, Timex Corp. and 
Microsoft Corp. even demonstrated a watch that can take in messages from a 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the devices that's interesting, we call it an I-pad, an information 
pad," Miller said. "It would be a device that has a flat-panel screen. You can 
write on it, touch it. You might be able to speak into it and it might speak 
back. It would be wireless, cheap and have different forms in the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Some early forms of an "I-pad" are Apple Computer Inc.'s Newton, Motorola 
Inc.'s Envoy and IBM's Simon devices, which have both computing and 
communication features. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will see all kinds of combinations be possible," said Safi Qureshey, 
chief executive of AST Research Inc. in Irvine. "We want to provide the glue so 
the user can go in between all of these different access mechanisms." 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of a computer network in the home is rooted in the workplace. 
Portable computers, for instance, linked to the main one in an office are 
allowing more people to work at home or on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same technologies are going to be used in the home environment," said 
Alan Soucy, vice president of mobile computers at Zenith Data Systems. "They're 
going to be repackaged, more specific, more like an appliance." 
</P>
<P>
 The vision isn't just Intel's or the computer industry's. At a cable TV trade 
show last month, General Instrument Corp., the leading maker of set-top channel 
controls, described a plan for "component" TVs built around a computer-like 
box. The monitor -- which in time will be a flat panel screen -- and game 
player, video recorder or telephone would all be separate pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly how much it all gets centralized in one place, I'm a little hard 
pressed to predict right now," said Jeff Roman, vice president of technology 
and new business development for General Instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 The first personal computer sold to the general public, the Altair 8800, 
appeared in Popular Electronics magazine in December, 1974. It was a box of 
circuits and lights that cost about $250 but had no software or screen and 
required 50 commands, executed by flipping switches, just to get started. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the most popular PCs take just a few minutes to set up, have dozens of 
megabytes of software already installed, and can link through a phone line to 
millions of others worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Very few people anticipated the computers of today in 1974. Even fewer know 
what to expect in another two decades. Something as futuristic as an 
information furnace, while still vague, is probably only a decade away. There 
is certainty in the industry only about the next year or two. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not possible to conceive 20 years from now," said Intel's Miller. "The 
computers of 20 years from now will probably be 10,000 times more powerful than 
they are today."

FAUX PAS REPORT: LOAFERS ARE A STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION -- CASUAL 
</P>

 Even guys who you think have at least a decent sense of fashion can be seen 
doing this. They show up for a party after work still wearing their office 
slacks, and they've thrown on a pair of tennis shoes for comfort. Keeping your 
slacks on is OK, but the shoes? 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of guys have their dress shoes for the office and athletic shoes for 
the weekend with nothing in between," says Tom Fuller of Fuller's for Men & 
Women in Dana Point. "They may think they're making some kind of fashion 
statement, but when you show up at a nice reception in tennis shoes, I don't 
think it sends the right message." 
</P>
<P>
 A good in-between shoe is a casual loafer or other slip-on, even a deck shoe. 
It should be lightweight and of a neutral color to go with a variety of 
outfits.  
</P>
<P>
 If you're not sure if the event you're going to is "nice" casual, be sure to 
keep your loafers in the back seat just in case. 
</P>

 Stripe slights: Talk about a mixed message: What else would you call wearing a 
blue, big-striped blouse with black, pin-striped pants? Lots of women have been 
seen combining stripes, leaving themselves open to some ribbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The look for this summer is subtle, with patterns that don't announce your 
arrival," says Sandy Miller of Twice the Style in Costa Mesa. "You don't want 
people to think the circus is in town." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of too many stripes is that even if you're in great shape, the mix 
of lines can distort your figure. Try a bright white blouse or pants with a 
striped coordinate, and leave the striped socks at home. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tie fraud: They're hot, trendy little status symbols, and they bring up a 
major fashion ethics question. 
</P>
<P>
 They're the Nicole Miller ties, colorful bands of silk that run $60 and up. 
Miller's designer ties have themes that often relate to one's profession. 
Accountant's ties have 1040 forms, dentist's ties have drills and toothbrushes 
and doctor's ties have anatomy charts and syringes. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are reports that phonies are out there who wear the accountant's tie 
and yet don't know their way around a calculator; they wear the doctor tie yet 
they can't put on a Band-Aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, anyone can wear the ties, but most people who do are in the field 
the tie represents," says Ziva Adams of Tie Rack in MainPlace/Santa Ana. "You 
don't ask to see their medical license before you sell someone the doctor tie." 
</P>
<P>
 In the interest of protecting the public, let's hope there's a grass-roots 
effort for a ballot initiative preventing poseurs who may have flunked med 
school or who can't fill out a 1040-EZ without help from getting a Nicole 
Miller tie. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, don't trust your teeth or your medical records to the man 
who's wearing one. Ask to see his license.

 Help yourself and help Children's Hospital of Orange County. Charlotte Russe 
stores are donating to CHOC 10% of sales from their Children's Collection, 
accessories covered with a collage of international kids. Donations will 
continue until stocks are depleted. "Every year we try something different to 
raise money for the hospital," says Larry Lawrence, one of the three brothers 
who own the junior wear chain. Lawrence's teen son spent time at CHOC when he 
was born prematurely. Find vests ($40), backpacks ($16), handbags ($13), belts

 When the folks at Rio Vista Equine Products recently raved that 80% of the 
$12.5 million worth of horse shampoo and tail de-tangler they sold last year 
was for human use, it seemed like they weren't just horsing around. And what 
gives with including Rio Vista Hoof Fix in manicures? Apparently two-legged 
types are discovering that the secret to taming wild hair and strengthening 
nails is at the local tack and feed shop. Southern California and Dallas lead 
the sales pack, says company spokesman Bob Albert. He attributes Rio Vista's 
benefits to its natural, high-grade cosmetic ingredients. Most products for 
horse and human are made of industrial-grade chemicals, which is why creator 
Jheri Redding decided to develop an organic line for his 270 thoroughbreds and 
name it after his Santa Barbara Ranch. Redding, who Albert calls "Mr. Organic," 
is the creator behind Nexxus, Redken and Jhirmack. The line's success is also a 
pocketbook issue. A 32-ounce bottle costs about $10 and lasts months. What will 
they think up next? Try a fly repellent with a pine scent. Albert says it's 
already a hit with golfers and fishermen in Florida. Bottoms Up

 Summer, swimming pools and the not-so-pleasantries of disposable diapers. 
First they swell up in the water and threaten to sink junior. Then they clog 
pool filters. And don't even mention the floating surprise. "That's really 
embarrassing," says Becky Cannon who has two daughters. Hence the inspiration 
behind Beyond Diapers, a waterproof, reusable pant that can contain serious 
messes ($9.95). Cannon's North Carolina-based line, Family Clubhouse, produces 
a full line of baby products. The pants can be worn alone or under swimsuits 
and are available in sizes for 3-month-olds to larger kids. Sales have boomed 
since going national in '93. She's sold 200,000 this year, including to Target 
stores. ROSE APODACA JONES

 The weather was hot and so were the blues at the "Hot Blues On a Cool Summer 
Night" event to benefit the Orange County Performing Arts Center last Thursday. 
Held at South Coast Plaza Village in Santa Ana, the benefit was organized by 
the Center 500, a support group of the performing arts center. So what did the 
500 guests wear? Breezy attire, of course, to sway easily to the warm sounds of 
jazz singer Charlie Jene, backed by the Champion Allstars.

A GRAND NIGHT FOR SINGING; FREDERICA VON STADE AND THOMAS HAMPSON JOIN THE 
SANTA BARBARA SYMPHONY FOR A 'GALA OPERA CONCERT' THAT LIVES UP TO ITS BILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC

 The phony moon glowed on Tuesday amid the electric stars on the vaulting 
ceiling that impersonates the night sky within the Arlington Theatre. The 
quasi-dressy audience, which had paid up to $100 for the privilege, filled the 
vast spaces between the faux adobes on the side walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The mock-pueblo stage in the golden-age movie palace was populated by the 
Santa Barbara Symphony, guest-conductor Roger Nierenberg and two of the biggest 
and brightest luminaries from the irrational world of opera, Frederica von 
Stade and Thomas Hampson. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's "Lion King" was out for the night. Something billed as a "Gala Opera 
Concert" was in. 
</P>
<P>
 The billing didn't turn out to be totally accurate. Von Stade and Hampson 
spent much of their grand night for singing in pursuit of show tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the pursuit may have seemed trivial, the results remained classy. Von 
Stade and Hampson are too smart, too tasteful, too honest and too sophisticated 
to bury their art in slush, no matter what that challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Many singers have voices. Some have brains. Von Stade and Hampson happen to 
have both. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not all, folks. They also have charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Their concert began, inevitably, with some orchestral stalling -- in this 
case, the overture to Glinka's "Russlan and Ludmilla." Here -- as in the Bizet, 
Gounod and Offenbach padding that followed -- Nierenberg drew crisp energetic, 
propulsive performances from the Santa Barbara Symphony. For better or worse, 
the maestro from Jacksonville and Stamford, Conn., is no dawdler. 
</P>
<P>
 When the main business commenced, Handsome Hampson, a Don Giovanni in tails, 
vamped pretty Von Stade, a sleek Zerlina in a simple black sheath, while vying 
for an errant spotlight. Interpretive suavity eventually triumphed. 
</P>
<P>
 The baritone, whose training included some time at the Music Academy of the 
West as well as USC, returned for more Mozart: the Count's aria from "Le Nozze 
di Figaro," in an elegantly embellished version that evaded the ascending 
climax so troubling to many an operatic aristocrat. Von Stade countered with a 
sweetly melting account of Cherubino's "Voi che sapete." 
</P>
<P>
 And off they went. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampson sounded a bit strained in Posa's "Per me giunto" from "Don Carlo," a 
bit dry in Figaro's "Largo al factotum." Even so, one had to admire his nuanced 
inflection of the Italian text, his constant concern for dynamic point and, 
where appropriate, his fine legato control. 
</P>
<P>
 The dangers of mannerism may loom on the horizon, but Hampson hasn't reached 
the horizon yet. Thank goodness. 
</P>
<P>
 Von Stade offered an exquisite surprise in the form of a Habanera in which 
Carmen scored all her insinuating points, for once, with subtlety and muted 
sensuality. Nary a hand reached hip. Nary a chest-tone reached growl. It made 
one regret that she has never ventured the role in the opera house. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosina's cavatina found the mezzo-soprano on familiar bravura ground, gently 
seductive and easily witty. 
</P>
<P>
 After an endearing if unabashedly hammy "Barbiere" duet, it was time for 
intermission. Also time for a change of clothes, a change of tone, and a change 
of acoustics. Not all the changes were for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 In Valentin's hum-along aria from "Faust," Hampson (now modeling a white 
dinner jacket) offered a object lesson in mellifluous pathos. In Siebel's 
impetuous aria from the same opera, Von Stade (now modeling a sleeveless tuxedo 
pantsuit) suggested what a first-rate artist can do with a second-rate role. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Broadway stuff. The soloists propped themselves on stools and, 
for reasons unknown, sang into hand microphones that provided sonic distortion 
as well as abnormal decibels. Unlike some opera stars on crossover trips, 
however, Hampson and Von Stade didn't croon, didn't assume low-brow airs, 
didn't suggest they were camping or, worse, slumming. One had to be grateful 
for big favors. 
</P>
<P>
 The agenda here included predictable excerpts from "State Fair," "Show Boat," 
"South Pacific," "The King and I," "Kiss Me, Kate" and "West Side Story." 
</P>
<P>
 Von Stade, at her wistful best, turned the recitative that precedes "Hello, 
Young Lovers" into poignant poetry. Oddly accompanied by a guitar, she made 
"Bill" from "Show Boat" emphatically hers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampson took the comic-macho bravado of "Where Is the Life That Late I Led?" 
and ran with it. And ran and ran and ran. 
</P>
<P>
 The excellent Santa Barbara orchestra provided lush accompaniment in response 
to Nierenberg's enlightened urgings. Occasionally, however, the tempos seemed a 
bit unyielding. 
</P>
<P>
 Von Stade and Hampson skipped one promised item, "They Say It's Wonderful" 
from "Annie Get Your Gun," but added one rapturous encore, "If I Loved You" 
from "Carousel." 
</P>
<P>
 The amateurish program booklet offered no texts and no program notes. 
Nevertheless, it did provide some interesting biographical data. Hampson, we 
are told, has sung "the title role of Ambroise in Thomas' 'Hamlet,' " not to 
mention "settings of Walt Whitman's 'Le Nozze di Figaro.' " What's in a name. .

THEATER REVIEWS; 'WORLD': DESTINATION UNKNOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than most musical creators, composer John Kander and lyricist Fred Ebb 
require the world of their shows' stories to embolden and amplify their songs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's next to impossible, for instance, to understand the sorry little "Mr. 
Cellophane" without his piece of the action in "Chicago," and it strains the 
senses to imagine the feverish sense of "Kiss of the Spider Woman" outside of 
that musical's surreal universe. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet the Kander-and-Ebb revue conceived by Scott Ellis, Susan Stroman and 
David Thompson, "The World Goes 'Round," at Saddleback College's Cabaret 
Theatre, demands such straining. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes resembling one of those crazy mail-order sampler CD commercials, and 
sometimes delivering the goods with real purity from a hard-working quintet of 
singers backed by Terence Alaric's piano, the revue -- and director Beth 
Hansen's production of it -- veer all over this "World's" map. 
</P>
<P>
 The bifurcated aims of the show are half tribute to a body of work and half 
tribute to one important limb of that body: "Cabaret." Audiences sit at little 
cabaret-style tables (sometimes jammed a bit too close), where they may order 
food and drink (though no booze) at intermission. Wally Huntoon's black set and 
urbane proscenium frame blend nicely with lighting designer Kevin Cook's 
footlights for a faux-Berlin effect. 
</P>
<P>
 As a bonus, Kovia Mikhail looks eerily like Liza Minnelli's Sally Bowles, 
especially in the anthem, "Maybe This Time." She's also front and center in 
"Cabaret," turned into a fresh, five-part-harmony jazz tune, and "Money," which 
lacks an insinuating mood. 
</P>
<P>
 It never quite puts you in Berlin, which "Cabaret" did, even if you were 
sitting in a standard Broadway house. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribute side of this show is more difficult to pin down. The major 
Kander-and-Ebb shows, besides "Chicago," "Cabaret" and "Spider Woman," receive 
their due: "The Act, " "Woman of the Year," "Zorba" and the movies "Funny Lady" 
and "New York, New York." But at least half of the show defies any tying 
together, where one song just leads into another, willy-nilly. 
</P>
<P>
 Any show is asking real leaps from an audience to jump from "All That Jazz" to 
the funny "Class" (Mikhail and Patti McClure having a ball) to "Mr. Cellophane" 
(Alaric's one, poor singing number). 
</P>
<P>
 Or, at the top of Act II, from the jolly "Ring Them Bells" (costumer Charles 
Castagno gets tacky) to "Spider Woman" to a love medley of "Only Love," "Marry 
Me" and "A Quiet Thing." The medley itself is deeply felt -- Brooke Wilkes and 
Kent Helwig play it out like a dramatic scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it's hard to see where it's going. Where it does go is a totally different 
mood: Mikhail and McClure back for their second funny tune, "The Grass Is 
Always Greener." Too often, "The World Goes 'Round" forces this ensemble into 
navigating mood swings rather than presenting a coherent show. 
</P>
<P>
 As traffic cop of the mood swings, Hansen functions very well. As musical 
director, she could have found a more fluid accompanist than Alaric, but she's 
hit pay dirt with this quintet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhail, McClure and George Quick operate very well on their own, while Helwig 
appears hesitant and Wilkes is asked by choreographer Susan Cable to do some 
unfortunate Michelle Pfeiffer bits on top of the piano for "Arthur in the 
Afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Put them together, and this group is suddenly a tightly locked singing machine 
sending out a real musical charge. You question whether the last impression 
this fine ensemble should leave is "New York, New York," but there's no doubt 
that they love being a team. At least this ill-fitting revue has that.

THEATER REVIEWS; A 'MUSIC MAN' WHO'S TOO NICE; MAIN CHARACTER HAROLD HILL, WHO 
OUGHT TO BE BENEVOLENTLY SLEAZY, IS TOO NOBLE FOR THE PLAY'S OWN GOOD. 
OTHERWISE, THE HUNTINGTON BEACH PLAYHOUSE STAGING SINGS.

<P>
 There's a trick to making any production of Meredith Willson's "The Music Man" 
work like gangbusters, and it's the one important detail that's overlooked in 
an otherwise top-notch staging at the Huntington Beach Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Willson's story (created with Franklin Lacey) is set in 1912. That was the 
approximate period of popular tales about "Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford," and 
"Peck's Bad Boy," both reluctant heroes whose misdeeds were monumental, but who 
were redeemed at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 They were just two of the brash, destructive icons -- like George M. Cohan 
heroes, the villain with a good heart -- that epitomized to turn-of-the-century 
Americans the brawling, ambitious spirit that made America what it was. 
Willson's Prof. Harold Hill is authentically of that most politically incorrect 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Both director Kysa Cohen and her Harold Hill, Steven Biggs, gloss over the 
benevolent sleaze that's a part of Hill's personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is out to take the town for every penny he can get, seduce the local 
librarian, and abscond on the last train before his scam is discovered. His 
buoyant enthusiasm is part of the scam. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs' Hill is so noble, however, that his actions seem out of character, as 
though both director and actor want so badly for Hill to be liked that they've 
taken away the charm of the con man at his crummiest. Consequently, there's 
really not that much to redeem, or forgive, at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs is otherwise an ingratiating Hill vocally and romantically, and a good 
match for Terri Gandy's feisty Marian the librarian, with her attractive, 
burnished soprano and her expert sense of timing. Roberta Sawyer is warm and 
charming as Mrs. Paroo, and her Irish accent sounds real, not the Hollywood 
stereotype variety. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Dennis Ure's Mayor Shinn is played way above the level it should be, if Tim 
White's correctly nasty anvil salesman Charlie Cowell isn't far behind Ure, 
these overstatements are made up for by the bright, charming performance of 
Nick Mousetis as young Winthrop, whose lisp is held in check, and whose strong, 
clear voice makes a delight of "Gary, Indiana." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall the production is light and airy, as it should be, and Cohen's 
choreography, which doesn't give the dancers more than they are able to handle, 
fills the stage with attractive, inventive and energetic movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Production numbers and solos are well performed, costumes by Cohen and Andrew 
Otero are period right and attractive, and Tim Nelson's musical direction has 
the right enthusiastic drive.

O.C. POP BEAT: FEST WILL OFFER REAL ALTERNATIVE TO 'ALTERNATIVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ROOS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that the Lollapalooza tour regularly includes many of the nation's 
top-selling rock bands, it's more and more difficult to think of it as a 
showcase of "alternative" rock. 
</P>
<P>
 As the alternative has become the mainstream, fans looking for real 
alternatives have to work a little harder. Organizers of Sunday's 
"Independent's Day '94" mini-festival in Silverado Canyon have made the hunt a 
little easier for anyone interested in a smorgasbord sampling of up-and-coming 
Southern California bands. 
</P>
<P>
 And it has the bonus of being for a good cause: More than 30 local rock, punk, 
reggae and ska bands will play from noon to 8 p.m. to raise money for the 
Orangewood Children's Home, a nonprofit shelter for abused and homeless 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The local music scene needs more publicity and exposure, and this event will 
certainly help," said Jaime Munoz of Fountain Valley-based Taurus Enterprises, 
who organized the festival along with his partner, Tony Cardullo. The show will 
be hosted by KROQ-FM deejay Richard Blade. There will be five stages going 
simultaneously, with each band playing 30 to 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This festival's purpose is really twofold: to gain more visibility for the 
bands as well as providing needed revenue for Orangewood," Munoz said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Social Services Agency study showed that Orangewood is having severe 
crowding problems, aggravated by the fact that the average stay for the 
children has increased substantially in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz said there was an outpouring of bands offering their services for the 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every band scheduled to appear, there are at least two more that want to 
play," he said. "The interest and enthusiasm has been overwhelming, really." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to draw from 1,500 to 2,000 paying fans, which would net around 
$5,000 to $6,000 for Orangewood," said Munoz, who last year promoted a reggae 
festival in Long Beach and a ska festival in Colton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fortunate to have sponsors like Coors Light, BAM magazine and (Santa 
Ana amplifier manufacturer) Mesa Boogie, and others, along with many volunteers 
working on everything from counter help to stage and sound prep. Everyone is 
pitching in." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the participating musicians said they've found the community spirit to 
be contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the bands know each other, at least by name, and this kind of event 
brings the local scene a little bit more in focus," said Maurice Torres, 
guitarist of the Fountain Valley-based Grabbers, which is signed to 
Orange-based Dr. Dream Records and has released one single, "Huntington Beach 
Vs. the World." 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of thing helps break down some of the existing cliques out there, 
and it's a good chance to make some new friends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another plus for the bands, according to Torres, is that they get to play in 
front of more people than they normally do at such local clubs as the Doll Hut 
in Anaheim and Club 5902 in Huntington Beach. Scheduled to play at 4 p.m., the 
Grabbers -- whose pop-laced punk sound recalls the Stooges and Dead Boys -- 
will also be the opening act during the Cadillac Tramps' upcoming West Coast 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea sounded fun and worthwhile to us," explained Ron Richter, 
guitarist and spokesman for Huntington Beach's Funky Sex Machine. "I hope we 
get a good turnout, so people can see that we don't all sound alike." 
</P>
<P>
 On the scene for about five years, the group is heavily riff-oriented ("we 
play low-end groove rock"), kind of like a raw Soundgarden. The group is 
scheduled to play at 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the festival's lineup lacks a single name with major drawing power, 
at least one band that seems to be headed in that direction is Long Beach's 
Sublime, who, Munoz said, may tour with next year's Lollapalooza package. 
</P>
<P>
 Combining a powerful blend of punk-rock aggression with the infectious rhythms 
of reggae, Sublime currently has two releases available on Skunk Records: "40 
Ounces of Freedom" (1992) and the 2-month-old "Robbin the Hood." 
</P>
<P>
 A cross between Minor Threat and the Adolescents, the trio -- which is 
scheduled to go on at 6:30 p.m. -- is currently negotiating with Atlantic 
Records, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a lot of fun, and if we weren't there playing, we'd be there 
watching," said the president of Skunk Records and Sublime's co-producer, 
Miguel (like Madonna, he prefers first name only). 
</P>
<P>
 Added Munoz: "All of the bands are playing for free, so the festival is 
reasonably priced. We want people to come out. If it's successful, we'll do 
more of them. I'm already thinking ahead to October . . . over 60 bands . . . 
on 10 stages . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 * "Independent's Day '94," a benefit for Orangewood Children's Home, will be 
held Sunday at Oak Canyon Ranch, 5305 E. Santiago Canyon Road, Silverado 
Canyon. Noon to 8 p.m. $8 advance; $10 at the door (student discounts

PEARL JAM, TICKETMASTER AND NOW CONGRESS; AMERICA'S BIGGEST BAND SENT SHOCK 
WAVES THROUGH THE MUSIC BUSINESS WHEN IT FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT ABOUT TICKETMASTER. NOW, CONGRESS IS HOLDING A HEARING. HOW'D IT ALL 
GET SO FAR?

<P>
 Rock 'n' roll returns to Capitol Hill today, but this time it's not over 
record labeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the House Government Operations subcommittee will convene to hear 
testimony about how the $1-billion concert industry operates in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing follows a complaint filed by the best-selling band in the U.S., 
Pearl Jam, against Ticketmaster, the largest ticket company in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 The band alleges that the Los Angeles-based firm exercises a national monopoly 
over ticket distribution and used its influence with promoters to boycott Pearl 
Jam's planned low-priced tour this summer. The complaint, filed May 6, 
triggered a Justice Department civil investigation into possible 
anti-competitive practices in the ticket distribution industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Jam's unprecedented action has turned up the heat on the longtime 
simmering debate over ticket prices, and the Seattle rock group has received 
words of support from some of the nation's biggest concert draws. Among them: 
Garth Brooks, Neil Young, R.E.M., the Grateful Dead and Aerosmith, whose 
manager is scheduled to testify today. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing has been building up for a long time," says Stone Gossard, Pearl 
Jam guitarist and co-founder, who will speak first at today's hearing. "And 
deep down, it's really not about money. It's about music. It's about fairness. 
It's about a band who believes good intentions can translate into sound 
business practices and a giant corporation that's completely out of touch." 
</P>
<P>
 A Ticketmaster spokesman dismisses Pearl Jam's move as a "brilliant marketing 
ploy" to sell records and says that the firm "operates fully within the 
parameters of all applicable laws." Ticketmaster's practices were reviewed in 
1991 when the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division allowed the firm to 
buy certain assets from a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pearl Jam's move has sent shock waves through the country, all the way 
from the streets of Seattle to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 President Bill Clinton -- who invited Pearl Jam to the White House in April 
while the band was on the East Coast during its spring tour -- is keeping tabs 
on the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The White House is impressed by Pearl Jam's commitment to its fans," says 
George Stephanopoulos, senior adviser to the President for policy and strategy. 
"We want to make it very clear that we can't judge the merits of the band's 
allegations against Ticketmaster or prejudge the Justice Department action in 
any way. But that said, we think the goal of making concert ticket prices 
affordable is a laudable one. It's something we believe in." 
</P>
<P>
 And the entire record industry is watching from the sidelines, anxious for the 
outcome of what one insider has called a "holy war." The stakes are high and 
the fight will surely provide a rare look inside the lucrative concert 
industry.  
</P>
<P>
 But how did a rock band, a ticket firm and even the U.S. President become 
involved in a matter that has led to today's session on Capitol Hill? The 
following, based on interviews with dozens of key participants on both sides, 
is a step-by-step account of how the biggest-drawing band in America arrived at 
the door of the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Labor Day, 1992, when Pearl Jam celebrated its ascent to superstar 
status by throwing a free "thank you" concert for 30,000 hometown Seattle fans. 
It also was the band's first blowup with Ticketmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The quintet was angered when the ticket firm requested a $1 service fee for 
each free pass it distributed. The band went around the firm and gave away 
tickets on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the episode, Pearl Jam began making a conscious effort to reduce 
ticket and T-shirt prices for its 1993 tour -- its first as a headliner.  
</P>
<P>
 Rather than take on Ticketmaster last year, however, Pearl Jam allowed its 
fans to be charged service fees ranging from $3 to $6 per ticket on its 40-date 
cross-country trek. Instead, the band instructed its representatives to focus 
on persuading venue owners to accept smaller commissions on Pearl Jam 
merchandise so that T-shirts could be sold for $18 -- about 25% less than most 
acts charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We swore when we formed this band that if we ever got successful we would 
make sure we did something to keep our concert prices down," Gossard says. "But 
we decided to take it one step at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Jam also lowered the face price of each ticket to $18 -- despite 
opposition from some promoters who encouraged the group to charge almost three 
times that amount. The band -- which has sold nearly 11 million albums since 
1992 -- turned down more than $2 million last year in potential tour and 
merchandise profits as a result of its low-price policies, promoters say. 
</P>
<P>
 While fans applauded Pearl Jam's efforts, the band's unorthodox tactics were 
perceived in the industry as a direct affront to the profit base of a powerful 
clique of promoters, venue owners and concessionaires affiliated with 
Ticketmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute they became a headliner, this band refused to compromise with 
anybody," says one promoter, who requested anonymity because he -- like others 
interviewed -- did not want to alienate either the popular American rock band 
or the ticket giant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike a lot of other acts, Pearl Jam is not greedy. But they could care less 
about the middlemen in this business and anytime you disagree with them during 
a negotiation, they just tell you, 'Hey, man, it's either my way or the 
highway.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Jam locked horns again with Ticketmaster in early November, 
approximately one hour before tickets were scheduled to go on sale for the 
tour's final shows in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute this time stemmed from a disagreement over a charitable 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, says he negotiated a deal on Oct. 29 with 
Ticketmaster in which the firm's Seattle representative agreed to donate 
$20,000 of the show's service fees to a local program for impoverished 
children. Pearl Jam had also pledged $20,000 to the same charity, from the 
concert proceeds, Curtis says. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes before tickets went on sale, however, Curtis says another band 
official was informed by Ticketmaster chairman Fredric D. Rosen in a telephone 
call that his company's donation was unauthorized and a $1 surcharge must be 
added.  
</P>
<P>
 Furious, Curtis now says that the band ordered Rosen to cancel the concert. 
After an hour of heated discussion with the band's agent, Curtis says Rosen 
consented to donate about $14,000 to the charity, and the show went on sale. 
Other sources close to the event confirm the band's account. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last-minute nature of that episode was a real eye-opener for us," says 
Curtis. "Most people we deal with don't do business that way -- especially when 
it involves raising money for a good cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen declined to be interviewed for this story, but high-level sources at his 
company denied that Ticketmaster reneged on the contribution. The dispute that 
afternoon, they say, erupted after the band demanded -- at the last second -- 
to increase service fees by an additional 50 cents in order for Ticketmaster to 
put up its $20,000 share. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Pearl Jam needed to raise money for their charity they didn't seem to 
have any difficulty with raising the service fee to accomplish it," says 
Ticketmaster spokesman Larry Solters. "It kind of makes you wonder what this 
whole dispute is about." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Ticketmaster donated $14,000 and the service charge was not 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Jam clashed again with Ticketmaster on March 1 of this year, just before 
the band embarked on a 24-date spring tour. Its agent informed promoters the 
band would play concerts this summer only at venues that charged $18 per ticket 
and no more than $1.80 in service fees. Ticketmaster typically collects $4 to 
$8 per ticket in fees for rock and pop concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 The quintet also required that the amount of the service charge be printed 
clearly on the ticket -- a practice that Ticketmaster has adamantly opposed in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Pearl Jam refused to permit inclusion of paid advertisements on 
the back of the ticket, squelching another source of revenue for Ticketmaster, 
which sells that space to corporate sponsors and does not share the proceeds 
with artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Jam's demands flew in the face of industry practices instituted for the 
most part by Ticketmaster, which has dominated the market since 1991 when it 
bought certain assets from Ticketron, its primary competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a week, Curtis says, Pearl Jam had come to the realization that it 
would never be able to prevent fans from being charged what the band considered 
excessive service fees if they continued to book shows on the mainstream 
concert circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Their reasoning: "A percentage of Ticketmaster's service charges is often 
kicked back by Ticketmaster to promoters and venues, giving them a vested 
interest in keeping service fees high," according to the band's memorandum to 
the U.S. Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster gives a portion of its service fees to many of the nation's major 
promoters and arena owners in exchange for exclusive ticket distribution 
contracts, many of which were signed during Ticketmaster's rise to prominence 
in the late '80s. Retail stores that operate as Ticketmaster outlets also 
receive rebates, as do some artist managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Jam's dilemma, insiders say, was that Ticketmaster's expenses often 
exceed the cap that the band sought to impose. For instance, a $1.80 fee 
wouldn't be enough at most mainstream Southern California venues, according to 
sources, because Ticketmaster pays at least an estimated $1.50 of each concert 
service fee to local building owners, promoters and retailers. Additionally, 
Ticketmaster maintains its own costs often exceed $2 per transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster spokesman Solters says these arrangements are legal and were 
reviewed by the U.S. Justice Department in 1991 following the Ticketron 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question you ought to be asking is what gives Pearl Jam the right to 
dictate and fix prices in a free market?" Solters says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions between the two camps increased during the band's spring tour. 
According to Pearl Jam's memo, Ticketmaster had pledged to list its $3.75 
service charge separately on the face of each $18 ticket, starting with the 
band's March 13 concert in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 But barely an hour before tickets were to go on sale, Rosen telephoned the 
venue and reneged on the deal, the memo says. Curtis responded by canceling the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 After heated telephone discussions between Rosen and Pearl Jam's 
representatives, Ticketmaster relented to the band's demands, the memo says, 
and the show went on. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster denies that any argument took place. The misunderstanding, the 
firm says, stemmed from a misrepresentation of the deal to the band by one of 
Pearl Jam's own associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempers flared again less than a week later when the band circumvented 
Ticketmaster by selling tickets through a newspaper lottery to a March 19 show 
in Detroit, Curtis says. The tickets were $18 each with a $1.75 fee going to 
the promoter, Nederlander. (Fans were also charged a $1.50 "facility fee" by 
the venue, the Masonic Temple.) 
</P>
<P>
 According to the memo, Pearl Jam was "informed" that Ticketmaster "threatened 
the promoter of the concert with a lawsuit for breaching its exclusive 
agreement," and even temporarily shut off its ticket machine at the venue. But 
Nederlander refused to back down, sources say. Ticketmaster agreed to accept a 
portion of the promoter's $1.75 service fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources at Nederlander say no legal threats were issued but heated arguments 
occurred with Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster sources deny that any dispute took 
place, saying it reached "an agreement" with the promoter. 
</P>
<P>
 "By this point, we were getting pretty frustrated," Pearl Jam's Gossard says. 
"There's no doubt that (Ticketmaster) takes more of the total ticket percentage 
than they deserve. We really just got sick of arguing about it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 By mid-March, Pearl Jam had hired a company to identify available parcels of 
open land and consulted with several promoters about staging summer concerts in 
outdoor venues not associated with Ticketmaster. The band's representatives 
began exploring alternative ticket distribution methods for its tentative 
20-date tour -- scheduled to kick off in July. 
</P>
<P>
 In early April, Curtis says Pearl Jam was told by a promoter, the substance of 
their complaint to the Justice Department, that Ticketmaster had begun to 
organize a boycott of the band's alternative tour with the aid of the North 
American Concert Promoters Assn., a McLean, Va.-based group that represents the 
nation's largest promoters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster's Solters denies the firm tried to organize a boycott of the 
tour. But in two letters obtained by The Times and submitted with Pearl Jam's 
complaint, Ben Liss, the executive director of the association, advised 
promoters that if they booked Pearl Jam under the band's conditions, Rosen 
warned they could face possible lawsuits. (Liss, who was president of Ticketron 
when that company was acquired by Ticketmaster in 1991, says his attorney 
advised him not to comment for this story.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster "views the Pearl Jam issue as an all-or-nothing proposition," 
Liss wrote in a March 24 letter, adding that Ticketmaster's Rosen "intends to 
take a very strong stand on this issue to protect Ticketmaster's existing 
contracts with promoters and facilities and, further, (Ticketmaster) will use 
all available remedies to protect itself from outside third parties that 
attempt to interfere with those existing contracts." 
</P>
<P>
 As rumors of a boycott spread through the concert industry, Pearl Jam pressed 
on with its spring tour and performed more than a dozen scheduled dates without 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 8, Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, who along with Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder led 
the Seattle music surge, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot blast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kurt died right at the point when Pearl Jam was encountering all these 
complications with putting together the tour," Curtis says. "Coupled with 
everything else that was going on, it just about knocked the wind out of the 
band." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The band's last squabble with Ticketmaster occurred the day before its April 
17 show at the Paramount Theatre in the Madison Square Garden complex, where 
the band again bypassed Ticketmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-April, Pearl Jam's memo says, its management was warned through third 
parties that they should "watch their backs" -- statements, the band claims, 
that were intended to "threaten and intimidate." In addition, the memo says 
Ticketmaster suggested it might sue Pearl Jam for "tortiously interfering" with 
Ticketmaster's exclusive dealing arrangements with promoters -- allegations 
that the firm vehemently denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Two major promoters told The Times they attempted to intervene at this point 
on behalf of Ticketmaster, which eventually put in an unofficial bid to sell 
tickets to the band's summer shows for an estimated $2.50 service fee -- 70 
cents above Pearl Jam's limit. 
</P>
<P>
 But by this time, Curtis says, the band had grown leery of Ticketmaster. Even 
though a few promoters were willing to work with the band, Pearl Jam worried 
that Ticketmaster might disrupt the tour by making good on the legal threat 
spelled out in the letter sent by the concert association to its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about health, safety and comfort issues associated with putting on 
shows in remote locations, and deeply troubled by Cobain's suicide, Pearl Jam 
decided to pull the plug. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if we had spent two months assembling the show and Ticketmaster 
threatened the promoter with a lawsuit one hour before we were set to hit the 
stage?" says Curtis, who estimated that the band could have grossed about $9 
million this summer. "What if a show got canceled at the last second and (a 
fan) got hurt? We just couldn't risk it." 
</P>
<P>
 While Pearl Jam felt somewhat defeated in its struggle to lower prices, it did 
not give up. Before leaving New York, the band had representatives visit an 
attorney at Sullivan & Cromwell, a law firm noted for its antitrust work. Three 
weeks later, the band's representatives were sitting in the Washington office 
of the Justice Department's civil division. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Justice Department have since served Ticketmaster with a 
"civil investigative demand" -- the equivalent of a subpoena -- ordering the 
firm to surrender contracts as well as other records pertinent to the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That probe prompted Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres), chairman of the House Government 
Operations subcommittee, to call today's hearing. Ticketmaster chairman Fredric 
Rosen will testify, as will members of Pearl Jam and other prominent figures in 
the music industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster's Solters claims Pearl Jam engineered the controversy to promote 
the band's third album, which is due to be released in two months by Sony 
Music. Ticketmaster also believes Sony may be using the furor to hasten its 
entry into the ticket distribution business, Solters says. Sony officials deny 
both allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have here is a band that refuses to release singles or music videos 
and has now decided not to go on tour," Solters says. "What better way to 
generate publicity for a new album than to go after a convenient target and 
stir up some controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gossard maintains that Pearl Jam isn't just acting in its own interest and 
points to the support being received by the band. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're real excited that other artists and managers are coming forward now," 
he says. "There are some big questions that need to be answered about how 
tickets are distributed in this country, and we're glad the government is 
getting involved. People shouldn't have to pay an arm and a leg just to go out 
and see a concert."

ONE QUIET MAN, ONE BOOMING CAREER; MOVIES: THAT'S FOREST WHITAKER, THE ACTOR 
BEST KNOWN FOR 'BIRD' AND 'THE CRYING GAME.' HE'S GOT FOUR MOVIES COMING OUT 
THIS SEASON, WHICH ISN'T BAD FOR A SHY GUY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GRANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a town that thrives on the flashy, Forest Whitaker is one actor who shuns 
the limelight, does his work and then goes home. Nonetheless, the 32-year-old 
actor has worked constantly during the last couple of years, in such quirky yet 
high-profile films as "Bird" and "The Crying Game," and this season he's in 
four upcoming movies, as well as in the director's chair again. 
</P>
<P>
 First up is "Blown Away," which opens Friday, in which Whitaker stars with 
Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones as Bridges' arrogant, antagonistic bomb squad 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was intrigued by a character that could walk into a room and say: 'I'm the 
best. Stick around and maybe you'll learn something from me,' " Whitaker says 
shyly, while noshing on rigatoni at a corner table at his hotel. "Actually, I 
was hoping that the film would help me with that side of things," he says, 
followed by a crooked grin. Well, did it? "I don't know, man," he admits. "I'm 
sure I'm different. I keep growing." 
</P>
<P>
 The publicity-shy actor has been dubbed "enigmatic" and a "loner," but 
Whitaker up close comes off as merely introverted, even spiritual. "I am what I 
seem," he says simply. "I'm not acting like I've done no wrongs. And I've done 
some rights. I've had pain, worked on things, you know," he says softly. "I've 
looked through the fire. Now I'm trying to find some peace." 
</P>
<P>
 The actor has his own issues as well. "You know what I think about 'Blown 
Away'? I think it's about redemption. I think everybody, even in the smallest 
manner, deals with that issue." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker, who has become something of a critics' darling, nonetheless says 
that he has had to confront his self-doubt through the years. "There are times 
when I feel like I'm being chased by something," he says. "Of not being able to 
do something right. It took a long time before I felt comfortable about what I 
was doing as an actor." 
</P>
<P>
 "Blown Away" director Stephen Hopkins says Whitaker has clearly reached that 
level. "He's an interesting fellow," he says. "He speaks in such a spiritual 
and gentle way, so it's a real shock when he comes onto the set and we start to 
shoot a scene and bang! He's this rude and arrogant, larger-than-life 
character. It's really something to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker's searing portrayal of jazz great Charlie Parker in 1988's "Bird," 
directed by Clint Eastwood, was the turning point. "At that time, I wasn't sure 
about what I was doing," he insists. "I was just trying my best to see if I 
could do it or not. But Clint trusted me," he marvels. "He taught me how to 
dance on a limb." Some dancing -- he won the best actor award at Cannes for his 
performance. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A native of Longview, Tex., Whitaker was raised in Los Angeles and became a 
star football player at Palisades High School. He won scholarships to the 
University of Southern California in both theater and opera, then switched his 
interests from singing to acting. His affable, bearish presence was a scene 
stealer from the very beginning, in his film debut in 1982's "Fast Times at 
Ridgemont High" and other early roles like "Platoon," "Good Morning Vietnam" 
and "The Color of Money." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps his most heart-wrenching performance was as the soldier in 1992's 
"The Crying Game." The film catapulted Neil Jordan into the upper echelon of 
directors and made unknown Jaye Davidson a star. For Whitaker, however, the 
role of the British soldier had less impact. "It was a very positive 
experience, and I was so pleased to see how well it did," he says. "But did it 
help my career?" 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, perhaps not. But Whitaker's choices have often seemed calculated to 
challenge, not coast. His directorial debut, 1993's HBO movie "Strapped," a 
gritty urban thriller, won him the director's award for best first feature from 
the Toronto Film Festival; he was then inundated with directing offers from 
virtually every major studio. 
</P>
<P>
 While he says he prefers directing to acting, he has absolutely no desire to 
direct himself. "When I was working on 'Strapped,' I was directing a scene in 
which two of the actors were like biting the room," he recalls. "There was so 
much pain. If I had been acting in the film, I'd have to live with that pain, 
figure it out and maybe it would stay with me a little bit."  
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker recently returned from Paris, where he played Cy Bianco, a fictional, 
flamboyant fashion designer in Robert Altman's "Pret-a-Porter," an inside look 
at the fashion industry and the media that cover it. He was energized by 
Altman's improvisational spirit and, while he found the world of couture 
elusive ("I knew nothing about the fashion world"), the character he played is 
a real eccentric. "He's into cheap clothes. The clothes he designs are old 
clothes that are restructured. He always speaks his mind, whereas a lot of the 
other designers in the film are more covert and competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He also stars in the HBO film "The Enemy Within," about a political coup in 
the United States in the near future, due out later this summer. He will then 
be seen in "Jason's Lyric," a feature directed by Doug McHenry due out in the 
fall, a powerful drama in which the actor plays an abusive father killed by one 
of his two sons. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, he reports to work on Wayne Wang's "Smoke," about a long-estranged 
father and son, starring with William Hurt and Harvey Keitel. Later this year, 
he moves back into the director's chair for 20th Century Fox's screen 
adaptation of the best-selling Terry McMillan novel "Waiting to Exhale." 
Despite the fact that the film's major characters are all women, he says 
"Exhale's" subject matter is universal: "The film explores how people repeat 
cycles." 
</P>
<P>
 A future role he hopes to play is that of legendary boxer Joe Louis, although 
that project is definitely off the front burner for now. He frets that by the 
time he's free of his other commitments he may be too old to play the boxer. 
"At some point, I'll probably just direct -- and write," he says. "I don't know 
what it is that I'm still trying to figure (out) -- there's something I need to 
figure out." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker, who is divorced and has a 4-year-old son, Ocean Alexander, refuses 
to shed any but the dimmest light on his personal life. Instead, he is 
single-mindedly focused on his career and thinks that time is really his only 
enemy. "I wish I could feel it like when I was a kid. I could see the holidays 
coming. A year seemed like seven or eight when I was a kid. Now I need to stop 
and take stock -- that's why I'm probably not going to be acting forever."

STUDY OF TV VIOLENCE WILL WIDEN THE FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to improve on past surveys that emphasized bullet rounds and body 
counts, a new industry-funded study of televised violence will assess whether 
broadcast blood and gore are artistically defensible or merely gratuitous, its 
sponsors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA Center for Communications Policy, selected by the four major networks 
to conduct the study, will spend at least two years examining portrayals of 
violence in everything from made-for-TV movies to Saturday morning cartoons, 
said center director Jeffrey Cole.  
</P>
<P>
 Describing the planned study at a press conference, Cole said it will try to 
address qualitative issues instead of duplicating the quantitative focus of 
previous studies. In addition to prime-time and children's programming, it will 
encompass television commercials, movie promotions and video games, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will study televised violence for at least two programming seasons, 
and possibly a third. It will issue annual reports of its findings, the first 
of which is due next July. 
</P>
<P>
 Most academic studies conducted over the past 20 years have counted incidents 
of fighting, shooting, and other violent acts without examining context, Cole 
said. But the center intends to address how graphically violence is portrayed, 
whether it is relevant to the plot and whether those who commit it are 
punished. 
</P>
<P>
 While Saturday morning cartoons are "problematic" because they tend to contain 
gratuitous violence, Cole said, the center's evaluators will generally "operate 
on the assumption that not all violence is necessarily bad."  
</P>
<P>
 The industry-sponsored effort is designed in part to head off efforts in 
Congress to increase federal oversight of TV programming. At Wednesday's 
briefing, representatives of the four networks -- ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox -- 
urged Congress to refrain from regulating content, calling it "an area fraught 
with constitutional peril." 
</P>
<P>
 The networks will pay the center about $1 million for the first two reports. 
Although the UCLA center's reports will be released publicly, the networks will 
not be required to follow any recommendations they contain. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS Senior Vice President Martin D. Franks, speaking for the four networks, 
said that the reports will provide new insight into how different media 
approach violent themes.

NBA DRAFT; LAKERS RECALL THE PAST; PRO BASKETBALL: TEMPLE GUARD JONES 
REMINISCENT OF FORMER GREAT MICHAEL COOPER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lakers must be serious about this duplicating-the-past thing. They just 
drafted Michael Cooper again. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, he goes by the name Eddie Jones, the Atlantic 10 Conference player of 
the year from Temple. But he still plays defense and gets out on the break. He 
still plays shooting guard and small forward. And he still is lanky, at 6 foot 
6 and 190 pounds. The real Cooper, now a Laker assistant coach, saw him 
recently and said "it was like looking at a mirror image." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers hope it stays that way. They invested the 10th pick in Wednesday's 
NBA draft that it will, taking Jones over Arizona's Khalid Reeves in hopes he 
will help revitalize the offense that ground out just 100.4 points a game last 
season and also make a contribution to one of the league's worst rebounding 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Lakers were happy with their choice, Jones, the player they had planned 
to take unless Lamond Murray slipped past the Clippers at No. 7, was thrilled. 
Though he has had only two brief visits to Los Angeles as part of pre-draft 
workouts, he was a Laker fan from way back, since watching Cooper and Magic 
Johnson in admiration during the Showtime era. Now both will be his tutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dream come true," Jones said from the draft site in Indianapolis. 
"When you grow up watching those types of players, you imitate what they do on 
the court. It's just God willing for me to be there and learn what they did on 
the court from players. Big-time players. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what I hoped for. I didn't really expect it. The word out here was 
that it was going to be Carlos Rogers. I was hoping it was going to be me." 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, there was a chance it would be both. The Lakers considered Rogers 
more seriously in the days just before the draft and then, it is believed, 
tried to trade with Seattle just after the SuperSonics took the Tennessee State 
small forward at No. 11. Executive vice president Jerry West said during the 
first round they were trying to complete a deal, but would not say who it 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Any significant Laker trades--and the Rogers deal apparently is still a 
possibility--will probably involve moving one of the four returning shooting 
guards, all of whom have started during the past two seasons. It was crowded 
there already, but it's downright take-a-number now with the arrival of Jones, 
who is projected as a fill-in small forward who will get most of his time in 
the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 That this only adds to the logjam, instead of filling a more glaring position 
need for scoring and rebounding up front, is the obvious drawback. But, the 
Lakers reasoned, its better than making a reach with their highest pick since 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some big guards; we'll just have to see," Coach Del Harris. "I don't 
get into those positioning things much. I worked with Don Nelson for a number 
of years, and one of the things I learned from Don Nelson is to ignore the 
positioning and play the player. That's the thing about Eddie. We'll just call 
him a ballplayer and stick him out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Said West: "We're excited. Very excited. Going into the thing, we thought that 
there might be a small forward, which we've indicated is a need for us. But we 
just felt we could not pass on this kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We indicated we were going to take the best player. And we felt he was the 
best player there, regardless of position." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, an honorable mention All-American as a senior, was arguably the best 
athlete in the draft, a leaper and a driver with a great first step who needs 
to become a more consistent outside shooter. His offensive game has been 
compared to Ron Harper's. 
</P>
<P>
 That he is a very good defender in the process--thus the comparison to 
Cooper--and someone who can be a pretty good rebounder and shot blocker from 
the backcourt is what ultimately convinced the Lakers. They also talk about his 
great attitude and approach in just as glowing of terms, something that was 
also mostly absent from last season's roster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers had no second-round pick. The First Round

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; MARADONA FACING A BAN AFTER POSITIVE DRUG 
TEST; ARGENTINA: EPHEDRINE SHOWS UP IN SAMPLE. RESULTS OF CRITICAL SECOND TEST 
WILL BE ANNOUNCED TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diego Maradona, one of the most brilliant and controversial figures in soccer, 
was at the center of a drug scandal that shook the World Cup on Wednesday after 
he tested positive for a banned cold medication. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of Argentina's final first-round match, against Bulgaria tonight at 
the Cotton Bowl, it was announced Maradona's "A" urine sample had traces of 
ephedrine, an anti-asthma stimulant found in over-the-counter medications. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Grondona, president of the Argentine Football Federation, made the 
announcement on the side of the Cotton Bowl where the players, including 
Maradona, were supposed to practice Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of playing soccer, the Argentines sat on the field in small groups 
looking sullen and talking with federation and FIFA officials for about a half 
hour. Maradona sat with his teammates near one goal, a tiny figure whose every 
move was scrutinized by hundreds of journalists sitting in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, at the team hotel, Grondona said until the results of a "B" sample were 
known, it was impossible to speculate what could happen. The second sample was 
tested at the UCLA drug laboratory Wednesday afternoon in the presence of Raul 
Peidro, an Argentine team doctor, and other soccer officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a happy moment," one of the physicians said. "But it was done in a 
calm manner." 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA, soccer's governing body, is expected to announce the results today at 
its World Cup headquarters in Irving, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the players were kept away from a swarm of reporters following the 
team, Maradona told a Buenos Aires television station: "It's my fault. I did 
it. It's me." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Argentine officials listed Maradona's name in today's starting lineup. 
A once-magical midfielder, Maradona, 33, is playing in what is expected to be 
his final World Cup tournament. Appearing in his fourth World Cup, Maradona 
would set a record of 22 Cup matches if he plays tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Trecker, a spokesman for World Cup '94, said the controversy will not ruin 
the image soccer has created in the past three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly is a pity when something off the field becomes bigger than on 
the field," he said, adding that it will not cast the tournament in a negative 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 If Maradona's "B" sample is positive, FIFA's Organizing Committee would form a 
special committee to study the case and determine what sanctions, if any, to 
levy. Agricole de Bianchetti, a federation attorney, and Daiel Bolotnicoff, 
Maradona's attorney, were arranging meetings with FIFA officials late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under FIFA's drug policy, unlike most in American professional sports, 
sanctions are not specified for any particular offense, which gives FIFA 
flexibility in dealing with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's positive, Maradona could be banned," Grondona said. "It could be a 
year's suspension." 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA officials said Maradona would be suspended immediately if the second 
sample proves to be positive. Grondona said the team's standing would not be 
affected, that any penalty would be against individuals. Argentina won its 
first two matches and has six points to lead Group D. Grondona said that 
Ernesto Ugalde, team physician, could be sanctioned if found to have given 
Maradona the medication. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona, who was banned for 15 months in 1991 for cocaine abuse, tested 
positive for ephedrine after Argentina defeated Nigeria, 2-1, in Foxboro, 
Mass., on Saturday. He and teammate Sergio Vasquez were randomly selected to 
submit urine samples. Two players from each team are selected after every World 
Cup match to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Grondona said the drug was a nasal spray not prescribed by the team doctor but 
by Maradona's private physician. Maradona was said to have taken the medication 
to combat flu, and claimed he did not know it was a banned substance. He 
claimed his physician forgot to tell federation doctors about the medication. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, it was a reckless act, according to those familiar with FIFA's 
drug-testing policy. Not only was a drug hotline set up by Donald Catlin, 
director the UCLA drug laboratory that is handling the World Cup specimens, but 
teams must declare before each game what drugs they have taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephedrine, once a popular drug for sprinters and cyclists, is not used much by 
athletes anymore, Catlin said Wednesday night.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some sports, doping scandals have been rare in soccer. Twice players 
have been dismissed from the World Cup finals by FIFA for using drugs. The 
first was defender Ernest Jean-Joseph of Haiti in Germany in 1974. But his team 
manager refused to send him home and he had to be extradited by security men 
sent from Haiti. He never played again. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 1978 finals in Argentina, Willie Johnston of Scotland was sent home in 
disgrace and banned for taking an illegal drug for medicinal purposes. 
</P>

 Times staff writer Julie Cart contributed to this story from Los Angeles. The 
Turbulent Times of Maradona 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona is one of the world's best-known athletes, both for his skill on the 
soccer field and his innate ability to find trouble off it. The following is a 
look at Maradona's roller-coaster life: 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 30, 1960: Diego Armando Maradona was born in Lanus, Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 October, 20 1976: Played his first game as a professional for the Argentino 
Juniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 27, 1977: Played his first game as a member of the Argentine national 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 July, 1982: Played on the Argentine World Cup team but was sent off the field 
in the closing moments of a losing game after kicking an opposing player in the 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 August, 1984: Went from the Spanish club Barcelona to Napoli in Italy for a 
record $10 million transfer fee. 
</P>
<P>
 June 22, 1986: Scored the first goal on an apparent hand ball in a 2-1 victory 
over England in a World Cup quarterfinal. He said the ball was punched by "The 
Hand of God." Argentina went on to win the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 November, 1989: Married Claudia Villafane, the mother of his two daughters. 
His wedding cost about $3 million and during the reception he punched out a 
photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 July, 1990: Led his team to the World Cup final in Rome. The game was won by 
West Germany, 1-0, and he said the whole tournament was tainted by "Mafia 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
 August, 1990: Returned to his Italian club team. 
</P>
<P>
 April 6, 1991: Suspended by FIFA for 15 months for cocaine use discovered 
during post-match testing after an Italian League game. 
</P>
<P>
 April 26, 1991: Arrested in Argentina for possession and distribution of 
illegal narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 18, 1991: Received a 15-month suspended sentence for previous drug 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 June 1992: Signed by Seville of Spain; he later quit the club after less than 
one season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 12, 1993: Returned to Argentina to play for the Newell's Old Boys club 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 1, 1994: Was fired for skipping practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 2, 1994: Fired a compressed-air rifle at journalists, slightly injuring 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 June 29, 1994: Head of the Argentine soccer delegation says Maradona tested 
positive for ephedrine. A second sample will be tested to confirm.

NBA DRAFT; CLIPPERS SELECT MURRAY; PRO BASKETBALL: CAL FORWARD DRAFTED AMID 
RUMORS OF IMPENDING MARK JACKSON TRADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers, who may not re-sign star small forward Dominique Wilkins, 
selected Lamond Murray, a 6-foot-7 small forward from California, with the 
seventh pick in Wednesday's NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers selected Greg Minor, a 6-6 guard-forward from Louisville, with 
the 25th pick, which they received from Atlanta in the Dannny Manning deal, 
however there are reports that they'll trade disgruntled guard Mark Jackson and 
the draft rights to Minor to the Indiana Pacers for guard Pooh Richardson, 
forward Malik Sealy and the rights to Nebraska forward Eric Piatkowski, the 
15th selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that there are a lot of rumors, things that we intend to do," Clipper 
General Manager Elgin Baylor said. "We're not finished as far as doing things 
in the future. There are a lot of things that we're going to do, but we're not 
at liberty to talk about it at this particular time." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal could not be consumated Wednesday because of NBA salary cap rules. 
Richardson signed an $18.2 million, seven-year contract extension on draft day 
last year and under NBA rules a player can not be combined in a trade until one 
year after a deal because of aggregate salary cap rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana Coach Larry Brown, who left Richardson off the Pacers' playoff roster, 
likes Jackson, who played for him when he coached the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Piatkowski, who averaged 21.5 points for the Cornhuskers last season, 
impressed NBA scouts at predraft tournaments. He was the MVP of the Phoenix 
Desert Classic, averaging 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who idolizes Wilkins, was happy to join the Clippers even though 
Wilkins, who becomes a free agent Friday, may not be back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited to be with the Clippers," Murray said. "I'm glad to be 
back in California, close to home. I think I have a lot to offer the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'll bring an added scoring threat along with Dominique Wilkins. I've 
idolized Dominique Wilkins for a number of years and I'm looking forward to 
being a teammate of his." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who averaged 24.3 points per game last season to lead the Pacific-10 
in scoring, needed only three seasons to break Kevin Johnson's school scoring 
record with 1,688 points, a 19.1 average. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, the Clippers' sixth lottery pick in the last 10 years, might make an 
immediate impact on the Clippers, whose leading scorers, guard Ron Harper and 
Wilkins, become free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the fact that he can do several things," Baylor said. "He can really 
shoot the basketball, and that's something we have lacked-- a terrific 
perimeter shooter from the (small forward) position. He can run the floor very 
well and finish the play on the fast break and he's a good postup player." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper scout Barry Hecker agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started scouting I asked 'What makes a player?' and they said, 
'The guy who pops out at you,' " Hecker said. "Lamond Murray was the guy who 
popped out at me. He's got all kinds of talent. He could be an All-Star if he 
works at it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was the most skilled small forward in the draft. I thought he 
was more skilled than (Minnesota's) Donyell Marshall (the fourth player 
drafted)." 
</P>
<P>
 A first cousin of Portland forward Tracy Murray, who renounced his final year 
of eligibility at UCLA two years ago to enter the NBA draft, Murray gave up his 
senior season at Cal to enter the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who benefitted from playing the final two seasons of his college 
career with All-American point guard Jason Kidd, the second player drafted, 
thinks he'll prosper without him. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can say what they want, but I don't think I'll have problems scoring 
without him on the floor," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor, who averaged 13.8 points, 6.1 rebounds and 2.5 assists last season, 
will probably play small forward, Baylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers waived forward Tom Tolbert, who averaged 3.8 points and 2.2 
rebounds in 49 games last season. . . . . The Clippers also signed free agent 
Tony Massenburg, a 6-9 forward who has spent the last two seasons in Spain. 
</P>

JIM MURRAY: HERE COMES NEW BREED OF TRAINER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Horse trainers as a class used to be the most secretive bunch on the planet. 
They made atomic spies look gregarious. The guy next door usually had no idea 
what they did for a living -- rob banks, maybe. Or work for the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do you think racehorses work out at or near dawn? Because they can't 
sleep? Naw. They work out at dawn in near darkness because horse trainers like 
to work them in poor light. In total darkness if possible. They didn't want the 
clockers to get any idea how fast their horses could go. Their whole life was 
spent trying to smuggle a 2-1 shot in a race and get 20-1 on him. Lip tattoos 
came into being to counteract practices of gypsy trainers who were not above 
trying to pass a Man O' War off as an $8,000 claimer. I won't say that trainers 
lived under assumed names -- but, sometimes, their horses did. 
</P>
<P>
 And one of the sad stories of the track concerned the time a trainer did talk 
too much. The trainer, named Georgie Odom, needed money and he decided to 
chance slipping a stakes horse, Top Row, into a cheap claiming race to make 
some quick cash and hope nobody put in a claim for him. It was fairly safe that 
Depression year at Narragansett Park because nobody had much money. But the 
night before, in a card game in his hotel room, Odom let slip the information 
about his sure thing so his poker-playing buddies could make a buck at the 
windows. But one of them was Bert Baroni, a Reno barber, who did more than bet 
him. He claimed him. He even won the Santa Anita Handicap with him. And in 
those days, the Santa Anita 'Cap was the first $100,000 race. You could buy 
Rhode Island for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgie Odom had paid for violating the code of silence that had been 
practiced by horsemen long before the Mafia thought it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Times have changed. I went out to the track the other day to interview the 
trainer, Dave Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein is a new breed of horse trainer. He has a horse, The Wicked North by 
name, who might be the best one on America's tracks today, but he's not trying 
to hide his form, work him out in the dark, shop for a price for him or 
otherwise hide his form. He doesn't want to. He wants the whole world to know 
how good he is, even if he goes off at 1-2. Bernstein doesn't care. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave doesn't hide his occupation from the neighbors. You don't have to meet 
him under Shed Row at the crack of dawn. You can meet him at a trackside box in 
the afternoon. And he hands you -- of all things for a trainer -- a calling 
card! Listing not only his home phone number but his number at the track and a 
paging number. You'd think he was a doctor. Or selling insurance. Plain Ben 
Jones and Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons must be having fainting spells someplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse trainers no longer have unlisted lives. And, Stephen Foster to the 
contrary, they don't learn their business at camptown races. They don't all 
come from Missouri. Dave comes from Los Angeles, which is not exactly Jesse 
James country. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he wasn't born in a tack room in Joplin, Dave has always loved 
horses -- even in the days when the only ones he had were stuffed animals. 
</P>
<P>
 His dad, a respectable businessman, couldn't understand why Dave didn't just 
lust for a mag-wheeled Camaro or a two-wheeled desert bike like the rest of his 
generation here. Dad thought horse racing was an occupation for a guy with his 
own deck or dice, but son Dave was sneaking into racetracks when he was too 
young to make a bet. 
</P>
<P>
 He not only hung around the homestretch, he hung around the backstretch. He 
briefly weighed a career in veterinary medicine but hankered to condition 
horses more than medicate them. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been said you learn more training bad horses than you do good ones. If 
true, Dave Bernstein had a master's degree. He had enough bad horses. He even 
"stabled" some of them in empty lots near his home till he could wangle prized 
stable spaces at the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 With The Wicked North, he hopes to win more than races. He hopes to win horse 
of the year with him at the Eclipse Awards. To that end, he will go into this 
Saturday's prestigious Hollywood Gold Cup at Hollywood Park as the high weight 
and favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold Cup champions have made horse of the year eight times beginning with the 
legendary Seabiscuit, about whom movies were made, and continuing through 
Swaps, Affirmed, Ferdinand and Round Table, a veritable Who's Who of Racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein wants the world to know all about The Wicked North. His life used to 
be a pretty well-kept secret. Where good horses used to go for millions at 
auction, The Wicked North cost a measly $10,000, or a little more than a saddle 
pony when Bernstein picked him out for owner Phil Hersh. "I liked him in the 
ring because he was a big athletic-looking colt," Bernstein recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 But The Wicked North really blew his cover when the great rider, Kent 
Desormeaux, got aboard him one morning at Del Mar. Desormeaux, who once won 598 
races in a single year, knew a good horse when got on one, and he came back 
from his ride whistling. 
</P>
<P>
 A big (17 hands), powerful (1,200 pounds) son of Northern Dancer, The Wicked 
North could be joining an elite of the track, i.e., horses who have won the 
Santa Anita Handicap and the Hollywood Gold Cup in the same year. Horses such 
as Round Table, Affirmed, Greinton. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished first in last year's Santa Anita Handicap. But the record book 
shows he finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened was, he impeded the progress of a Wayne Lukas horse called My 
Rakalu at the three-sixteenths pole. The rules of the game called for him to be 
placed behind Myrakalu, who finished fourth. The Wicked North won the race by a 
length and a half over Stuka and Bien Bien, but they got the money. When he was 
dropped to fourth, the difference was more than lengths, it was money. First 
prize was $550,000. Fourth was $75,000. A half-million dollar mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 That too is the horse trainer's life. Just when you're reaching for the pot, 
you turn over a deuce on the last card. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein and Hersh never lost faith in the colt. After he traveled to 
Arkansas earlier this year to sweep the Oaklawn handicap, then returned to 
Hollywood Park to win the Californian, someone asked Hersh if this was the best 
horse he ever had. Hersh replied sternly "He's the best horse anyone ever had!" 
</P>
<P>
 Horsemen have certainly changed. Ben Jones probably wouldn't have wanted an 
Eclipse Award. It would ruin the odds. His horse might even go off at even 
money. You might as well work him out in broad daylight.

<P>
 The NCAA Presidents Commission, in decisions that could anger many coaches and 
administrators, is refusing to go along with softened academic requirements and 
is forcing a football playoff committee to disband. 
</P>
<P>
 A special academic committee had recommended on Tuesday that toughened 
freshman standards, Prop. 16, be relaxed. The committee said an additional 500 
minority athletes would graduate under its new proposal, which reduces the 
importance of standardized test scores many blacks label as racially 
discriminatory.

DUCKS DO MORE DEALING THAN DRAFTING; HOCKEY: ANAHEIM TRADES LONEY AND HILL, 
GETS KURVERS FROM ISLANDERS TO HELP POWER PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks traded their first captain, Troy Loney, during the second day 
of the NHL entry draft Wednesday, and in a separate deal parted with defenseman 
Sean Hill, the player who scored the team's first goal. 
</P>
<P>
 But they came away with veteran New York Islander defenseman Tom Kurvers, who 
they hope will inject some offense into a power play that was often powerless 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, he's one of the best point men on the power play playing in the 
league," said Duck Coach Ron Wilson, whose team's power-play efficiency of 
14.4% was the worst in the NHL. "We'll certainly miss Troy's personality in the 
room and his toughness in the corners, but we had to do it to get something we 
needed last year. We certainly needed to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurvers, 31, who had nine goals and 40 points in 66 games last season and has 
played 637 games for six NHL teams, was acquired for Loney in a deal that 
didn't involve any draft picks. With the addition of Kurvers and first-round 
pick Oleg Tverdovsky, if he is ready, Wilson said the Ducks' power play has 
been improved "tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks sent Hill, 24, to Ottawa along with their ninth-round pick for the 
Senators' third-round pick, which General Manager Jack Ferreira then sent to 
Tampa Bay for a later third-round pick as well as a fourth-round pick in 1995. 
It was Hill who scored the first goal in Duck history at 4:13 of the second 
period of 7-2 opening-night loss to Detroit last October. He finished the 
season with a career-high 27 points but was sometimes a defensive liability. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks now have said goodby to three players who had key roles in the birth 
of their franchise, with Loney and Hill following Ron Tugnutt, who was in goal 
for the team's first victory and was later traded to Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved it in Anaheim. I had a great time," said Loney, 30, who had 13 goals 
and 19 points in 62 games last season, sitting out about a quarter of the 
season because of a knee injury. "(The trade) is quite a shock. It came out of 
the blue." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' second day was a quiet one, but they left elated with their picks 
in the first three rounds, adding Russian winger Vitali Yachmenev in the third 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yachmenev, 18, came to North America last year to play for North Bay in the 
Ontario Hockey League and continue learning English. He put up striking 
offensive numbers -- 61 goals and 113 points in 66 games. His flaw is 
considered to be his 5-foot-9, 180-pound build. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a prolific goal-scorer," said King General Manager Sam McMaster, who 
previously was general manager at Sudbury in the OHL and used five of the 
team's eight picks on OHL players -- including the top three. "(Yachmenev) will 
go back to North Bay next year and he'll have an excellent opportunity to move 
in after a year in the minors." 
</P>
<P>
 The coup of the Kings' draft was getting goalie Jamie Storr in the first round 
-- a player many observers think will be a franchise goalie. Somewhat lost in 
the shuffle was Matt Johnson, a 6-5, 225-pound winger who can hardly get lost 
in any crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a monster," said King Coach Barry Melrose, who has long pushed for more 
size in the organization and now has the player acknowledged to be the biggest 
in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the return of Marty McSorley and the prospect of adding some other 
physical players -- the Kings are considering pursuing Detroit's Bob Probert, 
who becomes a restricted free agent on Friday -- Melrose isn't ruling out the 
chance Johnson could be in the NHL next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Matt he should come to camp with the idea of making the L.A. Kings," 
Melrose said. "He's got to be an enforcer and take the heat off Marty. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the type of player who can develop at the NHL level as well as at the 
junior level." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's 233 penalty minutes playing with Peterborough in the OHL are an 
indication of his fighting ability. Though McMaster says he is "not a goon," 
Johnson's skating and other skills are somewhat more limited.

 "He's the toughest guy in the draft," one scout said. "If he had the whole 
package at 6-5, you'd be looking at Brett Lindros." 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster's first draft definitely bore his OHL stamp, and he chose two of his 
former players from Sudbury -- seventh-rounder Luc Gagne and eighth-rounder 
Andrew Dale.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they prove me right, we got two bona fide players late," McMaster said. 
"If they prove me wrong, it's a seventh and an eighth pick. I wouldn't take a 
chance on inside information in the second or third round, but in the seventh 
or eighth, it's all up-side."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; WITH TWO GAMES LEFT, SECOND ROUND IS FAR 
FROM SET

 Because of the system used to determine first-, second- and third-place teams 
in World Cup group play, Romania must wait until today's final first-round 
games before learning who it will play Sunday at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 As winner of Group A, Romania is expected to play Bulgaria or Italy in the 
second round, but there are a number of scenarios that could change 
everything.Italy finished third in Group E, but depending on tonight's matches, 
Argentina, Bulgaria or Nigeria could finish third in Group D. If the 
third-place team from Group D qualifies for the round of 16, Romania will play 
that team. If only two teams from Group D advance, Romania will play Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina, which leads Group D, will finish first and play Monday in Foxboro, 
Mass., if it defeats or ties Bulgaria tonight. Bulgaria would need at least a 
tie to advance to the second round as the third-place team. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Argentina loses by enough goals, and Nigeria defeats Greece by enough 
goals at Foxboro, the Argentines would finish third. Nigeria would finish third 
with a big loss, and, get this: Greece still could finish third if it were to 
win by, say, 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
 For Argentina, a close loss or tie might mean a second-round match against 
Italy. Otherwise, the Argentines are likely to play Belgium. ELLIOTT ALMOND

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; FIFA IN TUNE WITH OTHER SPORTS; DRUGS: 
SOCCER'S GOVERNING AGENCY USES RANDOM TESTING BUT DEVIATES IN AREA OF 
SANCTIONING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although soccer has not been stung by doping controversies the way track and 
field and weightlifting have, the sport has modeled its drug-testing policy 
after the International Olympic Committee, one of the most strident anti-drug 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, FIFA, soccer's governing body, has adopted IOC guidelines except 
in the area of sanctioning. 
</P>
<P>
 "In soccer, it's really rare to have drug problems," said Anthony Daley, chief 
medical officer for World Cup '94. 
</P>
<P>
 But random testing is used during World cup matches to protect the integrity 
of the sport. Under FIFA regulations, two players are randomly selected from 
each team after each World Cup match and are required to give a urine sample. 
</P>
<P>
 One such sample, taken Saturday from aging star Diego Maradona of Argentina, 
showed traces of ephedrine, a banned substance found in over-the-counter 
medications. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA officials will announce today in Irving, Tex., whether Maradona failed 
the drug test and will be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephedrine is included under a long list of stimulants banned by soccer, the 
IOC, the NCAA and other sports organizations. Also listed among the group is 
caffeine in excessive amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Other generic lists of banned substances are narcotic analgesics, anabolic 
steroids, beta-blockers and diuretics, which are taken to mask muscle-building 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA's methods for collecting samples are uniform with other organizations. 
Each specimen is divided into two, and the "B" sample is analyzed if the "A" 
sample is positive. The system is designed to protect the individual against a 
false-positive or laboratory mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, FIFA's policy deviates from most organizations in its system of 
sanctioning. 
</P>
<P>
 If a result proves positive on both samples, the Organizing Committee forms a 
special commission, which determines the degree of responsibility and then 
metes out punishment. Banned Stimulants 
</P>
<P>
 Some banned stimulants and over-the-counter substances in which they are 
contained: 
</P>
<P>
 Stimulant: Pseudoephedrine 
</P>
<P>
 Over-the-counter product: Actifed, Ambenyl, Amemine, Afrinol, Chlorafed, 
Chlortrimeton-DC, Co-Tylenol, Deconamine, Dimacol, Disphoral, Drixoral, 
Emprazil, Fedhist, Histalet, Isoclor, Lo-Tussin, Nasalspan, Novafed, Nucofed, 
Plu-Histine, Polaramine, Expectorant, Pseudo-Bid, PseudoHist, Rhymosyn, Rondec, 
Ryna, Sudaged, Triprolidine, Tussend. 
</P>
<P>
 Stimulant: Phenylephrine 
</P>
<P>
 Over-the-counter product: Coricidin, Dristan, NTZ, Neo-Synephrine, Sinex  
</P>
<P>
 Stimulant: Ephedrine 
</P>
<P>
 Over-the-counter product: Bronkaid, Collyrium with Ephedrine, Pazo 
Suppository, Wyanoid Suppository, Vitronol, Nose Drops, Nyquil Nightime Cold 
Medicine, Herbal Teas

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; EPHEDRINE USE HAS SIDE EFFECT OF BIG 
TROUBLE; DRUG: SWIMMER DEMONT LOST A GOLD MEDAL IN 1972 FOR TAKING COLD 
MEDICINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It can lurk in the most innocent cold medicine, herbal tea or nasal spray. It 
is very common, but for an athlete subject to drug testing, it can be very 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Ephedrine is a component in many over-the-counter cold medications. It is 
classified as a stimulant and considered by the international governing bodies 
of many sports to be an illegal performance-enhancing drug. Increasingly, 
ephedrine is at the center of many thorny legal and ethical battles regarding 
drug testing and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina star Diego Maradona has tested positive for ephedrine and faces a 
World Cup ban. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the drug stems from its potential for dual use: Taken as 
medically indicated, ephedrine is an effective antihistamine and can offer 
relief from some cold symptoms. Taken in large doses or in its pure synthetic 
form, ephedrine can act as a powerful stimulant that some sports officials 
believe can offer a competitive advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Stimulants have long been on banned lists for Olympic athletes and FIFA's list 
of prohibited substances is nearly identical to the International Olympic 
Committee's. It was an Olympic athlete, Rick DeMont, who first brought the 
ephedrine problem to light. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMont, a U.S. swimmer in the 1972 Olympics, had taken asthma medication 
before one of his races. The medication registered as a stimulant during drug 
testing and DeMont was forced to give up his gold medal in the 400-meter 
freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 In track and field, the problem resurfaced a few years ago. After a spate of 
random drug tests that revealed ephedrine, officials in the sport struggled to 
determine a mechanism that would separate "inadvertent use" by athletes 
treating colds, and deliberate use as a performance enhancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Track officials also considered the issue of whether ephedrine, even in large 
amounts, was truly a stimulant that would benefit an athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussions are ongoing and little has been resolved. The most important 
point, officials say, is for athletes to consult physicians or call the U.S. 
Olympic Committee drug hot line before taking any medications they are unsure 
of or unfamiliar with. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer, however, has seldom dealt with ephedrine and its sometimes confusing 
uses, although FIFA has a strong stance against drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. team physician Dr. Bert Mandelbaum experienced the minefield of potential 
drug conflicts when he sought FIFA advice on treatment for Eric Wynalda's skin 
rash before the first U.S. game against Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandelbaum said the first course of treatment he recommended involved a 
cortisone derivative, which appeared on the FIFA list of banned substances. He 
contacted the UCLA drug testing lab, which handles all World Cup drug tests, to 
determine if the cortisone would be allowed. Finally, Mandelbaum appealed to 
FIFA and was told, "No is no." 
</P>
<P>
 He then turned to antihistamines to treat the rash and even then was mindful 
of avoiding over-the-counter medications that might appear on a test as 
ephedrine or other stimulants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had bad dreams about the list and neglecting something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandelbaum said the U.S. team has been undergoing drug education for about a 
year and the players have been periodically tested. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical staff has warned the players not to take any medications without 
first clearing them with team doctors.

<P>
 GROUP D at Foxboro Stadium, Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Greece vs. Nigeria 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 4:30 p.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: International Channel, ESPN2 (6:30 p.m.) ESPN (9:30 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: The only important battle here will be between the Nigerians 
and their stamina. Will they have enough energy to score five goals? Six, 
maybe? How about a dozen? In two games, the Nigerians have outscored their 
opponents 4-2. The Greeks have been outscored, 8-0, the only scoreless team in 
the tournament. The Nigerians will pit forward Rashidi Yekini and midfielder 
Emmanuel Amunike against a Greek defense that will be missing injured Stelios 
Manolas. The Greeks will counter with Savas Kofidis against tough defenders 
Uche Okechukwu and Chidi Nwanu. The only bright spot for the Greeks is that 
Nigeria's top defender, Austin Eguavoen, is questionable because of an ankle 
injury. This overall team matchup represents the Greeks' worst nightmare 
because the Nigerians will not only score against them, they will beat them up. 
The Nigerians averaged 24 fouls in their first two games, which projects to a 
World Cup-high 72 fouls after tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: The Nigerians need a victory or a tie to advance to the second 
round in their first World Cup appearance. The Greeks, also in their World Cup 
debut, would need to win by nine goals to advance. "Obviously Greece is going 
home now, but there are Greek players who have something to prove to the rest 
of the world," Nigerian Coach Clemens Westerhof said. "They will give us a good 
match." Right. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Alkis Panagoulias, the Greek coach who lives in the United States, 
had the right idea when he said, "I prefer every four years to come to the 
World Cup and lose, than to be England and not come to the World Cup." The 
problem is, England has a better chance of winning this game. Nigeria by 7 1/2.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; DOES U.S. TEAM KNOW WHAT IT'S UP AGAINST?; 
SECOND ROUND: PLAYERS SAY THEY AREN'T AWED BY UPCOMING OPPONENT BRAZIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If ignorance is bliss, then the U.S. team is the happiest team ever to face . 
. . who was it again? Oh, yes, Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the prospect of playing three-time World Cup champion Brazil in the 
second round Monday at Palo Alto might chill even the warmest heart, the U.S. 
team seems to be wrapping itself in a comforting cloak of unawareness. Either 
the players are not kidding when they say they don't know much about the team, 
or it's a defense mechanism they have developed to block out the frightening 
specters of Romario, Bebeto and Rai. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest with you, I don't know any of the guys on their team," U.S. 
defender Alexi Lalas said. "They're not my idols. People tell me they are 
great. Nobody thinks we can beat Brazil, nobody in the whole world. I bet you 
people will throw down a lot of money that we don't win." 
</P>
<P>
 It might be indicative of the U.S. team's soccer background that many of its 
players' knowledge of Brazil, one of the sports' greatest teams, is limited. 
Many of this country's best soccer players grew up idolizing stars in other 
sports and don't have the encyclopedic knowledge of soccer history that comes 
naturally to children growing up in more soccer-crazed countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Tab Ramos, who plays professionally in Spain, said the difference for the 
European-based players is that they see Brazilian players every day and know 
what they can do. "I know what they are capable of and what they mean to their 
teams," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic, while careful to praise Brazil, is equally quick 
to add his own spin, saying that anything can happen. Milutinovic does not want 
his players to hold their Brazilian counterparts in such awe that they abandon 
confidence in their ability and question if they should be on the same field.

 "The more low key we are about our opponents, the better it is," forward Roy 
Wegerle said. "Once you start thinking, 'They've got this great player or that 
great player,' that automatically subconsciously downplays your own confidence. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for us not to know too much about them and then do a little bit of 
homework and know what we're up against. But to be in awe of them or fear them, 
if we do that, we're only going to downplay our own strengths; that's not what 
we want to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen them play most of their games. In my opinion, they are the best 
team in this tournament. If we are not going to win this thing, then I hope 
they do. They play the game the way it should be played. They are entertaining 
and they know how to win games. We know they are the best team. We need to 
respect them, as long as it doesn't turn into fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Few on the U.S. team are able to discuss at length the tactical style of 
Brazil or have much knowledge about of the country's soccer history. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ramos: "We definitely don't want to have too much respect, but we have to 
know what we're up against. Brazil right now is probably the team that has 
played the best in this World Cup. It's good to have respect for the other 
team, but knowing that if we play our best and we defend well, and we have a 
little bit of luck, maybe Brazil will have a bad day and we can win. Why not?"

NBA DRAFT; BLOCKBUSTER TRADE THAT WASN'T OVERSHADOWS PLAYER SELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen did not become a Seattle SuperSonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Kemp did not become a Chicago Bull. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA draft turned out to be less exciting without the reported trade of 
superstars that would have shaken the balance of power but finally fell 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls, three-time champions from 1991-93 and the No. 1 team in the East 
going into the last weekend this season, have decided that without Michael 
Jordan they should begin rebuilding and recently began shopping Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
 They found an interested party in the SuperSonics, 63-game winners last 
season, now being run by a hastily assembled front office after the departure 
of General Manager Bob Whitsitt. After a spring of turmoil that included their 
first-round playoff loss, SuperSonic Coach George Karl was even willing to 
discuss trading Kemp, at 24 four years younger than Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal they were working on would have sent Pippen, Will Perdue and the 
Bulls' No. 21 pick to Seattle for Kemp, 35-year-old Ricky Pierce and the 
SuperSonics' No. 11 pick. But talks broke off Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have tremendous respect for Scottie Pippen but I have tremendous respect 
for Shawn Kemp, too," Karl said. "It's not very often you get the opportunity 
to talk about a great player. But we think Shawn is a great player, too, and 
he's going to be a great player for many, many years." 
</P>
<P>
 The draft was almost anticlimactic. The selections went largely according to 
the consensus -- Glenn Robinson to the Milwaukee Bucks, Jason Kidd to the 
Dallas Mavericks, Grant Hill to the Detroit Pistons, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bucks got Robinson, the college player of the year, a 6-foot-7, 240-pound 
powerhouse of a small forward who averaged 30 points as a sophomore and made 
39% of his three-point shots in his two seasons at Purdue. With a second 
first-round choice, they got Eric Mobley, a 6-10, 260-pound center from Pitt. 
With 6-11 Vin Baker, who had a big rookie season, Milwaukee suddenly has a 
young front line bursting with potential after the team won only 20 games last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks took Kidd, considered by some, including Magic Johnson, to be 
the finest point guard prospect since Johnson in 1979. Then with the 19th pick, 
they got Tony Dumas, a talented 6-4 guard from Missouri Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pistons took Hill, Duke's all-around star who had measured out to be even 
bigger than anyone thought -- 6-8, 230 pounds -- after playing both guard spots 
and small forward for the Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minnesota Timberwolves took Marshall, a 6-9 small forward who was the Big 
East's player of the year. With the third pick on the second round, they got 
Boston College's Howard Eisley, a point guard who can shoot but was pushed off 
the first round in the rush for the big players. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Bullets, long in need of big players, grabbed 6-8 1/2, 
253-pound Juwan Howard, who had been the other Twin Tower to Chris Webber at 
Michigan, then found Marquette's 7-1 Jim McIlvaine, an unpolished shot blocker 
who'd been expected to go on the first round, waiting for them five picks into 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Drafting No. 16, Golden State Coach Warrior Don Nelson pulled his annual 
surprise, selecting Louisville's Cliff Rozier, a 6-10, 260-pound center who had 
scared so many teams off with his lethargic play in the NCAA tournament that he 
was given a chance of dropping off the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the second round turned into a longshot grab bag. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston Celtics used the 36th pick for a 6-10 Russian, Andrei Fetisov, then 
traded his rights and forward Ed Pinckney to the Bucks for Blue Edwards and 
Derek Strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen-year-old Dontonio Wingfield, who left Cincinnati after his freshman 
year, went to Seattle at No. 37, where he probably won't get a guaranteed 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 At No. 44, the Indiana Pacers took Damon Bailey, the home-state idol whose 
career at Indiana never lived up to the compliments Bobby Knight lavished on 
him when he saw him playing in eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 At 41, the Pacers selected William Njoku, a 6-9 forward who was born in Ghana, 
attended college in Nova Scotia and played on the Canadian national team. 
</P>
<P>
 At 46, the Bucks took Michigan State's Voshon Lenard, who made himself 
available for the draft after his junior year to the surprise of scouts who 
said he would have been better off staying in school. 
</P>
<P>
 With the last pick, No. 54, the SuperSonics took a 6-11 Serb, Zelkjo Rebraca, 
proving basketball is, indeed, international.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; CITY GIVES PIRATES $8 MILLION LOAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh City Council reluctantly tossed an $8 million rescue line to 
the Pittsburgh Pirates by approving a loan designed to keep the team afloat and 
in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, the council approved a $20 million loan to the team.The money hasn't 
yet been repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, losing as much as $1 million a month, owes a $5.4 million interest 
payment to Citibank in August. It has nearly exhausted a $34 million line of 
credit with the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirate president Mark Sauer had said that if the team didn't get the bailout, 
a new Three Rivers Stadium lease and a salary cap, the Pirates could be sold, 
possibly to out-of-town buyers who would relocate the 107-year-old franchise.

 Seattle left-hander Greg Hibbard is expected to miss the rest of the season 
with a partially torn rotator cuff. . . . The New York Yankees put infielder 
Mike Gallego and catcher Bob Melvin on the 15-day disabled list and replaced 
them on the roster with Kevin Elster and Matt Nokes. . . . Atlanta third 
baseman Terry Pendleton, bothered by a lower back strain, was placed on the 
15-day disabled list, retroactive to June 22.

SALSA STILL COUNTS ON WRIGHT FOR LEADERSHIP, INSPIRATION; SOCCER: VETERAN 
PLAYER IS READY TO FILL ANY ROLE FOR HIS TEAM, WHICH OPENS ITS SEASON FRIDAY AT 
DENVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Wright grimaced with every movement of his leg but refused to do what 
would have helped: sit down. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, a standout Salsa forward, suffered from a pulled left hamstring during 
the American Professional Soccer League championship game Oct. 2 against 
Colorado at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't catch up to the ball, I couldn't accelerate past the defenders, I 
couldn't plant to shoot," Wright said. "It was frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite excruciating pain, Wright remained on the field in Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? "I had to play," Wright said. "Morale and team spirit would have all gone 
down if my teammates didn't see me out there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa lost to the Foxes, 3-1, in overtime. An important point, however, 
was made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul is one of our team leaders," sweeper Danny Pena said. "He's not as vocal 
as some of the other guys, but he gets the respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows when it's time to come to work and what to do when he gets there." 
</P>
<P>
 Said midfielder Yari Allnutt: "He's the most reliable guy around." 
</P>
<P>
 The APSL's second-leading scorer last season, Wright, 24, is one of the 
league's swiftest players. Wright was a key to success in the Salsa's inaugural 
campaign and he is looking for more this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Opportunity No. 1 comes Friday night. The Salsa opens against Colorado at 
Denver's Mile High Stadium at 6:05, matching last season's title-game 
opponents. The Salsa's first home game is July 24 against Seattle at Titan 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good thing we're playing Colorado to open because we can get them out 
of our system right away," Wright said. "We're still very disappointed about 
what happened last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to take what should have been ours -- and that's the 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright (5 feet 9, 165 pounds) is healthy and ready, a bad combination for 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Wright used his exceptional speed to score 13 goals. That would 
have been enough to lead the league had it not been for his teammate, Paulinho. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulinho, a skilled forward from Brazil, and Wright were involved in a 
friendly race for the scoring crown throughout the season. Paulinho pulled away 
in the final few games to win with 16 goals. They tied for the team lead in 
assists with seven. 
</P>
<P>
 When MVP voting time arrived, Paulinho's name appeared on the most ballots. 
Wright and Pena joined Paulinho as first-team all-league selections. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Paulinho is deserving of the top award, Salsa assistant coach Octavio 
Zambrano said the players' success is tied to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The combination of Paulinho and Paul," Zambrano said, "is a combination that 
is deadly." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright routinely creates havoc against the best-laid defensive plans by 
simply, well, outrunning the defense. When not creating easy scoring chances 
for himself, he helps teammates by drawing the attention of wary defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the fastest guy I've ever played with," Pena said. "He's a smoker. He 
can take over a 1-1 game at anytime." 
</P>
<P>
 Speed, though, is only half the story. Control is the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speed by itself is not enough in this game," Zambrano said. "This is not a 
track where you just have to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always have to think about variables, like the position of the ball and 
the position of your teammates. He has tremendous acceleration with control." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright has played professionally since graduating from San Diego Grossmont 
High in 1987. He was a member of four Major Indoor Soccer League championships 
while playing with the San Diego Sockers, among other teams, before signing 
with the Salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 At every stop, his legs have provided a spark. 
</P>
<P>
 "My speed gives us another dimension," Wright said. "When you have speed, and 
you have the other skills to go with it, other players are basically at your 
mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can do whatever you want to do whenever you want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why having Wright at full strength is a must. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was a big factor as to why we were not successful in the 
(championship)," Zambrano said. "He is such a pivotal part of our offense. We 
suffered because he was not 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 Understandably, Wright was down after the loss. Fortunately, Wright's longtime 
girlfriend, Jennifer Boyd, 22, was there to help him up. She always is. 
</P>
<P>
 They have dated since high school and Boyd has been as much a part of Wright's 
career as his coaches and teammates. In the often unstable world of 
professional soccer, Boyd has been a pillar. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been there for the good and bad," Wright said. "She's very important to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 With Boyd's support, Wright strives to better his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that I wasn't at my top form last year," Wright said. "I'm looking to 
reach that top level this season."

BYRD READY TO JOIN BIG BOYS; EX-RANCHO ALAMITOS STANDOUT LEAVES COLUMBIA FOR 
STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It became a pregame ritual on Saturdays, former high school football teammates 
Jeff Byrd and Leon Vickers calling across the country to wish each other luck 
before kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it was Byrd, a freshman running back at Columbia, calling from New 
York City, preparing for an Ivy League game. 
</P>
<P>
 Other times it was Vickers calling from Palo Alto, where he started part-time 
as a freshman at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Topics ranged from which team they were playing, how practice went, school, 
friends, the weather or how their alma mater, Rancho Alamitos, had fared on 
Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 But the discussion always turned to one subject -- why was Byrd, the state's 
leading high school running back two years ago, playing at the Division I-AA 
level? 
</P>
<P>
 And it was Vickers who was the voice of reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff, it's all hype. You can play Division I ball. You can play here at 
Stanford. You should be playing here.  
</P>
<P>
 "He couldn't get over the fact that everyone in Division I wasn't running a 
4.2-second 40 or bench pressing 500 pounds," Byrd said. "It got me to thinking 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Overlooked by recruiters because of his size, Byrd is convinced he can play 
Division I ball and will try to prove it this fall as a walk-on at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Ivy League to the Pac 10? Not an easy transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't impressed with the level of play in the Ivy League," Byrd said. "I 
always wondered if I could play at Stanford, and I have to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had heard how well Leon was doing there, making the travel squad and 
starting a couple of games, and I thought, 'Yeah, I can play at that level, 
too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He had proved himself a worthy recruit as a high school senior, leading the 
state in rushing with 2,596 yards and breaking the Orange County single-season 
record set by former Servite standout Derek Brown, now a starter with the New 
Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Byrd's incredible senior season, most top Division I schools passed on 
him because of his size (155 pounds) and speed (4.68 in the 40). 
</P>
<P>
 While Vickers was wined and dined by Stanford and Rancho Alamitos quarterback 
Marshall Brown was wooed by Fresno State, Byrd waited and waited for a call 
from a top program. It never came. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was small and nobody wanted to give me a shot, even though I did the job in 
high school," Byrd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada liked him and Hawaii showed some interest late in the recruiting 
season, but Byrd, a straight-A student, wanted to go the Ivy League route for 
academics. Yale, Dartmouth, Princeton and Columbia were more than interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivy League schools play a Division I-AA schedule and don't offer athletic 
scholarships. Byrd landed a few academic scholarships, but it was only a small 
dent in Columbia's $26,000 annual tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk I am taking (by transferring to Stanford) wasn't with the money," he 
said. "Columbia and Stanford cost the same. But I was walking away from a 
three-year starting position at Columbia, and that's not easy to do." 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman, he had starred on special teams, becoming the first freshman to 
score a touchdown in an Ivy League game when he returned a blocked punt for a 
touchdown in a 27-24 loss to Colgate. It was the first year Ivy League freshmen 
were eligible to play varsity football. 
</P>
<P>
 His playing time on offense was somewhat limited, but the offensive backfield 
was hit hard by graduation, and, barring injury, Byrd was the team's star of 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked Columbia a lot," he said. "I really enjoyed it. I played some last 
year and coming into the spring I was going to be the starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything bad to say about New York City, Columbia, or the 
football program. I loved it there. But I've always wanted to play Division I 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
 With Vickers' support, Byrd put his plan in motion. He applied to Stanford in 
December, was accepted in March, met with coaches in early June, then visited 
the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches saw a different Jeff Byrd than the one they had seen in high 
school. During his freshman year, he had added 20 pounds to his high school 
playing weight of 155 pounds and decreased his 40-yard dash time by 
thirteen-hundreths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd sent Cardinal running backs coach Bill Singler a highlight tape from his 
senior year. No recruiter had seen the tape because Byrd and former Rancho 
Alamitos Coach Mark Miller made the film after recruiting season had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching the film, Singler agreed to meet with Byrd, who "asked for a 
fair evaluation." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been B.S.-ed by recruiters before," Byrd said. "They would come by and 
tell me, 'You're great,' then I would never hear from them again. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this was a different feeling I was getting from Stanford. They gave me a 
fair evaluation of everything. Plus, I came to them with the idea of walking 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 The feedback was encouraging, so Byrd and father, Caryl, visited the campus in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took me in to meet with (Coach) Bill Walsh and it was like, 'Uh, what do 
I say?' " Byrd said. "Coach asked me how many yards I ran for in high school. 
When I told him, he said: 'Why aren't you already here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford offensive coordinator Terry Shea and Singler refused to comment on 
Byrd, saying the school still hadn't received a release form from Columbia, a 
formality for a football transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is that Jeff's on our list and he has been invited here for 
fall camp," Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd understands there's a certain risk in transferring to a top Division I 
program, where walk-ons are often fighting for more than a spot on the depth 
chart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I had heard horror stories about walk-ons," Byrd said. "Sean Cheatham 
(former Rancho Alamitos standout) walked on at USC and remembered always being 
late to practice because he was taped last, after the scholarship players, and 
was the last one to get a uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to Leon about that, and he said it's not that way at all at 
Stanford. You're treated like you're part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd has a modest goal this season -- play special teams and make the travel 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
 But the coaching staff has warned him -- be ready to play. Injuries at the 
tailback position could push him into some playing time in an offense that 
includes All-Americans Steve Stenstrom at quarterback and Justin Armour at 
wideout. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pro-style offense and it won't beat you up like an I-formation," Byrd 
said. "The way they use their running backs, you can expect to see five or six 
runs and eight or nine passes a game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal return starting tailback Mike Mitchell (124 yards rushing, 154 
receiving) and fullback Ethan Allen (260 yards rushing, 313 receiving). The 
incoming recruiting calls include Valencia High's Chris Draft and prep 
standouts Corey Hill and Anthony Bookman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches said going into spring they had six running backs but they came 
out with only two (because of injuries)," Byrd said. "They told me that the 
position is wide open, and everything is up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Byrd will report to Stanford in mid-August, along with the incoming freshmen. 
As a transfer, he's starting over, with a whole new offense to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know Play A from Play B right now," he said. "The coaches have told 
me I can make an impact as a walk-on, and next year, they have 25 scholarships 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm leaving a lot behind at Columbia, but until I prove myself at 
Stanford, I won't give up. I know that until I get there, I will always be 
second-guessing myself."

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; AT 24, THE WORLD IS OPEN TO ELS

<P>
 Whither Ernie? We probably will be seeing a lot more of the new U.S. Open 
champion, headed for greatness in the opinion of Jack Nicklaus and others who 
say they know a phenom when they see one drive the green and curl in nasty 
35-footers. 
</P>
<P>
 Els, of South Africa, said he plans to play 15 PGA Tour events next year, 
which would have been the minimum for keeping his card if he hadn't earned a 
10-year exemption by winning the Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I will play a lot more tournaments (in the United States)," Els said. 
"But I will always play around the world, I think. For the time being, I am 
still pretty young and I can travel around. I will play Europe, I will play 
America, I will play Japan, I will play all over the place. But I will play a 
lot more in America, yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 That's probably a good idea. In seven events on the PGA Tour this year, Els 
has collected $529,130. He has made the cut six times and has three top-10 
finishes -- first in the U.S. Open at Oakmont, second at the Buick Classic and 
tied for eighth at the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 On the PGA European Tour, he is third on the money list, trailing only Masters 
champion Jose Maria Olazabal and U.S. Open co-runner-up Colin Montgomerie. 
</P>
<P>
 Els has moved from 11th place to No. 7 in the SONY rankings, passing Paul 
Azinger, David Frost, Ian Woosnam and Montgomerie. 
</P>
<P>
 As well as things have been going for him, Els said he isn't going to change. 
He has earned a reputation as an affable, gum-chewing, big-money player with 
strength and finesse, not at all a bad combination. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More Els: Maybe we should have seen him coming. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he achieved the first hat-trick of the South African Open, PGA and 
Masters since Gary Player in 1979. Player was 43 when he did it. Els was 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Player sent a note to Els the morning of the playoff and Els found it hanging 
in his locker at Oakmont. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last add Els: Loren Roberts, who lost to Els in a sudden-death playoff for the 
Open title, said that at 38 he envies the 24-year-old Els' game. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was Roberts doing at 24? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was an assistant pro working at Morro Bay, giving lessons, renting carts, 
selling green fees and making pimiento cheese sandwiches and hot dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fuzzy: Even though he shot a four-round total of 299 and finished in a tie for 
58th at the U.S. Open, Fuzzy Zoeller maintained his sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played ugly golf, but I almost broke 300, so I must be better than a 
bowler," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here's Johnny: Johnny Miller, who has won 24 tournaments, is wondering why 
only one player, Nick Price, has won more than once this year on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is pretty amazing, isn't it?" Miller said. "I wish there was a way of 
getting inside all these players' heads and seeing how much they really play to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have players that obviously always want to win, but there was a time . . . 
Nicklaus would be first to admit that the whole focus of the week was to get 
rested up enough or prepared enough -- like Hogan did -- that you would go win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it is more go through the motions of doing all the things you are 
supposed to do with the hopes of maybe it might be your week once a year or 
twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's being realistic for the players, because there is (sic) so many 
good players now. But I can't believe that you don't get more multiple winners, 
especially out of the talents of a (Fred) Couples, (Greg) Norman." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: For what it's worth, Golf Digest predicts Price will win the British 
Open. Golf Digest also said the favorite at the U.S. Open  
</P>
<P>
 was Nick Faldo, who missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Domination: If they were 22 instead of 54 and 64, would Jack Nicklaus and 
Arnold Palmer dominate golf today? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any player who has been dominant in his time would be dominant today," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you brought Byron Nelsons, Ben Hogans, if you brought Bobby Joneses, 
Walter Hagens, I think all these players would have been dominant players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly think Arnie and I would probably fall in the same category." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Stamps next? For the golfer who has everything, a Scottsdale company has come 
up with "golf paper," which is paper made of traditional pulp, plus actual 
grass clippings from greens. 
</P>
<P>
 The clippings are treated and blended into the paper, which is made of 
recycled material.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; FANMORE TO JOIN FIVE-HORSE FIELD IN THE GOLD CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A field of five will probably be entered this morning for the $750,000 
Hollywood Gold Cup on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Bobby Frankel has decided Fanmore will make his main track debut in 
the 1 1/4-mile Gold Cup, joining The Wicked North, Arcangues, Del Mar Dennis 
and Slew Of Damascus in the race, which will be televised nationally by ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-year-old Lear Fan gelding will be ridden by Corey Nakatani, and Gary 
Stevens will replace Nakatani on Slew Of Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 Third in the Californian behind The Wicked North and Kingdom Found, Slew Of 
Damascus was scheduled to arrive at Hollywood Park early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really happy with his work (five furlongs in 1:00 Tuesday morning at 
Bay Meadows), and all systems are go," said trainer Craig Roberts. "We took the 
bar shoe off his (right front) foot about three days before the work. We wanted 
to make sure he was comfortable before we asked him to do anything stressful on 
the foot." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Mar Dennis, who disappointed in the Californian after winning the Mervyn 
LeRoy, worked a half-mile in 47 3/5 Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been working every five days and galloping a mile to a mile and a half 
on the days when he doesn't work, and he's still put on 10 pounds since his 
last race (June 5)," said trainer Paco Gonzalez. "He's coming up to this race 
very good, and he's going to run well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On his way to his first victory in his ninth start, heavily-favored Boldtopic 
pulled himself up in the final sixteenth of a mile of Wednesday's second race. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-length lead vanished and three others in the field of $32,000 maidens 
-- Family Law, Ballazzi and Freeze Police -- passed him nearing the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux got the 3-year-old Bold Tropic gelding going again, and 
somehow Boldtopic was able to get up and beat Family Law in a photo. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the stewards ruled that he was guilty of interfering with Freeze 
Police and disqualified him, placing the 1-2 favorite fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some solace for owner Blane Schvaneveldt, the quarter horse trainer, 
and trainer Henry Dominguez. Boldtopic was claimed by trainer Charles Pinnell 
for $32,000. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park's American Handicap will be the final race in the National Best 
Seven on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The other six races in the series, which is being run on the holiday as 
opposed to its usual Saturday, are the Suburban Handicap at Belmont Park, the 
Ft. McHenry Handicap at Laurel, the Molly Pitcher at Monmouth Park, the Stars & 
Stripes Handicap at Arlington, the Americana Handicap at Calder and the 
Independence Handicap at Louisiana Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Flotilla, the upset winner of the Hollywood Turf Handicap, will make his 
next start July 24 in the $250,000 Sunset Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-year-old had been under consideration for the American Handicap, but 
trainer Jenine Sahadi decided to wait for the longer Sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure the 1 1/8 miles (of the American) is his best distance and it 
looks like the race is going to come up pretty tough," said Sahadi. Grand 
Flotilla worked seven furlongs in 1:28 4/5 last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Post time on Saturday is noon and the Gold Cup will be run at 1:05 p.m. as the 
third race on the card. . . . Camilla Blu, who won the Convenience Stakes in an 
upset in May, had to be destroyed after breaking her pelvis during last 
Saturday's seventh race. . . . Chris McCarron will ride Kingdom Found for 
trainer Gary Jones in the $350,000 Suburban Handicap on Monday at Belmont Park. 
With McCarron gone Monday, Gary Stevens will ride Semillon in the American 
Handicap. . . . Pat Valenzuela and David Flores have switched agents. 
Valenzuela will now be represented by Jim Pegram, replacing Tony Matos, and 
Matos will represent Flores. . . . The sixth Jockeys Across America Day will be 
held Saturday. The annual event benefits the Don MacBeth Memorial Jockey Fund. 
. . . Paseana, who is expected to return to the races at Del Mar, worked six 
furlongs in 1:13 3/5 Wednesday morning for trainer Ron McAnally. Valiant 
Nature, who is also trained by McAnally, could return in the Swaps Stakes on 
July 23.

LOS ALAMITOS; $400 DEAL TURNS INTO POT OF GOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Schlagel wanted a horse to ride, something cheap and sweet. He paid $400 
and ended up with a well-bred quarter horse mare who took him into the rarely 
sweet and always expensive world of quarter horse breeding and racing. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, years later, he wouldn't have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 Silique, the mare he bought and eventually bred, gave him Rainbow Sun, the 
fastest qualifier and a likely favorite in Friday's $134,000 Los Alamitos 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a freak deal," Schlagel said. "It was a dispersal sale but not through 
a sales company. The owner just hired an auctioneer and I happened to see the 
ad in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlagel bought Silique to ride and then discovered that her breeding -- she 
is by the successful sire Fast Jet -- made her valuable as a broodmare. After a 
couple of false starts, one of his homebreds made it to the races in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainbow Sun, Silique's 1991 foal, earned $49,212 as a 2-year-old. In three 
races this year, the colt won the Anaheim Stake, finished fourth in the El 
Primero Derby trials and won the finals, earning $46,662. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now in our sixth year of getting foals to the races, so it was really 
the make-or-break year for us," Schlagel said. "And so far it's been great." 
</P>
<P>
 As a 2-year-old, Rainbow Sun showed promise but did not always break well. He 
ran 11 races and the three times he pounced from the gates, he won. The colt 
was turned out for a couple of months in the winter and, Schlagel said, 
returned a more mature horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to be looking around in the gate. Now he just looks straight down the 
track," Schlagel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettors have been harder to convince. Ignoring Rainbow Sun's half-length 
victory over Moo Vin First in the El Primero Derby, fans selected Moo Vin First 
as the favorite in the Los Alamitos Derby trial. Rainbow Sun left the gate at 
9-1, the sixth choice of eight. 
</P>
<P>
 But then again, the field for that trial, the second of four trial heats, 
looked like a derby final to many in the stands. Six runners qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainbow Sun, trained by Dennis Givens, was the fastest over 400 yards at 20.02 
seconds. The slowest to qualify, Ima Reb Hot, finished in 20.13, a difference 
of only 0.11 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sticky N Picky, tied with Be Real Now as the second-fastest qualifier, won the 
fourth trial heat. Her trainer, Bob Gilbert started five in the trials and has 
two in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Sticky N Picky would run well," he said. "With her, the whole thing 
is the break because she's so fast if she breaks well. The last one, she didn't 
break well and we just figured it was her first time under the lights." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert's second derby qualifier, Pecuniary Perks, ran a strong race in the 
trials, finishing second to Sheza First Down at 30-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The field for the Los Alamitos Derby: Rainbow Sun, Sticky N Picky, Be Real 
Now, Sheza First Down, Moo Vin First, Artesias Special Gal, Movados, Totally 
Illegal, Pecuniary Perks and Ima Reb Hot. 
</P>

 Jockey Jose Badilla Jr. overcame the rail and a speeding The Fling King to 
pick up his first major stakes victory with Cool Papa Bell in the $100,000 
Kindergarten Futurity on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He broke really well tonight," the 20-year-old Badilla said. "I had to keep 
after him because I could see the horse on the outside closing in. I didn't 
want to waste such a good break." 
</P>
<P>
 James Kelly, who owns the Arizona-bred gelding in partnership with Charles 
Grannon, also wanted to see Cool Papa Bell take advantage of his great start. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way I like to see him break," Kelly said, referring to his 
disappointment in the colt's trial run. "Last time he ran, he was scared to 
death because of the lights." 
</P>
<P>
 Cool Papa Bell is not eligible for any races until the Breeders Classics on 
Dec. 17, so he probably won't see the lights again until then. Kelly shipped 
him back to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fling King, the 6-5 favorite as part of a three-horse entry, broke from 
the fifth spot and never let up under jockey Henry Garcia. He finished a neck 
short. The Blane Schvaneveldt-trained Toll Tracer was third. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Miss Kindergarten Futurity, Ah Sigh beat the 1-2 favorite, Dicey 
Secret, running the 350 yards in 17.71 seconds. For the third time in as many 
races since the fillies were awarded their own division in the Kindergarten, 
the fillies ran faster. Cool Papa Bell's time in the Kindergarten was 17.87, 
almost a length slower. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Frank Nakamura began racing quarter horses nearly 20 years ago, but Ah 
Sigh gave him his first homebred stakes victory. He named the First Down Dash 
filly after his wife, Asaye. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said no one would know how to pronounce it if I spelled it the same way," 
Nakamura said.  
</P>
<P>

DESAUSSURE HAS IT ALL -- BUT THERE'S A CATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Critics say his weaknesses are only an arm's length away, but Taft High's 
Andre DeSaussure isn't listening. He's taken his weaknesses and placed them 
firmly over his ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't let words people say take me down," he said. "I'm always gonna be out 
here working hard. Those are the people that come out on top." 
</P>
<P>
 DeSaussure, blessed with all the speed and size any receiver could wish for, 
has difficulty holding on to a thrown football. "I'm glad that's the only thing 
they talk stuff about, because I run good routes and I get to the ball," he 
said. "It's just catching it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some say DeSaussure is overrated because of his inability to catch 
with consistency, several Pacific 10 Conference football coaches came calling 
over the past year, seeking the opportunity to work with the fleet-footed 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because DeSaussure -- 6-foot-3, 195 pounds -- is a not-so-average track 
athlete who desperately wants to play football.  
</P>
<P>
 DeSaussure won the 100-, 200- and 400-meter sprints in the City Section 
championships as a junior, becoming only the second male athlete since 1911 to 
complete that hat trick, joining Ronnie Wayne Williams of Chatsworth (1977). 
</P>
<P>
 Further still, DeSaussure was the state runner-up in the 400 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering his track record, he should probably stay in his own lane. But 
DeSaussure is out to prove his skeptics wrong and attain his goal of becoming 
one of the country's best college receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, DeSaussure and 73 other senior football standouts will showcase their 
talents in the Daily News all-star game at Birmingham High at 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 DeSaussure, who earned a football scholarship to Washington after only one 
season as a high school receiver, and Arizona-bound receiver Jim Romero of L.A. 
Baptist will lead the West. 
</P>
<P>
 If DeSaussure had the sure, soft hands of the diminutive Romero, he would 
possess the complete package as a receiver. But, for now, DeSaussure knows 
where his game needs work -- he just doesn't like talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "His speed cannot be questioned," said West co-Coach Joel Schaeffer of Reseda. 
"But he's inconsistent catching the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 all-star practices, DeSaussure's weakness is no secret to his West 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent workout at Pierce College, West players were milling around 
after more than an hour of practice drills. Many rested while some offensive 
players, including DeSaussure, played catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Taft lineman Dan Lazarovits bellowed to no one in particular, "Hey, you 
know why that (L.A. Times') photographer has been here so long? She's still 
waiting for Andre to catch the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Those within earshot -- DeSaussure not among them -- doubled over with 
laughter. "Oh, that's so cold," said one player, after picking himself up off 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 DeSaussure did not have a good practice that day, to be sure. He dropped 
several easy passes in drills, but got better as the day wore on. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches say his problem hands are the result of not enough work. After playing 
defensive back almost exclusively at Royal High, DeSaussure transferred to Taft 
in the middle of his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft Coach Troy Starr and one of his assistants, Rod Gatlin, began molding 
DeSaussure into a receiver. Starr even bought a passing machine so his receiver 
could catch more practice passes after his coach got tired. 
</P>
<P>
 When DeSaussure wasn't fielding the machine's offerings, he was on the other 
end of throws from Gatlin, a former El Toro High quarterback who played at Cal 
State Fullerton and Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made me his project and worked with me," DeSaussure said. "Basically, I 
owe my scholarship to him." 
</P>
<P>
 A year after catching only two passes for 45 yards at Royal, DeSaussure caught 
27 passes for 656 yards and five touchdowns for Taft. Practice makes him 
better, according to Gatlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been drastic improvement, but it's been all his commitment and hard 
work," Gatlin said. "With Andre, it's more of a mental thing, him being focused 
and him keeping his intensity to the football. He tends to get lazy, 
lackadaisical after he gets open." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting open deep is rarely a problem for the speedster. In fact, the long 
ball, or "big play," as he calls it, is what inspires him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to do whatever's necessary to win. He just hopes it's necessary that 
he goes deep," said West co-Coach George Hurley of Newbury Park.

 After a seven-month layoff, 74 of the region's finest senior high school 
football players will take the field for one last hurrah. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen players headed to Division I colleges on scholarship are 
featured in tonight's 15th annual Daily News all-star game at Birmingham High 
at 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The East seems loaded on offense with Sylmar High's Tyrone Crenshaw, San 
Fernando's Leon Blunt and Hart's Mike Kocicka. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, two-time City Section 4-A player of the year who is headed to 
Michigan State, averaged 8.3 yards a carry in three seasons and led the 
Spartans to a 4-A championship in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Blunt, bound for Notre Dame, ran for 803 yards and 11 touchdowns as San 
Fernando's quarterback last season, but will move to wide receiver and 
defensive back for the East, which has Kocicka and Palmdale's Rocque Sandoval 
at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Kocicka, The Times' Valley back of the year who's headed to Nevada Las Vegas, 
threw for 32 touchdowns and ran for 11 last fall at Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 The West is led by quarterbacks Zack Hernandez of L.A. Baptist and Jeremie 
Watkins of Simi Valley. Hernandez was the Southern Section Division X player of 
the year after leading the Knights through an undefeated season. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona-bound Jim Romero of L.A. Baptist and Washington-bound Andre DeSaussure 
of Taft are the featured receivers for the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda's Joel Schaeffer and Newbury Park's George Hurley will coach the West, 
and Palmdale's Jeff Williams and Grant's Bill Foster head the East.

PLAYING HARDBALL FOR THE FIRST TIME; TRIO OF FORMER CSUN SOFTBALL ALL-AMERICANS 
TRY HAND AT NATIONAL PASTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Baseball no longer is the forbidden fruit for female athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Three former Cal State Northridge All-Americans gave it their all at an open 
tryout Sunday for the Colorado Silver Bullets, the nation's only women's 
professional baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla Rouse was a member of two NCAA Division II national championship 
softball teams at CSUN. Tamara Ivie and Shannon Jones played in the NCAA 
Division I college softball World Series twice with the Matadors, who moved up 
to that level four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning has been an integral part of these athletes' careers, yet there they 
were in the sweltering Rancho Cucamonga heat striving to make a team that has a 
1-20 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy women showed up to try out for the Bullets in temperatures that soared 
above 100 degrees. They clapped loudly at the start of orientation when Manager 
Phil Niekro was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just looking for ballplayers to invite to camp next year," said Niekro, 
a former major league knuckleball pitcher who won 318 games in 24 years. "We 
looked at 1,700 women for our ball club last year and 24 made the team. We let 
four go since that. . . . It's not going to be easy." 
</P>
<P>
 The women, dressed in everything from baseball pants and T-shirts to shorts 
and tank tops, took note and got to work. The tryout tested speed, defensive 
ability, arm strength and accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Only those who did well in at least two categories made it to the batting 
cage. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who didn't went home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a public relations trip," said Tommy Jones, the Silver Bullets' 
director of player development. "There will be a lot of hurt emotions, but this 
is the same scenario as a major league baseball trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who runs the tryouts, played eight seasons of professional baseball and 
managed in the minor leagues for 12 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't throw, can't run, can't catch, we're not gonna pick you," he 
said. "We don't carry too many DHs." 
</P>
<P>
 Rouse, an outfielder who will play in the Olympic Sports Festival beginning 
this weekend, expected a challenge but didn't think she was out of her league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see a good softball player not being able to adjust to the game," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But of the 70 players trying out, only 20 made it to the end of the lengthy 
workout. Ivie, Jones and Rouse were among them. So was Sandra Romero, a 
32-year-old Ventura native who played softball at Ventura High and Ventura 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I practice baseball three hours a day with my nephew's Pony baseball team," 
said Romero, who works in construction. "I love playing ball. I grew up around 
the sport and as a little girl always wished I could play with the Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivie and Jones are students and have no commitments that would hinder them 
should they land jobs as professional ballplayers. Romero is self-employed and 
says she could take time off. 
</P>
<P>
 Rouse, 30, is a computer software engineer and would have to take a sabbatical 
if she makes the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Silver Bullets play men's minor league, semipro, amateur and over-30 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches wouldn't name the top candidates from Sunday's tryout, but they 
anticipate inviting about three players from Rancho Cucamonga to spring 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 The twenty finalists were told they would be contacted by mail toward the end 
of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 However Niekro was not impressed with what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an average tryout," he said. "A lot of people were out for the first 
time and they said, 'That's a long way to throw the ball.' We did have better 
arms than we thought we would in the bullpen, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was glad to hear that because she tried out as an infielder and pitcher. 
The 21-year-old says it was her first time throwing a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I had nothing to lose," she said. "This is a chance of a lifetime. 
What else is there for us to play after college softball? This is great. It's 
exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 But the transition from softball may not be easy. Wooden bats are heavier than 
the aluminum ones used in softball. Baseball dimensions are also tougher to 
navigate and the ball is much smaller and travels faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivie says it felt strange handling a baseball. The 21-year-old played in three 
softball games with her summer league on Saturday and felt awkward fielding 
baseballs on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to adjust," she said. "It took me four times to get the ground 
ball. I figured it would be like this, but I wanted to try out anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 The tryout was held in conjunction with the Silver Bullets' Monday game 
against the Southern California Tremors 30-and-over club. The Bullets lost, 
8-1, but scored for the first time in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,191 fans were not concerned with the Bullets' horrible record and often 
sloppy play against the Tremors. 
</P>
<P>
 They cheered loudly when pitcher Shae Sloan threw her first strike in the 
second inning, went crazy when designated hitter Pam Schaffrath smacked a 
double in the third and jumped and yelled wildly when right fielder Michelle 
Delloso stole third base in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 These fans even cheered when the Tremors committed an error and booed every 
time a Silver Bullet pop fly was caught. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been incredible fan support," said Kathleen Christie, the team's 
director of media relations.  
</P>
<P>
 "Without an exception, in every single game the crowd is behind the women 
regardless of the score or their performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we started we wondered how the women were going to handle the 
heckling, but that hasn't happened yet. So far the other team and the umpires 
are the only ones that have had to worry about heckling." 
</P>
<P>
 The Silver Bullets, who are each paid $20,000 plus expenses for a 45-game 
season, received a standing ovation at the end of the game. Then hundreds of 
people flocked to the fence by first base and anxiously waited for players to 
sign game programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle McAnany, the only local player on the team, says it has been like a 
dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old physical education teacher was an All-American third baseman 
on CSUN's softball team in 1985 and a member of three Matador national 
championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Former CSUN catcher Missy Cress made the Silver Bullets roster in April, but 
was one of four players cut June 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd play pro baseball," McAnany said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The fans are awesome. We've had a great response. Even our opponents are 
helpful. And playing in major league parks has been incredible. I've met Rickey 
Henderson and Mike Piazza, all the men I've admired for years. Now we have the 
same job." 
</P>
<P>
 And now women across the country want her job.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: SAUGUS STOCK CAR EVENT SPREAD OVER WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saugus Speedway will celebrate the Fourth of July weekend with a rare two 
nights of racing for stock car enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 All six NASCAR Winston Racing Series divisions will be in action on Saturday 
or Monday night on the one-third mile flat asphalt oval in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 The sportsman division, headed by points leader Pat Mintey Jr. of Lancaster, 
will headline Saturday's GM Performance Parts Night with a 40-lap main event. 
Mintey has 207 points to 192 for Sean Woodside of Saugus, 181 for Craig Rayburn 
of Santa Clarita and 173 for Gary Sigman of Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the Saturday night program will be the pro stock division, which 
includes a 25-lap oval track main event and a 15-lap Figure 8 race. Scott 
Dinger of Simi Valley is the pro stock leader with 137 points to 118 for Brian 
Kelly of Arleta. 
</P>
<P>
 An Ego Challenge will precede qualifying at 6 p.m., with trophy dashes 
starting the show at 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night will feature the Grand American modifieds, which have been 
dominated by Dave Phipps of Simi Valley. Phipps is a six-time track champion, 
having won sportsman titles in 1984, 1987 and 1988 and Grand American modified 
the last three years. He leads with 143 points, far ahead of runner-up Dave 
Blankenship of Reseda, with 99. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Monday night races will include street stock oval and Figure 8s, 
mini-stocks and pro four modifieds, followed by a train race and a fireworks 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 The street stock division is the tightest with only three points separating 
the first three drivers. Kirk Miller of Alta Loma leads with 123, followed by 
John Schultz of Valencia with 121 and Greg Benner of Whittier with 120. Other 
points leaders include Kenny Smith of El Monte, pro four modified division, and 
Jeff McCall of Gardena, mini stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Trophy dashes will begin at 6 p.m. on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus General Manager Ray Wilkings, who was named national promoter of the 
year in 1990, has also scheduled a band concert at 5 p.m. on both days. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK CARS -- The first of four NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Tour races at 
Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield will be held Saturday night on the half-mile 
paved oval. The late model stock cars will run 100 laps. . . . Cajon Speedway 
in El Cajon will hold a Winston Racing Series sportsman race and a destruction 
derby Saturday night, followed by street stocks, a train race and fireworks on 
Monday night. . . . Blythe Speedway will hold a sportsman and pro stock program 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 OFF ROAD -- Desert racing enthusiasts will get a doubleheader of action in the 
23rd Fireworks 250 Saturday when the SCORE Tecate Trophy Trucks compete in one 
race and the 14 other Ultra-Wheels classes run over the rutted 73-mile course 
in a separate event. Veteran Roger Mears will start first in the truck race, 
then head for Pikes Peak and the July 4 hill climb. Both races will be three 
loops of a 73-mile course starting at the Sidewinder exit off I-15 between 
Barstow and Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
 INDY CARS -- The 1995 Indy car schedule has been expanded to 17 events, one 
more than this year. A surprise is that five races will be held before the 
Indianapolis 500. The season will open March 5 with a new race on the streets 
of Miami, followed by Surfers Paradise in Australia, Phoenix, Long Beach and 
Nazareth, Pa., before Indy on May 28. The season will end Sept. 10 at Laguna 
Seca, a month earlier than this season to avoid TV conflicts with football and 
the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 SPEEDWAY BIKES -- Racing reaches the halfway point Friday night at the Costa 
Mesa Speedway with national champion Mike Faria holding a substantial lead with 
843 points over former national titleholders Brad Oxley (782) and Bobby 
Schwartz (729) and ice racing champion Charlie Venegas (737). 
</P>
<P>
 PIKES PEAK -- Rod Millen, after winning Mickey Thompson stadium off-road 
championships in his Toyota truck, will take aim Monday on the Pikes Peak 
Hillclimb unlimited class and overall record in a new factory-backed Celica GT. 
The rally-type car, built in Millen's shop in Huntington Beach, is a 
four-wheel-drive, powered by a turbocharged, four-cylinder, 2.1-liter motor. 
Millen's son, Rhys, will also drive a Celica in the showroom stock class. This 
will be Toyota's first factory effort in the 72-year-old Race to the Clouds -- 
a 12.42-mile run to the top of the mountain that includes 156 turns. 
</P>
<P>
 POWERBOATS -- Ten national champions will be among 75 boats entered Monday in 
the annual Fourth of July Regatta at Long Beach Marine Stadium. Don Johnson of 
Azusa, 1990 world champion, and Craig Wendt of Huntington Beach, the 1991 
International Outboard Grand Prix champion, are entered in the Formula Champ 
boats class, in which speeds are in excess of 140 m.p.h. Also part of the 
program, which starts at 10 a.m., will be circle ski racers. 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- A garage sale of some of Carroll Shelby's car collection will be 
held next Friday at the Hyatt Newporter Hotel in Newport Beach. Among the items 
will be a turbine-powered Indy car, a 500-horsepower Pantera that was Shelby's 
personal car, and a number of Chrysler products designed by Shelby. It will be 
part of the Newport Beach Classic & Collector Car Auction, July 8-10, handled 
by Don Williams, Rick Cole and Richie Clyne.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: COMPTON; GOLF FACILITY PROPOSED FOR VACANT SCHOOL LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have proposed converting an empty lot next to Dominguez High 
School into a golf driving range. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say the move would generate cash for the financially strapped 
Compton Unified School District.The proposal was presented at a school district 
meeting of Compton parents and community leaders recently . 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Sotelo, a project manager for the city Parks and Recreation Department, 
said the city would build the driving range for an estimated $543,000. In 
return for leasing the land, the school district would get a percentage of the 
revenues. Although terms have not yet been negotiated, Sotelo said, the driving 
range could generate tens of thousands of dollars each year for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The driving range would be built on a 7.6-acre lot north of the school. A 
nine-hole city golf course is nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is being reviewed by a committee of 11 Compton parents and 
community leaders that was established to look at ways to develop vacant school 
properties to generate money for refurbishing schools, said Margie Garrett, a 
teacher and co-chairwoman of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will eventually make a recommendation to the state administrator 
overseeing Compton schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the land at Dominguez, the committee is looking at proposals to 
develop three other sites: a 21-acre parcel at Central Avenue and Greenleaf 
Boulevard, a former elementary school at 1420 N. McKinley Ave., and a former 
office at 118th Street and Compton Boulevard. PSYCHE PASCUAL

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; RESIDENTS SUCCEED IN BID TO STOP PLANT PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of a North Long Beach neighborhood have won their lengthy battle to 
stop construction of an asphalt recycling plant on Paramount Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 With a unanimous 8-0 vote Tuesday, the City Council denied the appeal of 
Ecopave California Corporation, which sought to put a heavy industrial plant in 
a light industrial zone at 6150 Paramount Blvd.Councilman Evan Anderson Braude 
was absent for the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision brought cheers and applause from about two dozen audience 
members, who had been fighting the asphalt plant for more than six months. 
Neighbors complained that Ecopave would increase air pollution, dust and heavy 
truck traffic near their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 An alternative site for Ecopave at 1642 E. 32nd St. is still being considered. 
The site was suggested by city staff, but is also in a light industrial area. 
Steve Vance, the main Ecopave proponent, said he would continue negotiating 
with the city to find a workable home for his proposed business.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: WHITTIER; COUNCIL OKS REQUEST TO RESTORE THEATER SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a mall owner's request to restore a 30-foot art 
deco sign that once graced the old Whittier Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of King Richard's Antique Mall will pay restoration costs, 
estimated at $30,000, and hope to mount it on the shopping center's main 
building at Penn Street and Whittier Boulevard later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to save a piece of history and put it up on our building," said 
John Passage, manager of the mall.  
</P>
<P>
 The city has been storing the sign since the 62-year-old theater was torn down 
in July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff must still determine whether the mall structure can support the 
sign. Earlier this year, the Whittier Redevelopment Agency rejected a proposal 
to include the sign in a $1.3-million multiplex theater expansion on South 
Greenleaf Avenue. Agency officials said that architectural changes would have 
been required in the theater expansion to accommodate the sign. JOHN D. WAGNER

CITY HALL JOURNAL: MAYWOOD; CAPT. BOWMAN HIRED AS CHIEF OF POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has officially hired police Capt. Gil Bowman as chief of the 
26-officer Maywood Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman, a 22-year Police Department veteran and a Maywood native, will move 
into the chief's office upon the retirement at the end of the month of Theodore 
Heidke, who has held the city's top law enforcement position for the past 14 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best part of managing the department is (that) you get to carry out your 
ideas," said Bowman, adding that he plans to place more emphasis on getting 
police officers involved in community events.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 5-0 to hire Bowman, 47, who is married with four 
children. The new chief is expected to earn an annual salary of about $72,000, 
city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, the council voted 4-0 in favor of hiring Bowman, with 
Councilwoman Elvira Moreno abstaining on the grounds that she did not know 
Bowman well enough to approve the hire. BOB ELSTON

WORKER ERROR BLAMED FOR 7 MISSING VOTES; ELECTION: RECOUNT REVERSES RESULTS, 
GIVING MIKE DONELON AN EDGE OF ONE BALLOT OVER TONIA REYES URANGA FOR COUNCIL 
SEAT. CITY CLERK'S OFFICE INSISTS NEW TALLY IS ACCURATE.

<P>
 Officials of the Long Beach city clerk's office on Tuesday blamed employee 
error for an election snafu that turned a City Council candidate's narrow 
victory into a one-vote loss, but they insisted that the current results are 
accurate and verifiable. 
</P>
<P>
 In a public explanation before the City Council Tuesday, Deputy City Clerk 
Deborah Wright said that "simple human exhaustion" probably led to the office's 
failure to count seven ballots in the race for the 7th District council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven additional ballots were included in the June 22 recount of the race, 
giving contractor Mike Donelon a one-vote win over Tonia Reyes Uranga in Long 
Beach's June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright told the council that the clerk's office was not able to determine 
exactly what happened to the votes, but she speculated that the error occurred 
about 2 a.m. when a clerk was feeding the last ballots into a counting machine. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk, who had been working 20 hours, apparently handed some ballots to 
another clerk to expedite the counting process, Wright said. In the switch, a 
short stack of ballots apparently was not fed through the machine, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers at the next station, who matched the total votes cast with the total 
counted, failed to catch the mistake, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 She insisted, however, that any vote-tampering would have been impossible. The 
boxes were then sealed and placed in a storage room in City Hall, Wright said. 
The room is locked and accessible only to the city clerk's staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven uncounted ballots were absentee votes from a California Heights 
precinct, an area of strong Donelon support. Donelon received six of the votes 
and Uranga received one, giving him a one-vote lead, 2,932 to 2,931. 
</P>
<P>
 On election night, Uranga was ahead by 29 votes. But her lead shrank later 
that week as late absentee and provisional ballots were counted. After the City 
Council certified the election results June 14, Donelon asked for a recount. 
The additional uncounted ballots that turned up in the recount were enough to 
gave Donelon a one-vote edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are seeking to represent the 7th District, which covers parts 
of central and west Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Donelon, president of the California Heights Neighborhood Assn., was the top 
vote-getter in the April primary elections. But Uranga, a community activist 
and former president of the Long Beach Children's Museum, made a strong bid 
during the runoffs, amassing the most campaign money among candidates in the 
council elections. Both enjoyed strong community support -- Uranga from the 
west side of the city and Donelon from California Heights, a neighborhood in 
central Long Beach near Bixby Knolls. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien temporarily blocked the 
council from certifying the recount and ruled that Uranga should be allowed to 
examine some questionable ballots. A further hearing on the case is scheduled 
for July 6. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that could bolster Uranga's challenge, council members voted 
unanimously Tuesday night to ask City Clerk Shelba Powell to re-evaluate about 
30 provisional and absentee ballots that she excluded from the vote tabulations 
for various reasons.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ernie Kell, who also supported the council's request, said he hopes the 
move "will give the candidates and public a better feeling of integrity in the 
election process." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, the sole arbitrator over ballot rejections, could choose to ignore the 
council's request, said Assistant City Atty. Robert E. Shannon. If she does, 
however, Uranga could ask a judge to decide whether some of the rejected 
ballots should be counted. 
</P>
<P>
 If Powell accepts any of the ballots that Uranga challenges, they would be 
considered part of the recount. About 20 or 30 ballots were thrown out by 
Powell, Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 A date has not been set for Uranga to examine the ballots, said Deputy City 
Clerk Bill Joder. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell has been on vacation and is expected to return Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen Uranga supporters staged a small demonstration outside City Hall 
before the council meeting. They attended the meeting carrying signs with 
messages such as "Something Stinks in the 7th (District)," and "Who Really Cast 
the Mystery 7 Votes?" 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga's attorney, Fredric D. Woocher, praised the council's move. "It may not 
resolve anything but will get us that much closer," Woocher said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will probably argue that the seven additional votes that changed 
the election should not be counted. "The chain of custody on those ballots is 
out the window," he said. "There is definitely potential for a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Joder said the clerk's office has matched each vote to a registered voter's 
name and found the final tally to be correct. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal said he was troubled by the missing votes. 
"By certifying the election of Uranga, we agreed that the electoral process in 
that district was fair and accurate. Then more ballots turned up in recount," 
Lowenthal said. "What if we certify Donelon and they find more votes?"

POLICE ARE REAL WINNER IN GRAFFITI TAG CONTEST; CRIME: THE GAME BETWEEN RIVAL 
CREWS WAS TO SPRAY-PAINT THE MOST INITIALS ALONG A STRETCH OF FREEWAY. BUT 
OFFICERS RESPONDED BY ARRESTING EIGHT AND SAY UP TO 60 YOUTHS MAY EVENTUALLY BE 
CHARGED. 
</P>

<P>
 It began as a dangerous contest between two groups of teen-age taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 The participants had to spray-paint their crew's initials as many times as 
possible along a stretch of freeway -- dashing across busy freeway lanes, 
scaling billboard poles, slipping around barbed-wire barriers, hanging from 
freeway signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners of the graffiti war would have bragging rights. The losers would 
have to disband their crew and never spray-paint the group's name again. 
</P>
<P>
 For five nights last month, the tagging crews splattered a seven-mile stretch 
of the Long Beach (710) Freeway between the Artesia (91) Freeway and downtown 
Long Beach. They sprayed sound walls, overpasses, on-ramps and off-ramps. Some 
commercial buildings were covered from the ground up to 10 feet -- apparently 
as high as the taggers could reach. A few business owners found graffiti on 
their roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 When all of the aerosol paint canisters were dropped, police said, the freeway 
stretch had been hit with about 25,000 "tags" (crew initials). Damages 
approached $100,000.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely the worst case of damage from graffiti we've seen," said 
Long Beach Police Officer Barry Fowks. Fowks and his brother, Officer Bob 
Fowks, led an investigation into the torrent of vandalism, which occurred from 
May 14 to May 19 from the Broadway exit in Long Beach to the Artesia Freeway. 
Sheriff's deputies and California Highway Patrol officers also participated in 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Six youths and two adults have been arrested, but police say as many as 60 
suspects may be charged before the investigation is wrapped up. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the Fowks brothers say, they hope to break up two of the most 
aggressive tagging crews in the area -- rivals that have long spread graffiti 
throughout several cities along the Los Angeles-Orange county line, including 
La Mirada, Whittier, Buena Park, Fullerton and La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Fowkses' investigation, leaders of the two groups met 
sometime before May 14 and challenged each other to a battle. The rules were 
simple: Taggers would swarm into an area and paint their crew's three-letter 
initials over every available surface during a specified time period. Then crew 
members would take video or still pictures and count the total number of 
initials (tags). The crew with the most tags would win. 
</P>
<P>
 The two crews chose the Long Beach Freeway because it offered a cleaner canvas 
for the battle, Bob Fowks said. "They found some large, pretty virgin territory 
and went to make a name for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The taggers also believed their initials would not be recognized so easily 
outside their home turf, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But before members of the two crews could finish their game, the Fowks 
brothers were on the case. They noticed a proliferation of new graffiti as they 
cruised the Long Beach Freeway May 16, but the initials were unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these kids had been local, it wouldn't have been a mystery to us," Barry 
Fowks said. "We would've known who they were by the names they used. But we 
didn't recognize the tags, so it took a lot of investigating." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 17, a witness saw at least two teen-agers spraying paint on the 
loading-dock doors of an industrial park business near the Artesia Freeway, off 
Susana Road. The witness reported the taggers' license plate number to 
sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 That night and the next, sheriff's deputies, California Highway Patrol 
officers and the Long Beach police officers independently made vehicle stops 
that helped fill in the pieces. One car with four juveniles had 26 cans of 
spray paint. Authorities also stopped a truck with two teen-agers who had fresh 
paint on their fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the three agencies began comparing notes. Highway Patrol Officer 
Randy Campbell, who recently had been named the region's graffiti abatement 
coordinator, contacted the Fowkses, who had been in touch with sheriff's 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fowkses called city graffiti abatement workers while Campbell contacted 
Caltrans crews. They began to paint out the markings by the end of the week, 
before taggers could count up all of their initials and declare a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 21, Long Beach police cars filled with police, CHP officers and 
sheriff's deputies descended on 12 households in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. They arrested two adults and five juveniles. Each was charged with 
felony vandalism and conspiracy. Another boy was arrested later in the week. 
The juveniles' names have not been released because of their ages. 
</P>
<P>
 The two adults, Michael J. Ross of Whittier and John Ehredt of La Mirada, both 
18, pleaded not guilty June 23 to five counts of felony vandalism and one count 
of conspiracy. They are each being held in lieu of $160,000 bail. If convicted, 
each faces a year in prison and fines of up to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The juveniles, if convicted, could be fined and lose their driving privileges 
until age 21. They could also be put on an 8 p.m. curfew seven nights a week 
for the next year and be required to maintain at least a C average in school 
and attend classes every day. Alternately, violators could find themselves 
spending six months in a youth camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are planning another sweep of taggers' homes and expect to make 
more arrests.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CERRITOS; SCHOOL BOARD SUBMITS $69-MILLION BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ABC Unified School District board approved a $69-million budget Tuesday 
night that included cuts in student supplies and the elimination of an 
elementary school counseling program. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget was adopted on a 4-3 vote.Critics on the board said some of the 
$1.8 million in cuts, including a reduction in legal fees and computer 
services, are likely to be rejected by the Los Angeles County Office of 
Education. The county has until August to approve the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are supporting an unbalanced budget, a budget we know going in will not 
fly," board member Robert Hughlett said before voting against the spending plan 
for the new school year.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, a dispute over the budget has prompted a heated battle on 
the school board and resulted in the intervention of the county education 
office. In April, the county ordered the district to trim the budget and 
appointed a fiscal adviser to supervise the process. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials also placed a new teachers contract on hold until ABC 
officials could show that the district can pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Cecy Groom said the district has complied with the 
county order and intends to enforce the contract. Groom said the district no 
longer needs the services of county-appointed fiscal adviser Wes Bosson and has 
asked its attorney to draft a letter to the state Department of Education 
demanding that the county remove him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosson, however, said the school board has no authority to remove him. He said 
he would continue supervising the finances of the district until he is removed 
by county officials. PSYCHE PASCUAL

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; OFFICIALS BOW TO PROTESTS OVER BRIDGE DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Naples residents and local boaters who challenged a plan to strengthen the 
Appian Way Bridge over Alamitos Bay won a reprieve last week, when officials 
said they will explore other design ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents, supported by City Councilman Douglas S. Drummond and the city's 
Marine Advisory Commission, had argued that widening the bridge's pilings to 
make the structure more earthquake-safe would also have made navigation nearly 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't a matter of opposing the retrofit, it's a matter of finding a better 
design," Drummond said. "There's currents and high winds, and with the amount 
of activity, there's going to be problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge, which crosses Alamitos Bay near the Marine Stadium waterway, is a 
popular thoroughfare for boats, rowing crews and other watercraft.  
</P>
<P>
 At a recent meeting in the Naples area that drew about 90 people, U.S. Coast 
Guard and Los Angeles County officials agreed to look into alternate designs. 
Although the county is designing and paying for the retrofit, the Coast Guard 
must give final approval because the bridge covers a navigable waterway. 
</P>
<P>
 Boaters argued that the proposed design would leave only about 95 feet between 
pilings, which would create blind spots and make it difficult to avoid oncoming 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Visibility is already a problem at the bridge," said Wayne Till, a Coast 
Guard official who recently toured the area. The effect of the proposed 
redesign, he said, "would be like trying to look through a picket fence across 
the waterway." 
</P>
<P>
 David Sharkey, the county civil engineer who is overseeing the project, said 
the bridge -- and the nearby Davies Bridge -- might not be able to withstand an 
earthquake of magnitude 7.0 or stronger on the Newport/Inglewood fault line. 
The proposal would have widened the bridge's center pilings by 17 feet on each 
side and added cross support at the top of the bridge, at a cost of about 
$500,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The June 14 meeting was called after organizers collected about 500 signatures 
protesting the proposal. Trish Schooley, who lives near the bridge, organized 
the opposition. She said the proposed design, with its additional concrete 
pilings and barriers, also would be an eyesore in the quaint, upscale 
neighborhood.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; QUAKE DANGER CITED AT COLLEGE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN COX 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six Cal State Long Beach employees, nervous about projections that a 
nine-story building they work in could collapse during a major earthquake, have 
asked that they be moved elsewhere until the university strengthens the 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees said they are concerned about a 1993 seismic safety report 
warning that the McIntosh Humanities Building probably would collapse during a 
major earthquake. The study, sponsored by the university, does not elaborate on 
the magnitude or proximity of such a quake. "We just don't feel that it's safe 
to wait in this building," said one of the concerned employees, Pat Warren, a 
secretary in the philosophy department. 
</P>
<P>
 Edeltraud Falk, a part-time German teacher, said she schedules her student 
conference hours in other campus locations, such as classrooms and computer 
labs, because she wants to spend as little time as possible in the building. 
Falk said she has not requested relocation because she is not a member of the 
employees' union, the California State Employees Assn., which is supporting the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 About 130 university employees work in the office building, the tallest 
structure on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials said they have no vacant office space on campus to 
relocate the employees. They have asked employees to continue working in the 
building while administrators seek $1.2 million to pay for strengthening of the 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters earlier this month defeated a ballot measure that would have raised 
$900 million to pay for structural reinforcement of state higher education 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees filed a grievance last week with the California State University 
chancellor's office after Cal State Long Beach officials rejected their 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren said the employees requesting relocation work on the top three floors. 
Workers on lower floors, she said, may be less concerned with the structure's 
safety because they cannot feel the tremors that occasionally occur in the 
building. JOHN COX

COMMUNITY NEWS: LAKEWOOD; THUDS OF 2 MINOR QUAKES STARTLE RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two earthquakes in the Lakewood area last week were minor, measuring 2.6 
and 2.5 on the Richter scale. But they created resounding thuds, prompting 
dozens of people to call City Hall and the local sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so different that people didn't connect it with an earthquake 
experience and were wondering what it was," city spokesman Don Waldie said. "It 
wasn't your usual rocking-back-and-forth earthquake. It was more like a bump." 
</P>
<P>
 People near the epicenter of a quake feel more of a jolt, said Caltech 
seismologist Kate Hutton. They feel more of a rocking motion when the quake is 
distant, she said. She said both quakes were centered in an area bounded by 
Bellflower Boulevard, Centralia and South streets and the San Gabriel River. 
The first quake, measuring 2.6, was at 11:50 p.m. June 21. The 2.5 quake 
occurred at 8:46 a.m. June 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The quakes probably were on small, isolated faults and were probably not 
precursors of a larger temblor, Hutton said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BELL GARDENS; DISPUTED LAND DEAL AND CLEANUP SLATED FOR TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The property at 5614 Shull St. is a mess in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacant 1.5-acre industrial parcel is overgrown with grass and trees, which 
provide shade for the homeless who squat there. Black drums of soil samples sit 
in rows and an open pit marks the spot where an underground storage tank was 
once buried. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city tests, the soil where the 24-foot-long tank was buried is 
contaminated with a combination of cleaning solvent and a petroleum-based 
liquid that may have seeped into the ground-water aquifer. Nobody is quite sure 
of the extent of contamination, where it came from, or -- most important -- who 
should clean it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is pointing fingers right now," said Anthony R. Ybarra, Bell Gardens 
director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has spent more than $500,000 to find out what is going on below the 
surface of the land it purchased for $595,000 from Herbert B. and Judith E. 
Brohn of Red Bluff in 1985. The city is suing the couple, who once owned 
controlling interest in the Berk Oil Co., which used the land as a supply yard 
and maintained the tank. 
</P>
<P>
 The city filed its lawsuit in Norwalk Superior Court in 1992 to force the 
Brohns and Berk Oil to pay for the cleanup, which could exceed $1 million. 
Because the soil is tainted, the land is virtually unusable, the city claims. 
The city bought the land with the intention of building affordable housing, 
Ybarra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Brohns have countersued the city, saying that the purchase 
agreement came with an "as is" clause that protects them. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial is scheduled Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the city's lawsuit, the Brohns told them that they had cleaned 
out the tank, filled it with sand and paved it over. But four years later, 
consultants hired by the city pried open the tank and found that it still held 
drums of contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite a surprise to everybody," said Robert Lemen, attorney for BCL 
and Associates, the consulting firm that conducted the 1985 soil studies.

<P>
 Whittier College has begun a campaign to raise $1.5 million for a new 
endowment fund to offer annual full-tuition scholarships for Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund is named after Martin Ortiz, founder and director of the college's 
Center of Mexican American Affairs, which recruits Latino students to the 
college and offers social and cultural activities. Ortiz, 70, the only Latino 
to graduate from the college in 1948, founded the center in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 The endowment will provide six full-tuition scholarships a year. 
</P>
<P>
 About $210,000 has been raised for the endowment. The East Los Angeles 
Community Union has pledged $100,000, and the Union Pacific Foundation and 
George H. Mayr Foundation each have pledged $50,000.

JOB; JOB REFERRAL SERVICE OPENED AT CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People usually stop by City Hall to pick up a dog license or a building 
permit, but now Bell Gardens residents can go there to search for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 With assistance from their neighbors in Commerce, Bell Gardens officials 
recently opened a job referral office for residents. The effort is designed to 
help reduce joblessness in the city, where unemployment is almost twice the 
national average. 
</P>
<P>
 The office in the basement of City Hall is linked by computer to a job list 
compiled by the City of Commerce, which has been operating its own referral 
service for more than a dozen years and has placed about 500 people in jobs 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the jobs available through the city's office are clerical, warehouse, 
or sales positions and pay at least minimum wage and up to $16 per hour, said 
Adriana Ulloa, senior administrative analyst in Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 The unemployment rate in Bell Gardens, a city of 43,000, is about 13%, Ulloa 
said. According to 1993 statistics from the state Department of Finance, the 
median family income in the city was $23,819. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulloa said many Bell Gardens residents were having a difficult time finding 
transportation to Commerce to make use of that city's job referral office. 
Commerce officials decided to help establish the Bell Gardens office so that 
the two cities will not have to compete against each other in the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them to develop something brand new, it would take five to seven years . 
. . and they would compete with us," said Robert Chavez, social services 
manager in the City of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the first time, unemployed residents in Bell Gardens can make an 
appointment locally to see a public employment counselor. Ulloa said that it 
only takes about 15 minutes for people to add their names and other relevant 
information to the computerized list. Like a dating service, the computer 
matches the applicant's skills with job openings. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the new computer system in Bell Gardens can print a polished 
resume for each job-seeker who uses the free service.

CAUGHT IN THE CROSS-FIRE; RESIDENTS STRUGGLE TO PROTECT THEIR FAMILIES AMID A 
DECADE-OLD ASIAN-LATINO GANG WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The two young gangsters have never met, and yet given the chance they would 
probably try to kill each other. 
</P>
<P>
 One belongs to Long Beach's biggest Mexican gang. He's a spindly 15-year-old 
who talks about defending his race with a gun tucked into his trousers. 
</P>
<P>
 The other is a 17-year-old Cambodian who dropped out of school after seventh 
grade and joined a gang he hoped would protect him against "the Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they still have peach fuzz on their faces, the two are seasoned 
soldiers in a racially charged gang war pitting Latinos against Asians on the 
streets of central and northern Long Beach -- a conflict that has claimed at 
least 36 lives in the five years that police have been documenting the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The death toll includes three innocent Latino victims -- ages 15 to 19 -- from 
Los Angeles who were gunned down May 15 in front of stunned witnesses, just 
moments after leaving a birthday party near MacArthur Park where they had gone 
to promote their dance club. 
</P>
<P>
 Two teen-age Laotian gang members have been charged with three counts of 
murder and three counts of attempted murder in the incident, which left three 
other Latinos seriously wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The brazen attack drew a chorus of condemnation across Long Beach. But to 
those who live in the city's meanest neighborhoods, it served only as a 
reminder of the unending gang violence over the years that has maimed countless 
victims, terrified residents and deepened resentment that may never heal. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings have left parents searching for ways to protect their families. 
Some have pulled their children out of school because of brawls and stabbings 
on campus. Others have taken even more extreme action, sending their sons back 
to Mexico in hopes of keeping them alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Families don't know where to turn," said Olivia Herrera, an activist whose 
son was killed earlier this year in a shooting that police believe was carried 
out by Asian gang members. "The community is fear-ridden. Somehow, we have to 
pull things together." 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides in this war readily blame each other for starting the trouble. 
Both camps refuse to back down, instead speaking of the need to avenge their 
fallen brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino gang members say they fight to protect their barrios -- their pride -- 
against Asians intruding on their streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're backing up your race, so people won't think Mexicans are punks," said 
the defiant 15-year-old Latino, who proudly displays a twisted bullet wound on 
his stomach and a dime-sized nick on his hand like badges of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the stomach wound nearly left him dead a year ago, the eighth-grader 
remains defiant. "The Chinos are gonna lose," he said, referring to Asian 
gangs. "They're not as powerful as the Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
 Latino gangs, who are primarily Mexican American, have deep roots in Long 
Beach. In some families, successive generations have joined up since the late 
1960s, when Latinos started banding together in part to protect themselves 
against attacks by more dominant Latino gangs from other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there are more than 5,000 Latino gang members in Long Beach, almost 
half the city's gang population, according to a recent city report. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Asian gangs cropped up in Long Beach only a decade ago. Their 
emergence coincided with the influx of Southeast Asian refugees. The Asian 
gangsters -- who are mostly Cambodian but also include Laotians, Vietnamese, 
Chinese and other groups -- say they formed gangs as protection against attacks 
by their more numerous Latino rivals. Now, there are about 2,000 Asian gang 
members, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd walk on the street and they'd jump me," said the 17-year-old Cambodian, 
who joined his gang about two years ago and has a quarter-sized bullet wound on 
one of his calves. Now "I call my homies. If I can't do nothin' about it, my 
homies can." 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers say the young Asians mimicked their rivals' lingo, graffiti, 
baggy clothing, tattoos and buzz haircuts -- irritating the existing Latino 
gangs who viewed the newcomers as wanna-bes. 
</P>
<P>
 By organizing, the Asian youths gained power not only to challenge their 
rivals but also to shake down residents and businesses in their own community, 
activists and police say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being in a gang made them feel important, respected," said Leakhena Nou, a 
Cambodian social worker. "And they do get the respect, because people are 
intimidated by them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In one sense, the gang war in Long Beach is no different from violence tearing 
at other cities where gangs regularly trade insults and gunfire to settle 
vendettas. But gang counselors and police see a disturbing trend in Long Beach: 
A conflict that began as a struggle over turf has deteriorated into an 
intractable race war. Now, killings are increasingly motivated by hate, with 
Asians and Latinos shooting one another on sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're walking down the street and see your enemy. You either beat him up or 
shoot him," said a 14-year-old Cambodian gang member who boasts of many fights 
with Latino rivals. "It's a game you play, but a reality game." 
</P>
<P>
 One Latino gang member, a 21-year-old who said he now refrains from violence, 
offered an equally nonchalant attitude shared by many of his fellow gangsters. 
"If I would be gangbanging, I would be blasting a lot of the Chinos," he said. 
"If you live in the gang life, you gotta die in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gang counselors say the battling has turned into an old grudge. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, I think some of the younger kids don't know why they are 
fighting," said Thomas M. White, coordinator of the city's gang prevention 
program.  
</P>
<P>
 At the crux of the problem is a deep cultural divide. While rivals may live 
next door to one another in crowded neighborhoods, they are separated by an 
ocean of differences -- from language and religion to food and music. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino gang members refer derogatorily to all Asian gang members, regardless 
of origin, as "the Chinos." For their part, Asian gangsters know all Latinos as 
"the Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
 Tension between the two groups dates back to the early 1980s, shortly after 
thousands of Cambodians fleeing their war-torn country began arriving in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Many refugees came here to join family, after spending their lives in rural 
areas, living in bamboo huts without running water or electricity. Here, they 
moved into poor, urban neighborhoods around Anaheim Street that had been home 
to Latinos and African Americans for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly the newcomers got a foothold -- learning English, pooling their money, 
founding religious centers, and eventually opening businesses. Today, various 
estimates place their Long Beach population at 45,000 to 60,000. Their presence 
on Anaheim Street is well pronounced -- with restaurants, grocery stores, 
jewelers and other shops -- and some Cambodian residents envision the 
thoroughfare as a sort of Little Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most enduring symbol of change has taken place in the very 
building that once housed the community's main Latino social service agency, 
Centro de la Raza. The now-defunct agency moved from its Anaheim Street 
building in the early 1980s to a site closer to downtown Long Beach. A few 
years later, the nonprofit group United Cambodian Community Inc. moved into the 
building and made sweeping renovations, including a new facade reminiscent of 
Buddhist temples. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the building is home to organizations and businesses that serve the 
Southeast Asian community as well as a job placement center open to all 
low-income residents of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the Latino community resent the fact that Cambodians occupy the 
building and also express frustration at Cambodian business successes. Others 
complain about the newcomers depleting already limited social and medical 
services in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cambodians displaced the Latinos," said one gang counselor who works in 
both communities. "The adults were angry, and the youth acted that anger out." 
</P>
<P>
 The violence that has spilled into the streets has sent frightened residents 
scurrying for answers and safety. Many now keep their children home at night 
because the streets have become so dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Emma and Jose Sandoval sent their 14-year-old son, Ignasio,back to their 
native Mexico to live with their oldest son last fall after Ignasio was stabbed 
in the back and stomach and shot in the head near their old apartment at 14th 
Street and Cherry Avenue. Ignasio, who was not in gangs, still carries the 
bullet in his skull. Doctors said it was too dangerous to remove. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want him dead," Emma Sandoval, 41, said of the difficult decision to 
part with her son. "He said to me, 'If you don't send me (to Mexico), they will 
finish me off.' He was so traumatized. I don't think he'll ever come back." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval worries about the safety of her seven other children. Another son, 
19-year-old Joel, was nearly run down recently by suspected Asian gang members, 
she said. He has rejected attempts to send him to Mexico, saying he wants to 
remain to help provide income for the family. Sandoval says she doesn't know 
why her sons were targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders say that countless families such as the Sandovals are caught 
in the middle of the gang violence with nowhere to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can't relax in front of their homes anymore because they're wondering 
if they are gonna catch a stray bullet," said Ernie Natividad, a counselor with 
Victory Outreach Long Beach, a church that ministers to gang members. "There's 
a lot of fear." 
</P>
<P>
 That fear extends to school campuses, where racial tensions occasionally boil 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 At Jordan High School in North Long Beach, a city police officer and school 
district security guard -- both armed -- spend their days trying to maintain 
calm between Latino and Asian students, who have gotten into numerous fights 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 One Latino parent recently moved her family to the city's eastside to seek a 
safer neighborhood but has since pulled her 13-year-old son from school after 
he was jumped twice on campus by Asian rivals who were bused to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Amelia Nieto's son, who asked not to be named, was suspended after a recent 
fight with an Asian rival in which he suffered minor injuries. Nieto said her 
son, who is not in a gang, could not concentrate on classes because of the 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something's not right," said Nieto, 42. "Kids have to watch their backs and 
still pay attention to the teacher. I think home study is really the best way 
for him. I feel like it is safer and he will learn a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Latino and Asian activists say the city should have prepared better for the 
racial tensions that exist today -- pushing for cultural awareness classes in 
schools, establishing a dialogue between groups and seeking more racial 
diversity on the police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the police department's 762 sworn officers on May 1, there were 561 whites, 
113 Latinos, 52 African Americans, 31 Asians and five Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief William C. Ellis said the police department is making efforts to 
recruit more minority officers, but added that police alone cannot be expected 
to solve a complex problem that involves schools, families and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The activists and even some frustrated city officials, meanwhile, complain 
that City Hall has ignored the gang problem over the years because the violence 
hasn't yet spread into affluent parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city has been in denial that a gang problem even exists," said 
Councilwoman Doris Topsy-Elvord, a former county probation officer whose 
central Long Beach district includes many gang-infested neighborhoods. "For 
years, this city didn't even want to recognize it, but I had (gang members) in 
Long Beach on my caseload." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the city examines its gang problems only when high-profile 
incidents push the issue to the surface. After the shootings of the three 
Latinos last month, police blanketed known gang areas temporarily to catch the 
suspects and to quell further violence. City Manager James C. Hankla ordered 
the city Human Relations Commission to hold hearings on the Asian-Latino rift 
and other gang problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But community activists say a police crackdown will not bring peace to the 
streets in the long run. And they criticize the commission for failing to 
invite enough young people to the hearings, which were held outside the central 
city communities most affected by the gang war. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners point to the good they expect out of their recent meetings. 
At their urging, the City Council approved emergency recreation programs for 
the summer that will include city vehicles that bring sports equipment, board 
games and other activities to parks. The commission plans to hold further 
meetings on gang problems and will issue a final report to the council this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Manager Joe Rouzan, who coordinates the city's response to gangs, 
conceded that officials were slow to respond to the gang violence initially, 
partly because leaders hadn't expected tensions to flare between Latinos and 
Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rouzan said the recent commission meetings are only the latest effort to 
address the gang troubles. In recent years, the city also has hired more police 
and formed athletic leagues for inner-city youths, among other things, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rouzan heads a new task force that is examining the effectiveness of various 
anti-gang programs run by the city and other organizations. Next month, the 
task force, which includes police, youths, school district officials, court 
officials and others, will list anti-gang programs that deserve the most 
funding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some police and gang counselors question whether the city's efforts will have 
any impact on gang members who feel shunted by adult authorities and care 
little about official edicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the meetings in the world aren't going to make a bit of difference if 
you've got a 15-year-old running around at 10 o'clock at night with an Uzi in 
his hand and killing on his mind," said Long Beach police Sgt. Jim Bisetti, who 
oversees a joint gang task force with the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders, police and community activists appear to agree on one point: Any 
solution will have to include grass-roots organizations that work closely with 
the gangs. Some counselors on the street say that real change will ultimately 
rest with the families and religious institutions that play a dominant role in 
the Latino and Asian communities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even a dedicated corps of counselors and pastors will have a difficult 
time putting an end to the gang war because of the racial animosity that 
divides the sides and fuels the violence, activists warn. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang members themselves scoff at notions of peace, and are reluctant to 
consider a truce like the one that has helped bring a tentative peace among 
some African American gangs in Watts. The young gang members in Long Beach are 
prepared to continue the battle, they say, even if it means their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not gonna let 'em shoot us," said the 17-year-old Cambodian gang member 
with the bullet wound on his calf. "If they do, we'll shoot them back."

NOTEBOOK / KIRBY LEE; RAMIREZ IS HOPING TO GET EAST L.A. COLLEGE PROGRAM BACK 
ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The track and cross-country programs have returned to East Los Angeles 
College. And so has Louis Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Montebello High coach who led East L.A. teams from 1988-90 and 
competed for the Huskies in 1977-78 has been named to head the recently 
reinstated programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, 38, who has coached at Trade Tech for the past four years, said that 
his ties to East L.A. and the school's facilities influenced his decision to 
return to his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams coached by Ramirez have won Southern California Athletic Conference 
women's cross-country titles. Ramirez led the East L.A. women to three 
consecutive SCAC titles before moving to Trade Tech, where the men's team won 
its third conference track title in four years this season. 
</P>
<P>
 While coaching at Montebello High, Ramirez led the Oiler girls to a 
second-place finish in the 1987 Southern Section 3-A finals and three 
consecutive Whitmont League titles. 
</P>
<P>
 East L.A. has not fielded a cross-country or track team since 1991. Ramirez 
took over in 1988 after the programs were suspended for two years because of 
budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be easier this time because I've established a wider region to 
draw from," Ramirez said. "I'm very well-known around East L.A., but I can also 
draw from City schools. There has been a void at East L.A., but there are a lot 
of kids already there that want to come and run." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Granville of Bell Gardens High has been named the State Sophomore of 
the Year by Cal-Hi Sports magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville, who last year was named the Freshman of the Year, won the 800 
meters in the state meet to become the school's first state champion and set a 
sophomore national record of 1 minute, 48.98 seconds this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State placed third in the Jakarta Sister Cities Men's Volleyball 
tournament in Indonesia, defeating Amsterdam in the consolation final. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers finished second in their bracket to Jakarta before suffering a loss 
to eventual champion Seoul in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, which won four of its six matches during the weeklong tournament, 
also registered victories over Cairo, Tokyo and New South Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood High won titles in girls' basketball and boys' volleyball in the Watts 
Summer Games at Compton College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights defeated Washington, 49-38, in the basketball final, and Lynwood 
defeated City Section 4-A champion University in the volleyball championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Prince scored 20 points to help Dominguez beat Dorsey, 92-58, in the 
boys' basketball final and Schurr, paced by the doubles champion team of 
Richard Tellez and Raymond Lee, won the boys' tennis title.

AVONDRE JONES LOOKS TO REBOUND FROM TURBULENT YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Avondre Jones had been through the recruiting process before. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones didn't know what to expect when he was granted a release from his 
basketball scholarship at USC earlier this month after a troublesome freshman 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, interest in the 6-foot-11 center has been comparable to his senior 
year at Artesia High in 1993 when he was sought by nearly 100 universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not as many letters, but a lot of calls," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Virginia Ruffin, bracing for the deluge, changed the family's home 
telephone number shortly before Jones' decision to leave USC was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recruiting was a very hard time for us," Ruffin said. "We changed the phone 
number so we would not have to go through it again." 
</P>
<P>
 An unlisted number, though, hasn't stopped calls from some coaches. Others 
have resorted to calling Ruffin at work. Tranquillity, however, should be 
restored soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 19, who will play for the West team in the U.S. Olympic Festival in St. 
Louis on July 2-5, expects to make his decision early next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has narrowed his choices to Missouri and Michigan, schools he considered 
before committing to USC, along with Louisville and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to know I'm wanted," Jones said. "I didn't know what the 
reaction would be when I left. I just want to start all over again. It's good 
to know people understand what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who is playing in the Say No Classic summer league at Trade Tech, can't 
pinpoint what went wrong at USC, but said he decided to transfer mostly because 
of lack of playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I considered the year a total waste," Jones said. "I didn't mind not starting 
when the season began and it wasn't a big deal. I thought it would change as 
the season went along but it really didn't change at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was touted as the first dominant center in eight seasons at USC for 
Coach George Raveling after averaging 21.2 points and 11.7 rebounds as a senior 
in leading Artesia to its third State Division II title in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But that scenario never materialized at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones started only one of 25 games, averaging 3.8 points and 3.1 rebounds in 
13 minutes per game for the Trojans, which finished 16-12. He fouled out of one 
game at Stanford in five minutes without scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like the (USC coaches) were looking over my shoulder and every mistake 
I made, I was coming out of the game," Jones said. "I was thinking about that 
instead of playing my game. I could never get into the flow. Raveling wasn't 
the bad guy, I expected to get yelled at during games. I just didn't see the 
message of it." 
</P>
<P>
 There were also problems off the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was suspended twice, once from the first-round Fresno State game in the 
National Invitational Tournament, for missing practice and a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to do it all over again, I would handle some situations 
differently," Raveling said. "I thought he would play more as the season 
progressed but things just didn't work out. There is not always immediate 
gratification in this society. There are rules. Patience is rewarded over time. 
I think he needs to realize that." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a chance Jones was not willing to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Raveling) told me they don't see any reason why I would want to leave 
because things were going to get better," Jones said. "I'm thinking they told 
me the same thing last year. I had one bad year and I couldn't afford to risk 
another one if I am going to do something with basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who finished summer school classes at USC this week, decided in late 
May to leave after receiving support from his parents, former Artesia teammate 
Charles O'Bannon, now at USC, and Artesia Coach Wayne Merino. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling met with Jones and his parents before agreeing to the release. Both 
Jones and Raveling said the parting was not adversarial. Jones retains three 
years of eligibility but must sit out a season because of NCAA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones strongly considered joining O'Bannon at UCLA before signing with the 
Trojans and expressed desire to attend UCLA if it were not for stringent 
Pacific 10 transfer regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference requires a player transferring to schools within the conference 
to sit out two seasons and relinquish two years of athletic eligibility. Under 
that rule, Jones could play only one more season. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as big men, I still feel I can play with anybody in the Pac 10 but I 
didn't see any future at USC," Jones said. "It didn't make any sense to be 
watching while somebody else was playing and getting better."

CAPTURING NICARAGUAN SPIRIT WITH REGGAE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ROOS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raymond Myers knows that when things get as ugly as they often have been in 
his native Nicaragua, it's vital to hold on to pride and hope in order to keep 
the spirit alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, 31, is a reggae musician from Bluesfield, on Nicaragua's Atlantic 
coast. He has seen unemployment, crime and political unrest engulf his war-torn 
homeland. Like many before him, Myers has used music as an outlet for both his 
anger and longing for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a bad situation over there," Myers emphasized recently during a 
phone interview from Culver City, where he is living. "We have a lot of 
problems, man, but we've got to hold tight, remain positive, and let music help 
soothe us from some of the stress and problems. I believe music can educate 
people . . . it has the power to reach out and touch our souls." 
</P>
<P>
 Influenced by reggae legends Bob Marley and Peter Tosh ("They took simple 
little folk music and made it a worldwide phenomenon"), Myers has forged a 
style reflecting his culturally diverse native land, which is inhabited by 
English-speaking Creole, Latin/Mestizo, Amerindian and Afro-Caribbean peoples. 
He blends reggae, salsa, soca (soul/calypso) and rock strains into his own mix, 
with lyrics in English and Spanish.  
</P>
<P>
 He and his 10-piece band performed Wednesday as part of the Long Beach Museum 
of Art's Summer Concert series. John Delafose and his Eunice Playboys, a zydeco 
band, launched the annual series June 22.  
</P>
<P>
 Myers focused on reggae with political overtones during his years as the lead 
singer, guitarist and composer of the Soul Vibrations band from 1986-'93. But 
creative differences within the band prompted Myers to pursue a solo career. He 
just finished recording new material at Jackson Browne's studio in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers met Browne about eight years ago in Managua, Nicaragua, at the 
Sandinista Assn. of the Arts. Touched by Myers and his music, Browne said he 
would try to help Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of his new songs finds Myers in strong voice, physically and 
metaphorically. The infectious "Aviva El Corazon" ("Lively Up Your Heart") is 
an ode to Marley's "Lively Up Yourself" and dances on a bed of catchy rhythms. 
The pulsating, horn-driven "Shame Guys" is a light-hearted knock at men who lag 
behind women on the dance floor. But it is "Latino Soy" ("I am Latino"), sung 
with immense pride and joy, that highlights Myers' new work.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a salsa song about Latin culture and our heritage," Myers said. "I just 
wanted to express the richness and humility of the Nicaraguan people, and that 
there is a unification between us. Not everything is as negative as portrayed 
by the media and outsiders." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said he is optimistic about his new opportunity as a solo artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to keep a musical tradition alive, but with a variety of roots reggae 
that is danceable, more commercial and less overtly political than the Soul 
Vibrations material," he said. "On my own, it is more challenging, but it's 
also more pleasing and comforting to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, who is married and has three children, is a believer in the notion of 
making the world a brighter place for his descendants. In that vein, he led a 
five-week music class last year for the Willie Gault Youth Enrichment Program 
at Jordan High School in Long Beach. About 80 disadvantaged inner-city youths 
received free music, dance, voice, art and drama instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great cultural experience for these kids," Myers said. "Man, you 
have to keep going to school . . . you have to have an education today. I mean, 
these kids are prone to drop out, so we've got to urge them to continue and not 
give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Through the power of his music, Myers hopes he also can be a positive force 
for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just try to express my feelings through my music," he said. "If I can 
capture the spirit of the people -- right at that moment -- it brings me such 
great joy. It reminds me of how I felt when I first started singing in the 
church choir when I was 14 years old."

SHORT & SWEET; IT'S ONLY NATURAL THAT CHILDREN GET COMFY WHEN COTTON CUTIES 
COME OUT TO PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sunflowers and pansies, ladybugs and butterflies, wild animals and dinosaurs 
-- when it comes to children's clothes, it's a jungle out there. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer is the season for fun prints on kids' play clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the time when children can do what they want, whether it's going to the 
beach or playing POG, the bottle cap game, by the hour. They can also wear what 
they want. For kids in Orange County, that means donning shorts, sun dresses, 
rompers, T-shirts and other clothes that are comfortable, colorful and 
festooned with eye-catching graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids like all-cotton or soft rayon fabrics printed with everything from tiny 
ladybugs to the giant inhabitants of "Jurassic Park." This summer, kids can 
have their pick of prints motifs: gingham, stripes, florals, beetles, gardening 
tools, seed packets, animals, sports, cowboys, cows and coffee cups. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they see dinosaurs in a book, they want dinosaurs on their clothes," says 
Kelly Wilson, co-owner and designer of Hide-n-Seek Reversibles, a children's 
clothing manufacturer in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colors and graphics appeal to kids," Wilson says. She and partner Christine 
Giannulli seek out all-cotton fabrics with quirky prints that aren't 
necessarily designed for children's clothes. They created one dress for girls 
printed with coffee cups and the words "espresso," "cafe latte" and other java 
terminology. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appealed to the mothers as much as the children," Wilson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Dads like the golf and fly-fishing prints featured on the boys' shorts and 
pullover hooded tops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We use a lot of theme prints you usually don't see for small boys -- 
airplanes, sports, surfing, animals," says Wilson, who began making shorts for 
her 3-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Many pieces in their line are reversible, such as shorts with a 
cow-jumps-over-the-moon print on one side and the word "moo" scribbled all over 
the other. Hide-n-Seek collections run from size 6 months to 6X and can be 
found at the Red Balloon in Fashion Island Newport Beach, Small Things Bright & 
Beautiful in Dana Point, Chelsea's Castle in Mission Viejo and Lucy Max in 
Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the styles by Hide-n-Seek at Lucy Max: a girl's jumper ($42) and unisex 
shorts ($26) printed with old-fashioned seed packets and a boys' reversible 
shorts in a navy bandanna print one one side and checks on the other or a blue 
Hawaiian print and matching gingham combination ($26). 
</P>
<P>
 "Children really go for prints," says Bernadette Kelly-Whelan, owner of Lucy 
Max. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly-Whelan designs clothes for her Lucy Max line, which sells at her store 
and 40 other retailers around the country. She uses whatever fabrics happen to 
catch her eye, staying away from cutesy materials made for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we pick up odds and ends and just make a small collection," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 For summer, there's a sun dress or trapeze top and bloomers for girls with a 
detailed print of garden tools in deep fuchsia, teal and green tones ($29). She 
used a vintage-looking cowboy print to make a boys' romper ($28). 
</P>
<P>
 She also favors prairie prints, such as sun dresses and jumpers in tiny 
pin-stripes, small florals or the gray and white gingham she used to make a 
girl's romper ($29). Such styles look like they were designed for farmers' 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladybugs, pansies, sunflowers, watermelons -- these are just a few of the 
popular summer prints used for children's play clothes at the Toddling Turtle 
in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hits of summer: girls' knit bicycle shorts by Anita G. of Newport 
Beach in a hot pink, orange and yellow tropical print with fish and palm trees 
($15), and boys' coordinating shorts and T-shirts in assorted beach prints 
(about $16 to $23). 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids live in shorts and T-shirts in the summer," says Pamela Haydon, store 
co-owner. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how pleasing the print, kids won't wear something that's not 
comfortable -- especially in summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They like things over-sized," says Susan Hoffman, owner of Balboa Island Kids 
Clothing Co. "And they won't wear anything that's itchy." 
</P>
<P>
 She carries sun dresses, shorts and tops that are loose-fitting and made of 
woven cotton and cotton knits, some printed with true-to-nature flowers and 
gingham checks. One line, by Fitigues, features thermal sweat pants, T-shirts, 
shorts, rompers and other cotton separates for boys and girls in muted hues 
such as white, oatmeal, celery, navy and black ($20-$50). 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing hard; everything's soft," says Kay Howard, co-owner of Little 
People & Me in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, girls will wear palazzos, broomstick skirts and lightweight 
shifts and bike shorts, inspired by clothes their mothers wear, while boys will 
don shorts and T-shirts. Bright tropical prints and florals are especially hot 
for the summer months, Howard says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun and games until back to school," she says.

HEAD AND SHOULDERS; THE RATINGS ARE OUT -- ON TV NEWSCASTERS. SOME EXPERTS 
SUGGEST SOFTER, UPDATED LOOKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 We invited local fashion and beauty experts to cruise the channels as our 
armchair critics. Here's what they think of some of L.A.'s anchors.  
</P>
<P>
 "Colleen Williams (of KNBC) could be a class act if she got rid of a few 
things," says Ty Moore, co-designer of the bold, sexy Van Buren line of women's 
wear. Such as her jackets: "They have embroidery and passementerie. And with 
the funky, natural white streak in her hair, it's too much to look at. I think 
her hair is perfect, but I would like to see her in Armani or Valentino suits." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore also suggests that KABC's Christine Lund wear "more sophisticated 
clothing" and that her station colleague Laura Diaz lose her "disco-bunny 
hairdo." Tritia Toyota of KCBS, however, "just does everything right," Moore 
says. "She's what a newscaster should be. She's never overdone, but she's never 
boring to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 Makeup artist Michael Maron, author of two books, including "Makeover 
Miracles" (Crown, 1994), sees Toyota a little differently. "I've always wanted 
to get my hands on (her), to reshape her eyebrows," he says. "She has one of 
the sweetest, prettiest faces and she can do so much more with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maron likes the "gamin look" adopted by KABC anchor Susan Campos as well as 
Diaz's recent "wonderful transformation," including her hair. ("Her sideburns 
are a little bit much," he concedes.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Martin (KCBS) and Pat Harvey (KCAL) could soften their hair and makeup, he 
suggests. And Tawny Little (KCAL) "should narrow the bridge of her nose with a 
bit of contour shadow." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Beck (KTLA) does "a fabulous job on her eyes," he says, but her 
lipstick is a little too dark sometimes, "which gives her a vampy look." Maron 
likes her bob, but suggests that layers would add width to her "slightly oblong 
face." 
</P>
<P>
 Hairstylist Bruno Meglio, co-owner of Bruno & Soonie in Beverly Hills, says 
that with a few exceptions -- notably Beck, Little, and Williams -- his desire 
is: "To get on the set and mess the hair up. It never moves." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Meizler and German Valdivia, the young designers/owners of JonValdi 
on Melrose Avenue, fault KNBC anchor Paul Moyer for dated ties and jackets that 
are two sizes too small. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Fishman (KTLA), however, is a success in one sense: "There was nothing 
striking about him," Valdivia says. "It was fine for what he wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Tuck "has some off nights," Meizler says, adding that the KCBS anchor 
looked very good one recent night in a tasteful tie, pocket square and 
double-breasted suit -- a style the designer usually dislikes "because it's the 
power suit of the '80s." KCAL's David Jackson got high marks for his impeccable 
single-breasted suits, French-cuff shirts and neatly patterned ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Bloch, a New York transplant and wardrobe stylist with Cloutier -- an 
L.A. agency that dresses and grooms celebrities for magazine and television 
appearances -- applauds several local anchors, including Jackson, Diaz, Jann 
Carl (KTLA), Harold Greene (KABC) and Wendy Walsh (KCOP). They get points for 
understanding the importance of color and beautiful lapels. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they're sitting -- and you see them basically from the waist up -- what 
happens, has to happen in the lapel," Bloch says. 
</P>
<P>
 KTTV's John Beard got the suit lapels right recently, but he destroyed the 
image with an ill-fitting button-down-collar shirt, Bloch says. Male anchors 
could take some sartorial lessons from New York Knicks' coach Pat Riley and 
O.J. Simpson's criminal defense lawyer, Robert Shapiro, he suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Martin's lapels "tend to be old-fashioned," he adds. And he would like to 
see her in softer colors: "One day she wore a bright yellow thing with white 
stripes. It was great if she were going to a cocktail party at the horse races. 
But this is a news studio, where she's telling me three babies have been 
kidnaped." 
</P>
<P>
 But even softer colors and updated jackets might not be enough for Bloch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why does everybody have to be in a suit and be so conservative?" he asks. "I 
don't feel anyone young can relate to these people. There's no one who dresses 
a little cool, no one who looks as if they looked at a (fashion) magazine. I 
mean, who do Winona Ryder and Johnny Depp and all the people like them relate 
to on the news?" ROSE-MARIE TURK

HEAD AND SHOULDERS; ANCHORS COME INTO OUR HOMES EVERY DAY. BUT SELDOM DO WE GET 
THE WHOLE PICTURE ON THEIR WARDROBES. THINK COMFY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tritia Toyota is between television newscasts and her silk blouse is not a 
pretty sight: It has been stained by coffee, a pecan roll and toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
 To complicate matters, the KCBS anchor is scheduled to meet the emperor of 
Japan after work and she has just drizzled glue on her black shoe -- in an 
attempt to reattach a bow. 
</P>
<P>
 Amused by the crisis, Toyota ties a stray grosgrain ribbon around her neck to 
dangle strategically over spots she can't hide with her jacket. And a deft male 
colleague paints her shoe with a black felt-tip. 
</P>
<P>
 Pampered prima donnas they are not. In addition to making minor repairs, 
members of the L.A. anchor corps generally do their own shopping, pay for their 
own clothing out of generous salaries, and often do their own on-camera hair 
and makeup. Pointers from management on dress and grooming are rare, they say. 
And they don't subscribe to the Joan Lunden method for avoiding frequent 
appearances in the same outfit. (The anchor of ABC's "Good Morning America" 
recently told W magazine that her wardrobe choices are noted on a six-week 
board in her office.) 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the anchors are parents who take children to school and dash home 
between newscasts for family dinners. All of them would be happy if viewers 
were riveted to the message, not the messenger. But they reluctantly concur 
that appearance, as Toyota says, is part of the package. "It's not something I 
wish people paid attention to, which is why, I guess, I wear the same sort of 
things all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Visible from only the waist up, pivoting gingerly in their chairs, catering to 
Middle America, they make easy targets. Everyone has heard or hurled the barbs: 
cardboard; carbon-copy Kens and Barbies in boring, sometimes cheesy clothing; 
big hair; too much makeup and flashy colors. 
</P>
<P>
 But they must be doing something right. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Ann Martin, the forever-pleasant media personality whom at least one 
fashion expert would love to revamp (see accompanying story, E1). She moved 
from KABC to KCBS earlier this year -- without changing a hair on her head -- 
for a rumored $1.2 million to $2 million salary. And viewers who contact her 
"are awfully nice," she says, most often asking where she buys her blouses. 
</P>
<P>
 She personally answers the calls and letters, although her latest career move 
has put her "a little behind," she says. "I have a stack of mail." 
</P>
<P>
 The switch has also forced her to contend with a new, deep-blue set, which 
rules out a favorite navy blazer and other dark jackets. And shopping for 
replacements has become more difficult now that designers prefer "neutrals and 
ivories," she says. "That can be fun for the real world, but not for 
television," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 Guided only by "years of mistakes," she looks for tailored, colorful clothing 
that will "show up against the background but won't attract a lot of 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Jewelry is equally tailored. "I don't want people to watch my earrings swing 
back and forth, and anything too glittery isn't professional. This is a pretty 
serious business." 
</P>
<P>
 Her naturally curly hair is almost its original color. It gets some help from 
her hairdresser, she says. But she doesn't get any nightly help: "Whatever I 
can coax it into is what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 And despite her salary, Martin isn't exactly rolling in clothes: "If you are 
always looking for something to wear to work, you're not looking for the fun 
stuff to wear to a baseball game or out to dinner. So that's where I'm 
lacking." 
</P>
<P>
 KCAL's Pat Harvey, who scored high with the experts, says viewers "pay 
attention to every little detail." They recently spotted a ring on her left 
hand and called or wrote to ask if she is engaged. (She isn't.) 
</P>
<P>
 She is most often asked the name of the product that adds shine to her 
jet-black hair (only her hairdresser knows) and where she shops. "Just about 
everywhere," Harvey says, from Nordstrom to the Downtown garment district, 
where she recently discovered "great Armani-style suits for half the price." 
</P>
<P>
 Her shopping strategy is similar to that of any business executive: "I have 
always tried to have a professional look," she says. "At the same time, I don't 
think there's anything wrong with a little color. The viewers like that. If I 
wear red or yellow, I get calls or letters saying: 'That's your color.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she says, she's never heard a negative word; not even after she 
crossed her legs and revealed that, like all anchors, she occasionally cheats. 
Dressed in a blue blazer and pearls, she wore what she thought would be 
off-camera jeans for a dash to the airport. One viewer who spotted them called 
to say: "Boy, I'm glad to see you're not so stiff." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no L.A. anchor aims for comfort as much as KTLA's Barbara Beck in her 
7-to-10 a.m. slot. Up at 4 a.m. and dressing at home means, she says, "that I 
often come in with two different black shoes. I put everything out the night 
before, just like when I was in school. But sometimes I forget and then I'm 
scrambling." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen months ago, Beck made a fashion switch that includes softer shades of 
reddish brown, beige and camel. 
</P>
<P>
 "All through the '80s, consultants taught us to wear bright colors and happy, 
happy jewelry," she explains. "I discovered bright pink and yellow are not 
colors for me, so I just decided to wear what looks good. I think the most 
important thing is to feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a big jewelry person," Beck adds. "For me it's an added complication 
in the morning. I don't want to think about earrings getting caught in the 
earpiece or necklaces getting caught in the microphone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her Barbra Streisand hairstyle, as one media expert describes it, replaced an 
asymmetrical cut that received plenty of viewer attention. "Everyone either 
loved it or hated it," Beck says. "Now I'm just ordinary and I don't hear as 
much (from viewers)." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the station has a makeup artist, Beck chooses to do her own. She uses 
a Lancome foundation, L'Oreal black Voluminous mascara and Paramount, a MAC lip 
color that is the clincher. "When I put it on, I know I'm going to work," Beck 
says. "I usually don't wear lipstick." 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota's 6 a.m. routine is so simple that she can be out the door in 10 
minutes. The clothing she carries in her car -- and almost her entire wardrobe 
for a last-minute assignment to Sarajevo -- reveal the serious side of her 
work: Bullet-proof vest, ski parka, thermal underwear, jeans, shirt, hiking 
boots, yellow slicker.  
</P>
<P>
 Her L.A. anchor attire includes "some jackets and skirts I've been wearing for 
15 years." She shops second-markdown sales and outlet stores, and doesn't 
obsess about clothing rotation. "I remember if I wore red yesterday," she says, 
"and maybe I won't wear red again today. But I can't remember what I wore past 
last Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
 KTLA's Jann Carl tracks her wardrobe with a simple closet strategy. But the 
anchor with model-perfect looks doesn't show a model's interest in her 
wardrobe. "I like to shop, but not for clothes," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She buys from catalogues -- Bloomingdale's and Barrie Pace among them -- and 
Ann Taylor, where, despite a litany of restrictions, she hasn't alienated the 
salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard when you walk in and tell them: 'No green, no yellow, no white, no 
checks, no floral patterns.' You go through this long list and they think 
you're the pickiest person they've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not everything goes over well. One viewer suggested that she donate a 
new brown suit to the Salvation Army. And a filigreed-patterned blouse, a 
present from her husband, was nixed by Carl's agent and the news director as 
too distracting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Fishman, Carl's co-anchor, says no one has ever told him what to wear. The 
former political science professor has been on the air 34 years, making him 
"the longest running anchor in America," he believes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishman dresses as if he were visiting someone in their home: "Generally, I 
tend toward a dark blue blazer or a dark suit. I dress conservatively because I 
don't want my clothes to be the point of interest."

<P>
 In all these years, he says, he's never gotten a letter saying: " 'Hey, that's 
terrible.' Or, 'Where'd you get that jacket?' Or, 'Maybe that jacket will be 
coming back someday.' " And no one seems to have noticed that he favors 
starch-free shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 KCBS anchor Michael Tuck says he takes special interest in his shirts, buying 
stripes and solids at Neiman Marcus or ordering custom-made styles from the Tom 
James Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months ago, during what he describes as "a very positive conversation," 
Tuck got some advice from his boss. "He wanted a stronger statement, more power 
ties, things of that nature. He made a very good point. I was dressing in too 
many light colors, and the ties were fashionable but they didn't convey any 
sense of strength." 
</P>
<P>
 So, was a clothing allowance thrown in with the suggestions? "Hell, no," says 
Tuck, roaring with laughter. "You're on your own."

FOOT SOLDIERS ON THE CULTURAL DIVIDE; CUSTOMS: A MOSTLY VOLUNTEER SQUAD KEEPS 
THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE DURING WORLD CUP '94. THESE DIPLOMATS HAVE TURNED 
PROTOCOL INTO A FINE ART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Brazilians gasped. 
</P>
<P>
 At their consulate in San Francisco last April, Brazilian dignitaries and 
World Cup '94 officials had nodded their approval to a plan to fly thousands of 
eager fans to Brazil's opening match against Russia. But with one gesture, an 
American World Cup official slipped over the cultural divide: He flashed the OK 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-page World Cup Protocol Manual contains the standard diplomatic no-nos 
-- no big arm movements; no gum chewing; always shake with the right hand, 
never with the left -- but nothing warning them of such a faux pas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three consular officials just gasped in horror," recalled David 
Sternberg, World Cup protocol manager for San Francisco. "As it turns out, that 
symbol is about 10 times more offensive than the middle finger is in our 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 For a brief, unshining moment, the atmosphere was "pretty scary." But after a 
short exchange, everyone laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the words of one participant, protocol is "the fine art of avoiding an 
international incident." For the tournament's 800 mostly volunteer diplomats, 
protocol is a mad sprint across nine cities, full of sleepless nights attending 
to everyone from Cameroon's tribal chieftains to the crown princes of Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 Protocol for the monthlong, 24-nation tournament is coordinated by executives 
in the World Cup '94 headquarters in Los Angeles. The diplomatic foot soldiers 
are a mix of world travelers, former White House advance personnel and 
volunteers just out of college who suddenly find themselves rubbing elbows with 
State Department experts and Secret Service agents who speak into their lapels. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's heady stuff," said Lisa Amore, World Cup '94's protocol chief for 
Washington and a veteran of several international cultural events. 
</P>
<P>
 One day in early June, Amore was waiting on the Tarmac at Dulles International 
Airport as Crown Prince Faisal and his massive entourage touched down. They 
joined a caravan of more than 200 artisans, musicians and folk dancers there to 
celebrate their country's dark-horse bid for the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 But Amore was worried. Prior to the royalty's arrival, she had sat through a 
30-minute film introducing Saudi Arabia to protocol officials. It contained no 
women. Amore could find only one female on the staff of the Saudi Embassy -- an 
assistant, and she was British. "I didn't know what the Saudis would think of a 
woman running the protocol department," she said. "I wasn't sure I'd be 
respected." 
</P>
<P>
 The ice-breaker came the following day, when dignitaries and royalty posed for 
pictures at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Tyson's Corner, Va. Amore watched as 
Prince Waleed bin Bader stared stone-faced into the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can smile, you know," Amore boldly told him. The prince began to 
nervously crack a smile, she said, and for the next several minutes "had a 
serious case of the giggles." 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, the Saudis spared no expense as they invited the entire 
50-person Washington protocol office to the embassy for a lavish four-hour 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one problem: no chairs. "We sat on the floor, fidgeting the whole 
time as our legs fell asleep," Amore said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her World Cup role, Amore has stirred the waters of inspiration in several 
cultures. During a telephone interview, Amore said: "I am currently being 
serenaded by a bunch of French ministers." (Her last name being ideally suited 
for crooning.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The mirth in Washington belies the fact that Amore, like her counterparts in 
other cities hosting matches, is sleeping three hours a night, attending to 
late-hour phone calls and myriad requests in different languages from various 
time zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Moller, the Los Angeles-based director of all World Cup '94 protocol 
operations, attends to his duties with the scientific precision of C3PO, the 
protocol droid from "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
 A change in plans? "We would need to take the venue scenario out of the 
holding zone and modify it to accommodate the new schedule," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardon? 
</P>
<P>
 "We leave nothing to chance." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a long way from his days as an intern for the 1984 Olympics in Los 
Angeles. Moller, now just 28, went on to write his master's thesis at Columbia 
University on the history of protocol in the United States and runs his own 
international diplomacy business out of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Moller's piece de resistance so far is the June 17 opening ceremony in 
Chicago, a "Gargantuan" and "monstrous" undertaking that involved weeks of 
preparation, handling everyone from President Clinton and Bolivian President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Oprah Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
 After flying into the 95-degree heat in New York the following day, Moller 
said that "I was so exhausted that I couldn't lift my carry-on bag off the 
plane." 
</P>
<P>
 Ceremonies surrounding the July 17 final in Pasadena are likely to be "a 
similar headache," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Moller was slaving away in Chicago, Mark Woodbridge prepared the 
protocol troops in Dallas for quite a different fete: Nigeria versus Bulgaria. 
The June 21 battle of the non-traditional rivals provided a study in contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nigerian delegation, which included several tribal chieftains and a 
princess, arrived decked out in a rainbow array of flowing robes, kente cloth 
stoles and kufi caps. 
</P>
<P>
 When a reporter asked Woodbridge to identify the chieftains, the Dallas 
protocol chief showed that even seemingly trivial details require a diplomat's 
sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 27 tribes in Nigeria. If I listed one name, then some chieftain 
would wonder why I didn't list his name. Then I'd have to list all the names," 
he said. "It'd be a big mess." 
</P>
<P>
 He did say, however, that the Nigerians were "a happy, jolly, fun kind of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the Bulgarian delegation was stern and remote, with "a real 
ex-Communist country kind of feeling," Woodbridge said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Dallas' brimming Nigerian community was more than happy to cheer on its 
team, the handful of former Bulgarians there declined to greet visiting 
officials, afraid of awakening ghosts from the Cold War, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Colombian delegation, who marched into the Rose Bowl heady with Pele's 
predictions of world domination, the World Cup became a grim undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his team's stunning June 22 defeat by the United States, Simon 
Gaviria, 9, son of former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, begged to be taken 
to Palo Alto for the next match against Switzerland, said Susan Metzler, 
protocol chief for Los Angeles. But Dad would have none of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not as eager to go, because of the loss, I think," Metzler said. "He 
wanted to return to Colombia." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For some, like the Saudis, even a loss can be a cause for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in three motorcades for the opening game on June 20 at RFK Stadium, 
Princes Faisal, Sultan and Bandar, along with some 300 other dignitaries, 
dwarfed the 50-person Dutch delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 The limousine procession moved at a hair-raising pace through the streets of 
Washington almost until the first chords of the Saudi national anthem, Amore 
said. Not 10 minutes before the game started, Prince Bandar, the Saudi 
Ambassador to the United States, decided he wanted to leave the luxurious 
quarters in the Tribune of Honor, high above the crowd, and sit below with his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the Saudi advance people were wondering if the other princes might 
like to do the same -- which would have entailed moving 45 people in a matter 
of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to quietly explain that it wouldn't be such a good idea," she said. 
"There was just one seat for Prince Bandar. I said 'Looking down, you can see 
there are no more seats. Wouldn't it be much more comfortable up here where 
there's water and fans?' " The Saudis eventually agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the 2-1 loss, she said, Faisal "just jumped out of his seat" after 
Faud Amin's wildly unexpected header into the goal, leaving the Saudis in a 
festive mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the games even started, Saudi Embassy officials put out the word 
that the visitors wanted 24-hour attention during their stay. They found their 
man in Gus Suleiman, 25, a Jordanian American businessman who went to preschool 
in Saudi Arabia and a military academy in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 At their expense, Suleiman was given his own quarters next to the Saudis at 
the Ritz-Carlton and flies with them to matches across the country. Suleiman, a 
mere volunteer when the Saudis found him, said he does not worry whether his 
job as a hotel desk agent is waiting for him when it's all over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was willing to take the risk," he said. "Besides, I'm pretty sure I can 
charm my way into anything."

BY DESIGN; THE PAPER CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pack of Crane cards and a sloppy stack of note paper left over from a 
previous marriage is a pathetic excuse for a stationery "wardrobe." (That's 
what it's called. Trust me.) But I didn't know just how pathetic my closet was 
till I met the stationery manager at Tiffany & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Ugh. Was I raised in a barn?  
</P>
<P>
 You can try blaming your personal stationery deficit on fax and phone. But 
even Hollywood agents and studio execs -- more familiar with those devices than 
they are with fine manners -- know that the Right Stationery signals membership 
in what French cultural critic Pierre Bourdieu called "the desired social 
subset." Few scripts land on any desk in town without a buck slip paper-clipped 
to the top. As in: Perry, Talk to me about this. Don. Printed only with the 
company logo and a name, the cards presuppose a relationship, a mutual 
understanding of how things work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just the appropriate size to drop an apothegm," notes Castle Rock 
Entertainment executive John De Simio. He says he goes through hundreds of the 
3-inch-by-7-inch cards a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like when someone gets a promotion," he explains. "I'll write 
'Congratulations. It's good to see a meritocracy exists at your studio.' " 
</P>
<P>
 These days, that's about as many words as anyone in or out of Hollywood cares 
to write, stationers say. Yet etiquette doyen Letitia Baldrige persists in 
describing all manner of monarch sheets, half-sheets, informals and notes in 
her massive guidebook, "The New Manners for the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 Wake up, Tish! Judging by all the blank books I've seen bulging from racks and 
shelves in stores around Los Angeles, I'd say the only people left with any 
enthusiasm for the long form are neurotic journal writers grappling with their 
own life stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, inspired by compulsive letter-writer Alexandra Stoddard's book "Gift of 
a Letter" -- imagine a literary, quotation-happy Martha Stewart -- and the 
popularity of a recent translation of George Sands' correspondence with 
Flaubert, I recently went in search of my own wardrobe of status symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heights: First stop, Tiffany & Co., Beverly Hills. This is where you go 
for perfection. Hold the gorgeous Crane paper to the light and see the coveted 
Tiffany watermark. Scratch the lettering (a sorority sister test, like biting 
down on pearls), and it won't flake because it's engraved. Get treated like a 
princess and rest assured that typefaces and colors have been pre-edited to 
spare anyone from appearing tasteless. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany's John Petterson says the trend is toward very conservative, 
traditional stationery. But like the Hollywood honchos, even Tiffany customers 
think shorter is better and are more inclined to order correspondence-card 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred correspondence cards engraved in Parsival type, with matching 
envelopes, cost about $200. A woman clever or dull enough to keep the same 
husband and address for the rest of her life can use the custom-made die till 
she does. 
</P>
<P>
 The Middle Ground: At the Drexler Collection in Santa Monica, former gallery 
owner Paul Drexler carries some of the most innovative paper designs around. 
Drexler, an attorney-turned-stationer, produces an eye-boggling array of 
illustrated papers made from antique images he's collected over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 A trip to Flax, the artist and architecture store in Westwood, is like a trip 
to the storage room in elementary school: The sheer abundance of materials 
makes your head spin with possibilities. There is a wall full of stationery, 
sold by the pound, made by a company called Paper Weight. It is subtle, 
serviceable and, with some imagination, can be every bit as personal as the 
more expensive variety. A friend designed a rubber stamp with her name and 
address to use on this paper. It looks fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
 While the average ready-made rubber stamps are too cutesy for adult 
stationery, Oggetti, the marbleized-paper store in Century City, has an 
assortment of ethnic stamps made of Lucite for $9. They make a sort of 
wood-print-like design when repeated across the top of paper. (A sculpted raw 
potato just doesn't work for this, no matter what the crafts books tell you.) 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Art Supplies carries an assortment of Strathmore's blank, heavy cotton 
paper note cards with deckle edge, designed to take a variety of mediums -- 
watercolor, pastels, charcoal. Perfect for those periodic non-verbal moments in 
life. This store also carries an enormous variety of handmade and unusual 
papers priced from $3 per 20-inch-by-24-inch sheet to $20 and up. 
</P>
<P>
 If that route sounds too exhausting, Bandelier of Sante Fe, N.M., makes 
environmentally correct and acid-free (meaning it won't disintegrate like the 
paper you're reading) stationery in social sheet size -- 5 inches by 7 inches 
-- tied up in a clever corrugated portfolio for $19. Bandelier's wrapping paper 
is studded with balsam, which reminded me of the paper we used in grade school. 
Then, it was annoying to have one's beautiful pencilmanship interrupted by big 
hunks of balsam. Now, we worship them. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting Corners: Yamaguchi is a Japanese import store on that stretch of 
Sawtelle between Olympic and Pico boulevards that is dotted with nurseries and 
sushi restaurants. Japanese papers in cloudy hues of lavender and gold with a 
kid finish are $4.95 for 12 sheets and six envelopes. Added bonus -- each pack 
contains a heavy white card the same size as the writing papers, lined 
horizontally on one side, vertically on the other, to keep us uphill writers 
level. Pick up a few disposable Japanese fountain pens in assorted colors for 
$1.99 and write your little heart out. 
</P>
<P>
 When you care enough to send the very cheapest, Hallmark's the ticket. 
Granted, much of the stationery here features teddy bears and flowers, but 
nowhere in town could I beat the price -- nor the honesty of a package called 
Lots of Letters. As billed, the plain box contains 50 sheets of paper and 25 
envelopes for $3.99. 
</P>
<P>
 For a bit of pure camp, I couldn't resist Paper Moon's pink, sputnik-style 
stationery. Designed under the Hallmark label, the papers feature an undulating 
border decorated with super sexy fashion model types from cut-art books. Across 
the top, in big loopy script it says: Oh-la-la. All for $8.

TREASURES FROM YESTERYEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMESBack when elegance meant plumed hats and 
gloves, Dona Evans collected. And now her stuff is back in style. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dona Evans opens a faded gold hatbox and pulls out a billowy creation covered 
in ostrich feathers that has been preserved in tissue paper for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a time capsule, the box and its contents recall the days when a woman 
without hat and gloves was not considered fully dressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans remembers the era well. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '50s, while still a teen-ager, she developed a love for glamour and 
began to cultivate an extensive wardrobe. Although her claim to royalty was 
limited to a stint as Miss Chevrolet and Miss Yo-Yo for Duncan Yo-Yos, she 
often dressed like a queen in flamboyant hats and gloves that matched her 
outfits to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 That age of elegance all but vanished in the mid-'60s, but the 58-year-old 
Santa Ana resident had saved almost everything she had worn since 1953, 
including a few bustiers and bras. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans has stacks of hats -- at least 50 by her rough estimate -- in their 
original boxes. She snaps open an old suitcase stuffed with gloves of every 
length and color, at least 200 pairs in all. And an immense shoe collection, 
which has taken over her linen closet, is intact. In four decades, she has worn 
out and discarded only two pairs. 
</P>
<P>
 She has held onto all of these things for one reason: 
</P>
<P>
 "I always hoped they'd come back in style," Evans says. "And they are starting 
to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Not until one of her friends encouraged her did she begin to unveil her 
treasures. She says she is thinking of forming a club with others who share her 
love of vintage clothing and hopes to loan her items to a museum for an 
exhibit. What she has could fill a small gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 She owns picture hats festooned with ostrich plumes dyed deep shades of 
fuchsia, royal blue or purple, and others with silk organza cabbage roses 
covering their wide brims. A turquoise garden-party hat with a square brim 
decked with silk roses is a real head-turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the purses she has saved over the years: funky foot-long envelope styles 
in such metallic '50s colors as pink and turquoise; hard plastic handbags, some 
with mother-of-pearl and metallic confetti inlays, and a tiny brass bag that 
looks like a miniature bird cage. 
</P>
<P>
 She has boxes filled with costume jewelry, including complete "suite" sets of 
matching earrings, necklaces, bracelets and brooches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted things to match," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She has unusual pieces, such as a single leaf-shaped earring of thin 
gold-toned metal and faux pearls that curl over the top of her head like a 
miniature hat, or a leafy pair of black-and-white sequined clip-ons that extend 
above the earlobe instead of below it -- designed to be worn with a swept-up 
hairdo. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her '50s-era shoes look new, such as the clear plastic mules with 
colored rhinestones or the pumps covered in a floral-printed black and ruby 
silk. 
</P>
<P>
 Vintage dresses, most of them fitted sheaths and a few of them originals 
designed by Mr. Blackwell and left over from Evans' modeling days, still hang 
in her closet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still drag them out and wear them because they keep coming back in style," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Among old gloves filling bags: a bright orange short pair and an 
above-the-elbow avocado pair from the '60s, as well as assorted gloves in 
almost every shade of blue, from robin's egg to royal. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans' collection was born out of an appreciation for elegance, a word that 
turns up often in her vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, she played dress-up with her mother's hats, handbags and clothes. 
She loved watching such old movies as "Gone With the Wind," featuring actresses 
in beautiful ball gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'I would love to get into those,' " she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans grew up in an affluent part of San Diego, but she says her family was 
not as wealthy as many of the neighbors. She recalls envying in high school the 
girls with huge wardrobes. She can still remember the name of a classmate who 
had "endless cashmere sweaters." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How Evans acquired her inventory is a tale of hard work, determination and a 
passion for fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 To earn money to buy clothes, she sold flowers, washed dishes, knitted and 
sewed for others as well as worked part time for the phone company. She spent 
the money on hats, handbags and her beloved cashmere sweaters, items she could 
not make on her sewing machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sold telephone stock to buy a white fox fur stole," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 A receipt for a blue feathered hat found tucked in a hatbox reveals that Evans 
never scrimped on her wardrobe. The price of the hat, purchased at Bullock's in 
Santa Ana in 1956, was $62.40 -- no small sum in those days, especially for a 
working girl. Yet Evans quickly points out that many of her hats cost more than 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans always wore the clothes well. Although she complains of having "football 
shoulders," her 5-foot-6 frame with its hourglass shape was tailor-made for 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-ager, she modeled for the Fashion Quarter, a tony store in San 
Diego. Models were expected to supply their own gloves and shoes, which only 
added to Evans' inventory. Through her modeling work, she acquired such gems as 
her Blackwell originals. 
</P>
<P>
 Now an income tax expert, Evans still adds to her wardrobe. She frequents 
Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom, looking for elegant merchandise. She saves the new 
items too. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she misses the glamour of the past. She complains that people don't 
"dress" anymore. Even Hollywood actresses look "trashy." Few women, she says, 
have the elegance of Princess Diana ("she almost always wears a hat") or the 
late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elegance is being lost," she says, "and I don't think it should be."

OFF THE CUFF; MANICURIST FILES DOWN 'MADGE THEORY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 J ulie Walker, like Rodney Dangerfield, just can't get any respect. The owner 
of Essence Nail Salon in Newport Beach, who has been a manicurist for 13 years, 
says it's because of her profession, one that requires her to file 400 nails a 
week.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the Madge Theory: 'You're soaking in it,' as if people think we're 
soaking our heads. Like we're little bubble heads."  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, she says the job requires expertise. Walker went through 350 hours 
of class time studying diseases and conditions of the nail and bones in the 
hands, among other subjects, and had hands-on experience performing manicures, 
pedicures and other common procedures.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although I'm fully licensed, I continue to attend advanced classes on nail 
care to update my skills. One class recently offered by the Red Cross was on 
"AIDS in the Workplace." I don't have AIDS, but I was concerned about the 
possibility of transmitting HIV from one client to another. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross representative said the potential for transmitting the disease 
through what I do is slim to none. I very seldom cut anyone, and when I do, I 
either throw away the hand file or sterilize the instrument in an approved 
antiseptic that kills HIV. HIV is a fragile virus and can't live long outside 
the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Some clients have purchased drill bits, files and nippers, and they bring 
these to me to use on them each time. I'll gladly do it to ease their mind, but 
it's not necessary because of the precautions I take. I try not to hurt anyone. 
I'm not into pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Something manicurists can do to hurt clients is ignore mold or fungus 
problems. If a natural nail is lifting off the nail bed, most of the time it's 
because the artificial nail on top hasn't been applied correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 Or a natural nail can lift up because of improper maintenance. Acrylic nails 
are designed to be filled once every two to three weeks at the most. The growth 
of the natural nail creates a gap between the cuticle and the acrylic nail and 
if you let that gap get too big, water can get underneath the acrylic and mold 
will grow in that warm, dark place. 
</P>
<P>
 Fungus is not something you get from artificial nails; people without 
artificial nails get it, too. Cocktail waitresses call it "bar rot"; it's when 
the citric acid from lemons and limes eats away the soft tissue under natural 
nails. Gardeners get it from the soil and men and women get it by bumping their 
nails. Hard bumps tear the tissue underneath the nail, causing the natural nail 
to pop up and fungus to grow underneath. People call it "tennis toe" when it 
happens to their toenails. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason the new growth won't adhere to the nail bed is because of fungus. 
Some manicurists cut back the natural nail, and that gets rid of the fungus and 
the new growth will lay flat in the nail bed. But I recommend my clients see a 
dermatologist. If the fungus is not treated, it can spread from nail to nail, 
and fungus can affect new growth if the nail recedes far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Any artificial nail will do a small amount of damage to the natural nail, be 
it acrylics, silk, linens, fiberglass or gels. But none of it will affect new 
growth. Women think their natural nails will never be the same after they've 
taken off acrylic nails, but acrylics only weaken the exposed nail. 
</P>
<P>
 When women take their acrylics off, they have forgotten why they had them put 
on in the first place: because their nails were weak, chipped or wouldn't grow. 
After having strong artificial nails that maintain the polish, they look at 
their flimsy natural nails and try to blame it on the acrylics. But artificial 
nails aren't to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Nails don't have to be long to look good. They just need to be well groomed. 
If the cuticles are taken care of and if you have lotion on your hands and 
elbows, you'll look nice. And any color looks nice if it's applied correctly 
and not slathered over the cuticles. 
</P>
<P>
 Men come in for manicures for the same reason women do: It's good grooming and 
it's an hour of pampering, a chance to chill out from the hectic day. 
</P>
<P>
 Artificial nails are so common today, I'm already seeing my next generation of 
clients. Young girls see their mothers getting their nails done and they want 
it done, too. My mother, on the other hand, will only have her nails done on 
special occasions because she still thinks of it as a luxury. But this new 
generation sees it as something everyone does -- my 2 1/2-year-old daughter, 
Jennifer, always has her nails polished.

INSIDE OUT: FASHION; WE ARE NOT AMUSED BY LINDA GRAY'S QUEENLY LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
 Showing they almost have what it takes, the cast of Fox Television's "Models 
Inc." strutted down the runway in a fashion show of Escada's fall collection 
last Friday night. Although one or two weren't quite runway model material, the 
youthful, attractive actors bedazzled the audience -- a bevy of out-of-town 
network affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, almost everyone. When actress Linda Gray took her bow at the end of the 
show (her character owns the fictitious modeling agency, so more than bowing 
wasn't required), one woman snipped: "She looks like she's tired of smiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm, close. We suspect that Gray was the tiniest bit unhappy with her hair 
and wardrobe. While her "girls" got to slink around in soft suits and long 
shiny hair, the leggy stunner -- who makes strong men weak and young men strong 
-- was dressed and coiffed like a porcelain doll. Who said the queen of a 
nighttime soap has to look like the Queen? 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, we scanned the crowd at Santa Monica's trendy Renaissance club for 
promised "Melrose Place" cast members. Did we miss them? we asked an affable 
Fox staffer on our way out the door. "Nah," he said. "It's a light talent 
turnout." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sound of One Hand Clapping: Flash forward to Monday night's trunk show of 
Donna Karan's fall collection at Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills. This audience 
claimed to adore the clothes (except for the woman who declared one illusion 
net top "way too Madonna"). But they didn't break into applause till the very 
end. Is it a trend, or is the miserable heat making everyone blase? Perhaps the 
line was so wearable, as several fans noted, that no one was thrown into a fit 
of fury -- or ecstasy. For a more conclusive opinion, we asked one of the 
evening's bartenders for his take. "The neon colors were great," he bubbled. 
Karan's vivid tones reminded him, he said, of a Pedro Almodovar film. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Call Them Elitist: Couture gloves by 30 French designers, including 
Sonia Rykiel, Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld, got their day in the sun 
at a first-ever glove fashion show in Paris late last week.  
</P>
<P>
 The show, according to Associated Press, paired gloves with trendy cat suits 
and elegant couture outfits. Yves Saint Laurent showed pretty, long mosaic 
gloves with his miniskirt and red thigh boots. Dior showed a trouser suit with 
"eyelet"-cut leather gloves and shawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by the renewed interest in hats, luxury glove-makers tested the 
waters for their product using, but of course, le consumer survey. Paul 
Rigaudy, president of the French Federation of Leather Gloves, reports: "The 
survey proved most people don't think wearing gloves is snobbish." So there. 
</P>
<P>
 Better Gangsters Than Fascists, We Suppose: You might call it tabloid fashion 
-- ripping styles from society's most notorious characters. Italian designers 
Dolce & Gabbana found inspiration for their 1995 summer collection in the 
virile look of Mafia don turncoat Tommaso Buscetta, Reuters reports. "We liked 
his style," the designers said in an article they wrote for Turin's La Stampa 
newspaper. Buscetta's style -- etched into the minds of Italians through his 
testimony at televised trials -- runs to dark jackets worn over open-necked 
white shirts, cuffed trousers, shiny shoes and gangster dark glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be provocative," the designers allow, "but let's remember this is only 
a gag. We're talking about clothes, about an inspiration for style." 
</P>
<P>
 And Speaking of Italians: The Italian World Cup soccer team -- which tied 
Mexico Tuesday -- may qualify as the best-dressed off the field in their 
Giorgio Armani wardrobes. The designer outfitted the team and staff for half 
price. . . . We're thinking of taking up the game. 
</P>
<P>
 And Speaking of Soccer: Want to look like your favorite soccer player? Well, 
you could grow a very long red goatee, a la Alexi Lalas, but the less patient 
can tune in to QVC tonight at 6 p.m. to score World Cup duds. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk a Mile in Her Shoes: Deposed talk show hostess Vicki Lawrence has 
deposited her wardrobe for the canceled "Vicki!" show at the Address, a Santa 
Monica resale store. Owner Maureen Clavin has about 37 pairs of shoes (Sizes 8 
1/2 and 9); 10 suits (Size 12), and an array of costumes the actress wore while 
performing skits on the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: the infamously hideous "Momma" dress (along with "the ugliest 
shoes you've ever seen," Clavin said); a Madonna costume featuring a bodice 
with sharply protruding cones, and a chartreuse "Super Vicki" suit, complete 
with large letter V . Clavin's selling the costumes by silent auction this 
month. "People can bid whatever they want -- no minimum." She'll donate the 
money to Pediatric AIDS Foundation.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fess Parker -- best known as the brave frontiersmen in coonskin hats, Davy 
Crockett and Daniel Boone -- has settled in northern Santa Barbara County on a 
700-acre ranch as a winemaker. But he hasn't forgotten his roots.The "Davy 
Crockett All-American Independence Day Celebration" will take place Sunday on 
the grounds of Parker's winery, 6200 Foxen Canyon Road in Los Olivos. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a mountain man encampment with ax throwing demonstrations and 
crafts from the frontier days. You can ride a stagecoach, listen to tales of 
the Old West and hear a reading of the Declaration of Independence. A live 
country band and a chicken supper round out the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids and grown-ups can play games of the period, such as the gunnysack race, 
three-legged race and the fire brigade water bucket race. There will be a Davy 
Crockett costume contest open to all ages.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fess Parker family, including grandchildren, will join the event, 
scheduled for 3-7 p.m. Parker and his wife, Marcy, run the winery, son Eli is a 
winemaker and daughter Ashley handles the marketing. The winery's first harvest 
was in 1992. The Independence Day celebration is $25 for adults (includes 
chicken supper) and $12 for children; tickets at the gate $15 (without dinner).

RSVP; GALA JOFFREY DINNER KEEPS BALLET FANS ON THEIR TOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Felisa Vanoff quoted Martha Graham, calling the dancers "Acrobats of the 
Gods." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, the band took its cue and the dancers of the Joffrey Ballet -- who 
had just been thrown dozens of bouquets onstage at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion -- tripped down the magnificent staircase of the Grand Hall to greet a 
black-tie dinner audience that loved them. 
</P>
<P>
 There was yet another standing ovation. (Most members of the orchestra had 
risen to their feet after the finale in the Pavilion, and upstairs in the 
Founders, the loud cheering was like a soccer crowd.) 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the party band broke into "Hello, Dolly," but substituted "Hello, Jerry 
. . . it's so nice to have you back in town." And Gerald Arpino, the Joffrey's 
artistic director, descended. 
</P>
<P>
 Arpino took the microphone to return the compliment: "It's good to be here. 
I've been over the hot coals and I've made it, and it's good to be back." He 
referred to the fiscal and political turmoil when the Joffrey left the Music 
Center after being its resident ballet company from 1982 to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Vanoff, who chaired the elegant dinner with Linda LoRe, president of 
Giorgio's, said: "I wish with my heart that they will have their home here 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Signed toe shoes sheathed in luminous Lucite amid tall wispy orchids and roses 
were the centerpieces on every table. 
</P>
<P>
 Honorary chairwoman Caroline Ahmanson sat next to Arpino. Celebrity chairs 
Whoopie Goldberg and Patrick Swayze were on location, thus absent, so the other 
celebrity chairwoman, Lisa Niemi, was coddled with extra attention. 
</P>
<P>
 So was ballerina Jodie Gates, who starred with Tom Mossbrucker in "Light 
Rain." She sat next to Joffrey CEO and benefactor Joseph H. Wender. "There was 
something thrilling and exciting in the air tonight -- I really felt the energy 
in the audience when we came out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the performance, benefactors had cocktails in the Blue Ribbon Room. Ed 
and Ruth Shannon (on the founding board) mingled with Mary Lyman (Joffrey board 
member from La Jolla and Iowa City) and Abe Tucker, a San Francisco board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 At the dinner, gala co-chairwomen starred -- Kathy Giannotti, Donna Kamin, 
Barbara Rodstein and Elizabeth Hirsch. They were getting superlatives, as were 
co-chairwomen Janet Eggers, Susan Rothenberg, Nancy Sanders and Barbara 
Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop's Kent Kressa had to catch a morning plane, but he and Joyce were on 
the dance floor late -- when they weren't conversing with Phyllis and Michael 
Hennigan (who brought their daughter, Cassandra, a Princeton junior) and 
Shelton G. Stanfill, president of the Music Center.

INTO THE NIGHT: RSVP; THIS PARTY'S NO BOMB; IT'S A BOOMING SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Scene: Tuesday's premiere of MGM's pyrotechnical thriller "Blown Away" at 
Mann National in Westwood. An elaborate party came afterward. "You get lots of 
boom," said star Jeff Bridges about the story of a Boston bomb squad dealing 
with an Irish bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Bridges; co-stars Lloyd Bridges and Suzy Amis; director Stephen 
Hopkins; plus 1,600 guests, including Ellen Barkin, Emilio Estevez, Malcolm 
McDowell, Jon Bon Jovi, Morgan Freeman, Mick Fleetwood, Diane Lane and Gary 
Busey (who wore stretch pants with a kimono jacket, "the Joey Buttafuoco look," 
in one guest's words), plus MGM and UA execs Frank Mancuso, Michael Marcus and 
John Calley. 
</P>
<P>
 Subject of Conversation: That the actors' Irish brogues seemed to breeze in 
and out from scene to scene. More than one guest referred to this as the Kevin 
Costner school of accents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Party: A parking lot done by Ambrosia as "a post-industrial funky 
warehouse" to match the film's detonated landscape -- car carcasses, twisted 
scaffolding, metal hulks spewing smoke and enough Irish themed food to cater 
Peter O'Toole's wake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Don't-You-Know-Who-I-Am? Moment: When the main theater ran out of seats, 
hundreds of guests were sent to an overflow screening. Some acted as if they 
were being dragged off for mandatory root canals. 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Mode: Warm weather after-work clothes -- summer-weight black dresses, 
linens and sufficient rayon for a bowling shirt factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Trend Accessory: Small leather backpacks. One woman wanted to know, "is there 
such a thing as an evening-wear backpack?" 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Discussing the dramatic qualities of the O.J. Simpson saga, 
entertainment attorney David Colden said, "I always tell my clients to go back 
to the classics. This is 'Othello' meets 'Speed.' "

 The world's largest black armband: Sure, it's another distinction that L.A. 
can claim. A black bandage has been wrapped around the City Hall tower for more 
than six months -- not as a symbol of mourning, as some visitors have thought, 
but as a safety net for earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Depressing any way you look at it.

 So, the City Council has approved a motion by Councilwoman Laura Chick "to 
evaluate the feasibility of decorating" the net. And Patrick Media Group, the 
billboard people, have agreed to donate their services. "We're not saying it 
should be a mural or a symbol or what," said Eric Rose, a Chick deputy. "But we 
should be able to come up with something. We have the most creative artists in 
the world in Southern California."

 Recommendations are due in three weeks. To do its part, this column is calling 
upon readers to submit ideas to us in the form of drawings. And, naturally, the 
most creative will be awarded with prizes from Only in L.A.'s Cave of Wonders. 
We've been trying to get rid of this "My Other Car Is a Zamboni" license plate 
frame for a long time, anyway.

 His lucky number? Numerologists no doubt are following the still-uncertified 
City Council election in Long Beach -- the one in the 7th District. You may 
recall, that Tonia Reyes Uranga appeared to be leading by seven votes when the 
balloting was completed Election Day -- the 7th of June. But, in a recount, the 
clerks found several uncounted ballots, giving opponent Mike Donelon a one-vote 
lead. Uranga's forces are examining the questionable ballots, pending a final 
declaration.

<P>
 But fate may be on Donelon's side, given the number of letters in his last 
name. miscelLAny:

 If what Princess Di says is true, we wish to apologize to her on behalf of all 
Angelenos. She says she was photographed by a camera hidden in the ceiling 
while she worked out in a London gym. Her lawyers say a permanent injunction 
has been issued forbidding distribution of the photos by the gym, whose name -- 
we're sad to say -- is: LA Fitness.
