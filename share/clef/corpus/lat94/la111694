JURY DUTY ON TRIAL; REMEDIES FOR L.A. COUNTY SYSTEM'S MANY PROBLEMS ARE BEING 
WEIGHED BY AN OFFICIAL PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The courthouse telephones don't always work, or they're endlessly busy. The 
jurors' waiting room is so crowded that some spend the day sitting on the 
floor. The elevators are slow and the heating system erratic. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury service in Los Angeles County too often is onerous and unpleasant. 
Citizens who arrive at the courthouse eager to "do justice" quickly find that 
the experience is short of the ideal. Service is long, 10 days generally, while 
some surrounding counties ask prospective jurors to serve only one day or on 
one trial. Those called in Los Angeles County typically do more waiting around 
and standing in line than anything else.  
</P>
<P>
 Little wonder, then, that many area residents don't leap at the opportunity to 
serve. The county is now faced with a high demand for jurors but a low number 
of people qualified and willing to serve. Last year, the superior and municipal 
courts had to mail out about 4 million jury affidavits to impanel slightly more 
than 187,500 jurors.  
</P>
<P>
 These problems have, if anything, been exacerbated by the spotlight on local 
courts recently in several highly publicized trials. Budget cuts, swelling 
criminal caseloads due to enforcement of the state's new "three strikes" law 
and the general deterioration of court facilities have not helped either.  
</P>
<P>
 The county's Economy and Efficiency Commission is now completing work on 45 
draft recommendations for improvements, which will be considered for formal 
adoption next month. The suggestions include shortening the term of service, 
simplifying the existing two-step summons procedure, upgrading courthouse 
facilities and juror amenities and raising juror compensation from the current 
rate of $5 per day. However, coming up with ideas for improvement is relatively 
easy; coming up with the money to implement them is something else. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the suggestions are controversial, and many are not new. (Los Angeles 
County tried a term of five days or one trial term in 1992 but considered the 
experiment unsuccessful, even though this and even shorter terms have worked 
well elsewhere.) The courts should look closely at these sensible proposals. 
And the Board of Supervisors should look hard for the necessary funds.

SMOKING OUT THE WHISTLE-BLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having wasted millions of dollars trying to repeal California's tough new 
anti-smoking law, Philip Morris is now cruising for another public-relations 
black eye. The tobacco company is suing the ABC television network over news 
reports, based partly on anonymous sources in the tobacco industry, that 
cigarette makers artificially raised the nicotine level in their products to 
keep smokers hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 The libel suit itself is not surprising, nor is the plaintiff's attempt to get 
ABC reporters to disclose their sources, but there is a troubling wrinkle. 
Philip Morris has sent subpoenas to hotels, car rental companies, phone 
companies and credit card issuers in an attempt to trace the movements of 
journalists as they gathered information for the story. 
</P>
<P>
 This attempt to make an end-run around press shield laws is properly being 
resisted by ABC, with the support of several other major news organizations in 
friend-of-the-court briefs in Virginia. They argue that, in this 
computer-driven Information Age, exposing such records would seriously 
undermine the ability of reporters to guarantee confidentiality to key sources. 
Certainly the reporter's privilege means very little if it applies only to what 
goes into his or her notebook. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, this situation grows out of excessive use of anonymous sources. Too 
many news organizations allow aggrieved persons to shoot at enemies from a 
newsroom duck blind. In very rare cases, reporters even have fabricated 
stories, using unnamed "sources." But that is not the issue here. If Philip 
Morris has a valid claim of libel, it should be able to prove that based on the 
content of the news programs, not hotel phone records. Let a jury decide 
whether it was libelous to say that the tobacco companies manipulated nicotine 
content and then lied to the federal government about it. 
</P>
<P>
 We suspect that part of the Philip Morris offensive is not to win a libel 
judgment but to intimidate its own employees who would be whistle-blowers. 
Despite certain abuses, press access to inside sources has proved to be a 
powerful tool to keep government and business honest, the Watergate scandal 
that brought down Richard Nixon being only the most obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 There are certain facts that cannot be obtained without offering sources 
ironclad promises of anonymity. The press should not permit sources to make 
gratuitously pejorative statements from under cover, but the public good 
requires access to knowledgeable sources without fear of legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philip Morris suit serves only to detract attention from the real issue: 
that the tobacco companies are marketing and promoting a dangerous product, and 
that they knew they were doing so long before the public did.

WORKING THROUGH A MOST DIFFICULT TIME; HOW BEST TO HANDLE THE PROP. 187 
AFTERMATH: VERY CAREFULLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a time for partisan politics and there is a time for responsible 
government. Nowhere is this distinction more salient than with the volatile 
issue of illegal immigration. For if there ever was an appropriate time for 
harsh rhetoric -- and The Times, which strongly opposed Proposition 187, 
doesn't think there ever was and doesn't think there ever should be -- that 
time is past. Further polarization must be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the problem may seem simple enough to some politicians in Washington, 
3,000 miles away from California's reality. Listen to Rep. Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.), slated to become House Speaker: " . . . We need a system of being able 
to deport you that is very efficient and very fast and works." That's easy (if 
chilling and regrettable) for Gingrich to say, but to the thousands of hospital 
and school officials directly affected by last week's passage of 187, the 
reality is something else. Washington politicians must realize that California 
now faces a difficult and testing time. They should send less hot air and more 
federal money westward to help with the immigration problem. 
</P>
<P>
 RESULT OF NEGLECT: Gov. Pete Wilson, who was wrong to support 187, was never 
wrong to press Washington to take more responsibility for controlling our 
international borders, both north and south. That huge task includes blocking 
the many paths through which people enter illegally. For years The Times and 
many others have made the point that while federal immigration law put a 
phenomenal burden on the affected states to cope with immigration pressures, it 
did not provide the states with the resources to respond to those needs. The 
overwhelming passage of Proposition 187 was in part the result of that chronic 
neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage was unfortunate but predictable. It now falls to the good people of 
California to make the best of the new situation, to respond to the 
requirements of 187 (in the event the courts do not strike them down) with 
humanity, with thoughtfulness, with caution. Credit those who already are 
urging restraint through avoidance of polarizing statements or premature 
enforcement action. For instance, it was reassuring to hear state Atty. Gen. 
Dan Lungren publicly reject the idea that school and hospital administrators 
are to be subject to police action by the state. And it was wise of the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors to avoid jumping into the legal fray, when 
there are already so many parties in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 But then there are the other sorts of voices -- people calling for the 
end-of-the-year deportation of tens of thousands of Salvadorans whose legal 
immigration status is scheduled to expire Dec. 31. Given the current atmosphere 
of uncertainty and anxiety, President Clinton should extend their legal status 
for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 GOVERNOR OF ALL: For his part Gov. Wilson must demonstrate that he understands 
the need to govern all the people. Why start out right after the election 
announcing an executive order focusing on pregnant women and the elderly? What 
he should want most of all is not this but the $3 billion from Washington he 
believes is needed to compensate the state for services to immigrants now 
financed by California taxpayers. Newt, can't you help? 
</P>
<P>
 We have a further suggestion for the governor. We calculate it has almost no 
chance of coming to pass, but we suggest it anyway because it would be the 
right thing to do and there's no harm trying. It would be nice if Gov. Wilson 
picked up the telephone and asked various community and civic leaders who most 
strenuously opposed Proposition 187 to meet with him to hear them out on the 
best way to move forward. What Wilson needs to recognize is that his stubborn 
position on 187 created bad feeling and that it's now his obligation to 
initiate the dialogue. It would be desirable for the governor to hear wise 
counsel from civic leaders in all walks of life. Let's not work at cross 
purposes. Instead, let's begin healing the divisiveness.

WILSON AND PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his first directive regarding the implementation of Prop. 187, Gov. Pete 
Wilson moved swiftly to abort all prenatal care to illegal immigrants (Nov. 
10). The spurious and fallacious logic of this move is unmistakable on more 
than one count. 
</P>
<P>
 First, consider eligibility. When a child is born in the United States, the 
child is an American citizen. As such, Prop. 187 does not limit the child's 
eligibility for medical services. For all those "pro-life" proponents who 
believe life begins at conception, the fetus would be a U.S. citizen and 
therefore eligible for health care. This means prenatal services, since that is 
the only way the young American citizen can receive health care at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, consider cost. The cost of one day of neonatal intensive care, 
necessitated by inadequate care and education during pregnancy, would more than 
cover the cost of prenatal care for the entire term of the pregnancy. Even for 
those children fortunate enough to not wind up starting their lives (as U.S. 
citizens) as low-birth-weight, possibly drug-addicted or malnourished infants, 
attached to machines, there is a higher cost for delivery (an emergency 
service) when no prenatal care has been given. The taxpayers will be paying for 
this more expensive care, because emergency care cannot be denied to any 
person. The idea that there will be any savings from denying prenatal care 
could not be further from the truth. This has been shown time and again all 
over the nation where prenatal programs have been put in place to reduce the 
cost of more complicated pregnancies -- complications which can be mitigated or 
avoided by the education and health care offered through prenatal care.

 * All of us in the Latino community have to be grateful to Gov. Wilson and the 
group that wrote Prop. 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this attack on the community, we were Mexicans, Cubans, Salvadorans and 
others. Today we are one.  
</P>
<P>
 This issue allowed us to unite as never before. Extreme right-wing Latinos, 
marching with liberal leftist Latinos.

 As a Cuban refugee who fled communism, a conservative Republican, I would have 
never thought that I would stand there, cheering on Dolores Huerta of the UFW. 
But I did. And her rage was mine.

 We now have two years before the next election. We will work day and night to 
register our voters. We will turn our permanent residents into citizens. Our 
students will walk into the voting booth, rather than walk out of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Then next election we will vote, and most importantly, we will remember.

 * I love how your article on the oil and trucking industries pressuring Wilson 
and the air board is on the last page of the front section (Nov. 10). Why is 
that? Don't want anyone to see it? What a joke.  
</P>
<P>
 California needs to take the lead in this area, not back down. Why didn't you 
list how much money oil company executives kicked in for Wilson? How much did 
they give Kathleen Brown? 
</P>
<P>
 TONYA VALACAK 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta 
</P>
<P>
 * William Bradley blasts Kathleen Brown for missing an opportunity in her race 
against Wilson (Commentary, Nov. 10). Bradley rightly claims that the 
electorate hungers "to be launched out of the doldrums." The reason why Brown 
rejected the visionary campaign advocated by Bradley in lieu of the plodding 
path she chose was that instinctively she probably realized that she and her 
party could not effectively articulate the vision that Californians now crave.  
</P>
<P>
 This past election campaign too often focused upon petty matters and was 
always negative, but underlying it was a popular insistence that old habits of 
collective and individual irresponsibility stop. The vision that the new 
majority wants is that of a responsible community made up of responsible 
individuals. In our ugly time, "Happy Days Are Here Again" pap is not wanted. 
What we want is a new birth of responsibility. Individual and collective 
happiness can only be built upon a firm foundation of responsible behavior. 
Balance all budgets, individual and collective. And if the Republicans fail to 
see this vision, then in 1996 it will be time for a new party to carry this 
message.

DEFEAT OF PROP. 188 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Prop. 188 votes are in. David has beaten Goliath. Campaign costs for both 
sides have been tallied. Or have they? Prop. 188, which pretended to be for 
tough no-smoking laws, was a Trojan horse initiative that should never have 
been on the ballot. Its full cost may never be known. But let me try to put a 
human face on it. In the midst of my feelings of triumph over the sound beating 
of Prop. 188 I received a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 My friend, who smoked for 50 years, has lung cancer. He quit smoking 10 years 
ago when he was diagnosed with emphysema. I thought of the months he spent with 
me campaigning against Prop. 188. He had brought the original Philip Morris 
petition to my attention. He had signed that infamous mailing, then invited his 
neighbors to add their names. But they read the fine print: Sponsored by Philip 
Morris. Unlike thousands of other duped Californians, my friend was spared the 
vexation of having helped put Prop. 188 on the ballot. From then on he helped 
spread the word to defeat it.  
</P>
<P>
 Pro-188 funds, to the tune of over $18 million, came from the tobacco 
industry's deep pockets. In letters to retailers and stockholders, they stated 
that its passage will help them all profit financially. 
</P>
<P>
 No-on-188 funds came from the American Cancer Society and the Heart and Lung 
associations., which donated about $600,000. Health education foundations and 
other groups donated around $4 million. This was much-needed money that, 
without a Prop. 188 battle, would have been spent helping people with projects 
such as cancer research and tobacco education for young people.  
</P>
<P>
 And what of those thousands of hours spent by their volunteers campaigning 
against 188? This was a cost too. That time could have been spent doing the 
things volunteers usually do -- from driving a cancer patient to therapy to 
teaching a group of students to avoid peer pressure about smoking. Or perhaps 
my friend and other volunteers would simply have spent more time with their 
families, instead of waving flyers in supermarket parking lots or marching with 
a No-on-188 sign at busy intersections.  
</P>
<P>
 Californians won this battle, but the rest of America be forewarned. You will 
be put through the same ordeal by the tobacco industry in the name of profit. 
Whatever name it goes by, any petition sponsored with tobacco industry money 
should be made to put its name alongside it -- in direct proportion to the 
amounts donated.

HUMANE OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I must comment on the Nov. 6 article regarding humane officers. The overall 
impression left by the article discounted the dedication of humane officers who 
monitor and eradicate cruelty to animals, overlooked the risks that these 
officers undergo when they infiltrate a dogfighting ring, disregarded the fact 
that humane officers partner with other peace officers in their efforts to 
combat violence in our community and ignored the fact that they serve as 
educators, career models, rescuers (they are willing to hang off a cliff to 
rescue somebody's injured dog) and disaster relief workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the article focused on the negative and exceptional aspects of this 
system. Even within this imperfect system, most California humane officers 
employed by reputable organizations receive training in excess of that mandated 
by the new law and could withstand scrutiny of any oversight board. In fact, it 
was the reputable organizations that joined together and demanded the more 
stringent regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 While I think it is essential that we constantly re-evaluate our programs to 
best fulfill our missions, it is also essential to keep a sense of perspective 
on the issue. This type of an article can do damage to those of us who exist on 
financial contributions and donations based upon our meritorious performances 
in the field. Such an article can impede the progress of our organizations, 
damage the reputation of humane officers at large, and give publicity and 
credibility to those who deserve it the least.

PLATFORM; A TEXAS HOWDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE WALKER, who recently moved to Austin from Los Angeles, writes about 
one place where California transplants are welcome. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Californians are wagon-training it to Texas, primarily to San Antone (doesn't 
matter it's spelled Antonio; that's how everyone says it) and to Austin, the 
capital city. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a million people live in this riverside community but she acts like a 
maiden of 50,000.This is not a quick and snappy place. Fast drivers, yes. But 
fast lane, no. People take time to say, "Howyou?" (one word) or "How you be?" 
And there's always time to make a joke or share a laugh. Always.  
</P>
<P>
 So if you are too important for cordiality, stay put. And if you suffer from 
Movie Star Syndrome where no one else is quite as beautiful, talented or 
successful as y'all, then move to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, though, Texas is too cool to be rude, They don't even have fences 
around their yards. This might explain why "Friendship" is the state motto. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't tell you how many times I've been greeted with "Welcome to Austin" or 
"Welcome to Texas." This goes a long way in making up for humidity and 
chiggers.  
</P>
<P>
 In Texas they say, "If you don't like the weather, just wait a minute." I 
waited all of August. The humidity stayed stuck in the trees like gray glue -- 
except for one storm that dynamited the sky, pelting us with five inches of 
hard rain in one night. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there was the wave of storms this fall that flooded all of Houston. 
(But that's just more reason for living in the hill country.)  
</P>
<P>
 So put your attitude out with the rest of the trash, and come on down. Best 
hurry. As my friend Robin (from Odessa by way of Dallas) says, "Austin's not 
too big yet to be rude."

LITERALLY ABOVE IT ALL.

 Johnny Carson once used a news clipping about a notorious criminal case in his 
monologue: These two women tried to kill this Marine drill sergeant; one was 
his wife. They first tried to detach his brakes; all he did was fix them. Then 
they fed him massive quantities of LSD; he did not change his behavior one 
iota. Then they fed him blackberry pie laced with scorpion sacs; he took one 
bite and spit it out. Then they threw a rattlesnake in his bed; not only did it 
not bite him, but, to the wife's consternation, they couldn't find it in the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny thought this case was hilarious and everybody laughed. Everybody but my 
good friend Lou Boyle. Lou was the prosecutor on the case, and he knew that 
eventually the two women drugged the sergeant and beat his head in with a lead 
sash-weight. With the first blow, he regained enough consciousness to shout the 
name of his wife to warn her before her friend struck the second, fatal blow. 
</P>
<P>
 When the media asked Lou to comment, he refused. The bungled murder attempts 
may sound amusing with the distance of recollection, but not at the time. At 
the time, there was a trial going on. 
</P>
<P>
 A criminal trial must represent an unadorned attempt to get at the truth. All 
else must be subordinate to that end. The court's role in that effort is 
special. The court decides what evidence has sufficient reliability for the 
jury to hear, tells the jury what rules of law to apply to their factual 
finding and may dismiss a case unilaterally if warranted. That neutral role 
requires a kind of distance between the persons performing it and those vying 
before them. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no accident that a judge wears robes and presides from a raised 
platform, and that we all rise when he enters the courtroom. There is a 
psychological reason for these trappings of majesty. We need to entrust 
disputes to someone in whom we all have confidence; where we agree that this 
judgment supersedes our own; where we need a modicum of authority and finality. 
The image of a friendly, human, vulnerable, folksy Will Rogers type of OK guy 
is fine for the next-door neighbor; not for this job. This is not someone we 
are supposed to like, this is someone we are supposed to respect. We do not 
respect him because of the sufferings of his childhood or the difficulties in 
his climb through law school but because of the position he holds. We may 
consider his personal attributes when selecting him for the bench, but not in 
weighing how seriously we are going to take his rulings once there. 
</P>
<P>
 The O.J. Simpson trial is testing our society's commitment to keep criminal 
justice separate from entertainment. And they are very different matters. Thus 
far, most participants in this trial, especially counsel, have shamelessly 
succumbed to the bright lights. I'm worried about the jury being influenced by 
the pomp and circumnonsense. What will yield the bigger royalties in a 
post-trial book: guilty or not guilty? 
</P>
<P>
 But most especially I am worried about the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with Judge Lance A. Ito's weeklong series of interviews with 
Tritia Toyota is not that it is hypocritical vis-a-vis his stance on media 
coverage. It really is not. Ito is not so much angry about coverage as about 
inaccuracy. He must have felt sure that the interviews would be presented with 
accuracy. The problem is that the neutrality of a judge, in reality or public 
perception, may be influenced by more than financial reward; for many, the 
notoriety outweighs all other inducements. 
</P>
<P>
 All along, the judge has confined his public appearances to the courtroom. Now 
he enters the spotlight to talk about his past, his values, his dreams. Hey, I 
don't want to hear that stuff. I want a neutral and detached arbiter who 
refuses to buy into the media extravaganza. I want someone who does not allow 
even the perception that media attention may be an influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do I see this as an opportunity to educate the public about judges or the 
system -- questions from Tritia Toyota? Come on. Let's not pretend we watch 
Barbara Walters clumsily feign sincerity and attempt to elicit a tear because 
we are being educated. 
</P>
<P>
 I want a judge who, like my friend Lou Boyle, will say "no comment" and do his 
job, disgusted that anyone would use a human tragedy for entertainment. I don't 
want to know a damned thing about Judge Ito except that he is going to be angry 
as hell if his jury is messed with, if the attorneys lie to him or if the media 
interfere with a fair trial on the merits. That's all I want to know. Even with 
Tritia Toyota, he can get that message across in 10 seconds; he doesn't need a 
week. And we certainly do not need to expand this circus into the chambers of 
the court.

MANY A SLIP 'TWIXT PASSAGE AND ENFORCEMENT; EVEN IF PROP. 187 SURVIVES THE 
COURTS, ITS OUTCOME WILL DEPEND ON A NEW CADRE OF LATINOS IN LOCAL AND STATE 
OFFICE.

 On Nov. 9, 1938, Hitler's Nazi regime officially sanctioned the destruction of 
Jewish shops and synagogues, a major step forward in his drive to solve the 
"Jewish problem" in Germany. On Nov. 9 this year, Gov. Pete Wilson announced 
his executive order to immediately enforce provisions of Proposition 187 
affecting the health of the most vulnerable of the Latino community, pregnant 
women and the elderly. Wilson could have waited until the courts clarified the 
law, but, no longer a moderate, he has acquiesced to the right wing of the 
Republican Party, which demands not justice but tyranny, which values rhetoric 
over reason and which seeks to destroy rather than to build. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pyrrhic victory of Proposition 187 comes as no surprise to Latinos. Those 
who remember the ugly political battles over the 1986 Simpson-Mazzoli 
immigration bill and the English-only movement have learned that when elections 
become racial, implementation of laws become problematic. Although the state 
attorney general pledges to fight for 187 up to the U.S. Supreme Court, even he 
recognizes that the resources are not there to challenge the multitude of 
lawsuits now under way from school districts, professional organizations and 
individuals that will whittle away any tangible benefits from this law. 
</P>
<P>
 Health professionals, teachers and social workers plan to engage in civil 
disobedience if asked to enforce provisions of 187. Taxpayers will be stuck 
paying millions of dollars in litigation costs with no guarantees of successful 
enforcement but with the certain outcome of dividing a state that can no longer 
afford to divide. History has proved that the political shelf life of 
immigration reform is short, even when it is approved by the electorate, as the 
cost of enforcement soon supersedes any benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The flip side of this white voter backlash against immigrants was the 
consolidation of a Latino voting bloc that is no longer ambivalent about the 
legislative agenda of the state's Republican Party. If the Democratic 
leadership can capture and mobilize this constituency, it could easily become 
in the next 10 years a solid swing vote for Democrats. And unlike the situation 
in 1986, when California had only a handful of Latino state legislators and 
congressional representatives, there are more Latino elected officials at every 
level of government. This growth is not only in traditional Latino strongholds 
like Xavier Becerra's 30th congressional District, which includes East Los 
Angeles; Lucille Roybal-Allard's newly created 33rd District, which includes 
Huntington Park and South Gate, and Esteban Torres's 34th District, which 
covers La Puente and Pico Rivera, but also in non-Latino districts such as 
Assemblyman Joe Baca's 62nd District in San Bernardino County and newly elected 
Assemblywoman Liz Figueroa's 20th District in the Alameda-Santa Clara area.  
</P>
<P>
 That Anglo voters are beginning to cross ethnic lines to vote for Latinos 
speaks to the real political revolution that 187 proponents choose to ignore: 
</P>
<P>
 the growth of Latino participation on school boards, city councils and boards 
of supervisors as well as 
</P>
<P>
 in the state Legislature and in Congress. This presence will further challenge 
Wilson's attempt to enforce a popular but discriminatory law. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that the white electorate still determines the political 
fate of many Latinos, African Americans and others disenfranchised from our 
political system. Yet as the state's aging Anglo electorate flexes its muscle 
once again, it is with an utter detachment from the silent revolution that will 
continue to grow, not only in the 14 cities that are more than 70% Latino in 
Los Angeles County, but also throughout the state, where Proposition 187 has 
galvanized a new generation of Latino voters. And for Anglo voters who speed 
past the barrios, who choose to ignore the majority of legal Latinos who vote, 
live and enforce laws in East Los Angeles (95% Latino), Huntington Park (92%), 
Bell Gardens (88%), Baldwin Park (71%) and Lynwood (70%): We will be able to 
prevent enforcement of this racialized law. Even though pundits may dismiss 
Latinos as non-voters and passive participants in the political process, their 
permanent demographic presence in California cannot be denied. Soon Latino 
voices will be heard across this state.

CLIPPERS REMAIN WINLESS; PRO BASKETBALL: LAKERS RALLY BEHIND THREATT FOR 102-92 
VICTORY AFTER TRAILING BY NINE AT THE END OF THREE QUARTERS.

 You knew it wouldn't last. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who had lost their first five games by an average of 15.4 
points, built a nine-point lead going into the final quarter of Tuesday night's 
game against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clippers, the NBA's only winless team, couldn't handle success, making 
26% of their shots in the fourth quarter and losing for the sixth time in as 
many games, 102-92, before a crowd of 8,807 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had a chance tonight," Clipper Coach Bill Fitch said. "This was 
one of those we can look back on and at least say if. This was the first night 
we have been able to say if. " 
</P>
<P>
 Laker guard Sedale Threatt, who scored 12 of his 14 points in the fourth 
quarter, said the Lakers, who made 61% of their shots in the fourth quarter, 
didn't want to be the first team to lose to the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have hurt," Threatt said. "To come here and lose, it would have been 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers got a standing ovation at the end of the third quarter after 
building an 80-71 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were outscored, 12-2, in the final 3:46 as the Lakers won for the 
third time in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied at 90-90 after Clipper guard Terry Dehere made two free 
throws with four minutes to play, the Lakers scored 10 consecutive points. 
Cedric Ceballos, who had 24 points and nine rebounds, made a free throw with 
3:46 remaining to start the run and Threatt made a jumper with 3:02 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper forward Tony Massenburg was called for goaltending on a hook by Vlade 
Divac with 2:31 remaining and Nick Van Exel made a free throw with 1:36 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Divac, who had 24 points and 14 rebounds, added a dunk with 55 seconds left 
and Threatt made two free throws with 28.7 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out in the first half real sluggish," Threatt said. "Our guys missed 
a lot of shots. But we turned it up in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Coach Del Harris said Threatt jump-started the Lakers in the final 
quarter as they outscored the Clippers, 31-12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sedale was magnificent out there," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's such a great competitor that we always know he'll give us a spark out 
there. Nick (Van Exel) was struggling. He's a competitor, but he was 
struggling." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who missed 14 of 19 shots in the final quarter, missed five 
shots in a row before forward Loy Vaught, who had 14 points and 12 rebounds, 
tipped in a shot with 12.6 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers made two lineup changes before the game, one out of necessity and 
the other out of choice: Tony Smith for Eddie Jones, who had the flu, at 
shooting guard and Anthony Miller for George Lynch at power forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris had hinted after Saturday's loss at Golden State that he might make a 
switch to get more rebounding because Lynch averaged only 3.3 rebounds in 25.3 
minutes the first six games. 
</P>
<P>
 But the change didn't work as the Clippers, the NBA's worst rebounding team, 
outrebounded the Lakers, 23-19, in the first half en route to taking a 58-51 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a 6-9 rookie with only 19 minutes experience coming into the game, had 
only two points and two rebounds in 15 minutes. Clipper-Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper rookie forward Lamond Murray was 45 minutes late because he got stuck 
in traffic on his way to the game. . . . Clipper forward Loy Vaught said he's 
growing a beard in tribute to former Laker James Worthy, who retired last week. 
Vaught said he idolized Worthy when he was growing up.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; ODDS ARE AGAINST REPEAT BY ARKANSAS

 The "D" word was heard last season, before Rasheed Wallace and the rest of 
North Carolina's freshman class didn't show the proper respect for the seniors, 
causing the Tar Heels to flunk chemistry and get bounced by Boston College in 
the second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dynasty" was heard four years ago, before the Nevada Las Vegas went from 
blowing out Duke by 30 in the 1990 championship game to getting shocked by the 
Blue Devils in the 1991 semifinals. The Runnin' Rebels haven't been heard from 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 It was heard 10 years ago, before a couple of guys named Harold and the rest 
of the Villanova Wildcats shot the lights out against Georgetown and Patrick 
Ewing in the 1985 final. The Hoyas were never the same again. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, in Arkansas, there are no blue-chip freshmen waiting to take jobs 
away from established seniors. There is no scandal lurking around some 
Fayetteville street cor ner. There is a team oozing with confidence, a coach 
hoping to take his place in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen years after UCLA ended its run of 10 championships in 12 years, the 
Razorbacks are being mentioned as successors to a throne that has been mostly 
empty, filled by the same team only once in back-to-back seasons (Duke in 1991 
and '92). "It doesn't scare us," said junior forward Scotty Thurman. "We want 
to be known as one of the best teams ever." 
</P>
<P>
 The Razorbacks are the consensus No. 1 team headed into the 1994-95 season, 
which begins Wednesday night with the Preseason National Invitation Tournament 
and ends April 3 at the Kingdome in Seattle. They are the first championship 
team since UCLA won the title in 1967 to return all five starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by All-Americans Corliss Williamson and Thurman, whose three-point shot in 
the waning seconds helped lift Arkansas past Duke in last year's final, the 
Razorbacks are as big a favorite to repeat as any team in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's luck involved with winning a championship," said Arkansas Coach Nolan 
Richardson. "But the luck comes from chemistry, and we know each other. If we 
can improve 10 percent over last year, we'll be pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 But getting a championship team to improve can be problematic. Ask Dean Smith, 
whose seniors last season weren't as good as they had been as juniors or maybe 
as good as freshmen Wallace and Jerry Stackhouse. There was tension that came 
to a boil at the worst time -- during the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Smith said recently, "Chemistry didn't have anything to do with it; if 
we don't miss a couple of shots against BC, nobody would bring that up," he 
also said getting a team mentally prepared to defend its national title is one 
of the toughest things a coach has to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "You talk as if I had a lot of practice," said Smith, whose only other NCAA 
championship before 1993 came in 1982. "But it's harder because everyone thinks 
they're capable of doing more. Obviously, Arkansas has everyone back. It's 
going to be hard to maintain that chemistry, but it can be done." 
</P>
<P>
 But why hasn't it been done more often? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, parity has played a part. In the years when UCLA dominated, the 
Bruins had the pick of any blue-chip player in the country. But the spotlight 
provided by television and the emergence of new, made-for-TV leagues such as 
the Big East spread the wealth of talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries have been a factor as well. Smith says his Tar Heels teams might have 
won at least two more titles had it not been for a string of injuries that 
caused key players to miss the NCAA tournament. Indiana likely would have won 
back-to-back titles had Scott May not been hurt in the 1975 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to stay healthy, and you have to be a little lucky," said Louisville 
Coach Denny Crum, whose Cardinals won national championships in 1980 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams defending their titles don't often return intact. Crum recalls losing 
only one player off his 1980 team, but that player was star guard Darrell 
Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like football, when you're replacing 1/22nd of your team," said 
Crum. "You're replacing 20 percent of your starting team. And then when you 
take a player as dominating as Darrell was in college, it makes a big 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 After Duke won its first national championship in 1991 on the school's ninth 
trip to the Final Four, the Blue Devils had to replace two regulars: Billy 
McCaffrey, who transferred to Vanderbilt, and Greg Koubek, who graduated. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the heart of the team returned -- Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley and 
Grant Hill -- Coach Mike Krzyzewski spent the entire 1991-92 season defending 
the notion that the Blue Devils weren't defending anything. "It's a different 
team that's trying to win a national championship," he said over and over.

CLINTON SIGNALS WILLINGNESS TO AGREE ON SCHOOL PRAYER; CONGRESS: HE SAYS HE'S 
ALWAYS SUPPORTED VOLUNTARY CONCEPT. PANETTA INDICATES AREAS OF ACCORD, 
CONFLICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton signaled Tuesday that he might be willing to reach agreement 
with the new Republican congressional majority on school prayer.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be glad to discuss it with them," the President said at a press 
conference at an economic conference in Indonesia. "I want to see what the 
details (of a school prayer proposal) are. I certainly wouldn't rule it out. It 
depends on what it says." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta indicated further 
agreement with GOP leaders, saying that the two sides can agree on trade and 
congressional reform. Emerging from the first post-election meeting between an 
Administration official and the new Republican leadership, Panetta rejected 
proposed Republican tax cuts, saying that they would swell the federal deficit 
and weaken the strengthening economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was asked at his press conference if the country "needs" a 
constitutional amendment restoring prayer to public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I think the country needs and what I think the schools need is a sense 
that there are certain basic values of citizenship, including valuing the right 
of people to have and express their faith, which can be advocated without 
crossing the line of separation of church and state and without in any way 
undermining the fabric of our society. . . ," the President said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have always supported voluntary prayer in the schools, I have always 
thought that the question was when does voluntary prayer really become coercive 
to people who have different religious views from those who are in the majority 
in any particular classroom. . . . I personally did not believe that it was 
coercive to have a prayer at an outdoor sporting event or at a graduation event 
because I don't believe that is coercive to people who don't participate in it. 
So I think there may, there is room for that," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I want to reserve judgment, I want to see the specifics, but I 
think this whole values debate will go forward and will intensify in the next 
year. And again, I would say this ought to be something that unites the 
American people, not something that divides us. This ought not to be a partisan 
debate.  
</P>
<P>
 "The American people do not want us to be partisan, but they do want us to 
proceed in a way that is consistent with their values and that communicates 
those values to our children," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After an hourlong "courtesy call" with Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who is 
expected to be Speaker of the House in the next Congress, and Sen. Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.), who is expected to be Senate majority leader, in Dole's Capitol Hill 
offices, Panetta said that if the Republicans are serious about balancing the 
federal budget in five years, their proposed tax cuts and increased defense 
spending would require cutting a trillion dollars from the federal government 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever the outcome of the election, we all have a responsibility of helping 
to move this country forward," Panetta said. "We have to be very straight with 
the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Dole nor Gingrich offered any public comment after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Further marking the ideological yaw, Administration budget chief Alice Rivlin 
told reporters at a breakfast meeting that the proposed Republican tax cuts, if 
enacted, would swell inflation, ignite interest rates and "probably throw the 
economy into recession." 
</P>
<P>
 The likely new chairman of the House Budget Committee, Rep. John Kasich 
(R-Ohio), promptly accused her of "alarmist and inflammatory" rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gingrich did not comment Tuesday, Monday night he promised Republican 
contributors that his ideas could transform American society "within two or 
three years," a speech that even his own aides called "exuberant" and a sign 
that the Speaker-to-be was "feeling his oats." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta called the vote later this month on a new world trade agreement "the 
first test of the relationship" between the Democratic Administration and the 
new Republican majority in Congress, although that majority will not be seated 
until January.  
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich and other GOP leaders have generally indicated that they will support 
the agreement, but the likely new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), signaled his intention to delay consideration 
of the pact. In a letter to Clinton, Helms threatened to make trouble on 
foreign policy matters unless Clinton agrees to put off the trade vote until 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms' letter said: "I can assure that it will have an exceedingly positive 
effect on my making certain that the Administration positions on all foreign 
policy matters during the 104th Congress will be considered fully and fairly." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta said that there are other reforms that the Clinton Administration and 
the Republican leadership agree on, including lobbying reform, campaign finance 
reform, welfare reform, health care reform and the line-item veto. Referring 
obliquely to the Helms threat, he added that foreign affairs was an area where 
it was "extremely important" that Congress and the White House work together. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that he praised Gingrich for his promise to cut House committee 
staffs by one-third and noted that the Clinton Administration had cut the White 
House staff by 25% and the executive branch by some 270,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it came to economic policy, Panetta, despite an effort to sound 
conciliatory, could go only so far. "As the President has made clear . . . 
whoever proposes . . . tax cuts, the important thing is that they are paid for, 
and that they not increase the deficit in the process of doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a very fundamental discipline that we have put in place in the budget 
process here on Capitol Hill and throughout the government," he said, and if 
tax cuts are not matched with spending cuts, "you are simply increasing taxes 
on our kids for the future." 
</P>

BRITISH WOMAN TELLS FLORIDA JURY OF SHOOTING INCIDENT AT REST STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A British woman tearfully told jurors Tuesday how she and her boyfriend were 
napping at a highway rest stop when they were jolted awake by two gunmen who 
killed her boyfriend and wounded her. 
</P>
<P>
 After waking to a metallic knocking on their rental car's window, Margaret 
Jagger said, she and Gary Colley saw one man standing on either side of the 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The black youth, he was pointing his gun straight at me. He was sort of 
mouthing something to me, shouting at me, but I couldn't hear him," she said, 
wiping away tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to him, 'I can't hear you. I don't know what you want. What do you 
want?' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Colley, 34, tried to back up the car and flee, the gunmen opened fire, 
killing him and wounding Jagger. 
</P>
<P>
 Jagger took the stand as testimony began in the trial of John (Billy Joe) 
Crumitie, 17, one of four youths charged in Colley's death at the rest stop on 
Interstate 10. If convicted, Crumitie faces life in prison with no chance of 
parole for at least 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other teen-agers pleaded guilty to lesser charges and the fourth awaits 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sept. 14, 1993, shooting damaged Florida's image and prompted the governor 
to post 24-hour guards at highway rest stops. Colley was the ninth foreign 
visitor killed in Florida within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jagger, 36, of West Yorkshire, England, said she and Colley were driving from 
New Orleans to St. Petersburg and stopped for a nap shortly after 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Jagger said she failed to identify Crumitie in police lineups but did identify 
a 15-year-old whose murder trial has not been scheduled yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Crumitie's lawyer, Dwight Wells, said the state had no physical evidence 
linking his client to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the accused, 18-year-old Deron Spear, has also agreed to testify 
against Crumitie. Spear, the driver of the getaway car, awaits sentencing.

DISMAL REPORT ON ALCOHOLICS, ADDICTS AND AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just 1% of the low-income drug addicts and alcoholics who collect disability 
benefits ever recover or get jobs. Most are dropped from the rolls only when 
they die or go to jail, a federal study says. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, by the inspector general at the Department of Health and Human 
Services, also documents government failure to make sure substance abusers are 
in treatment as a condition of collecting monthly Supplemental Security Income 
checks of $446. 
</P>
<P>
 SSI is a welfare program for the elderly and disabled. Fewer than 10% of SSI 
substance abusers are definitely in treatment, and the treatment status of most 
of the rest is unknown, said Monday's report. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier studies found that addicts were spending their checks on drugs and 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 This month's report finds that death is the most common reason addicts and 
alcoholics are crossed off the rolls and that many substance abusers collect 
benefits for years. Investigators identified 510 who have been receiving 
benefits since the program began in 1974.

AUDIT OF BREAST CANCER STUDY CONFIRMS LUMPECTOMY'S VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An exhaustive audit of a fraud-tainted cancer study has confirmed the original 
results: Breast cancer is as effectively treated with a breast-saving procedure 
as with surgery in which the whole breast is removed. 
</P>
<P>
 A report released Tuesday by a team of experts at the National Cancer 
Institute concluded that removing the tumor and then treating with radiation is 
just as likely to result in long-term survival as is mastectomy -- removal of 
the entire breast. 
</P>
<P>
 The breast-saving procedure, called lumpectomy, has been in use for some time, 
but its validity was thrown into question earlier this year when NCI officials 
announced that a major study that supported lumpectomy was based, in part, on 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials learned that a researcher at St. Luc's Hospital in Montreal had 
falsified data for some of the patients that he had enrolled in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, called the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Cancer 
Project, had been key research in establishing the value of lumpectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 NCI removed the St. Luc's data from the study last spring and did a cursory 
recomputation that found the fraud did not affect the conclusion about 
lumpectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also undertook a detailed audit in which researchers re-examined 
hospital data for 1,554 patients in the studies and were able to find the 
original charts to verify data for 1,390 of the enrollees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We audited 86% of all of the data in the original study and found that the 
conclusion was not changed," said Dr. Jeffrey S. Abrams of the NCI therapy 
evaluation program. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some of the 484 institutions in the original study were left out of the 
audit, Abrams said, the experts got enough data to construct a statistically 
powerful verification of the original findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit found that breast cancer patients who chose lumpectomy and radiation 
had a 10-year survival rate of 71%, versus a survival rate of 66% for those who 
chose mastectomy. Abrams said the results, from a statistical viewpoint, show 
no significant difference between the two therapies. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports were delivered at a meeting of cancer clinicians organized by the 
NCI.

FRENCH MUSLIM YOUTHS PROTEST POLICE ACTION

<TEXT>
<P>
 French Muslim youths set fire to six cars in the northern town of Amiens 
during a second consecutive night of anti-police protests, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A few dozen youths demonstrated in the streets and no injuries were reported, 
officials said. Over the weekend, about 16 police were injured, some by shotgun 
pellets, in a riot by 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths, children of Muslim French army veterans, have accused police of 
using tear gas to break up a party and say the incident highlights 
discrimination against them. Officials say there was no such intervention.

DANA PARSONS: MAYOR AS MONEYMAKER: JUST WHAT IS YOUR HONOR WORTH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think of someone to whom you'd pay $100 or more, just for the privilege of 
spending an hour with them. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 No, no, not that kind of person. 
</P>
<P>
 Be serious. I've asked the question of several people, and not one has said, 
"The mayor of my city." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, New Zealanders must know something that we Americans don't. Resting 
on my desk is an article from the Auckland Star-Times, bearing the headline: 
"Mayors Are New Tourist Attraction . . . If the Price Is Right." 
</P>
<P>
 The article begins: "Tea, scones and a cheesy photograph with the mayor is a 
budding tourist industry, with some Asian tour groups now paying for the 
privilege." 
</P>
<P>
 The article says that the city of Christchurch, for example, has put a 
$100-an-hour price tag on its mayor, Vicki Buck. Not to be outdone, Manukau 
City told the newspaper that its mayor, Sir Barry Curtis, is worth three times 
that amount because of his experience and knighthood. 
</P>
<P>
 The article notes that deputy mayor, councillors and council executives cost 
the same hourly rate. However, "Morning tea (around $5 a head) and lunch ($10) 
are extras," the paper reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The article raised a number of questions in my mind, one of which was: Would 
people really hang around to meet Mickey Mouse at Disneyland if they knew they 
could meet Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly instead? 
</P>
<P>
 I was reading the article over the phone to former Dana Point mayor/councilman 
Mike Eggers and got about halfway through the second sentence about dollars for 
mayors when he burst into boisterous laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It beats the heck out of getting nailed at the produce counter at the 
supermarket. And it would sure make filing the FPPC report interesting," Eggers 
said. "That's amazing, absolutely amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 I know the article secretly confirms what every mayor already thinks: They're 
very interesting people with a lot to offer but why, oh why, are they so 
underappreciated by the public? 
</P>
<P>
 Will it be a coincidence if the next convention of the Orange County chapter 
of the California League of Cities takes place in Auckland? 
</P>
<P>
 Mary-Anne Crawford, the communications manager for North Shore, New Zealand, 
told the newspaper that Asians seem particularly fond of meeting with mayors. 
That's why the city includes the bonus of being photographed with the mayor, 
she said. "They are highly regarded and a photo with the mayor is good for 
brownie points," Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra L. Genis, Costa Mesa's mayor for the last two years, has the spirit. 
But not wanting to take money for nothing, she said she'd give the tourists 
their money's worth. She said she'd probably start them out with some bagels 
from a 17th Street shop or perhaps some coffee from Diedrich's. Bagels and 
coffee in tow, she'd direct them to Canyon Park and visit the horse stables, 
then head back and perhaps stop at El Toro Bravo for tacos or, if it's a 
Friday, at Taco Mesa because, she said, "That's tamale day." Maybe a little 
sightseeing and a conversation with some Eastsiders who have lived in Costa 
Mesa for 60 years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest Mayor Marcia Rudolph also was intrigued by the marquee value of 
mayors. After I mentioned that the knighted Mr. Curtis was deemed worth three 
times more than the woman mayor of Christchurch, Rudolph asked, "Does that make 
(Irvine mayor) Mike Ward more valuable than me?" She also questioned if 
outgoing Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young may be making a mistake by leaving 
office this year. 
</P>
<P>
 She pointed out that Lake Forest has hosted a visiting head of a British town, 
and, as best she recalls, City Hall served tea and cookies. "We always have 
cookies," she said. "I suppose we could put out a donations jar." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from amusement at mayors being paid to entertain, Eggers seemed 
especially amused by the desire for the visiting delegations to be photographed 
with them. "Why not?" he said, laughing. "It would tie in. Most people think 
mayors and politicians are bought off anyway. Now they've got the photo to 
prove it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph seemed to put the most thought into following the New Zealanders' 
strategy. Off the top of her head, she began envisioning a hierarchy of mayors 
on which to base a sliding pay scale. She suggested that white male mayors 
might charge the least, followed by minority-group males and then by women 
mayors. Her reasoning, which made perfect sense to me, was that the most common 
commodity should charge the least, while the least available commodity should 
command the most. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, she surmised, the scale could take into account a city's size or 
physical beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then it raises a whole new question," she said, "What is a supervisor worth? 
Are they worth anything?" 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't tell whether she was asking a question or supplying her own punch 
line, but perhaps we should leave things there for now. 
</P>

 The non-Raiders network: In case you weren't keeping score, the estimated 26 
fights among fans at the Rams game in Anaheim Stadium on Sunday resulted in 55 
ejections, three hospitalizations and 20 arrests -- about four times the 
average number there, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 And what was the extra ingredient Sunday? The Raiders -- and, inevitably, 
Raiders' fans. Free-for-alls are, of course, routine at Raiders' home games, 
where as many as 150 spectators have been ejected on a single afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Which helps explain the policy at C.T.'s Bar & Grill in El Sereno, where a 
virtual TV blackout on all Raiders games has been declared. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got every gang in the world in this area," explained Bud Haig, the 
manager of C.T.'s. "If we showed a Raiders game, you'd have more guns in here 
than at the invasion of Normandy. All our regular customers say they don't want 
to get in between that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Haig admitted he showed a bit of the second half of the Raiders game Sunday, 
but only because no one expected him to, and it was too late for word to get 
out to Raiders fans, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, if it's any comfort to Raiders owner Al Davis, his team's 
broadcasts are not alone among the verboten at C.T.'s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't show boxing either," Haig said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Get me to the brawl on time: Aside from the ejections, hospitalizations and 
arrests, the Rams-Raiders game also was the scene of three marriage proposals, 
delivered by planes pulling banners over the stadium. It wasn't known whether 
any of the fights were related to the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On top of things: During a scroll presentation, Sterling (Smooth) Forbes of 
the Harlem Globetrotters began spinning a ball on his finger, then took the 
hand of Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and set it on her 
finger, where it remained in orbit for several seconds, to her amazement. Of 
course, balancing acts come natural to politicians. 
</P>

 Now that's a service department!"My wife Cynthia, who's never owned a 
Chevrolet, received a Chevrolet brochure for service from a dealership in 
Indianapolis, Ind., where she's never lived," reports Pat McKean of Long Beach, 
which is in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat and Cynthia are tempted to get a Midwest oil change, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The brochure said they offer courtesy shuttle service," McKean explained. 
miscelLAny Bob Holmes of Long Beach noticed that a Sports Illustrated ad 
promises that its video, "1994: The Year in Sports," shows "the year's most 
exciting moments, including action-packed highlights of the Super Bowl, World 
Series and NBA finals." At last, we can find out if the Dodgers won it all in 
1994!

PERSPECTIVES ON JUDGE ITO; IT'S GOOD TO PUT A HUMAN FACE ON A GOD-LIKE ROLE; 
GIVEN THE CURRENT LEVEL OF SKEPTICISM ABOUT PUBLIC SERVANTS, ITO'S TV 
APPEARANCES SHOULD BE A CREDIBILITY BOOSTER. 
</P>

<P>
 The latest firestorm in the O.J. Simpson trial concerns whether Judge Lance A. 
Ito acted improperly in granting an interview to a local television station. 
This controversy is laden with ironies. After repeatedly criticizing the 
media's obsession with the case, Judge Ito's own cooperation with the media is, 
for now, the big story. At the same time, some commentators who previously 
criticized Ito for being media-phobic, are now lambasting him for doing the 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ironies are interesting, they mask the basic point: Ito's 
interview will not compromise a fair trial and is enormously important to 
inform the public about the human being who will be handling the most widely 
publicized case in American history. 
</P>
<P>
 The interview is being shown in five parts over the course of this week. Ito 
has carefully avoided discussing any aspect of the case. Certainly, it would be 
inappropriate for him to comment on the evidence or arguments in the matter. 
But he has not, and from all accounts, will not do that. His comments the first 
night focused on his family background and especially on the experience of his 
Japanese American parents who were uprooted from their home in California and 
interned in Wyoming during World War II. He has also discussed his feelings 
about his new-found celebrity status and his views about what makes a good 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the prosecution nor the defense has been harmed in any imaginable way 
by these comments. Not even the harshest critics of the interview have 
suggested that Ito's comments will interfere with a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The interview, however, is very beneficial in that it helps people to see Ito, 
and judges generally, as human beings. With rare exceptions, people know little 
about occupants of state and federal courts. The courtroom setting, with a 
black-robed judge sitting on a raised bench, makes judges seem more God-like 
than human. Ito's appearance on the TV interviews allows people to see the 
jurist as a person with a family, a cultural background and human interests. 
The pictures of his childhood make it much easier for people to view him not as 
an oracle of the law, but as a person. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, the interviews have shown him to be articulate and thoughtful. His 
moving description of his parents' experience in internment helps explain why 
he is a judge and his commitment to fairness. This only can help enhance the 
credibility of his rulings and, more generally, improve the image of the 
judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
 The interviews could not have come at a better time. After one of the ugliest 
election campaigns in memory, which gave little reason to feel confidence in, 
let alone warmth toward, government officials, the interviews engender respect 
for an important part of the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are the interviews unprecedented. The Los Angeles Daily Journal, a 
newspaper covering the legal system, regularly profiles judges and they 
frequently are quoted. During the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution 
in 1987, Justice Harry Blackmun was interviewed by the television show 
"Superior Court" and the interviews, which also were shown over a week, 
revealed a self-effacing, highly intelligent man. Judge Ito was interviewed 
earlier in the Simpson trial by several newspaper reporters and no one 
objected. 
</P>
<P>
 Some call Ito a hypocrite for objecting to the extensive press coverage and 
then fueling the media circus by doing these interviews. But I think that Ito's 
error was in his earlier remarks attacking the media, not in his current 
behavior. At times, Ito has seemed to engage in a battle with the press, 
referring to the media derisively as "jackals," sending letters to media 
executives trying to control their stories, and even at one point barring the 
press from the courtroom during jury selection. I hope that these interviews 
represent a thawing in that frosty relationship.  
</P>
<P>
 The reality is that the Simpson trial is, has been, and will continue to be a 
major news story. More people will learn about the law and the legal system 
from this case than from any other single event in American history. Rather 
than criticize or ignore this reality, this week's TV interviews use the press 
spotlight to an important benefit: helping people to see judges as human 
beings.

MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR WALLACE R. DAVIS SET FOR THURSDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Memorial services will be held Thursday for Wallace R. Davis, a Latino rights 
activist and attorney whose successful lawsuit against the Santa Ana Unified 
School District in 1968 changed a practice of placing disproportionate numbers 
of Latino students in a program for the mentally retarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 59, who died Saturday of a heart attack, argued the precedent-setting 
case before the California Supreme Court that led to culturally neutral 
entrance examinations for the district's students, reducing the number of 
Latinos placed in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who grew up in Santa Ana, was raised by his grandparents, Candida and 
Leandro Serrano. He worked in Orange County fields, picking fruits and 
vegetables during summer vacations throughout grade school. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked as a janitor for the Garden Grove School District while attending 
Cal State Long Beach, where he received his bachelor's degree in political 
science. He received a juris doctorate degree from UCLA in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' friends and family remember him as a tireless community activist who 
fought for Latino rights. 
</P>
<P>
 When Davis learned there was only one Latino medical student at UC Irvine in 
1970, he formed an organization, "Los Padrinos and Las Madrinas" to increase 
enrollment of minorities there, said insurance broker and friend Fred Flores, 
who helped organize the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, an Army veteran and avid basketball player, was chairman of the local 
Mexican American Political Assn. in 1969; was chairman of the board of the 
Legal Aid Society of Orange County in 1972 and president of the Mexican 
American Bar Assn. of Orange County, an organization that he helped found, in 
1979. He lectured on politics and civil rights at UC Irvine and Cal State Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a partner in the law firm of Davis, Samuelson, Blakely & Goldberg in 
Costa Mesa until his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wally certainly was a giant . . . in our community," said Amin David, 
chairman of Los Amigos de Orange County, a Latino rights advocacy group. "He 
was a very decent, honorable family person, one who would shine in the greatest 
darkness, and we're going to miss him tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim realtor Ross Romero, president of UCI's Latino Alumni Assn., 
remembered Davis as a role model. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wally always gave a lot of time to the advancement of Latinos at UCI and he 
was a person of utmost integrity -- a classic role model who showed young 
Latino professionals how to give back to the community," Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is survived by his wife of 33 years, Irmgard 59; children Anja Friday, 
32, of Orange; Mark, 31, of Tustin; Luke, 29, of Pasadena; Marisa Timothy, 28, 
of Westminster; Sabrina, 25, of Santa Ana; Erik, 24, of Santa Ana; and Nadia, 
23, of Los Angeles, and six grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be sent to the newly formed 
Wally Davis Scholarship Fund, 1145 S. Birch St., Santa Ana, CA 92707. The money 
will pay for scholarships for Latino students attending Rancho Santiago College 
or UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services will be held at Holy Family Cathedral in Orange at 10 a.m. 
The burial will follow at Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Orange.

 Outfielder David Justice of the Atlanta Braves and his wife, actress Halle

include comedian Jerry Seinfeld and actress Sharon Stone. 
</P>

 "Believe it or not, you feel like more of a normal person out there," Justice 
told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "I can go anywhere I want, do anything I 
want. (The people) are so used to seeing so many so-called celebrities that 
they are just used to it. It is nothing to them."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't know how the James Toney-Roy Jones Jr. match is going to end Friday 
night at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I keep changing my mind about the winner. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Will it be Toney, a warrior who has proven himself in tough fights, or Jones, 
a relatively untested power puncher with lightning hands? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But I am certain how the excitement will start. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ring announcer Michael Buffer is going to bellow, "Let's get ready to rumble!" 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Let's get ready to rumble!" is to boxing what "Gentlemen, start your 
engines!" is to automobile racing. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Buffer was watching a card on TV in 1982 when he was appalled by how little 
enthusiasm the guy in the tuxedo put into the announcement of the 
split-decision winner after a sensational fight. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "My oldest son, Michael Patrick, said I should try out," said Buffer, who was 
a model and an actor in commercials. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Buffer's persistence in cutting tapes and sending letters to promoters paid 
off. He got his start in Atlantic City, N.J., and he has been one of the most 
recognizable faces in boxing since. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He even got a call from Cary Grant one day. Grant had seen Buffer on the tube, 
said he loved his bow tie, and asked where he could buy one. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Let's get ready to rumble!" is not only Buffer's signature, it's his 
registered trademark. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted a hook to get people in the mood after putting them to sleep with 
the introductions of the referee, judges, other officials and candlestick 
makers," he said. "Rumble worked the best, but I've also used, 'Fasten your 
seat belts!' and 'Man your battle stations!' ". . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Buffer, who grew up in Philadelphia and lives in L.A., turned 50 on Nov. 2. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Three nights later, he got a birthday gift when he made the surprise 
announcement of his career. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Ladies and gentlemen, the impossible dream has happened. Heavyweight history 
has happened. Referee Joe Cortez reaches the count of 10 at 2:03 of round 
number 10. The winner -- and, once again, heavyweight champion -- big George 
Foreman!" . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches' cradle: Jeff Fisher of the Houston Oilers has become the fifth NFL 
head coach with a USC background. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Fisher was a cornerback for the Trojans. Mike Holmgren of Green Bay was a 
quarterback. Wayne Fontes of Detroit, Dave Wannstedt of Chicago and Norv Turner 
of Washington were assistant coaches. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On the week of the USC-UCLA game, Fisher is being remembered in Westwood for 
deflecting a pass into the hands of Freeman McNeil for the touchdown that gave 
the Bruins a 20-17 victory over the Trojans in 1980. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's great that Jeff is getting the opportunity," said John Robinson, who 
coached him at USC. "To get ahead in the NFL as a player, he had to use his 
mental edge. Then he was fortunate to become a protege of Buddy Ryan. He has 
some Mike Ditka in him. He's fiery." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Everett has a chance for a hat trick against Los Angeles teams this year. 
The Saints, who already have beaten the Rams in New Orleans, play the Raiders 
on Sunday at the Coliseum and the Rams again Dec. 4 at Anaheim Stadium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Rod Woodson belongs on that 75th anniversary NFL team, after all. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No NCAA Division I-A team with a schedule ranked among the 10 toughest in the 
nation ever has finished unbeaten, and that won't change this year. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 ESPN2 will showcase Steve (Air) McNair for the third time Saturday when Alcorn 
State plays Jackson State at 1 p.m. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas, the defending NCAA basketball champion, will try to win the 
cross-country title for the fifth consecutive year Monday at Prairie Grove, 
Ark. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas is going to run Breeders' Cup Classic runner-up Tabasco Cat in the 
$400,000 Hollywood Derby Sunday because he believes the future of the Preakness 
and Belmont Stakes winner is on the turf. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Is it too early to get excited about a possible Kentucky Derby showdown 
between Lukas' Timber Country and Richard Mandella's Afternoon Deelites? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Half the teams ranked in the top six in the Associated Press preseason college 
basketball poll -- No. 3 Massachusetts, No. 4 Kentucky and No. 6 UCLA -- will 
participate in the first John R. Wooden Classic Dec. 3 at The Pond of Anaheim. 
Kansas, which will play Massachusetts, is ranked 11th. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 John Robinson on Oregon: "It wasn't as though they choked against Stanford -- 
not that many teams have this year."

THE NHL/HELENE ELLIOTT; CLUBS CONSIDER OWN INTEREST, NOT THAT OF TICKET HOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NHL ticket refund plans that pay interest when you let the club hold your 
money aren't as good a deal as they appear. The interest will be taxable and 
must be reported as income, so clubs will send 1099 forms to the IRS and to 
you, if you pick that option. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the refund game. There's no winner, only a search for the least of 
all evils. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a season-ticket holder and request a full refund for canceled games, 
in many cases you will lose your seating priority. If you tell the club to keep 
the money and pay you interest, you keep your priority but you'll owe taxes. 
And if you want refunds as games are canceled, you had better be patient, 
because the NHL's pace is deliberately slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Some clubs are making an art form of delaying payments. For example, the 
Detroit Red Wings decided to issue refunds at the end of each month. So far, 
they have returned money for only the two home games canceled in October. Four 
more home games were canceled Nov. 2 but the Wings will keep that money until 
Nov. 30, presumably in some sort of high-interest account. If they had been 
that shrewd when they went shopping for a goaltender last season, they might 
have won the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Options that give credit toward future purchases, such as the "Kings' Dollars" 
plan, are worth considering. King season-seat or mini-plan holders can, instead 
of getting 6% interest, get scrip equal to 10% of the value of their package 
and use it at future King games, Forum events and at Forum concession stands. 
Kings' Dollars are considered discounts and won't be taxable. The Mighty Ducks 
and several other clubs also offer a discount option. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, even if you choose a discount, the club still has your money. 
</P>
<P>
 Moral of the story: One way or another, they're gonna get you. BIG LOSERS IN 
SMALL CITIES 
</P>
<P>
 Canceling neutral-site games won't mean so much in Denver, San Antonio and 
Minneapolis, where fans have the NBA or NFL for diversion. But major league 
events don't come to Halifax or Saskatoon every day. This season, they won't 
come at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing two games in Halifax and three in Saskatoon has disillusioned fans in 
those Canadian cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are so turned off by the whole labor thing, basically they're not as 
upset as they would have been if the season started and then the games were 
canceled," said Dave Whynacht, sports editor of the Halifax Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both games would have been sellouts (at the 9,770-seat Metro Centre). And we 
would have had Eric Lindros here (with the Philadelphia Flyers), but people 
figured (the lockout) was coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (sportswriters) are the most disappointed. That would have been a big 
night out for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Halifax lost its minor league hockey team two years ago. The city got a Quebec 
Major Junior League team -- the Mooseheads -- this season and that's some 
consolation. Fans last week got to see the Ottawa Senators' Alexandre Daigle, 
who rejoined his junior team during the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of paying $40 for an NHL game, you can pay $10 for a Quebec major 
junior game," Whynacht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets hadn't gone on sale in Halifax, but 4,000 three-game packages had been 
sold in Saskatoon. There's a junior hockey team in town but the nearest 
professional sports team is 157 miles away in Regina, the Canadian Football 
League's Saskatchewan Roughriders. 
</P>
<P>
 Saskatoon is sadly familiar with labor problems, having recently been hit by a 
strike by city workers. Losing its NHL games was a blow it didn't need, but 
folks there long ago learned to take what comes and move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it came as a big shock here," said Theresa Kirkpatrick, sports 
editor of the Saskatoon Star Phoenix. "We're surviving." DON'T CALL US, WE'LL 
CALL YOU 
</P>
<P>
 President Jack Quinn and General Manager Mike Keenan of the St. Louis Blues 
were laughed at when they tried to form a committee of "moderate" owners to 
urge Commissioner Gary Bettman to start the season as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Most executives blame the Blues for the rapid escalation of salaries -- St. 
Louis' payroll this season is a league-high $23 million -- and want nothing to 
do with Quinn. Nor were folks lining up behind Keenan, who lost his credibility 
and his friends when he left the New York Rangers after winning the Stanley 
Cup. A WHALE OF AN IDEA 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford Whaler General Manager Jim Rutherford said that using replacement 
players next season if this season is canceled is an option "that may very well 
happen in the long run." He didn't specify where players would come from. 
</P>
<P>
 He was quoted in the Hartford Courant as saying, "As I see this unfolding, it 
appears there will be a time where Mr. Bettman and Mr. (Bob) Goodenow (of the 
players' union) try to make their deal. If in fact the season is canceled, I 
would think our next step would be in the off-season to do the same thing as 
the NFL (once tried), just unilaterally implementing our own system. The 
players who want to play will, and the ones that don't will sue the owners. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's something that would happen immediately, but I do believe 
that's the way it will play out if there's not some kind of agreement this year 
and some games played this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Burke, the NHL's director of hockey operations, didn't deny the idea had 
been brought up. However, he said, "It's not something we're willing to discuss 
at this point in time. We intend to reach an agreement with our union." SLAP 
SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Extradition proceedings against Alan Eagleson, the NHLPA's former executive 
director, are expected to be initiated soon by the U.S. Justice Department. 
Eagleson was indicted by a grand jury last spring on 32 counts of racketeering, 
embezzlement and fraud and two more counts were added last summer. He has 
refused to surrender to U.S. authorities. A lawyer, he also faces disbarment in 
Canada for allegedly mishandling funds belonging to former clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal Canadien General Manager Serge Savard on the lockout: "For the first 
time, I am afraid for the season, unless something gets done in the next 10 
days." . . . The NHL has laid off 20 employees and cut the pay of remaining 
staffers, including Bettman. There will be hockey at the Forum this season: 
Notre Dame, Maine, Princeton and Boston University will compete in the annual 
Freeze-Out Nov. 25 and 27.

NBA ROUNDUP; RAVELING PUPIL HAS BIG NIGHT FOR HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If George Raveling needs a lift after retiring as USC's basketball coach, he 
might want to check the box score of the Miami Heat's 115-102 victory over the 
Dallas Mavericks Tuesday night at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Trojan Harold Miner had one of his best games as a pro, scoring 23 
points. He had scored exactly that many, total, in the Heats' first four games, 
all losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Miner, a third-year pro who is settling into a starting role, said he's a 
different player now because he's no longer reluctant to take an open shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last season, I was kind of hesitant to take it, because I was looking over my 
shoulder wondering if I would get yanked if I missed it," Miner said. "You 
can't play ball like that. When you play at this level, you have to play with a 
high confidence level. If you hesitate, you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami's Kevin Willis scored 24 points, but suffered muscle spasms in his left 
leg and will miss tonight's game at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 112, San Antonio 99 -- Another former Trojan, Robert Pack, scored a 
career-high 30 points at Denver to lead the Nuggets to their fourth victory in 
a row. Pack scored 17 points in the first quarter, helping the Nuggets open up 
an 18-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 David Robinson had 33 points and 20 rebounds for the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 82, Indiana 81 -- No. 1 draft pick Glenn Robinson had his best night 
as a pro, scoring 18 points for the Bucks, who survived a second-half collapse 
to win at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 105, Sacramento 99 -- Hakeem Olajuwon scored 28 points, helping the 
Rockets hold off the Kings at Houston and extend their season-opening winning 
streak to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, who lost for the 23rd time in their last 24 games in The Summit, 
led, 76-75, going into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 89, Charlotte 86 -- Chris Mills hit a desperate three-pointer at the 
buzzer in regulation to tie the game and the Cavaliers went on to win in 
overtime at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonzo Mourning was guarding Mills as he inbounded the ball from halfcourt 
with three seconds left in regulation, then followed the ball when he passed it 
to John Williams. Mills got the ball right back and made the big shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 114, Golden State 112 -- Isaiah Rider scored a career-high 35 points 
to lead the visiting Timberwolves, who broke a 16-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Manute Bol hit three consecutive three-pointers to help the Warriors cut a 
17-point deficit to one with 19 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 96, Portland 93 -- Danny Manning scored 10 points in the fourth 
quarter and Elliott Perry four in the final 44 seconds as the injury-depleted 
Suns came from 15 points down in the second half to ruin the Trail Blazers' 
home opener. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 112, Seattle 106 -- Derrick Coleman broke out of a slump by making 
seven of his first eight shots and scoring 16 of his 25 points in the first 
quarter to lead the Nets at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 122, Washington 102 -- Shaquille O'Neal dominated at both ends of the 
court, getting 29 points and 13 rebounds for the Magic at Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 110, Boston 94 -- Stacey Augmon scored 27 points and former Clipper 
Ken Norman had 19 for the Hawks at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Hawk Dominique Wilkins, guarded by Augmon, had only 16 points on 
eight-of-20 shooting for the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 99, Philadelphia 98 -- Joe Dumars scored seven of his 20 points in the 
final five minutes at Auburn Hill, Mich., and the Pistons won despite missing 
three of eight free throws in the final three minutes. Rookie Grant Hill led 
the Pistons with 22 points. NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Larry Krystkowiak is out of the Chicago Bulls lineup for two or three 
weeks after arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. The Bulls already are 
without center Luc Longley, who will miss at least two months with a stress 
fracture in his left ankle. . . . No. 1 pick Yinka Dare was placed on the 
injured list because of tendinitis in his right knee by the Nets, who activated 
Eric (Sleepy) Floyd.

 Holding. False start. Unsportsmanlike conduct. Unnecessary roughness. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Raiders, there have been a lot of penalties this season. They were 
penalized 13 times for 108 yards Sunday against the Rams and have been 
penalized a league-leading 98 times this year for 761 yards.This is a year 
after they were penalized 148 times, one short of the league record, for 1,181 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a coach to do? 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't like any penalties," Art Shell said. "Some of them you can 
understand, but there are some you can't ever understand, you can't live with. 
</P>
<P>
 "(We tell them,) 'Stay onsides. Don't move in motion. Don't hold.' These are 
the things that we preach on. . . . We try to get them to understand how we are 
hurting ourselves with those things."

 Receiver Tim Brown is known mostly for his receptions, but he is also a punt 
returner and is quietly having an excellent year in that category. 
</P>

 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler leads the AFC in third-down passing efficiency with

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; COOK LANDS SPOT IN BLUE-GRAY GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With no bowl game this season, UCLA Coach Terry Donahue spent time calling 
around the country to various postseason all-star games and landed quarterback 
Wayne Cook a spot in the Blue-Gray game on Christmas Day in Montgomery, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook will be joined by Bruin linebacker Shane Jasper. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue searched for a word to describe Cook's season, finally coming up with 
"unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you compare it to last year, he's had a disappointing season," 
Donahue said. "If you look at what he's done when he has had all his people in 
there, he has had a better year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of quarterbacks here, but not many of them have thrown for 
380 yards in a game after throwing for 296 yards; who has thrown for four 
touchdowns in a game. He's been unlucky, and it's unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook passed for a career-best 296 yards against Stanford, then surpassed that 
with 380 against Arizona State. He has passed for four touchdowns in a game 
three times, something no other Bruin quarterback has done. 
</P>
<P>
 And Donahue had a message for critics: "The last two games have shown what 
Wayne could do and explains why I was reluctant to make a change when we were 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some postscripts on the Bruins' 59-23 victory over Arizona State: Kevin Jordan 
and J.J. Stokes became the first UCLA receivers with more than 150 yards each 
in one game. Stokes had seven catches for 175 yards, Jordan six for 164. . . . 
Donnie Edwards had one sack, giving him 12 1/2 for the season, half a sack from 
the school record set by Jamir Miller last season. JIM HODGES

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NATION; LSU FIRES HALLMAN WITH 14-28 
RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Curley Hallman, who lost more games in a shorter period than any of his 
predecessors, was fired as coach at Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
 Hallman, 14-28 since coming to LSU from Southern Mississippi, will coach the 
last two games of the season before the dismissal takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Hallman's fourth year at LSU, all losing seasons. It is also an 
unprecedented sixth consecutive losing season for the Tigers (2-7), who close 
the season on the road against Tulane and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Joe Dean said he told Hallman of his dismissal Monday after 
conferring with LSU Chancellor Bud Davis. Hallman made it clear he was indeed 
fired: "I did not resign, folks." 
</P>
<P>
 He will be paid for the remaining year on his contract.

<TEXT>
<P>
 USC could wind up in the Sugar Bowl with victories over UCLA and Notre Dame, 
The New Orleans Times-Picayune reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans have won five in a row and would finish 9-2 with victories in 
their final two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, the Times-Picayune quoted Sugar Bowl President Chuck Zatarain as 
saying: "A Pac-10 co-champion might be very attractive for us. My intent is to 
attend both of USC's last two games." 
</P>
<P>
 That scenario assumes Oregon beats Oregon State on Saturday, clinching a Rose 
Bowl bid. If Oregon loses and USC wins, the Trojans go to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's Sugar Bowl opponent would be the winner of the Southeastern Conference 
championship game Dec. 3 between Florida and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USC partisans can take heart in this statistic: UCLA ranks last in the Pacific 
10 Conference in rushing defense, giving up an average of 218 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 And USC's No. 1 tailback, Shawn Walters, is expected to play Saturday after 
sitting out the Arizona game because of a cracked thumb. His backup, Leonard 
Green, gained 92 yards in the 45-28 victory, the most by any runner against 
Arizona this season.  
</P>
<P>
 Add stats: Quarterback Rob Johnson has completed 68.2% of his passes, tops in 
the Pac-10. EARL GUSTKEY

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; NEWMAN BLAMES MENTAL MISTAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams' defense ranks 16th overall in the NFL, but safety Anthony Newman is 
concerned that the defense ranks 27th in the NFL in third-down efficiency. It 
has given up 62 first downs in 133 attempts by opponents (46.6%).Only 
Philadelphia (74 of 158 for 46.8%) has a lower rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman blamed mental mistakes for letting teams off the hook on third down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not taking care of business," Newman said. "We're dropping coverage, 
we're not putting pressure on the quarterback. It's the whole defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders converted eight of 16 third downs in their 20-17 victory Sunday, 
including a 12-yard pass to Tim Brown on third-and-five that set up Jeff 
Jaeger's 44-yard field goal in the fourth quarter, the eventual game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fight so hard to get teams in third-and-long and we think we have them," 
Newman said. "We get lazy and we're not in it mentally. We'll get that 
corrected." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Shane Conlan's pile-driving hit on Raider running back Harvey 
Williams that saved a touchdown Sunday? Last season, Conlan might not even have 
been in on a fourth-and-goal from the Rams' one. 
</P>
<P>
 Conlan, considered one of the league's best defenders against the rush, was 
routinely pulled out in goal-line situations by the Rams' coaching staff, who 
said the middle linebacker was just too beat up to continue on a physical down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of puzzling," Conlan said. "That's something I do pretty well. It 
was weird, but I'm sure they (coaches) had their reasons. It was never really 
explained to me." MIKE REILLEY

 Arizona Cardinal quarterback Steve Beuerlein had surgery Tuesday to repair 
torn cartilage in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals said Beuerlein is expected to return in two to three weeks.He 
was injured Sunday during the Cardinals' first offensive series against the New 
York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued to play and directed both second-half scoring drives in a 10-9 
victory which left the Cardinals at 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Buddy Ryan said Jay Schroeder would start Sunday against the 
Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 San Francisco defensive end Richard Dent, sidelined since tearing knee 
ligaments in the season's second week, is not ready to return this week. He had 
hoped to play against the Rams. Tight end Brent Jones has a sprained left knee 
and could also miss the game. . . . The Eagles signed free agent kicker Jeff 
Wilkins to a one-year contract. He is expected to be used only on kickoffs and 
Eddie Murray will continue to kick field goals and extra points. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Chief wide receiver Michael Young, a former Ram, retired because of a back 
injury. Young, 32, from UCLA, played four years with Denver and one with 
Philadelphia. . . . The Dolphins waived running back Mark Higgs. . . . Steeler 
tight end Eric Green (pulled hamstring) and rookie running back Bam Morris 
(leg-muscle contusion) are doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dolphins. . . 
. Chief defensive end Neil Smith, running back Marcus Allen and cornerback Mark 
Collins might miss Sunday's game against the Browns because of injuries.

CHATSWORTH, SYLMAR REACH CITY FINALS; GIRLS' 3-A VOLLEYBALL: SPARTANS GET PAST 
CANOGA PARK IN SEMIFINALS, 15-8, 14-16, 15-6, 15-6.

<P>
 Over the past five seasons, Sylmar High Coach Bob Thomson has quietly built a 
budding City powerhouse in girls' volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 His Spartans are on the verge of a City 3-A volleyball title after defeating 
Canoga Park, 15-8, 14-16, 15-6, 15-6, Tuesday night in the semifinals and 
advancing to Saturday night's championship match at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayra Ariza paced Sylmar's attack with 23 kills and 26 digs for Sylmar (15-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Ariza picked apart Canoga Park with several kills down the left sideline and 
added some well-placed dinks as Sylmar defeated Canoga Park (11-5) for the 
second time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed that the angle they were taking allowed me to have the left 
corner," Ariza said. "So I just made a few adjustments and it worked out for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar's opponent will be Franklin, which defeated Fairfax, 15-13, 15-6, 
15-13. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like our chances in the final a lot," Thomson said. "Five of the girls on 
this team have played together for three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Canoga Park was playing catch-up all night, falling behind early in each game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar rolled to a 9-1 lead in first game but the Hunters were able to trim 
the lead to 9-8 behind the serving of Glenda Pasag. Pasag served seven straight 
points, forcing Sylmar to call a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans regrouped and ran off the next six points to claim the game. 
Ariza had three pivotal kills during Sylmar's run. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, Canoga Park jumped out to a 13-7 lead, but struggled 
before closing out with a16-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the third and fourth games rolled around, Sylmar had clearly 
established control of the match.

CHATSWORTH, SYLMAR REACH CITY FINALS; GIRLS' 4-A VOLLEYBALL: CHANCELLORS ROLL 
PAST SAN PEDRO AND WILL MEET PALISADES IN THE FINAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 San Pedro High entered Tuesday night's City Section 4-A Division girls' 
volleyball semifinal as a mystery to Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a quick glance by Coach Bud Dow during an early-season tournament, 
none of the Chancellors knew anything about the sixth-seeded Pirates or had 
seen them in action. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to Jennifer Joseph and Jennifer Hodges, Chatsworth didn't need to 
do any scouting as the Chancellors defeated San Pedro, 15-4, 15-12, 15-6, to 
advance to the City Section final for the first time since 1989. Chatsworth 
will face Palisades, a five-game winner over Roosevelt, in the final Saturday 
night at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really believe in scouting," Dow said. "Half of what you learn is 
wrong or it can be misinterpreted. I only had a couple of clues but I figured 
they weren't as strong and balanced as we were." 
</P>
<P>
 Dow's assumptions were correct as Chatsworth (11-4) jumped to a big lead in 
each game and maintained its intensity in the first and final games.  
</P>
<P>
 Only in the second game, after the Chancellors had a 12-3 lead, did they 
suffer a letdown. San Pedro scored nine unanswered points to tie the score 
before a kill by Nicole Snell and a block and another kill by Hodges ended the 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We slacked off a little bit," Hodges said. "We were playing well up until 
then. We just had to get it back." 
</P>
<P>
 San Pedro (13-3) couldn't combat the jumping ability of Joseph (10 kills) and 
Hodges (six kills). The Pirates also couldn't get the ball past Hodges, who had 
10 blocks. "That's why they call her position middle blocker," Dow said. "The 
last three games in the playoffs she's really gotten her timing down." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges had 13 blocks in a three-game victory over Van Nuys in the 
quarterfinals last week. Christina Kumor (nine kills) was the only consistent 
threat for the Pirates.

HARVARD FOULS OUT OF PLAYOFFS; WATER POLO: SHORTHANDED AT THE FINISH, 
WOLVERINES CAN'T HOLD OFF FOOTHILL IN 10-9 DEFEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Harvard-Westlake High water polo Coach Rich Corso put it, the Wolverines 
could only keep "our fingers in the dam" for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 And it became even more difficult after they lost some fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-ranked Harvard, playing shorthanded for much of the game because of 
fouls, lost 10-9, to fourth-ranked Foothill in a Southern Section Division I 
quarterfinal match Tuesday at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights' Robby Arroyo and Adam Metzger scored back-to-back six-on-five 
goals midway through the fourth quarter, breaking an 8-8 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo's tie-breaking goal, with 4 minutes 6 seconds to play, came just after 
Harvard's Albert Won was ejected with his third foul. The Wolverines earlier 
lost J.J. Arden with three fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 Without them, Harvard (21-6) was unable to play the high level of defense it 
had for most of the game. The Wolverines allowed only five goals in 15 
shorthanded situations. Harvard goalie Vahe Aharonian even stopped one of three 
four-meter penalty shots, which are typically automatic goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was, four of the Knights' five man-advantage goals came in the 
second half, after Harvard took a 7-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't patient early," Foothill Coach Jim Brumm said. "We really didn't 
get more patient, but we shot a little better." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Knights' shots were finding everything but the back of the net in 
the first three quarters. When they weren't hitting the post or shooting wide, 
they hit Aharonian, who made 20 saves in the last three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Corso started Brian Peterson in goal and planned to alternate the goalies, but 
stuck with Aharonian from the second quarter on because, "He was on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 So was Harvard senior driver Jimmy Duff, who had four goals. Duff scored three 
goals in the first quarter and had the last goal of the game with 1:15 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo and Jeff Pfluenger scored three goals each for Foothill (22-5), which 
will play Corona del Mar in Saturday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines broke a 5-5 tie with two goals in the third quarter. Aharonian 
stopped Pfluenger on a four-meter shot, cresting Harvard's emotional wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the Wolverines, their intensity was not enough to stop the 
Century League champions on too many more six-on-five advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 With four man-advantage goals, and one off a free pass, the Knights turned a 
7-5 deficit into a 10-8 lead in six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley 19, La Canada 12 -- The Falcons pulled away by outscoring the 
Spartans, 7-2, in the second quarter of the Division III quarterfinal at the 
Rose Bowl Aquatics Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley (24-4) will face La Serna in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Bennett scored nine goals for the Falcons and Chad Celi added four, both 
getting two in the second quarter.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: THIS FISH STORY HAS TWIST -- IT'S FOR REAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Sansome has seen a lot in his 10 years as a long-range skipper out of San 
Diego but his latest trip down the Baja California coast was one for the books. 
</P>
<P>
 Sansome, 49, said he had never seen anything like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five fishermen aboard the American Angler accounted for 311 yellowfin 
tuna, 150 dorado, 140 wahoo, 71 yellowtail, nine marlin, one sailfish and a 
short-bill spearfish. 
</P>
<P>
 That so many tuna and dorado were caught was no surprise, but to catch so many 
wahoo on a 10-day trip is unusual, and to have so many marlin around the boat 
is practically unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
 "We released at least 40 marlin," Sansome said. "I've never seen that many in 
one area. We probably had a dozen on (people's lines) at one time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The changing of the guard is under way off Cabo San Lucas, where striped 
marlin are moving in and the bigger blues and blacks are slowly moving out.  
</P>
<P>
 Not that the change in seasons has affected their appetites.  
</P>
<P>
 A 490-pound blue was caught aboard the yacht Reel Affair after it had 
swallowed a 40-pound tuna at the end of an angler's line.  
</P>
<P>
 When the marlin was hung on the scale, a 30-pound dorado fell from its mouth.  
</P>
<P>
 Striper fishing is on the rise, though, with some skippers reporting as many 
as three a day, an indication that this season might be as productive as last 
-- one of the best ever. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who prefer smaller and more edible game, this has been one of the 
best dorado seasons anyone can remember. 
</P>
<P>
 How easy are they to catch?  
</P>
<P>
 One was reportedly taken on a banana peel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Backpacker magazine, in its December Issue, sheds some light on some of the 
more popular outdoor activities and which ones might help shed the pounds this 
holiday season.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the best is cross-country skiing, an activity during which the magazine 
says it would take a person 4.2 hours to shed one pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Backpacking and cross-country walking are also good, the magazine adds, in 
that one can lose a pound in 8.3 and 9.7 hours, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to what the Department of Fish and Game is calling rumors, a 
spokesman said the department had not trapped and transported thousands of 
chukars out of state and blamed this year's disappointing season -- on the 
heels of one of the best in years -- on Mother Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard rumors we trapped 9,000 chukars," said Sam Blankenship, a DFG 
upland game biologist. "In fact, we've trapped 433 chukars over the past 
summer. They were all taken from the China Lake Naval Weapons Station, which is 
closed to hunting." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the birds were given to Oregon, which supplied much of the equipment 
and manpower, while the rest were distributed elsewhere in California, 
Blankenship said. 
</P>
<P>
 The poor hunting, he added, is because "below normal winter and spring rains 
in 1993-94 led to reduced seed production" and caused populations to plummet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The DFG is looking for ways to improve black bass -- largemouth and smallmouth 
-- fisheries management and fishing opportunities throughout the state and has 
scheduled a series of public meetings on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every bass angler has ideas on how to improve fishing," said Dennis Lee, 
senior fishery biologist. "The meetings will give bass anglers a chance to 
become familiar with our regulations, review documents and to have a say in how 
we should manage California's black bass." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Southland the meetings are Dec. 3 from 7-10 p.m. at Castaic Lake 
Visitors Center, (818) 366-7913, and Dec. 10-11 from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. at 
Angler's Marine in Anaheim, (714) 538-8307. Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 FLY FISHING -- Montana guide and author Gary LaFontaine will speak to the 
Sierra Pacific Flyfishers and the general public Thursday at the Encino Glen, 
with a dinner meeting beginning at 6:30 p.m. . . . Fly-tier and 
author-illustrator Dave Whitlock will present a program entitled "Midging" for 
the Fly Fishers Club of Orange County on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. at the Ramada 
Airport Hotel in Santa Ana. Details: (714) 373-2721.

 PHOTOGRAPHY -- Winning images in the Los Angeles Underwater International

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; MAKING SENSE OF JAPANESE POLITICS, BUSINESS; THE END 
OF JAPAN INC.: AND HOW THE NEW JAPAN WILL LOOK BY CHRISTOPHER WOOD ; SIMON & 
SCHUSTER $23, 240 PAGES

 Not so long ago, Japan was regarded with a mixture of awe, envy and fear by 
Americans, and the Japanese model of corporate management became something of a 
cult in American business circles. 
</P>
<P>
 We watched with despair as Japanese investors collected some of the icons of 
American popular and corporate culture, everything from Universal Studios to 
Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The buying spree, argues Christopher Wood in "The End of Japan Inc.," was a 
folie de grandeur , and now Japan is paying the real price of its arrogance and 
folly. "The bubble economy" of Japan has burst, Wood explains, and no one quite 
knows what will come next. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is at stake here is no cyclical blip but a sea of change in the way an 
entire society is run," Wood insists. "Radical change is coming, and it will 
come fast." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wood, Japan is facing its "most severe economic crisis since the 
American occupation." The old magic -- a kind of financial alchemy based on 
"export-driven pursuit of market share in global markets, heavy capital 
spending, and the deliberate suppression of consumer demand" -- no longer 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood is a former correspondent for "The Economist," and nowadays he's working 
as an investment banker in London. The blend (or clash) of these two 
sensibilities -- journalist and "investment strategist" -- create a savvy and 
sometimes impertinent tone. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, when Wood explains how matters of money and markets are 
controlled by politics in Japan, he pauses to tell us that Bank of Japan is 
chartered under a 1942 statute that was copied from the Nazi Reichsbank law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nazis did not believe in independent central banks," Wood explains. "So 
when the chips are down the far more politically aware Finance Ministry has the 
power to tell the Bank of Japan what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood writes knowingly of the political origins of the Japanese economic 
miracle, including the recruitment of a former war criminal to lead an 
American-sponsored government in the years after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 He argues that the "Hollywood culture only goes skin-deep in Japan," and the 
Japanese ideal remains "a spirit of enlightened feudalism." 
</P>
<P>
 And the fall of the Liberal Democratic Party, he insists, was nothing less 
than "the collapse of a ruling order." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood does not engage in Japan-bashing, but he is not shy about saying out loud 
what he thinks about the strengths and weaknesses of Japanese culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's loss of leadership in the market for computers and other high 
technology products, he says, is explained by "Japan's national traits of 
social conformity and suppression from an early age of all forms of 
individualism." 
</P>
<P>
 "It has raised basic questions about whether the traditional Japanese 
education system, with its emphasis on rote learning in contrast to the Western 
liberal arts tradition of cultivating critical judgment and an inquiring mind, 
are really the skills best suited to the needs of serving an information 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 What will take the place of Japan's failed policies as it hurtles toward the 
21st Century? 
</P>
<P>
 Japan itself is being shaken by profound social, financial and political 
upheaval, and there is no sure way to know what the landscape will look like 
when the dust settles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan clearly works best as a society when there is an agreed consensus," 
Wood concludes. "But sometimes a consensus is not possible. This is the new 
reality that now faces Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wood himself suggests that there is a right way and a wrong way to solve 
the economic problems of Japan Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan faces a choice between two paths to economic recovery -- one is the 
rough-and-tumble of what he calls "the Anglo-Saxon free-market way"; the other 
is "a panoply of controls and subsidies in the aim of defending the status quo 
whatever the cost in terms of subsidizing inefficiency." 
</P>
<P>
 "The End of Japan Inc." is a book by a specialist for a sophisticated 
readership. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood names names, crunches numbers, and slips in and out of government 
ministries and corporate boardrooms with the deftness of a true insider. But, 
to his credit, Wood manages to make sense of the dismal science of economics 
and the sometimes abstruse workings of Japanese culture, politics and 
enterprise.

THEATER REVIEW; AN APPEALING 'ACT OF IMAGINATION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playwright Bernard Slade shot to fame in 1975 with "Same Time, Next Year," an 
unlikely but quirkily funny and affecting tale of a man and woman who have an 
annual tryst for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to imagine "An Act of the Imagination" being fashioned from the same 
mind. Continuing through Saturday at the Cabrillo Playhouse in a San Clemente 
Community Theatre production, it's a neatly crafted but creaky little mystery 
-- clever, but hardly insightful except for its references to the ways a writer 
can cannibalize and reconstruct his own life for material. 
</P>
<P>
 The troupe acquits the play reasonably well under Robert Berman's competent 
direction. And the show's twists may genuinely surprise mystery fans -- simply 
by virtue of the play's being so little known. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystery writer Arthur Putnam has just finished a brilliant novel about a 
married man who is having an affair and who is afraid someone is trying to kill 
him. Putnam has based the character on himself, but is he having an affair like 
his hero? He denies it, but his wife and editor aren't so sure. And when a 
woman, claiming to be the lover in the story, shows up and threatens blackmail, 
the mystery deepens and darkens. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Scott puts an affecting, vulnerable spin on the bookish Putnam, but we 
need more emotional abandon at crucial moments from Barbara Hollis as his wife, 
Julia. And Dennis Eiche could pour on more charm as Simon, Arthur's son from 
his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Mull is nicely deadpan as Sgt. Fred Burchitt, a policeman and amateur 
acting and mystery buff. Janet Lee injects vivid passion into the proceedings 
as Brenda Simmons, the woman who claims to be having an affair with Arthur. 
Richelle Matheny does well as Arthur's earnest young editor, Holly Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Spielman's costumes and warm, lived-in-looking set capture the ambience 
of a writer's world nicely, complemented by Erica Guerra and Terri Gilbert's 
lighting and the sound by Jim Bras. 
</P>
<P>
 The only serious problem in this appealing though hardly mind-bending 
production is that, like the criminal who makes one crucial mistake, the 
theater has made a revealing goof: the program's double credit for one actress 
(left off this review's cast list). A fictitious name would better preserve the 
mystery. In a play like this, where secrets are the play, giving away even one 
clue is a crime.

 Getty vs. Britain, Again: The British government on Tuesday deferred until 
January a decision on whether to allow a rare Rembrandt painting to be exported 
to the United States -- specifically to Malibu's J. Paul Getty Museum -- in the 
hope that a buyer will come forward to keep the work in Britain. In a 
statement, British National Heritage Secretary Stephen Dorrell said postponing 
the decision would allow time for a matching British purchase offer at or above 
$7.63 million -- the sum the Getty is believed to have paid for the 
17th-Century masterpiece "Daniel and Cyrus Before the Idol Bel." An additional 
four months' postponement could be granted if a serious offer appears to be 
forthcoming, Dorrell said. Dorrell's decision was another blow for the Getty, 
which earlier this year failed in its bid to buy and export to California 
Antonio Canova's sculpture "The Three Graces."

 'Saigon' Casting: Kevin Gray, a U.S.-born actor of Chinese and Ukrainian 
descent, will play the Engineer in "Miss Saigon" when it opens at the Ahmanson 
Theatre in January. The casting of white actor Jonathan Pryce in the Eurasian 
role in the Broadway production set off a storm of controversy in 1990, but all 
of his U.S. successors in the role have been at least partly of Asian heritage. 
Gray opened the Toronto production of the show in 1993 and is now playing it in 
Detroit. The role of Kim will be played by Philippines-born Jennifer C. Paz, a 
veteran of the Chicago production, and Kim's lover Chris will be played by 
Peter Lockyer, who's currently doing the role on Broadway.

 Talk About a Resume: Other than tormenting many famous talk-show hosts as a 
frequent guest, what qualifications does Charles Grodin have to host his own 
talk show? "I have no qualifications at all -- and we're all very excited about 
that," Grodin said. The actor, named Tuesday to replace Tom Snyder as host of 
CNBC's nighttime cable talk show in January, also joked that he had special 
connections that would help him book his new show. "I went to the University of 
Miami with Saddam Hussein in the 1950s -- I'll be calling him to be on my 
program." On a more serious note, CNBC president Roger Ailes said that he had 
admired Grodin's wit as far back as 1981, when Ailes hired Grodin as a 
substitute host on Snyder's old "Tomorrow Show." Grodin's show, called "Charles 
Grodin," will be done live out of CNBC's New Jersey headquarters; CNBC will air 
a torch-passing of sorts tonight when Grodin guests on "Tom Snyder."*

 Taking a Stand: Talk-show host Ricki Lake and her husband, Rob Sussman, spent 
the night in a New York jail Monday after they joined 13 other anti-fur 
protesters who stormed the Fifth Avenue offices of fashion designer Karl 
Lagerfeld. The demonstrators, members of the animal rights group People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals, forced their way into Lagerfeld's office, chanted 
slogans including "Fur is murder" and placed bumper stickers on the walls and 
garments, police said. The damage to Lagerfeld's office was estimated at 
$3,500. Lake and the others were charged with third-degree burglary and 
second-degree criminal mischief, both felonies. If convicted, they could face 
up to three years in prison. Lake was scheduled to discuss the demonstration on 
Tuesday's "Late Show With David Letterman." POP/ROCK

 Seagal Order Canceled: A Santa Monica Superior Court judge on Tuesday set 
aside a temporary restraining order issued last week against actor Steven 
Seagal, ruling that plaintiff Sheryl Shuman did not notify the actor before 
filing her petition with the court. Shuman claims she had a four-month romantic 
involvement with Seagal, after which the actor repeatedly threatened her and 
then sent his bodyguards to "attack" her in retaliation for a TV interview she 
gave about him. However, Judge David Rothman ruled Tuesday that Shuman 
presented no evidence that Seagal knew about the interview. A further hearing 
on Shuman's request for a restraining order is scheduled for Nov. 30; Seagal's 
attorney, Martin Singer, on Tuesday called Shuman's claims "absolutely false 
and fabricated." SHAUNA SNOW

DANCE REVIEW; A SATISFYING BLEND OF UP AND DOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Parsons likes to be up in the air, so he and his dancers use the floor 
glancingly, preferring positions aloft. Whereas, Billy Taylor and his musicians 
expend energy getting down -- with a light, jazzy touch, of course. Separately, 
they soared in their own orbits Monday night at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
Together, they also found some common ground to play on. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parsons Dance Company and the Billy Taylor Trio call their evening "Step 
Into My Dream," the name of their shared third act. But before that, each group 
made its own statement, beginning with Parsons' buoyant 1990 piece 
"Nascimento." 
</P>
<P>
 This is modern dance in its most playful mode, with beautiful bouncing, 
stylish flinging of limbs and happy turning skips Isadora Duncan would be proud 
of. Patricia Kenny, Elizabeth Koeppen and Jaime Martinez were the most adept at 
keeping cheerful pace with the seductive changing beats of a taped score by 
Brazilian composer Milton Nascimento. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came Parsons in the old (1982) but always clever "Caught," using strobe 
lights to produce the effect of zero gravity jumps (his feet only touch the 
ground in the dark). Setting up the sleight-of-hand premise that you don't have 
to move to take off, it was a perfect prelude to the Taylor Trio's set. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After nine dancers had carved space so widely, it was hard to adjust to the 
more sedate pairings of musician and instrument. Then the music moved beyond 
the players' narrow bendings and bobbings -- a bass became witty in the hands 
of Charles (Chip) Jackson and the drums did impressive bongo duty for Steve 
Johns. At the piano, Taylor was especially eloquent playing his "It's a Matter 
of Pride" and Gershwin's "The Man I Love." 
</P>
<P>
 For "Step Into My Dream," the musicians played upstage, and the dancers played 
around -- especially well in several improvised duets that produced spontaneous 
bounces, glides and noodling from collaborative musical impulses. 
</P>
<P>
 Creeping in at other moments were cute wiggles and quirky segmented moves that 
might have defined jazz dance inspiration during the "Hullabaloo" years. Such 
is the fine line between wit and cliche, but generally Parsons treads it well 
enough to enable a pleasant merger. Uplift meets downbeat? Something like that.

THEATER REVIEW; HANDSOME 'LION IN WINTER' A BIT TOO TAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marital strife, generational warfare, adultery, sibling rivalry, betrayal and 
even homophobia. Some things never go out of style. 
</P>
<P>
 By investing 12th-Century England's Henry II and his queen, Eleanor of 
Aquitaine, with contemporary voices and psychological insights, James Goldman's 
1966 drama "The Lion in Winter" illuminates archetypal patterns in families, 
politics and the turbulent unions of men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pasadena Playhouse, the casting of real-life spouses Tom Troupe and 
Carole Cook as the heads of Goldman's dysfunctional royal family was a cute 
idea. But the results prove a mixed bag in a handsome but safe production that 
hits many of the high notes while under-serving significant aspects of 
Goldman's richly layered text. 
</P>
<P>
 The unqualified triumph here is Cook's portrayal of Eleanor, the feisty queen 
imprisoned for her relentless schemes to secure Henry's throne for her favored 
son, Richard the Lionhearted (Maury Ginsberg). Equally adept with Eleanor's 
brisk sarcasm ("Not now, dear -- mother's fighting"), vengeful rage and 
poignant meditations on losing her husband to a younger woman, Cook brings 
memorable clarity to this complicated figure. 
</P>
<P>
 As Henry, Troupe has a harder time of it. A character no less complex than his 
queen, Henry is a warrior-king, torn by polar impulses toward barbarism and 
civilization. Troupe's easygoing demeanor and thin, high-pitched voice work 
against him. He is hardly the sort of brash, swaggering monarch who can give 
lessons in bellowing to the young king of France (James Calvert) -- kvetching 
lessons, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 Though unconvincing as a roaring lion, Troupe fares much better with Henry's 
anguish at the treason of his beloved son John (Gordon Greenberg), and in his 
tenderness toward his young mistress (an agreeably assertive Jennifer Aspen). 
Not surprisingly, he's best in his soul-searching, love-hate dialogues with 
Eleanor, which play with the authenticity of a couple who've gone the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 But relations between the royal couple and their wayward sons are 
disappointingly shallow. Director David Galligan seems content to envision the 
princes as weak-willed, arrested development cases, not unlike the returning 
offspring in the sitcom-like "Alone Together" he staged at the Pasadena 
Playhouse last year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a glossed-over treatment that leaves much of the tangled familial knots 
in shadow, particularly Ginsberg's less-than-aggressive Richard (even his 
homosexuality gets little more than farcical attention). While Greenberg's John 
is appropriately dim-witted, he's far too kempt for the slovenly, bullying 
coward the other characters describe. Jay Underwood's cold, resentful Geoffrey 
is the most congruent performance, in part because he's meant to be the most 
self-effacing of the sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressive production values give the piece a solid foundation -- Gary 
Wissmann's revolving, multilevel stonework set is impeccably detailed, and 
costume designers Zoe DuFour and Dawna Oak have clad Eleanor in sumptuous robes 
that contrast with Henry's "woolly sheep dog" style. Kevin Mahan's generally 
effective lighting has an annoying compulsion to dim during the closing lines 
of each scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Brisk pacing counters the play's length, though sometimes at the expense of 
important beats. Henry's moment of triumph over Calvert's arrogant King of 
France lacks the required pause for its significance to register. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously blunted as well is the seething potential for violence so crucial to 
the period -- these people did not carry swords and daggers for ornamentation. 
Yet even the final armed confrontation between Henry and his sons is 
half-hearted -- it smacks of an emasculated revisionism that poorly 
counterpoints Eleanor's feminine vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing a shot of testosterone wouldn't fix.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BODY COUNT MILKS A DEAD GENRE IN GLAM SLAM SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One thing came across loud and clear on Monday night at Glam Slam during the 
set by Body Count, the rap/metal band fronted by L.A. rapper Ice-T: It's time 
to pull the plug on this genre. The novelty has worn off. 
</P>
<P>
 The main problem with the genre is that it pairs rap, in which lyrics are 
crucial, with metal, where lyrics are a distant second to instrumental din. 
</P>
<P>
 At Glam Slam, Ice-T shrieked over his four bandmates' screeching speed-metal 
riffs. He was ranting about assorted urban miseries, but you could hardly hear 
a word he was saying over the roar of the guitars. The show seemed pointless, 
except to the mosh-pit maniacs who were reacting to the rage inherent in 
speed-metal music. 
</P>
<P>
 The genre would probably have faded long ago if it hadn't been for Body 
Count's "Cop Killer" in 1992. The headlines generated by that controversial 
track also generated album sales, and definitely extended the style's life. 
</P>
<P>
 But Body Count came crashing back to reality this year with its second album, 
"Born Dead" -- which was just about dead on arrival when it hit the stores. The 
genre should be buried along with it.DENNIS HUNT

MUSIC REVIEW; VIENNA SYMPHONY: SOLID, PEDESTRIAN OUTING

<P>
 Making another Southern California stop -- but only its first Orange County 
appearance -- on its seventh U.S. concert tour, the Vienna Symphony and its 
music director, Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos, arrived at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa Monday night with an unhackneyed program, 
which it played strongly. 
</P>
<P>
 In Webern's Passacaglia, Opus 1, the Horn Concerto No. 2 by Richard Strauss 
and Brahms' Fourth Symphony, Vienna's second orchestra -- the Philharmonic 
being its first -- gave clean, neat and careful performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, much was missing. For starters, a lack of imagination and inspiration 
from the podium, and characterization by telling details from the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 There is subtext in all orchestral performances. Sometimes it is merely the 
urgency and continuity enforced by a conductor's will. Sometimes it is a shared 
programmatic intent between leader and led, creating meanings unspecified by, 
but idiomatic to, the composer. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, as here, it is a neglect of the listener, an assumption that 
careful and well-shaped note-playing will suffice where mental connections and 
emotional projection are actually a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 Efficiency and well-honed instrumental skills abound in this orchestra, which 
certainly plays with more cohesion and confidence than it did when last we 
heard it, at the concerts opening Ambassador Auditorium in 1974. But, on this 
occasion, under Fruhbeck, very little of this admirable program actually came 
to life, though, paradoxically, it sounded well. 
</P>
<P>
 The excellent, virtuosic and mellow-toned soloist in the Strauss Concerto was 
the orchestra's solo horn, Australian musician Hector McDonald. He was 
handsomely seconded by his colleagues.

DANCE REVIEW; PARSONS, TAYLOR MELD STYLES, SENSIBILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Parsons likes to be up in the air, so he and his dancers use the floor 
glancingly, preferring positions aloft. Whereas, Billy Taylor and his musicians 
expend energy getting down -- with a light, jazzy touch, of course. Separately, 
they soared in their own orbits Monday night at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
Together, they also found some common ground to play on. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parsons Dance Company and the Billy Taylor Trio call their evening "Step 
Into My Dream," the name of their shared third act. But before that, each group 
made its own statement, beginning with Parsons' buoyant 1990 piece 
"Nascimento." 
</P>
<P>
 This is modern dance in its most playful mode, with beautiful bouncing, 
stylish flinging of limbs and happy turning skips Isadora Duncan would be proud 
of. Patricia Kenny, Elizabeth Koeppen and Jaime Martinez were the most adept at 
keeping cheerful pace with the seductive changing beats of a taped score by 
Brazilian composer Milton Nascimento. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came Parsons in the old (1982) but always clever "Caught," using strobe 
lights to produce the effect of zero gravity jumps.  
</P>
<P>
 After nine dancers' had carved space so widely, it was hard to adjust to the 
more sedate pairings of musician and instrument. Then the music moved beyond 
the players' narrow bendings and bobbings -- a bass became witty in the hands 
of Charles (Chip) Jackson and the drums did impressive bongo duty for Steve 
Johns. At the piano, Taylor was especially eloquent.  
</P>
<P>
 For "Step Into My Dream," the musicians played upstage, and the dancers played 
around -- especially well in several improvised duets that produced spontaneous 
bounces, glides and noodling from collaborative musical impulses. 
</P>
<P>
 Creeping in at other moments were cute wiggles and quirky segmented moves that 
might have defined jazz dance inspiration during the "Hullabaloo" years. Such 
is the fine line between wit and cliche, but generally Parsons treads it well 
enough to enable a pleasant merger. Uplift meets downbeat? Something like that.

TV REVIEW; MTV'S 'HELP' PAINTS BLEAK PICTURE OF JOB MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Twentysomething and can't get a job? Your mistake was spending those four or 
more years in college. Instead of getting that degree in accounting, you should 
have been in fast food, the military or behind the counter at your local mall. 
</P>
<P>
 That seems to be the message in tonight's half-hour MTV report "Help Not 
Wanted," a bleak overview of job prospects for young people, hosted by Tabitha 
Soren. 
</P>
<P>
 The happy people here are a McDonald's manager (with a degree in engineering), 
a female Navy recruit and an air-conditioning installer. The college grads are 
singing the I-can't-find-a-job-and-I-have-student-loans-to-pay-off blues. The 
much touted economic recovery finds that corporations are less inclined to 
invest in full-time employees and that many recent college graduates are 
unemployed or working at lower-skill jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, we're told that, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics, "by 
the year 2000, half of all Americans will be employed on a temporary basis." In 
addition to that dismaying news, desperate young job seekers are being scammed 
by unscrupulous, multilevel sales companies -- as a "hidden camera" expose 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 You can say that these young adults should be glad to have any job today. But 
the sense of betrayal that colors this gloomy report is understandable: We're 
still telling them that a college education is the key to success. It can be, 
but the message needs a qualifier. Reality can be a real jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Help Not Wanted" airs at 10 tonight on MTV.

FED HIKES INTEREST RATES; INCREASE IS BIGGEST OF THE YEAR; ECONOMY: BOOST OF 
THREE-QUARTERS OF A POINT IN FUNDS RATE AND DISCOUNT RATE REAFFIRMS CENTRAL 
BANK'S FIGHT ON INFLATION. CRITICS SEE DANGERS TO GROWTH AND JOB CREATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board signaled its commitment Tuesday to quash any 
evidence of inflation by raising its two benchmark interest rates by 
three-quarters of a percentage point each, marking the central bank's sixth and 
largest increase of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve took the aggressive move in the face of mounting criticism 
that it has already gone too far this year to restrain economic growth and job 
creation to curb the potential threat of rising prices. The action to raise 
rates was the first since August. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member Federal Reserve board of governors voted unanimously to raise 
the bank's discount rate -- the rate it charges commercial banks -- from 4% to 
4.75%. In a separate meeting, the Fed's open market committee voted to increase 
the more influential federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each 
other on overnight loans, by three-quarters of a point as well, to 5.5%. The 
Fed's actions were quickly followed by increases of three-quarters of a point 
by commercial banks in their prime rates to 8.5% -- increasing borrowing costs 
for millions of Americans with variable rate loans tied to the prime. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's Federal Reserve action seemed to be a departure from Chairman Alan 
Greenspan's strategy of gradualism in setting interest rate policy and 
suggested that he and senior officials of the central bank now believe that the 
economy is growing at a stronger pace than they had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 The five previous rate increases this year were either quarter-point or 
half-point moves. The decision Tuesday for larger increases appears to be an 
acknowledgment that Federal Reserve officials had underestimated the strength 
of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Greenspan and other central bank officials acknowledge that there 
are few signs of rising prices, they believe that it is crucial for them to 
take preemptive action against inflation. Greenspan has argued that monetary 
policy acts with a long lag time and that, if the Federal Reserve waits to 
strike until inflation is evident in the economy, it will be too late to 
stabilize prices. Suddenly raising rates at that point could disrupt economic 
activity.  
</P>
<P>
 The nation's inflation rate stands at 2.7% for the first nine months of the 
year, with the consumer price index for September up two-tenths of a point, the 
last month for which figures are available. The index rose by three-tenths of a 
percentage point in each of the three previous months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve's decision to get ahead of what it sees as "the 
inflationary curve" pleased some economists. "It was appropriate -- in fact it 
was overdue," said Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic 
consulting firm based in Lexington, Mass. "I think the Fed has had trouble 
keeping up with economic growth -- each month we seem to see higher forecasts 
-- and so the Fed decided to get ahead of it for once." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good move. It cleared the air of a lot of uncertainty in the markets 
about how far and how fast the Fed would go," added economist Scott Pardee, 
chairman of Yamaichi International (America) Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, expressed criticism of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Continuing this policy of raising interest rates not only endangers the 
economic expansion but it hurts working men and women who have not seen their 
wages keep up with the expanding economy," said House Budget Committee Chairman 
Martin Olav Sabo (D-Minn.).  
</P>
<P>
 And, while most of the criticism came from Democrats and liberal groups, some 
business leaders and Republicans also expressed growing concern about what they 
view as overly aggressive Federal Reserve policies. Jerry Jasinowski, an 
economist and president of the National Assn. of Manufacturers, said that 
Tuesday's action "was not necessary. While the economy grew faster than 
expected in the third quarter, there is not much evidence of inflation. The Fed 
is fundamentally misreading the American economy." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), who is expected to become the 
next chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Development Committee, 
which has oversight responsibilities for the central bank, declared that 
"inflation is practically nonexistent." He said that the Federal Reserve has 
"acted cautiously to assure that it does not become a problem," but said he 
hopes "these actions today will not contribute to weakening economic 
prospects." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Feb. 4, the central bank has increased the federal funds rate -- which 
is widely considered to be the Federal Reserve's most important monetary policy 
tool -- by 2.50 percentage points. Economists said that in the past federal 
funds rate increases of two to three percentage points have been enough to slow 
the U.S. economy and anything above that level has pushed the country into a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists are now betting that the Federal Reserve has moved far enough 
to avoid the threat of rising prices next year but not so far that its policies 
will lead to a recession. Economists generally expect the economy to undergo a 
sharp slowdown next year because of the central bank actions, reducing overall 
economic growth to below 2.5% from this year's pace of about 3.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 But many Federal Reserve officials and conservative economists believe that 
economic growth cannot be sustained above 2.5% without risking higher inflation 
and so are committed to that growth rate as a key target for monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate decision came on a day when the government reported that retail sales 
jumped by an unexpectedly strong 1.1% in October and U.S. industry operated at 
84.9% of capacity last month, the highest level in nearly 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's strong action has convinced many economists that the central bank 
has finally caught up with the pace of economic growth and will not raise rates 
again in its next major policy meeting in December. Many observers think that 
it may be able to put off another rate hike until February or even later. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty large move and they clearly wanted to make a statement that 
they are here, they are in charge and that they will take care of inflation," 
observed Donald Ratajczak, an economist at Georgia State University. 
</P>
<P>
 But that enthusiasm for the Federal Reserve strategy was not shared by the 
central bank's widening circle of critics, ranging from leading business 
executives to unemployed workers and lawmakers -- who argued that the central 
bank's focus on price stability is choking off the nation's recovery as it is 
beginning to generate more jobs and higher wages.  
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of unemployed workers and other protesters demonstrated outside the 
central bank's Washington headquarters, chanting for Greenspan to change his 
mind and hold down rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came here to tell them to stop raising rates. It's making the job outlook 
very gloomy," said Lester Thomas, a 54-year-old unemployed sheet metal worker 
from Philadelphia, as he protested outside the Fed headquarters. Tracking the 
Increases 
</P>

time this year. In its statement, the Fed sought to signal its resolve to fight

APPEALS COURT DEALS SETBACK TO INDIAN CASINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a long-awaited ruling that deals a major setback to burgeoning casinos on 
Indian lands throughout California, a federal appeals court Tuesday rejected 
the claim of dozens of tribes that the state must allow them to offer 
wide-ranging forms of gambling, including electronic slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Agreeing instead with the position of state officials, who have fought for 
years to limit the growth of Indian gambling, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals said the tribes cannot conduct forms of casino gambling that are banned 
on non-Indian lands. 
</P>
<P>
 "A state need only allow Indian tribes to operate games that others can 
operate, but need not give tribes what others cannot have," said the 3-0 ruling 
issued in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling came after state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren refused to include the 
lucrative slot-type gambling in "compacts" that are supposed to be negotiated 
with tribes under the national Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Lungren said such 
devices -- the centerpieces of casinos worldwide -- clearly are banned under 
the California Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 But Indian casinos throughout the state began installing thousands of the 
video gambling machines anyway after U.S. Dist. Judge Garland Burrell last year 
agreed with tribal attorneys that the technology in the state's own lottery -- 
particularly in terminals for its then-new Keno game -- had "opened the door" 
to more expansive gambling by the tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's ruling largely overturned Burrell's decision, and Lungren 
immediately claimed vindication in what has been a long and frustrating battle 
for his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thousands of video slot machines now being operated in Indian casinos in 
California are illegal, and action should be taken in compliance with today's 
ruling," the attorney general said in a statement. He suggested further that 
federal prosecutors now seek removal of the devices -- more than 2,000 of them 
in San Diego County alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal attorneys immediately warned that any curtailment of gambling could 
have a devastating effect on the state's small Native American communities, 
many of which have come to depend on income from casinos in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 With revenues from tribal casinos now estimated to exceed $1 billion in 
California, an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court seems a certainty. First, the 
case must return to Burrell's court for a further hearing requested by the 
appeals panel on what types of electronic slot machines may, in fact, be 
allowed in the tribal facilities because they closely parallel lottery games. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lungren predicted that those criteria will clearly rule out video poker 
and other electronic slot machines, which have created a Las Vegas-type 
atmosphere in tribal casinos clustered in areas from the resort region around 
Palm Springs to Lake County north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are highly confident that we can successfully argue that slot machines and 
the electronic terminals operated by the lottery are not the same thing," 
Lungren said. 
</P>
<P>
 As in much of the nation, Indian gambling in California has grown amid a 
tangle of legal cases. Burrell's earlier decision was based on the logic of a 
series of past decisions that the general public policy of a state toward 
gambling -- not necessarily the exact types of wagering allowed -- dictates 
what can be offered on Indian lands. 
</P>
<P>
 But the appeals court said that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, adopted by 
Congress in 1988, gives states the power to prohibit specific types of gambling 
on Indian lands unless the same types of gambling -- not merely similar types 
-- are permitted elsewhere in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens in this case, several types of gambling remain indisputably 
legal in the state and thus available to the tribes, namely bingo, poker and 
off-track wagering on horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
 The revenue from none of these, however, approaches the take from electronic 
gambling, in which a single machine can generate $400 profit a day. A tribal 
casino in Connecticut, where such gambling has been sanctioned by the state, is 
expected to earn more than $300 million just from machine gambling this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The California tribes are now expected to argue that many types of video 
gambling machines are basically the same as the terminals the state uses for 
Keno. 
</P>
<P>
 During a hearing in March, 1993, Burrell, the Sacramento judge, had sympathy 
for such an argument, telling a packed courtroom: "At least some of the games 
the (tribes) propose seem indistinguishable from games offered by the state 
lottery."

STATE OKS COMPROMISE ATTACK ON AIR POLLUTION; SMOG: PLAN SUBMITTED TO U.S. 
CALLS FOR ALTERNATIVE FUELS, ELECTRIC CARS. BUT AUTO, TRUCKING INDUSTRIES GAIN 
CONCESSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barely meeting a key federal deadline, the state Air Resources Board on 
Tuesday unanimously adopted a sweeping plan that aims to clean up California's 
smog with an array of hotly contested strategies that could cost consumers and 
industries billions of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
 After 25 hours of stormy testimony from business owners and environmentalists, 
the air board approved a compromise plan that pushes advanced technology in 
cars and trucks and includes concessions drafted to accommodate the oil, 
trucking and auto industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Provisions that will force widespread use of much cleaner alternative fuels 
and electric vehicles in California after the year 2004 were kept in the plan 
as a high priority. As a compromise, though, the board decided that it was too 
soon to determine how stringent a future standard might be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan also relies heavily on a voluntary strategy drafted by Texaco and 
the trucking industry to use public money to buy and scrap thousands of older, 
polluting cars and diesel trucks beginning in 1996 in the four-county Los 
Angeles Basin, the state's smoggiest region. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of buying cars at $1,000 apiece would be about $75 million a year by 
1999. No sources of funds have been determined, but the ARB says the effort 
might be financed through a $7 annual fee tacked onto vehicle registrations or 
a $100 fee on new cars. 
</P>
<P>
 California's new blueprint for battling ozone outlines an ambitious 15-year 
agenda that is supposed to finally achieve the Los Angeles Basin's elusive goal 
of healthful air in 2010, the year mandated by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, California had until Tuesday to submit a strategy outlining 
in detail how it would comply with a national health standard for ozone in six 
regions of the state or face more onerous rules and sanctions from the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-member air board was under direction from Gov. Pete Wilson to protect 
the state's struggling economy but still meet federal clean air mandates as it 
wrestled with how to slash ozone -- the pervasive, lung-damaging main 
ingredient of smog -- by about 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must understand what our actions mean to each and every sector of the 
economy," said Jacqueline Schafer, chairwoman of the ARB. "We are in 
competition with other states to ensure that California's quality of life is 
the best. That means that in attempting to ensure our environmental future we 
must be cognizant of the economic mortgage required." 
</P>
<P>
 The board decided in a 7-0 vote to strike a compromise over new technology for 
cars because a proposal by the ARB staff last week prompted outrage from 
environmentalists and businesses that support alternative fuel technology. But 
in a concession to the trucking industry, the ARB made standards forcing 
alternative fuels in heavy-duty trucks a lower priority, setting no stringent 
long-term emissions goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan gives high priority to the proposal to begin scrapping old cars 
in the Los Angeles Basin at a pace of 6,000 vehicles in 1996, increasing to 
75,000 a year in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 But local air quality officials fear that the scrap program is too unrealistic 
and unenforceable to satisfy federal mandates, especially for the Los Angeles 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's the wrong way to go," said James Lents, executive officer of 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the agency that regulates air 
pollution in the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and businesses that back alternative-fuel vehicles 
criticized the ARB for giving in to influential industries. They said it is 
unfair to impose new fees on residents to pay for scrap programs when most of 
the burden should remain on industries that produce polluting vehicles and 
fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's draft version made "a mockery of the people like us who have tried 
to advance this technology so far," said Andrew Hirsch, a senior manager at 
Southern California Gas Co. But Tuesday's final plan "puts back some teeth for 
increased technology. It's a good solid compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Auto, trucking and oil executives, however, said the ARB was too optimistic in 
gauging the extent that alternative fuels and electricity could power cars and 
trucks in 2005. The price of alternative-fuel vehicles remains too high and too 
many technical shortcomings exist to guarantee widespread use, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives contend that a program to scrap old vehicles would cost 
billions of dollars less and save jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This serves as a model for how employers and the air board can work together 
to find things that do not cause as much job loss but meet the same air quality 
goals," said Allan Zaremberg, senior vice president of the California Chamber 
of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Air board member Jack Lagarias, who suggested the compromise Tuesday, said the 
plan "will send a message to (vehicle and fuel) manufacturers that advanced 
technology is still an answer to California's air quality problems." He said it 
was important to leave open to debate in the year 2000 how stringent a standard 
is necessary and reasonable by then. 
</P>
<P>
 For 25 years, the ARB staff and board have been unwavering in setting tough 
state mandates that force cleaner fuels and vehicles. But they have been under 
increasing pressure from Gov. Wilson's office in recent months to incorporate 
less costly alternatives recommended by the oil and trucking industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although eclipsed during much of the debate by the controversy over the 
vehicle scrapping programs, the new plan contains hundreds of important and 
aggressive measures regulating pesticides, consumer products ranging from 
aerosol paint to nail polish, and businesses from aerospace to auto mechanic 
shops. It also requires California heavy-duty truck operators to cut diesel 
exhaust in half by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is a compilation of measures to be imposed by the ARB and six 
regional districts, including the AQMD, as well as some national standards for 
railroads, airlines and other interstate sources under consideration by the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's goal is to create an anti-smog program strong enough to replace 
proposals developed by the EPA that have been criticized by virtually every 
business and government agency as onerous and economically disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
 "California's economy has a loaded gun to its head," Wilson's chief economist, 
Phil Romero, said at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero said the state plan would be 30% to 80% less expensive than the federal 
version. An economic consultant hired by the ARB at Wilson's request estimated 
that the state plan would cost $6 billion a year compared to $8 billion a year 
under the federal plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The ARB's plan, however, may not be specific enough to win the approval of the 
EPA, which has veto power. David Howekamp, chief of the EPA's western regional 
air division, said it lacks such necessary details as a strategy for funding 
the scrapping programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would have to address those issues," Howekamp said. "They have to have 
enforceable measures for this to be an approvable plan." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA has six months to determine if the plan is complete and a year after 
that to approve or reject it. 
</P>
<P>
 Schafer challenged the EPA to act quickly in accepting California's plan as a 
replacement of the federal version and also to adopt some national pollution 
standards for sources such as railroads and airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Submitting the (plan) today sent the message that California is willing to 
accept its responsibility no matter how difficult it may be," Schafer said. 
"California simply wants the federal government and EPA to accept the same 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a vocal opponent of the federal plan, 
praised the ARB Tuesday for "including many constructive proposals to achieve 
clean air and preserve jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The scrapping program is designed only for Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and 
San Bernardino counties, but could be expanded later. 
</P>
<P>
 The air board acknowledged that there is no easy source of funding for buying 
old cars and new fees are likely to become an explosive issue for Californians. 
Legislative approval is necessary before the program can begin, and the 
California Chamber of Commerce and oil industry officials have pledged to the 
ARB that they will persuade state legislators to pass a funding bill next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to cars, the plan prescribes the scrapping of 1,600 old, high 
polluting diesel trucks per year in the basin beginning in 1999. Fewer would be 
scrapped from 1996 to 1998. The ARB suggests low-income loans or government 
subsidies to pay the truckers to replace their old vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Zane, who directs the Coalition for Clean Air, said trying to buy such 
large volumes of vehicles is a "bogus, ephemeral notion . . . utterly, utterly 
absurd. Scrapping does have its place, but we should not see it as a substitute 
for new technologies." 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD officials say they also worry that the attempt to retire so many old 
vehicles will fail, leaving the Southland unable to meet health standards. "We 
think they are being overly optimistic," Lents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lents said he doubts that $1,000 will be enough to persuade motorists to sell 
their vehicles, which in most cases would be over eight years old. In an 
experimental program, Chevron and other oil companies have bought and scrapped 
5,000 cars since the summer of 1993, but have started to run out of willing 
sellers and have already upped offers to $1,500, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co. Executive Engineer Mike Schwarz acknowledged that the public, 
not the car and oil industries, would pay for the scrapping program. But he 
said that even if auto makers are forced to produce new technologies, they 
still would pass the cost to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is how, not whether, California citizens should pay for the 
measures in this plan," Schwarz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the concessions, some business leaders say the burden on California 
companies remains far too high. The plan "will have a dramatic and adverse 
effect on California's economy," said United Parcel Service executive Ken 
Churchill. "It attempts to mandate the impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan leaves intact regulations adopted by the ARB in 1990 that require 2% 
of cars sold in California by major auto companies to be electric-powered by 
1998, increasing to 10% in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan expands on those existing rules by requiring car makers to ratchet 
down average emissions even more, which could mean that all cars would have to 
be fueled by sources as clean as natural gas or electricity in 2005.

PARTS OF PROP. 187 MAY BE BLOCKED 2 OR MORE YEARS; LAW: ANALYSTS SAY SOME 
PORTIONS VULNERABLE. STATE WILL ASK FOR TIME TO DRAFT RULES TO AVOID 
CONSTITUTIONAL PITFALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the court fight over Proposition 187 resumes today in Los Angeles, many 
constitutional analysts say the measure's legal flaws could block some 
provisions for two to three years until the U.S. Supreme Court or the state 
high court makes a final ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think at least a substantial part will be enjoined, and there is a good 
chance all will be enjoined," said USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 State Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, a supporter of the initiative who will make a 
procedural move to keep the legal battle before elected state judges, conceded 
that parts of Proposition 187 are vulnerable to legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll just say this," Lungren said, "I am glad there is a severability clause" 
that lets the initiative remain law even if certain provisions are struck down. 
</P>
<P>
 At an afternoon hearing today in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, the state 
will argue that judges should not block enforcement of Proposition 187 until 
regulations to implement the law are completed. The regulations, Lungren said, 
may avoid the constitutional pitfalls that a strict reading of the ballot 
measure could raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the sweeping measure vow to force the state to defend the 
initiative itself, not the regulations. They will seek a court order today 
barring implementation of the law, citing cases of illegal immigrants who 
already have had problems getting public benefits since voters approved the 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know they have serious constitutional problems," complained Mark 
Rosenbaum, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who is attempting to 
invalidate the entire measure, "and they are really trying to write a different 
statute." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers and legal scholars are divided over the ultimate fate of Proposition 
187 and which Supreme Court -- California's, which is dominated by 
conservatives appointed by Republican governors, or the nation's -- would be 
more likely to uphold more of the measure that seeks to deny most public 
services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal analysts predicted the following twists in the court wrangle over the 
measure: 
</P>
<P>
 * A provision preventing illegal immigrants from attending public schools 
probably will be blocked by courts pending review by either the state or U.S. 
Supreme Court. A San Francisco Superior Court judge already has issued a 
temporary order prohibiting the state from enforcing the provision, which 
wasn't due to take effect until Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arguments that the initiative usurps federal authority over immigration will 
prove to be a thornier legal question. Although the U.S. Supreme Court in the 
past has prevented states from passing certain laws aimed at illegal 
immigrants, the high court could interpret federal law as a floor that states 
can build upon as long as the final result mirrors national policies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some of the measure's provisions that require reporting of illegal 
immigrants probably will be struck down, while others will withstand court 
scrutiny. Careful regulations, however, could save some of the reporting 
requirements by making them consistent with federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 * The state, which is defending Proposition 187, probably will attempt to 
consolidate the eight federal and state lawsuits against the measure and move 
the case out of Los Angeles. U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer, who has 
been selected to hear the four suits filed in Los Angeles, is considered a 
smart, independent liberal who is more likely to rule in favor of the opponents 
than the state. 
</P>
<P>
 A Carter appointee, Pfaelzer is out of town, and U.S. District Judge Matthew 
Byrne Jr., considered a moderate liberal, will preside over today's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the provision banning illegal immigrants from attending public 
schools is the most vulnerable, at least temporarily, because the U.S. Supreme 
Court struck down a similar Texas law in a 1982 case called Plyler vs. Doe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is about as sure a thing there ever is in a legal question," said 
Chemerinsky, who predicted that the provision will be blocked by trial and 
appellate courts pending high court review. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the current U.S. Supreme Court probably would have decided Plyler 
differently, analysts said, the justices may be reluctant to overturn 
precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a decent chance" the high court will reverse the decision, said UC 
Berkeley constitutional law professor Jesse Choper, "but any time you challenge 
a precedent you have an uphill battle. The people who sought to overturn Roe 
vs. Wade learned that." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative must comply with both the state and the U.S. constitutions. If 
the California Supreme Court struck down the schools provision on state 
constitutional grounds, review by the U.S. Supreme Court would be unnecessary, 
Chemerinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 The California high court has previously interpreted education as a 
fundamental interest under the state Constitution. This interpretation creates 
a special legal hurdle that must be crossed by anyone attempting to deny access 
to public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is no such hurdle under federal law, some believe the opponents 
of Proposition 187 would have a better chance before the state court. 
</P>
<P>
 Most legal analysts, however, accurately predicted that Lungren would prefer 
to try the cases before elected state judges. Federal judges have lifetime 
tenure, so are shielded from political pressures, and Lungren also knows that 
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, the first stop for most appeals, 
includes many liberal judges. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court, which has only one Democrat, is reputed to bend 
over backward to uphold voter initiatives. The court could simply distinguish 
the initiative from previous education cases and uphold the schooling 
provisions, said Chemerinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU lawsuit, one of the four filed in Los Angeles federal court, is the 
broadest in scope because it tries to overturn the entire initiative on a 
variety of legal grounds, including the supremacy clause of the U.S. 
Constitution.  
</P>
<P>
 States are prohibited under this clause from engaging in foreign relations, 
according to Loyola constitutional law professor Karl Manheim, who is working 
with the ACLU and who said immigration is an "outgrowth" of foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 He contended that Proposition 187 already has sparked anger within the 
government of Mexico. Top Mexican officials sent a diplomatic note to the U.S. 
government protesting the initiative before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legal analysts described the ACLU arguments as strong but less certain to 
prevail in court than the cases filed against the school provisions. 
Chemerinsky said the U.S. Supreme Court has twice stopped states from enacting 
immigration regulations based on the argument that states cannot step into 
issues over which the federal government already has jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruled about 50 years ago that Pennsylvania was illegally preempting 
federal law by requiring illegal immigrants to register in the state, the USC 
law professor said. In 1982 the high court also declared unconstitutional an 
attempt by Maryland to deny resident illegal immigrants in-state college 
tuition, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are arguments to be made on both sides," Whittier Law School 
professor Mary Ellen Gale said. "The U.S. Supreme Court has taken a fairly 
strong view (in favor) of state rights." 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the right of California in 1983 
to pass a law prohibiting new nuclear power plants unless the electric company 
building them could show it had a safe means of disposal for nuclear waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government argued unsuccessfully that the state law was illegal 
because nuclear safety is the responsibility of the federal government. But the 
high court, Gale said, decided the state had not preempted the federal role 
because the law was aimed at economic concerns, not safety. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said the requirement of Proposition 187 that police investigate the 
immigration status of arrested suspects "probably would not be 
unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts said requirements that social workers report illegal immigrants 
to immigration authorities conflict with federal regulations aimed at 
protecting patient confidentiality in Medi-Cal programs and probably would be 
thrown out by the lower courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most illegal immigrants are not covered by Medi-Cal in non-emergency 
situations anyway, say officials. Lawyers fighting to derail the initiative 
contend that some immigrants without green cards are entitled to 
public-assisted health care under federal law but would not be under 
Proposition 187 -- grounds for striking down the health care provisions in the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lungren said: "People have to look at what our regulations are going to 
say. . . . There will be a serious attempt to have them drawn in a way that 
makes them consistent with the Constitution and current federal law." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren refused to say whether he thought the courts would uphold a section of 
Proposition 187 that opponents find the most troubling. It requires school 
districts to check the immigration status of students' parents and to report 
those without legal documents to authorities. That provision would take effect 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a public policy standpoint," said Lungren, who endorsed Proposition 187 
on the eve of the election, "that is the issue that gave me the most trouble in 
deciding whether to support it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chemerinsky said, however, that he doubted any regulation preventing illegal 
immigrants from attending public schools would be upheld by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the regulations can save some of the reporting provisions," he said. 
"Courts are often willing to allow laws to be narrowed if there is a way to 
save them. But it really has to be a situation . . . where the law is not so 
fatally flawed that it is clearly unconstitutional."

COLUMN ONE; SHANGHAI: SURPRISING RISING STAR; ONCE MISTRUSTED BY THE 
COMMUNISTS, THE CITY IS NOW THE ENVY OF CHINA. ITS ECONOMIC PROWESS HAS WON 
FAVOR WITH THE NATION'S LEADERS AND POLITICAL PLUMS, INCLUDING TOP JOBS FOR 
NATIVE SONS.

<P>
 Xu Kuangdi, Shanghai's urbane deputy mayor, likes to regale foreign guests 
with the story of a provincial official who recently visited this booming city 
on China's east coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic was, as usual, impossible. Thousands of Volkswagen sedans, 
produced here in China's largest auto factory, clogged narrow lanes designed a 
century ago for rickshaws. Dust from 4,000 construction sites clouded the air. 
Sulfurous emissions from factories added the scent of heavy industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the distance from Hong Qiao International Airport to Shanghai City 
Hall is a little more than 10 miles, it took the visiting official nearly two 
hours to cover the route. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of being irritated by the halting journey, the official, from 
impoverished Guizhou province, was ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope someday in my province we can have such a traffic problem," he told 
his apologetic host. In his provincial capital, the official informed Xu sadly, 
it takes only seven minutes to go from the airport to City Hall. There are too 
few automobiles and too few construction projects to block the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanghai, with an official population of 13 million people and an additional 2 
million construction workers imported from the provinces, may be polluted, 
dusty and choking in traffic. But today it is the envy of all China, emerging 
as the leading symbol of the country's incipient economic might and, 
increasingly, as a star player on the political stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Once mistrusted by the Communist leadership because of its colonial-era 
history as a treaty port where foreign powers engaged in the opium trade, 
Shanghai is back in vogue, even with the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
 President Jiang Zemin, the heir-apparent to ailing 90-year-old senior leader 
Deng Xiaoping, was once mayor of Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
 So was the country's powerful economic czar, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, two more Shanghai party officials, current Mayor Huang Ju and 
local party chief Wu Bangguo, were appointed to the 20-member Politburo of the 
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee -- raising to four the Shanghai 
representation on the country's most powerful ruling body. 
</P>
<P>
 In political commentaries, the catty Hong Kong newspapers began to talk of a 
"Shanghai gang" in the center of Chinese politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Officials from Shanghai now occupy one-fifth of the important Politburo 
posts," announced the newspaper Ming Pao. 
</P>
<P>
 South China Morning Post columnist Willy Wo-lap Lam, Hong Kong's leading 
pundit on Chinese politics, proclaimed it the "ascendancy of the Shanghai 
faction." 
</P>
<P>
 The appointments provoked jealousy in other cities, including the haughty 
capital, Beijing, where outside competition for preeminence is not appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a young politician wants to be a high-ranking official today," one Foreign 
Ministry employee in Beijing commented caustically, "he should move to 
Shanghai." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the key political appointments were at least partly a reward for the 
city's enormous contribution to the central treasury, which gets about 
one-fourth of its tax revenue from the Shanghai industrial base. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointments also reflected a concerted effort, initiated by Deng himself, 
to shift some of the economic spotlight away from southern Guangdong province, 
near Hong Kong, which is viewed by the Communist leadership as politically 
unstable. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1989, after the army crackdown on the Tian An Men Square 
pro-democracy demonstrators, more than 500,000 protesters took to the streets 
in Hong Kong. Anti-government sentiments were just as strong across the border, 
especially in the Pearl River metropolis Guangzhou (Canton). 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, most of the central government's financial commitment to the 
"special economic zones" was in the south, in Hainan Island and Guangdong 
provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they saw all those Hong Kong people in the streets," said a diplomat 
based in Shanghai, "I think the government suddenly realized that it had too 
many eggs in the south China basket, where things looked out of control. 
Meanwhile, there was Shanghai." 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1989 turmoil, Shanghai remained mostly peaceful. Then-Mayor Zhu 
Rongji went on radio after the army had cleared central Beijing of 
pro-democracy demonstrators, killing hundreds, perhaps thousands of them. He 
appealed for calm, offering students an enigmatic hope for redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be impetuous," he cautioned. "History will show who was right or 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanghai's relative tranquillity earned the gratitude of the rulers in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech published for the first time last year, Deng said "one of my 
biggest mistakes" was excluding Shanghai from the special economic zones set up 
in 1978 as part of his economic reform program. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanghai was belatedly added to the list in 1990. Since then, the central 
government has committed $40 billion, more than in any other city, to a public 
works program here. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shanghai, Deng's 1978 slight seems to have been long forgotten, if not 
forgiven. Xu, expected to be named the mayor when the National People's 
Congress meets next year, speaks with pride of his city's dizzying growth, 
comparing it to the rise of the great American cities in the late 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shanghai is much like the United States, I think," said Xu, slipping into the 
facile English he perfected as an engineer working in Sweden. "It is an 
emerging city. One hundred years ago, Shanghai had only a 30,000 population. 
Now it has more than 13 million." 
</P>
<P>
 With an engaging smile and salesman's enthusiasm, the balding Xu launched into 
a list of Shanghai's modern industrial milestones. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the modern industries started in Shanghai . . . the Long March Rocket 
(China's powerful satellite launching rocket) was designed and manufactured in 
Shanghai . . . the first Chinese wristwatch was a Shanghai watch . . . the 
first passenger car . . . the first big ship of 10,000 tons was made in 
Shanghai . . . the first submarine." 
</P>
<P>
 The key to Shanghai's success, Xu said, is its unique combination of "Chinese 
traditional culture and Western culture." Only 20 years ago, during the Great 
Proletarian Cultural Revolution, such talk would have been considered 
blasphemy. The ruling Maoists had rejected Western ways and launched campaigns 
to destroy outsiders' icons. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, Shanghai proudly celebrates itself as the most Western of 
Chinese cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Xu, 57, was interviewed in the reception room at City Hall. The stately 
building in the riverfront Bund district features marble Ionic columns and 
mosaic tile floors. It was once the main office of the Hong Kong & Shanghai 
Bank, bastion of British imperialist finance. 
</P>
<P>
 In a historic reversion that says much about the Chinese economic 
transformation, it was recently repurchased by the original owners, now based 
in Hong Kong, and will be reopened as the bank's Shanghai office. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the historic Shanghai Bund, in fact, is for sale. And the Communist 
municipal offices are moving to new buildings elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on the west bank of the Huangpu River, the Bund remains one of 
Shanghai's most vibrant and expensive areas. Nanjing Road, the glitzy shopping 
street that leads to the Bund, becomes a blaze of neon at nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 On a narrow street around the corner from City Hall is a karaoke bar catering 
to foreign tourists and a newly opened beer hall that brews its own boutique 
beer in copper kettles. One store features the latest in multimedia computers. 
Another offers handmade violins. 
</P>
<P>
 Given a choice, despite the inconvenience of getting there though the 
horrendous traffic, most Shanghai natives would choose to live in this exciting 
district if they could afford the skyrocketing rents. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard joke in Shanghai is "Better a bed in Puxi" -- the western bank of 
the Huangpu, including the Bund -- "than a house in Pudong," on the other side 
of the river. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pudong, formerly the vegetable garden for Shanghai, is where the municipal 
government has pinned its hopes for the future. To entice foreign investment 
and development, the government created a master development plan with wide 
roads and industrial parks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a flurry of infrastructure building, the Shanghai government has erected 
two of the world's largest steel cable bridges, two tunnels and a new subway 
line, all since 1985, to connect Pudong with the old city center. Twenty ferry 
boats also travel between Puxi and Pudong. 
</P>
<P>
 For the massive construction needed in Pudong, the city government imported 2 
million workers from interior provinces. The way in which Shanghai imported the 
labor is one of the city's main success stories and another reason it won the 
heart of the central government. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials traveled inland where they created companies to recruit 
construction workers on a limited contract basis. The workers were guaranteed 
housing and medical care and were issued "blue work cards" giving them 
permission to come to Shanghai for a limited time until their construction 
projects ended. 
</P>
<P>
 The "blue card" system helped Shanghai avoid the massive influx of migrant 
laborers that has plagued Beijing and Guangzhou. Beijing is estimated to have 
1.6 million such workers; Guangzhou, more than 2 million. But unlike Shanghai, 
neither city has a method of regulating the migrant population, which many fear 
will become the nucleus of social unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, more than $8 billion has been invested in Pudong, including in major 
projects by the American chemical giant DuPont and the Japanese electronics 
firm Sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the buildings in the Shanghai Lingqiao (Golden Bridge) Export 
Processing Zone in Pudong, a large-scale model is on display for senior 
officials and foreign guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The model, on a hydraulic pedestal surrounded by a stainless steel railing, 
shows Pudong as Shanghai officials dream it will become -- an ultramodern 
community with parks and villas next to pollution-free industrial parks. Tiny 
ducks swim in limpid blue ponds. 
</P>
<P>
 On the walls of the frigidly air-conditioned model room, decorated in subtle 
grays and blues, are pictures of China's senior leaders. The calligraphy of 
Deng himself ("Pudong Development Area Offers Great Hope") is on one wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, Pudong is still a dusty, polluted development zone bearing little 
similarity to the idealized model. But ever the optimist and consummate 
salesman for Shanghai, Xu advises visitors not to be put off by the dust and 
the grit.

 "Pudong is still under construction," the deputy mayor said. "Around 
construction it is always very dirty, with a lot of dust. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all," he said with a contagious smile, "if everything is very quiet and 
clean, it means it is not developed."

PACIFIC LEADERS PLEDGE FREE TRADE BY 2020 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of 18 Pacific Rim countries formally committed themselves Tuesday to 
dismantling all trade barriers within the next 25 years, but last-minute 
objections from two nations showed how fragile their alliance remains. 
</P>
<P>
 After a six-hour meeting at the opulent summer palace of Indonesian President 
Suharto, the leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum ended their 
summit by pledging that their industrialized members will drop all barriers by 
the year 2010 and that developing countries will do so by 2020. President 
Clinton, who last year began pushing the group toward such commitments, said 
the move should broaden trade and investment, bringing a harvest of benefits 
for all concerned, including average Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good news for the nations of our regions, and especially good news 
for the United States and our workers," said Clinton, who has made the creation 
of trade groups a major foreign policy objective. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement came on the sixth day of a nine-day Asia trip by Clinton that 
today brings a state visit with Suharto. Clinton has promised to raise the 
issue of Indonesia's poor human rights record at the session. Meanwhile, 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher will meet with Indonesia's Human Rights 
Commission, a government agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tuesday's trade agreement is broad and non-binding, the countries 
hope it will create momentum to hasten the trend toward free trade within a 
group that includes half the world's population and 40% of its trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts called it remarkable that such a diverse group of nations -- which 
includes the United States and Japan, Brunei, Mexico and China -- could even 
agree on common goals. 
</P>
<P>
 But complications raised by South Korea and Malaysia in this scrupulously 
scripted event suggested that the compact could rapidly become bogged down in 
questions about the schedule on which the barriers will come down and about who 
will qualify for special benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, South Korean officials were secretly pushing for a quicker 
elimination of trade barriers and for assurances that theirs would not be 
classified as a developed country. Suharto, host of the event and key advocate 
of the program, resolved the issue by putting off -- for now -- questions of 
which nations fall into which category. 
</P>
<P>
 But the questions are likely to resurface quickly in the months ahead as 
officials begin to develop a map for the nations' movement toward freer trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Tuesday, at a news conference in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin seemed to stake out his nation's position when he 
flatly declared, "China's the biggest developing country." 
</P>
<P>
 American officials, for their part, were arguing that the question was not 
vital because the rapid pace of development makes it impossible to know which 
nations should still be classified as developing in 15 years. So far, it is 
clear only that the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand 
will be considered developed. 
</P>
<P>
 More basic objections to the agreement were raised by Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohammed. He joined the declaration only after enumerating in the 
formal session what an Administration official said was a "series" of 
reservations about the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahathir, who fears that the group may become a tool for U.S. domination in 
the region, said he is worried about the ability of small countries to compete 
in such a program. He said he is also reluctant to commit future leaders of his 
country to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials acknowledged that Mahathir, who boycotted last year's 
meeting, may decide to drop out entirely next year. But with Malaysia 
accounting for only about 1% of the group's economic output, officials said 
Mahathir's withdrawal would not be a fatal setback. 
</P>
<P>
 Also surfacing before the plan's approval were questions about whether 
concessions to developing nations would make the pact a handy target for 
free-trade foes preparing to attack the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
the huge world trade proposal now before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Administration officials, and some outsiders, have argued that the Asian 
deal could make the Administration vulnerable to charges that it is giving away 
too many benefits to U.S. trading partners. Critics of the GATT agreement say 
the Administration is too easily surrendering national sovereignty in its 
provisions for new international trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been nervousness all over about this," said a senior Administration 
official. But the official said the Administration believes that Clinton can 
show the public that the system is fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and other officials made the case that both sides will be making 
concessions. Because they have further to go, this argument goes, developing 
nations will actually take bigger trade-liberalization steps than will 
industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton gave the example of auto import tariffs. They constitute 30% to 60% of 
a car's price in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, but only 2.5% in the 
United States. Thus, while the developing countries will have longer to bring 
their barriers down, those barriers have farther to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "No country will get more in benefits than it gives," Clinton said. "No free 
riders." 
</P>
<P>
 Suharto had prepared carefully to make the APEC summit a public relations 
coup, even going so far as to have a celebrated Indonesian designer of batik 
garments tailor open-collared shirts for each leader attending.  
</P>
<P>
 This morning, Clinton arrived at the Istana Merkada Palace for a state visit 
with Suharto and a day of other meetings that may test how well Clinton can 
balance human rights concerns with his desire to create stronger commercial 
ties with Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 After an arrival ceremony at the palace, Clinton met Suharto to discuss trade 
and security concerns, and to lay out his views about Indonesia treatment of 
minorities, organized labor and the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Clinton was to talk to an audience of business people about U.S. 
concerns, including human rights, as Secretary of State Warren Christopher met 
with the government human rights commission and other U.S. officials talked to 
local human rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of APEC are the United States, Canada, Mexico, Chile, Thailand, 
Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, Australia, New 
Zealand, South Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Papua New Guinea. At 
China's insistence, Taiwan was represented here only by a trade official.

37.5% DECLINE IN DEATHS CREDITED TO HELMET LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its first year, the California motorcycle helmet law produced a 37.5% drop 
in fatalities from motorcycle collisions and saved as many as 122 lives, 
according to UCLA researchers who have conducted what they termed the 
"definitive" study of motorcycle safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonfatal head injuries also decreased significantly after implementation of 
the law in January, 1992, and there were sharp declines in the time injured 
motorcyclists spent in intensive care units and in the hospital after nonfatal 
accidents, the UCLA team reports today in the Journal of the American Medical 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorcyclists who did not wear helmets suffered a disproportionate share of 
injuries: Although fewer than 0.5% of motorcyclists did not wear helmets, they 
accounted for 15% of deaths and serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 law "clearly had a very strong impact" on public safety, said UCLA 
epidemiologist David L. McArthur. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is it saves all of us a lot of money when you prevent someone 
from dying or becoming a paraplegic and ending up on the state rolls for 
assistance," said Ray Biancolana, deputy director of the state Office of 
Traffic Safety. "We're pleased that the law has such a positive effect." 
</P>
<P>
 But anti-helmet motorcyclists contend that there are other factors responsible 
for the decline in deaths, especially aggressive licensing and rider education 
programs. "That is not reflected in the medical studies," said Larry Alger, 
marketing director of Bikers Against Manslaughter. "The important thing is not 
to crash in the first place, and that stems from proper education and 
licensing." 
</P>
<P>
 Biancolana, however, noted that the education and licensing programs were 
initiated in the 1980s. Such programs are responsible for the ongoing decline 
in motorcycle fatalities, he said, but an additional, sharp drop in deaths 
occurred after the helmet law went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers found that there were 523 fatalities in 1991, compared to 327 
in 1992, a drop of 37.5%. Using two different techniques to predict the number 
of deaths that would have occurred in 1992 without a helmet law, they concluded 
that 92 to 122 lives had been saved by the law. The proportion of helmet use 
increased from 43% of motorcyclists in 1991 to 99.5% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatality rate dropped from 70.1 deaths per 100,000 motorcycles in 1991 to 
51.5 per 100,000 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the deaths were among motorcycle drivers, but the study also found 
that the number of motorcycle passenger deaths dropped, from 66 in 1991 to 20 
in 1992, a 69% decrease. Some of that decrease, however, resulted from the fact 
that there were fewer passengers in 1992, although the actual numbers have not 
yet been determined, said UCLA's Corinne Peek, co-author of the study with 
McArthur and Jess F. Kraus of UCLA and Alan Williams of the Institute for 
Highway Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Among riders injured but not fatally, the average number of days spent in the 
hospital decreased by more than one day, the average number of days spent in 
intensive care decreased by 21.4% and the total number of surgical procedures 
decreased by 13%. 
</P>
<P>
 In large part because of the California study, the American Medical Assn.'s 
Council on Scientific Affairs issued a new report in today's journal calling 
for adoption of nationwide mandatory helmet laws for motorcyclists and 
bicyclists. The report also calls for the medical association to draft 
prototype laws and to work for better education and licensing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The California results play a significant role in promoting the council's 
support for the recommendations, said council member Dr. Mitchell S. Karlan, a 
cancer surgeon in Beverly Hills. The helmet laws and the rider education, he 
said, "are good public health and good preventive medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 By the beginning of this year, 23 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto 
Rico had laws mandating helmet use for all motorcyclists. Twenty-four other 
states had partial laws, most requiring use by riders under age 18. Three 
states, Colorado, Illinois and Iowa, had no helmet laws. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the most recent figures from the federal Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, 9,913 people died in motorcycle crashes in the United 
States from 1989 through 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Several studies in other states have shown reductions in motorcycle deaths 
resulting from helmet laws, but many of those studies involved relatively small 
populations, which limited their statistical validity, Peek said. 
</P>
<P>
 California, in contrast, has large numbers of motorcycles, which can be ridden 
year-round, making it ideal as the site for such a study, McArthur said. 
Moreover, in anticipation of the law's passage, the UCLA group was able to 
begin collecting data in January, 1991, a year before the law took effect. 
Because the data was gathered prospectively, Peek said, the numbers are 
considered more reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new data is combined with that of previous studies, she said, it is 
clear that "motorcycle helmet laws greatly increase helmet use, they definitely 
save lives and they prevent injuries." Saving Lives 
</P>
<P>
 Although deaths from motorcycle accidents have been declining for years, a new 
UCLA study shows that the 1992 motorcycle helmet law reduced deaths that year 
by 37.5%

NEWS ANALYSIS; FED'S ACTION WON'T DERAIL STATE RECOVERY, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hike Tuesday will put a crimp 
in the pocketbooks of millions of Californians but is unlikely to abort the 
state's modest economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 California businesses in such fast-growing industries as computer services are 
expected to continue investing and adding jobs, despite the rate increase, 
economists said. Higher rates also will help consumers who earn income from 
certificates of deposit and other fixed-rate investments. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, because California's recession was worse than the nation's, and 
the state has been slower to recover, California still has more room to grow, 
even with higher rates, some economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 And while this was the Fed's sixth rate increase this year, rates still remain 
low by historical standards at this stage of an economic recovery, said Gary 
Schlossberg, senior economist at Wells Fargo Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could probably absorb another percentage-point (increase) or two before 
the economy turns tail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This rise in interest rates . . . is not sufficient to derail the recovery in 
California," said John O. Wilson, chief economist at Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 But the central bank's action Tuesday nonetheless will hurt many consumers and 
businesses because banks and other lenders will respond by raising their own 
lending costs. 
</P>
<P>
 That means borrowers can look for another round of increases on a variety of 
loans, ranging from home mortgages to auto loans to corporate credit. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some major banks, such as First Interstate Bank of California, 
immediately followed the Fed's move by raising their prime lending rates to 
8.5% from 7.75%. The prime is the base upon which many consumer loans, such as 
home equity and auto loans, are tied. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's action also could push conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, 
currently about 9%, closer to 10%, a double-digit level not seen in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many fixed-rate mortgages are tied to market rates on long-term 
Treasury securities, their cost "has to do now with the bond market's reaction" 
to the Fed's steps, said mortgage broker Bob Sheets, owner of Golden West 
Mortgage Co. in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, at least, the bond market applauded the Fed, and the rate on the 
bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell to 8.03% from 8.07% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 And the mortgage market itself showed little change, because many lenders had 
raised their rates over the past few weeks in anticipation of the Fed's move. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage News Co. in Santa Ana, which tracks the rates of about 100 Southland 
lenders, said the average fixed rate on 30-year loans was 9.20% Tuesday, 
virtually unchanged from Monday but up from 8.86% just last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also expect higher adjustable-rate mortgages, which typically start 
three to four points below fixed-rate loans for at least a few months. That, 
too, would take cash out of homeowners' pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where the higher (rates in) adjustable mortgages begin to bite," 
Schlossberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate increases could particularly hurt first-time home buyers, who this 
year have been a key force in the real estate market's sluggish rebound, said 
Connie Leyba, an agent at the real estate firm Keeler Dilbeck in South 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that the higher rates crowd out a certain number of first-time 
buyers by leaving them unable to afford a mortgage's monthly payments, even if 
they hope to use an adjustable-rate mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Realtor Ken Lowman of ERA Dahler Realty in Rancho Cucamonga, who has about a 
dozen sales pending, said many of his clients called him Tuesday about the 
Fed's announcement but that few were panicking. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many real estate agents, Lowman has been advising his buyers to lock in 
their mortgage rate as soon they turn in a loan application, to protect 
themselves if rates move higher before they close escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing some hand-holding, mostly with first-time buyers, but the 
majority of my clients aren't worried about rates going higher," Lowman said. 
"They already locked in their rate, so they don't have to worry about what will 
happen next." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Fed's rate hike might cost consumers and businesses more, it 
won't be enough to snuff out the state's year-old climb out of the severe 
recession of the early 1990s, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Business spending on expansion and new equipment, not consumer spending, is 
perhaps the driving force of California's recovery now, because it is 
generating job growth in such areas as computer services, health care and 
entertainment, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 And business owners are making those investments because they see California's 
economy expanding further over the next year or two in spite of the rise in 
interest rates, said John Hekman, vice president of Economic Analysis Corp., a 
research firm in Los Angeles.

CLINTON SIGNALS WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER SCHOOL PRAYER; CONGRESS: HE SAYS HE 
SUPPORTS VOLUNTARY CONCEPT. PANETTA INDICATES AREAS OF ACCORD, CONFLICT WITH 
GOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL and MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton signaled Tuesday that he might be able to reach agreement 
with the new Republican congressional majority on school prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be glad to discuss it with them," the President said at a press 
conference at an economic conference in Jakarta, Indonesia. "I want to see what 
the details (of a school prayer proposal) are. I certainly wouldn't rule it 
out. It depends on what it says." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta indicated further 
agreement with GOP leaders, saying that trade and congressional reform are two 
issues that the two sides can agree on. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging from the first post-election meeting between an Administration 
official and the new Republican leadership, Panetta rejected proposed 
Republican tax cuts, however, saying that they would swell the federal deficit 
and weaken what has been a strengthening economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always supported voluntary prayer in the schools," Clinton said in 
Jakarta. "I have always thought that the question was when does voluntary 
prayer really become coercive to people who have different religious views from 
those who are in the majority in any particular classroom. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I want to reserve judgment, I want to see the specifics. . . . And 
again, I would say this ought to be something that unites the American people, 
not something that divides us. . . . The American people do not want us to be 
partisan, but they do want us to proceed in a way that is consistent with their 
values and that communicates those values to our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta made an hourlong "courtesy call" on Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who is 
expected to be Speaker of the House in the next Congress, and Sen. Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.), who is expected to be Senate majority leader, at Dole's Capitol Hill 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 After the session, Panetta said that if the Republicans are serious about 
balancing the federal budget in five years, their proposed tax cuts and 
increased defense spending would require cutting a trillion dollars from the 
federal government at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever the outcome of the election, we all have a responsibility of helping 
to move this country forward," Panetta said. "We have to be very straight with 
the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Dole nor Gingrich commented after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Alice Rivlin, director of the White House Office of Management and 
Budget, told reporters at a breakfast meeting that the proposed Republican tax 
cuts, if enacted, would swell inflation, ignite interest rates and "probably 
throw the economy into recession." 
</P>
<P>
 The likely new chairman of the House Budget Committee, Rep. John R. Kasich 
(R-Ohio), accused her of "alarmist and inflammatory" rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta called the congressional vote scheduled for later this month on a new 
world trade agreement "the first test of the relationship" between the 
Democratic Administration and the new Republican majority in Congress -- 
although that majority will not be seated until January.  
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich and other GOP leaders have generally indicated that they will support 
the trade agreement in the lame-duck session. But Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), 
the likely new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, signaled his 
intention to delay consideration of the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the President, Helms threatened to make trouble later on 
foreign policy matters unless Clinton agrees to put off the trade vote until 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms' letter said: "I can assure that it will have an exceedingly positive 
effect on my making certain that the Administration positions on all foreign 
policy matters during the 104th Congress will be considered fully and fairly." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta said that there are other reforms that the Clinton Administration and 
the Republican leadership agree on, including lobbying reform, campaign finance 
reform, welfare reform, health care reform and the line-item veto. Referring 
obliquely to the Helms threat, he added that foreign affairs is an area where 
it is "extremely important" that Congress and the White House work together. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that he praised Gingrich for his promise to cut House committee 
staffs by one-third and noted that the Clinton Administration had cut the White 
House staff by 25% and the executive branch by some 270,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But on economic policy, Panetta declared: "As the President has made clear . . 
. the important thing is that (tax cuts) are paid for, and that they not 
increase the deficit. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a very fundamental discipline that we have put in place in the budget 
process here on Capitol Hill and throughout the government," he said, and if 
tax cuts are not matched with spending cuts, "you are simply increasing taxes 
on our kids for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 In their "contract with America," House Republicans have promised what they 
call a middle-class tax cut, including a repeal of the so-called "marriage 
tax," a tax credit to families making up to $200,000 per year for each child 
they have, and broader eligibility for individual retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Republicans, including the probable new chairman of the House Ways and 
Means Committee, Bill Archer (R-Tex.), have proposed cutting capital gains 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever we do is going to be paid for by spending cuts," Archer said in an 
interview on "The McNeil/Lehrer NewsHour." He suggested that $50 billion could 
be saved over five years in welfare reform alone. "This is tough, but the 
American people are prepared for us to be tough."

 SOWING THE CROPS: The amount of agricultural land in the U.S. declined from 
about 965 million acres in 1987 to 946 million acres in 1992, according to a 
new U.S. census report. . . . During that same period, the acreage of crops 
harvested rose from 282 million to 296 million. . . . In Ventura County, more 
than 500 farms had annual sales of $100,000 or more. The number of residents 
earning their full-time living from the farms they own was 947, while 1,248 
farm owners had income from other jobs.

<P>
 ALL WORK, NO PLAY: As college fees skyrocket, working students say they're 
struggling more than ever just to stay in school (Life & Style, Page E1). . . . 
For many, activities beyond the classroom are out of the question. In Ventura 
County, the money crunch was probably a factor last spring when Chi-Young Choe 
was appointed student trustee to the board of the community college district 
after no one else came forward. Too many students work and can't make the time 
commitment, Choe said. "Unfortunately, often what it comes down to is that 
paycheck."

 LEGAL LIMBO: Parts of Proposition 187 may be tied up in the courts for years 
-- and may be decided only after state or U.S. Supreme Court rulings on the 
measure's legality, legal experts say (A1). . . . Meanwhile, Ventura County 
officials have decided -- at least for now -- to continue to provide public 
services to illegal immigrants.(B1) 
</P>
<P>
 NEW WING: The issue of Proposition 187 has turned up as a factor in the 
proposed $51-million expansion of Ventura County Medical Center (B1). . . . 
Critics of the expansion say the extra space may not be needed if illegal 
immigrants are denied medical care. . . . The issue came up during the 
expansion in Saticoy of Clinicas del Camino Real, which provides health care to 
low-income residents. Said Executive Director Robert S. Juarez: "It's going to 
be an issue in any health-care expansion project." Bountiful Harvest

GOP MAVERICK MAY HOLD KEY TO SPEAKERSHIP; CAPITOL: PAUL HORCHER, WHO HAS OFTEN 
CLASHED WITH REPUBLICAN ASSEMBLY LEADER JIM BRULTE AND OTHERS IN THE PARTY, 
COULD CONTROL 41ST VOTE NEEDED TO WREST JOB FROM WILLIE BROWN. 
</P>

<P>
 In the wake of last week's election, a little-known Republican lawmaker, who 
repeatedly has clashed with his GOP colleagues, could very well hold the 
balance of power in the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 With thousands of absentee ballots still to be counted from the Nov. 8 
election, Republicans will likely either hold a razor-thin edge in the Assembly 
or will be deadlocked 40-40 with Democrats when the newly elected members 
convene next month in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 But maverick Republican Paul Horcher of Diamond Bar, an outcast in his own GOP 
caucus, could deny GOP Assembly Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga the 
speakership and allow Speaker Willie Brown to extend his record 14-year reign, 
or, in the event of a stalemate, make a run at the job himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm assessing my Republican support," Horcher said this week, seeking to 
rally backing, especially among moderate lawmakers. "I would like to be a 
viable alternative to Mr. Brulte. I'm not an extremist." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Horcher, who is of German ancestry and whose wife is from 
Vietnam, called himself a mainstream Republican and maintained he represents 
"everyone, not just people who look like me." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) describes the unfolding events in 
the Capitol as a drama because Horcher and Brulte have been at odds. Now, he 
said, the Republican leader must woo his nemesis. "Brulte's whole future is in 
his (Horcher's) hands. It's a damn nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Perry, Brulte's spokesman, sounded a conciliatory note toward Horcher. 
Saying Horcher generally sides with the GOP, Perry added, "We think that with 
the (GOP) caucus in control, Paul can do even more for his district." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the first time the tousle-haired, 40-year-old attorney has been 
embroiled in a nasty legislative or political scuffle with his position crucial 
to the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Horcher was among a handful of Republicans who rose to support 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and vote for a $56.4-billion state budget that had 
been stalled in negotiations. Horcher actually cast the 54th and deciding vote 
after Wilson implored him to "please do the right thing." Afterward, Horcher 
said that even though he considered himself a fiscal conservative he "wasn't 
going to let the governor be humiliated." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in 1993, Republican lawmakers berated Horcher for what they perceived as 
an act of betrayal: accepting an appointment from Speaker Brown to a key budget 
committee after Brown had rejected Brulte's suggestion of another Republican 
for the job. At the time, Brulte said Horcher "should not have accepted the 
appointment" to the vice chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 With the post came additional staff and an office, but Horcher said the 
trappings had nothing to do with his decision. "I'm a public servant, not a 
prima donna," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiffs with other Republicans continued throughout 1993. Horcher cited an 
unsuccessful effort at the state Republican Party convention that year to 
censure him for accepting the Ways and Means position. 
</P>
<P>
 "At best," says Assemblyman Phil Isenberg (D-Sacramento), Republicans "were 
dismissive and disdainful of Horcher. And Paul is a proud guy." 
</P>
<P>
 "If they aren't regretting it, they should," said Isenberg, recalling "how 
bitterly personal they were in attacks on him." Isenberg is chairman of the 
Assembly Judiciary Committee that includes Horcher. 
</P>
<P>
 This certainly isn't the first time Horcher has faced tough situations. In 
1979, he was working in Iran overseeing refinery construction contracts for 
Fluor Corp. He said he was forced to quickly flee in the wake of the hostage 
crisis at the American Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a decision," Horcher said, "never to be frightened again." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Texas, he graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with a bachelor's degree 
in political science and attended La Verne University College of Law before 
passing the State Bar in 1978. He and his wife, Van Le, have two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher served on the Diamond Bar City Council before his 1990 election to the 
Assembly, succeeding Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), who had won a special 
Senate election. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Horcher has been known as a pragmatist and something of an 
anomaly. Horcher's biggest campaign contributor the past two years has been the 
typically Democratic-leaning California Trial Lawyers Assn., which has given 
him about $11,500, according to Legi-Tech, a computerized information service. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one of Horcher's biggest battles of the past legislative session was 
on behalf of the trial lawyers. He carried legislation restricting false or 
misleading TV commercials by personal injury attorneys. A compromise version 
was signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher bucked the Republican Establishment earlier this year when he ran in a 
special state Senate contest and lost to fellow GOP colleague and veteran 
conservative Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Monrovia). 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Horcher will emerge as a candidate for Speaker -- considered the 
second most powerful job in state government -- remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher won't comment on whom he might support for Speaker or even whether he 
might switch parties. But he did say he might vote for himself as Speaker, a 
prospect that could leave Republicans short of the 41 votes needed to elect a 
new Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Curtis Tucker (D-Inglewood) doubts that Horcher would bolt his 
fellow Republicans, however tenuous the relationship may be. "Would you want to 
be the one Republican in the world" who denies the GOP the speakership after a 
quarter of a century?" Tucker asked.

BELL RINGER, MISSION'S LINK WITH PAST, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Arbiso, who was known as the living embodiment of historic San Juan 
Capistrano, died in his sleep Monday at the age of 99. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbiso was internationally known as the bell ringer who welcomed the swallows 
home every year on Swallows Day -- a job he performed for more than 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As the city's patriarch since 1952, he was a connection with San Juan 
Capistrano's rich frontier history, someone who could remember life before 
automobiles, freeways and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was our living link with the past," said Mary Tryon, a spokeswoman for the 
San Juan Capistrano Historical Society. "He was born before the turn of the 
century and lived here all his life. Paul was the one person who remembered the 
mission before all the restoration work started." 
</P>
<P>
 The Juaneno Indian's long life centered on Mission San Juan. He played in its 
dusty stables as a child and got his first job there in 1908. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he became head gardener for the mission's rose gardens, a job that 
would remain his passion even after retirement at the age of 93.  
</P>
<P>
 As bell ringer, Arbiso would pull the thick ropes of the mission's giant iron 
bells to announce a death or the birth of a new life in town. But his fame came 
March 19 every year, when media from around the world would assemble to watch 
for the fabled return of the swallows. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Arbiso's job to ring the mission bells to symbolize the sighting of the 
first swallow of spring. He took the job seriously, but couldn't help but poke 
fun at the inevitable reporter who didn't know the return of the swallows was 
mostly myth. 
</P>
<P>
 "When do you think the first swallow will come?" he was asked one year by a 
journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, probably right after Mass," Arbiso replied, meaning that the first 
swallow would make an appearance only after he left church and could sound the 
bells. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbiso conceded little to the passing years. Until becoming ill in recent 
weeks, he was a familiar sight downtown, walking to Sunday Mass at the mission 
or visiting friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had a doubt that he would make 100," said his daughter, Alice 
Gastelum. "We were going to have a big blowout. But he died a beautiful death, 
just going to sleep comfortably while we watched."

COASTAL COMMISSION CHIEF GWYN RESIGNS; DEVELOPMENT: THE WILLIE BROWN 
APPOINTEE'S DEPARTURE MARKS FIRST IN A SERIES OF MEMBERSHIP CHANGES ON 
PROTECTIVE AGENCY. NEW LEADER MAY BE NAMED TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After serving 4 1/2 years, California Coastal Commission Chairman Thomas W. 
Gwyn resigned Tuesday -- the first in a series of membership changes that will 
substantially alter the makeup of the powerful agency that oversees development 
along the state's 1,100-mile coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwyn, an appointee of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), said 
during a break at his last commission meeting that he is stepping down because 
of new responsibilities as communications director for the Port of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 His departure leaves in doubt who will head the 12-member panel that meets 
monthly to decide the fate of issues involving development or protection of the 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is scheduled to consider the election of a new chairman and 
vice chairman this morning. A spokeswoman for Brown said a replacement for Gwyn 
will be announced today.  
</P>
<P>
 Gwyn, who was elected chairman in February, 1990, at his first commission 
meeting, declined to predict who will be his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the balance of power in the Assembly still uncertain after last 
week's election apparently erased Democratic control of the lower house, 
Brown's latest appointment could be short-lived. The Speaker names four of the 
coastal commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of what happens in Sacramento, the panel will see a number of new 
faces. In addition to Gwyn, at least three other commissioners -- Huntington 
Beach Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson, Port Hueneme City Councilman and veteran 
coastal Commissioner Dorill B. Wright and San Diego County Supervisor Leon 
Williams -- will be stepping down after retiring or losing elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember another time when there (was) so much turnover on the 
commission," said Commissioner Madelyn Glickfeld of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Gwyn expressed concern that the strong Republican showing in 
the election might weaken the commission's commitment to coastal protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The 53-year-old chairman said he believes the commission has been responsible 
in trying to balance development. He said the commission, created by voters in 
1972, discourages egregious development projects from even being proposed. Yet, 
it is difficult to know how to assess the condition of the coast today, Gwyn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at the differences between Northern and Southern California. There is 
a lot more development in the south," he said. "The community appears to have 
accepted a greater degree of development in the south. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "In the north, the culture is much more protective of the natural resources." 
</P>
<P>
 Gwyn predicted that the state's continuing population growth "is going to put 
pressure on both the natural and man-made resources of the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back on his tenure, Gwyn said, "it was a sad day" for the agency when 
former Commissioner Mark L. Nathanson pleaded guilty last year to soliciting 
almost $1 million in bribes from property owners and Hollywood figures with 
business before the commission. Nathanson is serving a federal prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwyn said he feels sorry for Nathanson, whom he considers a friend and someone 
who helped engineer "my election as chairman."

S.F. PAPERS SLOWLY RETURN TO NORMAL; STRIKE: PRODUCTION FACILITIES ARE 
RESTARTED. UNION SPOKESMAN URGES EMPLOYEES TO 'LET GO OF THE ANGER.'

 The 12-day strike at the city's two daily newspapers is over but operations 
were so crippled that the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Francisco 
Examiner are only slowly recovering. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chronicle, printing a Tuesday edition so thin that it was barely enough to 
swat a fly, apologized to readers, saying that production facilities were 
damaged and delivery systems were disrupted by the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to start the thing back up," said Jim Hale, president of the San 
Francisco Newspaper Agency, which prints and delivers both papers under a joint 
operating agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said one of the agency's three printing plants was put out of commission 
when striking workers contaminated tanks of ink with human urine. By Tuesday, 
he said, the tanks had been drained and the contamination had been cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper agency was gradually calling back its printers, advertising 
staff and other workers and planned to resume full operations within a week. As 
a result, both papers were able to print only the slimmed-down editions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Examiner, printing one daily edition instead of its usual four, was 
gradually bringing its 215 workers back. By the end of the day had called in 
fewer than half. The Chronicle, however, called back all its employees Monday 
in hopes of bringing about reconciliation more quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have been through a painful period," Chronicle Managing Editor Dan 
Rosenheim said. "Events like this strike create wounds, but I am very hopeful 
we will quickly get beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
 During the strike, there were scattered reports of violence and Kent Wilson, a 
striking driver, was electrocuted while allegedly tampering with a power line 
at a distribution center for the papers.  
</P>
<P>
 Members of the eight newspaper unions believe they were the victors in the 
walkout, winning a 3% raise over three years and preventing proposed staff 
cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning their strike strategy months in advance, the unions succeeded in 
disrupting the paper's normal operations by getting longshoremen not to unload 
newsprint at the docks, persuading businesses not to advertise and convincing 
some carriers not to deliver papers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the strike ended Monday, management and workers alike were hoping to 
rebuild the papers quickly, expanding the 32-page editions both papers printed 
Tuesday to 64 pages or more by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling everyone to try to let go of the anger," said Carl Hall, a 
reporter and spokesman for the Newspaper Guild, the union representing 
editorial employees. "We want everything to get fixed, the plants as well as 
the relationships, as fast as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he said, the strikers will not quickly forget who supported them 
and who did not. Inside the Chronicle building, he noted, there is a coffee 
shop and a barber shop. The barber honored the picket lines; the owner of the 
coffee shop went to work and served food to strikebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's going to have a very easy time selling coffee," Hall said. 
"But I think Joe the barber is going to have patrons lined up outside his 
door." 
</P>
<P>
 Herb Caen, the legendary 78-year-old Chronicle columnist who walked the picket 
line with his fellow strikers, reappeared in the paper Tuesday. He noted that 
the only other times he had missed a deadline were during World War II and 
during a 52-day newspaper strike in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are back where we belong: on your doorstep, playing our small but 
hopefully important role in your busy lives," he wrote. ". . . Especially in a 
smallish city like this one, people need and want a newspaper and 'feel lost 
without it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, readers around the Bay Area welcomed back their newspapers -- even the 
abbreviated editions that were delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted to have the strike over and the paper back to almost normal 
thickness," said recycling company executive Jerry Lucey. "As a San Franciscan, 
I think it's important to read the San Francisco Chronicle -- good or bad."

PROSECUTOR LINKS RULING PARTY TO MEXICAN ASSASSINATION; INVESTIGATION: TOP PRI 
OFFICIALS ARE ACCUSED OF TRYING TO BLOCK PROBE INTO SEPTEMBER KILLING OF THEIR 
SECRETARY GENERAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The chief prosecutor investigating a web of political intrigue behind the 
September assassination of Mexico's second-ranking ruling party official 
heightened the drama Tuesday, linking the killing directly to the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party and publicly accusing the party's top two bosses of trying 
to block the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Sending new shock waves across Mexico's already turbulent political landscape, 
Deputy Atty. Gen. Mario Ruiz Massieu charged that the ruling party's president, 
Ignacio Pichardo, and its new secretary general, Maria de los Angeles Moreno, 
"were more concerned with trying to defend the criminals than trying to solve 
the case of their (slain) secretary general." 
</P>
<P>
 He offered few specifics to back up the charge, but the prosecutor said he is 
convinced that the Sept. 28 murder of party Secretary General Francisco Ruiz 
Massieu was engineered by key members of the PRI, as the ruling party is known. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Ruiz Massieu is the brother of the slain secretary general, who was 
gunned down outside a downtown Mexico City hotel after a breakfast meeting, and 
the veteran prosecutor's investigation has uncovered what he has characterized 
as a broad conspiracy reaching higher into the ruling party with each new 
witness's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, though, it was clear that the prosecutor -- a ruling party member 
in good standing before he took on the probe into his brother's death -- had 
struck at the heart of the political force that has ruled Mexico for the last 
65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that the country has not had a murder with such important 
political characteristics, in which it was so totally clear, in my view, that 
it involved people of the PRI," he declared in a late-night television 
interview that ignited the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the program aired, the ruling party issued an urgent six-point 
statement rejecting the allegations as "without foundation." The statement, 
signed by party President Pichardo, declared the party's "total support for 
expediting the investigation . . . and its commitment to cooperate."  
</P>
<P>
 But Pichardo, in deflecting Ruiz Massieu's charges that he was stonewalling 
the probe, criticized the prosecutor for leveling the accusations outside the 
legal process. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate communique issued after Ruiz Massieu's charges were aired on the 
private network Television Azteca late Monday night and published nationwide 
Tuesday, the PRI's Commission on Honor and Justice announced that it had taken 
action on an allegation Ruiz Massieu made in the case more than a month ago -- 
a delay the prosecutor cited on the program as one indication that the party 
had been uncooperative at best. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission declared in its statement that it had decided -- apparently 
after weeks of deliberation -- to recommend the expulsion from the party of 
renegade PRI legislator Manuel Munoz Rocha. He has eluded a national and 
international police hunt since Ruiz Massieu, acting on testimony from more 
than a dozen suspects in the case, named the legislator as one of the chief 
architects of his brother's killing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the party made no comment on Ruiz Massieu's additional speculation in the 
television interview that Munoz Rocha may be a link between his brother's 
slaying and the assassination in March of PRI presidential candidate Luis 
Donaldo Colosio -- potentially an even more explosive allegation. The 
prosecutor said the legislator was in charge of Colosio's national campaign 
events, including public rallies such as the one in Tijuana where Colosio was 
gunned down. The investigation into that assassination is also continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the ruling party's damage-control efforts, the developments in the 
probe into Mexico's second major political assassination in six months could 
not have come at a worse time for Mexico's president-elect, Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo is in the midst of a campaign to reinforce election pledges of 
ruling-party reform, which he launched a week ago after he was confirmed as 
president-elect during a 17-hour legislative debate certifying the results of 
the Aug. 21 elections. The polls gave Zedillo just over 50% of the vote, the 
lowest plurality in ruling party history, and most analysts question his 
ability to reform the party with so small a mandate.

ISRAEL GIVES PALESTINIANS MORE CONTROL, WANTS BETTER SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel turned over more civil authority to the Palestinians on Tuesday in West 
Bank ceremonies but continued to caution that the full transfer of authority 
may be slowed by security concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 As Israeli army officers formally relinquished control of social welfare 
programs and tourism to Palestinian officials in Ramallah and Bethlehem, 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin toured military bases in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin also visited the spot where a Palestinian follower of the militant 
Islamic Jihad movement on Friday pedaled an explosives-laden bicycle into an 
Israeli checkpoint on Gaza's main north-south highway, blowing himself up along 
with three Israeli reserve army officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect a more serious effort from the Palestinian Authority than we have 
seen thus far," Rabin said. "Continued terrorism by extreme Islamic groups, 
Hamas and Islamic Jihad, if it continues, can put a question mark over the 
basis of the agreement between us." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin toured the military sites hours before leaving for a visit to the United 
States, where he hopes to ensure the continuation of U.S. aid for Israel. 
Israeli officials have been alarmed by reports from Washington that the new 
Republican majority in Congress may move to slash Israel's $1.2 billion in 
annual civilian aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister angered residents at the Jewish settler community of 
Netzarim -- an isolated outpost close to Gaza City -- by refusing to enter the 
settlement, which he has labeled a burden on security forces. He talked to 
settlers outside the gates of their community. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also sent a message to the Palestinians, insisting that "the 
settlements will remain in place" during the five-year interim of limited 
Palestinian self-rule in the territories, before the final status of the West 
Bank and Gaza is determined. Several Israeli Cabinet ministers have, in recent 
days, said that both Netzarim and dozens of isolated Jewish settlements in the 
West Bank will eventually have to be relocated away from Palestinian 
communities to ensure the settlers' safety. 
</P>
<P>
 But there appears to be unanimity among members of the left-leaning Cabinet 
that no such relocations should occur now. "That would be giving in to 
terrorism," said Education Minister Amnon Rubinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians on Tuesday also celebrated their Independence Day -- marking the 
day six years ago when the Palestine National Council, meeting in Algeria, 
declared an independent state of Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was once a dream has today become a reality. We are in our homeland," 
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat told a rally of an estimated 7,000 people in Gaza 
City. In the West Bank, celebrations were mostly low-key, with schoolchildren 
marking the occasion by singing the Palestinian anthem and saluting the 
Palestinian flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians in the West Bank say that they have yet to see real benefits from 
the peace framework that Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization 
signed more than a year ago. Palestinian self-rule exists in Gaza and in the 
West Bank town of Jericho, and Israeli soldiers have largely pulled out of 
those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Israeli military presence in the West Bank remains a reality of daily 
life. Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians on Israeli redeployment 
out of much of the West Bank, and the hand-over of responsibility for security 
there to the Palestinians, are proceeding slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials worry that the Palestinian won't be able to ensure the 
safety of some 140,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank.

THE JUDICIARY; CLINTON'S BIG BENCH: JUDGES OF ALL STRIPES AND COLORS APPOINTED; 
BLACKS, LATINOS, WOMEN, EVEN REPUBLICANS FILL FEDERAL VACANCIES. IT IS THE MOST 
DIVERSE GROUP NAMED BY ANY PRESIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are a Baltimore prosecutor whose husband was appointed to the federal 
bench by Ronald Reagan, a renowned civil rights lawyer here who is legally 
blind, a veteran prosecutor who became the highest ranking African American in 
the Los Angeles district attorney's office, a Latino activist in Chicago who 
worked as a U.S. attorney and a Vermont Republican who was first chosen for the 
bench by George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 The five are among 129 new judges that President Clinton has appointed to the 
federal courts during his first two years. The Clinton judges make up the most 
diverse group of presidential appointments ever. Women and minorities account 
for 58% of the total. African Americans are nearly one-fourth. Nine percent are 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 But the range of backgrounds does not stop there. A few are Republicans. One 
is outspoken against abortion. Most have practical experience as prosecutors, 
state judges or corporate attorneys -- or in some instances, all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 And best of all, say academic experts who track the judiciary, the Clinton 
Administration has not sacrificed quality for diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are highly qualified appointees, better on average than those of 
Reagan, Bush or (Jimmy) Carter," said Sheldon Goldman, a University of 
Massachusetts political scientist who monitors selection of judges. 
</P>
<P>
 He cites as evidence the American Bar Assn.'s evaluation of judicial nominees. 
A committee of ABA lawyers investigates all court nominees, analyzes the 
breadth of their legal experience and interviews dozens of people who know the 
candidate. At the end, each nominee is rated well-qualified, qualified or 
not-qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest tally, 65% of Clinton's appointees have earned a well-qualified 
rating, compared with 59% for Bush, 55% for Reagan and 56% for Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Clinton team got bad marks even from liberal groups for its 
slow pace in filling the record number of vacancies in the three-tiered federal 
court system. Only a Supreme Court vacancy got the President's quick attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But in its second year, the Administration picked up speed and is now winning 
rave reviews from the Alliance of Justice, a coalition of liberal groups that 
monitors the judiciary. Last month, director Nan Aron praised Clinton "for 
fulfilling his campaign promise to appoint only men and women of unquestioned 
intellect, judicial temperament, broad experience and a demonstrated concern 
for the individual rights protected by our Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, her conservative counterpart, Tom Jipping at the Free 
Congress Foundation, is not so enamored of the new judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are many liberal judicial activists in that group, and they 
have been rubber-stamped by the Senate," Jipping said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, only two Clinton court nominees have been tagged as liberal 
ideologues and challenged by Senate Republicans: Rosemary Barkett of Florida 
and H. Lee Sarokin of New Jersey. Both eventually won confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton has succeeded now in filling most of the judicial vacancies, he 
has by no means reshaped the federal judiciary. His appointees fill only 15% of 
the 837 federal judgeships, and many of them replaced retiring Democrats from 
the Carter era. Republican appointees still hold a majority in all 12 federal 
circuit courts of appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the huge U.S. 9th Circuit Court, which covers California and eight other 
Western states, Clinton has added only one judge among 26: Michael Hawkins of 
Arizona, a former U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Clinton nominees have not reshaped the law, they have surely begun 
to change the appearance of the judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
 "At our new judges conference (in Denver), it was wonderful to look around the 
room and see a group that looked so like the country," said U.S. District Judge 
Audrey Collins of Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 For 16 years, she worked in the district attorney's office in Los Angeles in 
jobs that ranged from conducting preliminary hearings and prosecuting consumer 
fraud cases to serving as a top administrator in the downtown office.  
</P>
<P>
 In May, she took her seat as a U.S. district judge, the fourth African 
American to hold a federal judgeship in Los Angeles. She was joined by Judge 
Richard Paez, a former municipal judge and the first Mexican American to serve 
on the federal district court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, Ruben Castillo has been an assistant U.S. attorney, a litigator 
for a prominent law firm and the regional director of the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Now, at age 40, he is the first Latino on 
the federal bench in Illinois. But he credits his appointment to his broad 
legal experience, not just his family heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, David S. Tatel has won admirers over the years for his work as 
a civil rights lawyer and advocate for poor children. From 1977 to 1979, he 
directed the civil rights office in the Department of Health, Education and 
Welfare. Said former Education Secretary Shirley Hufstedler, now a prominent 
Los Angeles lawyer: "I would be hard-pressed to find another advocate who had 
done more for the education of minority children than David." 
</P>
<P>
 But many who know Tatel only by reputation do not realize he has been blind 
for more than 20 years, having lost his sight to retinitis pigmentosa, a 
genetic disease. He climbs mountains, skis in Colorado and has completed 
marathons in New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no mention was made of his impairment in the White House 
announcement, Clinton made Tatel the first blind person to be a federal 
appellate judge when he named him to the influential U.S. court of appeals for 
the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Fred Parker was a prominent Republican lawyer and former state deputy 
attorney general in Vermont when Bush made him a federal district judge. On the 
bench, he won high marks for competence and fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 And this year, when Clinton had a Vermont seat to fill on the U.S. 2nd Circuit 
Court of Appeals in New York, he chose the person who came most highly 
recommended: Fred Parker. The new judge plans to keep his chambers in 
Burlington, but now he will begin commuting a few days a month to Manhattan to 
hear arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Gribbon Motz of Baltimore and her husband are believed to be the first 
married couple to sit on the federal bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it's true: He's a Republican," she said. "It's his only flaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan put John F. Motz on the federal bench in 1985, but his wife had also 
won high marks during her 25-year career as a private litigator, state 
prosecutor and state appeals court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 In perhaps her most celebrated case as a Maryland assistant attorney general, 
she won a $268,000 judgment against former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew to 
recover money he took as bribes during his term as the state's governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, she said, she received a call from then-White House Counsel 
Bernard Nussbaum to talk about the vacant seat on the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of 
Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Bernie, you must have the wrong Motz," she recalled. " 'My husband 
is the best-qualified person to move up to the 4th Circuit.' He laughed and 
said, 'We know your husband, and he has a fine record, but George Bush should 
have elevated him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Judge Diana Gribbon Motz sits on the appeals court based in Richmond, 
Va., with the power to review rulings of federal district judges in Maryland, 
Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. The President's

AMERICAN NAMED TO HEAD U.N. TROOPS IN HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Daniel Schroeder, deputy commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, was 
named Tuesday to command a 6,000-member U.N. mission that will replace the 
U.S.-led multinational force now in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, he headed a U.S. humanitarian mission in civil-war-torn Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder's appointment, which requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate, was 
announced by U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali during a brief visit 
to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 No date has yet been announced for the United Nations to take over from the 
U.S.-led force, which began arriving in Haiti in September to oversee the 
departure of a military junta headed by Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and the return 
from exile the following month of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, overthrown 
in a 1991 coup. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-led multinational force numbered about 20,000 at its peak but is now 
below 14,000. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. troops are expected to make up between a third and a half of the U.N. 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. force is expected to remain in Haiti until early 1996.

ANGOLAN FACTIONS SIGN CEASE-FIRE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Angola's warring factions signed a cease-fire Tuesday intended to allow their 
leaders to end the southern African nation's 19-year civil war this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The truce reached after six hours of talks was the first agreed to by both 
sides since May 15, 1991. It cleared the way for further negotiations on final 
details of a peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 The peace pact is to be signed Sunday in Lusaka, the capital of neighboring 
Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
 Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi, leader of the 
rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, had been scheduled 
to sign the peace pact Tuesday, but continued fighting that included a string 
of government victories caused the rebels to balk.

LOW TURNOUT MARKS VOTING IN NEPAL 
</P>

 They say that after a country opts for democracy, what counts is not the first 
election but the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Nepalese got their second chance Tuesday, and after months of political 
acrimony, charges of official sleaze and a lackluster, violence-marred 
campaign, about half showed how they felt by staying home. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in this poor and rugged Himalayan land cast ballots for the opposition 
Communists, or for the people whose reign by royal fiat was replaced by 
multi-party democracy four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A manifestation of discontent came a week ago, when Nepal's prime minister, 
who was up for reelection as voters chose a new 205-member House of 
Representatives, traveled to Jhapa in the southeast to appear at an election 
rally. Instead of being cheered, 71-year-old Girija Prasad Koirala of the 
Nepali Congress Party was stoned by left-wing opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone wants to hurl a missile at the leader of Nepal's first 
democratically elected government in more than three decades. But the 38-month 
record of the outgoing prime minister has provoked so much heated criticism 
that he and his party were not expected to win a large enough majority Tuesday 
to guarantee him another term. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, his most vociferous attackers may be the rebels inside the Nepali 
Congress who fielded rival candidates. Octogenarian Ganesh Man Singh, 
seniormost in the party's ruling troika, severed his half-century-old links 
with the party two months ago, warning that Nepal's fledgling democracy would 
not be safe under "corrupt Koirala and his coterie." 
</P>
<P>
 "My appeal to voters is that they should defeat Koirala and his henchmen," 
Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most serious charges leveled against Koirala is that he has allowed 
inflation to creep into double-digit territory -- a dire concern to many in 
this country, where average annual earnings are only $180. 
</P>
<P>
 The government and Koirala have been tarred with persistent accusations of 
graft. Also, the prime minister is seen by some as a shill for Indian interests 
because he approved a deal granting that powerful neighboring country the 
rights to a sliver of Nepalese land for a hydroelectric project. 
</P>
<P>
 As polls closed Tuesday, Election Commission officials reported a 50% to 55% 
turnout of the country's 12.1 million voters, which was low according to 
Nepal's admittedly limited experience with the democratic franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Such halfhearted participation was expected to hurt Koirala's party, which 
lacks the disciplined cadres of the leading opposition Communist Party of Nepal 
(Unified Marxist-Leninist). The Communists, however, were not expected to win 
an outright majority either. 
</P>
<P>
 Following an occasionally violent campaign in which six people lost their 
lives, authorities reported sporadic clashes on election day despite the 
deployment of 100,000 police and soldiers. In wards in 23 parliamentary 
districts, a second vote was ordered after violent incidents or the snatching 
of ballot papers or boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Ministry spokesman Shree Kant Regmi said one person was killed and two 
wounded in a gun battle between political factions in the Rautahat district. In 
the Taplejung district, 125 miles east of Katmandu, the capital, two backers of 
the Communists were seriously injured when they were stabbed by supporters of 
the monarchist National Democratic Party, Regmi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen parties and hundreds of independents took part in the election, 
resulting in more than 1,400 candidacies, but observers said it is the 
monarchists who could end up holding the balance of power if neither the Nepali 
Congress nor the Communists gain a 103-seat majority in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Democratic Party is made up of people who served in Nepal's old 
panchayat system of nominated, non-elected councils, when political parties 
were outlawed and King Birendra, who is venerated by many of his 20 million 
subjects as a living incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, was in effect an 
absolute ruler. 
</P>
<P>
 After violent pro-democracy protests in which more than 50 people died, the 
panchayat system and absolute monarchy were ended in 1990, and multi-party 
elections for Parliament were held the following year.

TRADE TALKS IN THE PACIFIC; NEWS ANALYSIS; VAGUENESS, DISTANT TARGET DATE RAISE 
DOUBTS ON ACCORD; TRADE: PROPONENTS SAY 2020 ISN'T AS FAR AWAY AS IT SOUNDS. 
SKEPTICS CONTEND THAT NOTHING IN THE AGREEMENT KEEPS NATIONS FROM RETAINING 
BARRIERS. 
</P>

<P>
 It seems a historic step for the countries of the Pacific region to promise to 
move toward free trade by the year 2020. 
</P>
<P>
 But how far-reaching is the new trade pact? 
</P>
<P>
 There are at least two reasons for some skepticism about the impact of what 
President Clinton and the leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum -- including Japan, China, South Korea, Canada and Australia -- pledged 
to do Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is that, for now, the agreement represents a promise with nothing 
behind it. There are no methods for enforcing free trade. If one country wants 
to preserve its trade barriers, none of the other Pacific nations can do 
anything about it. A defiant leader can merely come up with his own adaptation 
of the old line "How many divisions does the Pope have?" 
</P>
<P>
 The other problem, of course, is that 2020 is a long way off. It was 
relatively easy for the leaders to pledge to eliminate trade barriers by that 
time, because few if any of them will be in office 26 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some American critics have argued that setting such a distant target 
date could actually hamper the process of reducing trade barriers now. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (APEC) doesn't break any new ground and becomes instead a kind of 
comfortable base for saying, 'Oh well, we promise that we're going to get 
something done in 2020, so hang in there and don't beat up on us bilaterally . 
. . and certainly don't build any more on the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and allow any other countries in,' then you're not moving the process 
along," Paul Stern of the Washington-based Progressive Policy Institute said in 
a recent speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who first proposed the year 2020 believe the goal is, by itself, 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not quite as long off as it sounds," C. Fred Bergsten, director of the 
Institute for International Economics and a member of the APEC advisory group 
that first set the 2020 target, told one Washington audience last month. ". . . 
Moreover, we felt that in practice, the actual achievement of the 
liberalization would almost certainly occur much faster than the negotiated 
target date." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, President Clinton compared the goal of Asian-Pacific free trade by 
2020 to President John F. Kennedy's statement in 1961 that he wanted the United 
States to send a man to the moon in a decade. In both cases, an Administration 
official said, visionaries set a target "not knowing at that time whether or 
not that goal could be achieved. But the goal itself propelled the effort." 
</P>
<P>
 There are also disagreements about the extent to which the 2020 target date is 
good for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergsten insists that it is. "All of the countries in the region, outside 
North America in particular, have lots of trade barriers, and we don't have 
very many," he says. "So moving to totally free trade in the region means an 
enormous competitive gain to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 But then, there is the problem of that long lead time. It could make APEC, one 
critic suggested, "a red flag for protectionists in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are. We're going to deal with the two largest pools of cheap labor in 
the world, China and Indonesia, and they don't have to reciprocate (by lowering 
trade barriers) for 10 or 15 years. They can just run up surpluses," said 
Robert Manning, another senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (the 2020 date) could have a very counterproductive, unintended 
consequence." 
</P>
<P>
 The best argument on behalf of the deadline is that it forges at least some 
new economic links, however weak, between the United States and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could never walk away from the Asian market," Clinton said at a news 
conference. "We should be walking towards it, in terms that are fair."  
</P>
<P>
 The strong American support for APEC over the past five years has been based 
on the fear that the nations of East Asia might move to form their own 
intra-Asian trade bloc -- one that might include Japan but leave out the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed, in particular, has been pushing 
for an intra-Asian grouping, which could turn into a trade bloc dominated by 
the Japanese yen. APEC -- first proposed by Australia and then backed by the 
United States -- includes Canada, New Zealand, Mexico and Chile, all nations 
that are outside Asia but that border on the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 In setting the date far in the future, the United States succeeded in keeping 
everyone's attention focused on APEC -- the larger, more inclusive grouping. 
But in order to do so, it had to agree to that date. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality is that for now at least, Asian governments are leery of doing 
anything stronger than setting the vague goal of free trade by 2020. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Asian countries are afraid of "additional pressure from the United States 
to reduce trade barriers too quickly, as well as pressure (from America) about 
national policies dealing with such sensitive areas as human rights, 
intellectual property rights and the environment," said the East-West Center of 
Honolulu in a recent study.

TRADE TALKS IN THE PACIFIC; SOME PARTICIPANTS ARE COOL TO FREE-TRADE PACT; 
REACTION: MALAYSIA'S MAHATHIR SAYS HE WON'T BE BOUND BY DEADLINE. CHINA'S ZIANG 
IS ALSO LESS THAN ENTHUSIASTIC.

 While the industrialized nations of the Pacific region exulted Tuesday over an 
agreement to set up the world's largest free-trade area within 25 years, not 
everyone went home happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed said that his country will make its 
best effort to remove trade barriers by 2020, as spelled out in the accord, but 
that it does not feel bound to meet the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "If by the year 2020 we find ourselves unable to compete, I don't think 
anybody should force us to open up our country to an invasion by powerful 
companies from the developed countries," said Mahathir, who boycotted last 
year's meeting. He added that other small Asian countries share his views. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahathir issued a statement saying Malaysia "will only commit to undertaking 
further liberalization on a unilateral basis at a pace and capacity 
commensurate with our level of development." 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese President Jiang Zemin, whose government had previously expressed 
reservations about meeting a deadline, also appeared to be interpreting the 
agreement loosely. 
</P>
<P>
 Jiang said China endorses the liberalization of trade as a long-term goal, but 
he stressed that such liberalization should "be implemented in a phased and 
gradual manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the compromise adopted Tuesday by 18 leaders at the summit meeting of 
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, members of the group have until 
2020 to create "free and open trade." Industrialized countries such as the 
United States have to meet the goal by 2010, while developing countries such as 
Indonesia have until 2020. The statement does not define what "free and open" 
actually means.  
</P>
<P>
 Another non-specific aspect of the agreement is what defines an industrialized 
economy -- for example, where the newly industrialized nations of Taiwan, Hong 
Kong, Singapore and South Korea, the so-called Asian tigers, fall in the 
spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the definitions were left deliberately vague so that officials 
meeting over the next year can help nail down more explicit timetables before 
the next leaders meeting in Osaka, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong's financial secretary, Sir Hamish Macleod, who represented the 
British territory at the talks, said he found parts of Tuesday's communique 
"frankly a bit weak" because it does not use tough language to prevent new 
trade barriers from being erected. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said Hong Kong will have no trouble meeting the 2010 deadline for 
industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the happiest leaders at the meeting was Australian Prime Minister Paul 
Keating, because Australia was one of the countries that advocated the idea of 
APEC from the beginning. Australia is keen to be seen as a part of Asia, and 
Keating said the agreement will mean $7 billion and 70,000 jobs for Australia 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a triumph for Asian trade, a triumph for the world trade system and a 
triumph for Australia," Keating told a news conference. He said there was a 
sense of "restrained euphoria" among the participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating hinted that the group of economic leaders had to bend the rule of 
consensus to get a decision for a deadline for free trade. He said the members 
practiced "a flexible consensus" and wouldn't accept the view that one 
dissenting voice would be able to veto an agreement, a reference to Mahathir's 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Malaysian leader has been pushing a separate concept he calls the East 
Asian Economic Caucus, which would stand as a counterweight to the North 
American Free Trade group and the European Union. In Mahathir's view, the group 
should not include the United States, Australia or New Zealand, as does APEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said Indonesian President Suharto provided the momentum necessary to 
persuade doubters like Malaysia and China to agree to the communique even 
though they had reservations about certain aspects of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have set the course and the direction of future economic cooperation in 
the Asia-Pacific region in particular and the world in general," Suharto said.

U.S. WANTS BIHAC DECLARED WEAPONS EXCLUSION ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States is pressing its major Western allies to join in formally 
prohibiting the use of heavy weapons around the embattled Bosnian city of 
Bihac, in a move to head off further military gains in the area by the Bosnian 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of the United States, the North Atlantic Council, which is the 
policy-setting body of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, completed an 
initial review of the plan in Brussels on Tuesday and sent the proposal on to 
NATO military headquarters in Mons, Belgium, for further consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. plan would create a heavy-weapons exclusion zone around Bihac -- 
similar to those already established around Sarajevo and Gorazde -- that would 
prohibit the Bosnian Serbs from moving tanks or artillery within about a 
six-mile radius of the city's center. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind the move would be to prevent further Bosnian Serb gains, which 
U.S. officials fear might prompt neighboring Croatia to intervene militarily to 
help defend Bihac -- a move that U.S. officials are concerned could widen the 
war significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Western officials said that the U.S. proposal is meeting a lukewarm 
response, particularly from the British and French, who would be asked to 
contribute the bulk of the additional U.N. peacekeeping troops that probably 
would be needed to police the zone. Any violations of the weapons prohibition 
would be subject to NATO air strikes, if such actions were requested by the 
U.N. commander. 
</P>
<P>
 The only U.N. peacekeeping troops in Bihac right now are 1,200 Bangladeshis, 
who are poorly armed and equipped and are considered unfit to enforce any kind 
of exclusion zone. And Serbian forces have refused to permit the United Nations 
to send reinforcements or more equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear whether the allies ultimately would agree to go 
ahead with the proposal. "We're willing to look at it, but there are a lot of 
questions that go with it," a European official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that, besides the question of added peacekeeping troops, the 
U.S. proposal would constitute another use of the exclusion zone to tilt the 
battle in favor of the Bosnian Muslims -- at a time when the allies want to 
appear neutral as they try to coax the Serbs into making peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Willy Claes, NATO's new secretary general, and other key NATO officials are 
scheduled to discuss the issue with top U.S. policy-makers when they visit 
Washington later this week and early next week for previously scheduled 
meetings. But no decision is expected immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth H. Bacon, the Pentagon's spokesman, said Tuesday that the 
Administration regards the current standoff as "a crucial time" in the Bosnian 
situation. He declined to comment on specific details of the U.S. proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Muslims captured much of the territory around the city two weeks 
ago, but since then the Bosnian Serbs have rallied and have retaken 50% of the 
territory. Bihac, in northwest Bosnia, is close to the Croatian border. 
</P>
<P>
 Creation of the new exclusion zone would not require additional U.N. approval. 
The U.N. Security Council already has given that authority to NATO and the 
commanders of the U.N. peacekeeping troops in the country. All they would need 
to do would be to declare it. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the proposal to establish an exclusion zone, the United States also 
has suggested that the allies extend the "no fly" zone currently in effect over 
Bosnia to portions of neighboring Croatia to prevent Bosnian Serb planes from 
using the area to strike Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments came as NATO formally agreed to continue its arms embargo on 
the Bosnian Muslims without full U.S. participation in the wake of Washington's 
notice last week that American forces no longer would help enforce the 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambassadors from the organization's 16 member countries endorsed an assessment 
by the NATO military committee saying that the U.S. withdrawal is "unlikely to 
degrade the overall military effectiveness of the operation."

U.N. VANGUARD IN BIHAC POWERLESS TO AID BOSNIA; BALKANS: POORLY ARMED 
BANGLADESHI TROOPS TRAPPED WITH FEW PROVISIONS. ENCLAVE IS VULNERABLE TO SERBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The world's bulwark against the next foreseeable explosion of the Balkan 
conflict is a shivering battalion of Bangladeshis so poorly outfitted by the 
U.N. mission here that they share sleeping bags, shower in cold water and have 
only one gun for every four soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,200 Bangladeshis meant to deter a Bosnian Serb nationalist rout of the 
Bihac pocket were deployed to the vulnerable enclave in the northwestern corner 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina before their supply ship arrived with the food, fuel, 
weapons and supplies for the winter, U.N. officials here and in Bihac disclosed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been sent here completely unprepared. They don't have anything -- no 
heating, not enough fuel or food," a U.N. source said by telephone from the 
embattled and isolated Bihac. "They are walking around even without winter 
coats, and it is already cold here." 
</P>
<P>
 Bihac has suddenly emerged as the most unstable and potentially disastrous 
venue in the roiling Balkans in the two weeks since Bosnia's Muslim-led 
government recaptured 100 square miles of territory from the better-armed, but 
thinly spread, Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by their first significant loss in 32 months of armed rebellion, 
Bosnian Serbs loyal to their leader, Radovan Karadzic, have mobilized fellow 
Serbian rebels in Croatia as well as a defeated force of renegade Muslims for a 
deadly counteroffensive that has grabbed back most of that territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic's vow to roll on through Bihac and erase the Muslim enclave has 
trapped BangBat, as the subcontinental contingent is known in U.N. parlance, on 
a blazing battleground with neither the means to defend itself nor any hope of 
protecting the U.N.-designated safe area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are gravely concerned about the situation with regard to the Bangladeshi 
battalion in Bihac," U.N. mission spokesman Michael Williams told reporters 
after detailing ominous indications that Bihac could soon be the target of a 
massive siege. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the menacing moves by Serbian gunmen who surround as many as 200,000 
Bosnians in the Bihac pocket and the Bangladeshis sent to assist them, the U.N. 
mission finds itself powerless -- at least for the moment -- to call in air 
strikes and equally unable to rescue its own troops from their precarious 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Sarajevo and Gorazde, two other U.N. safe areas purportedly protected 
by NATO jets enforcing bans against heavy weapons, Bihac has not been 
designated a weapons-exclusion zone, although policy-makers at the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization proposed Tuesday that it be declared one.  
</P>
<P>
 If the zone is given formal approval, NATO could be called upon to attack 
heavy weapons within six miles of Bihac City. But even if Bihac were 
immediately designated a weapons-exclusion zone under NATO enforcement, it is 
doubtful the poorly equipped Bangladeshi peacekeepers could ensure that heavy 
weapons are withdrawn and the risk to the Bihac population abated. 
</P>
<P>
 And because Bihac is surrounded by Serb-occupied territory bristling with 
antiaircraft missiles and ruled by unpredictable rebel forces, Western 
countries that earlier parachuted relief supplies to similarly encircled 
eastern Bosnian enclaves have refused to make the dangerous flyovers to 
air-drop food and medicine to the people of Bihac or the Bangladeshis, Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. troops have been on canned rations for two weeks and will run out of 
food by Nov. 25. To stretch dwindling fuel supplies, only cold water is 
available in their barracks and they have no heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Another U.N. spokesman at mission headquarters here, Thant Myint-U, said the 
ship carrying supplies for the Bangladeshis arrived only Nov. 1, about two 
weeks after the troops were sent in to replace French soldiers. The French 
government withdrew its troops on short notice as part of a general drawdown 
that will cut the French contingent of 6,000 nearly in half by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian rebels occupying areas of Croatia contiguous to the Bihac pocket have 
been blocking humanitarian aid to the predominantly Muslim region for five 
months and since late October have also refused to let U.N. resupply shipments 
pass through their territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Croatian Serb rebels have likewise blocked foreign journalists from 
traveling to Bihac, preventing any firsthand assessment of the state of the 
U.N. deployment there. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials at the Zagreb headquarters concede that the troops from tropical 
Bangladesh arrived with little in the way of winter clothing in a mountainous 
region where nighttime temperatures are already below freezing. 
</P>
<P>
 Even what sleeping bags were provided to the Bihac-based troops came from what 
Williams described as "leftover East German stocks," rejected as substandard 
for the all-German military after unification in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Of most serious concern, the U.N. officials said, is the dearth of weapons for 
the troops deployed along what is now the Balkans' most active and dangerous 
front line. Fewer than 300 rifles were brought in by the contingent when it 
arrived a month ago. The rest of its personal weapons and heavier guns are now 
blocked by Serb rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 In a further sign of eroding U.N. influence in the simmering region, the 
Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees disclosed it has been 
compelled to reduce aid to more than 30,000 Muslims who fled the Bihac pocket 
in August after renegade Muslim warlord Fikret Abdic was defeated by the 
Bosnian army. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 5,000 fighting-age males lured to Abdic's side with food and money 
from his black-market dealings have been conscripted from their makeshift 
refugee camps by Croatian Serb rebels to wage another assault on Bosnian army 
forces in Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. sources here speculate that Abdic has joined forces with the Serbs in 
hopes of being reinstated as leader of a collaborating Muslim fiefdom. 
</P>
<P>
 "This violates a fundamental principle of international law. We vigorously 
protest this mobilization," U.N. refugee spokesman Peter Kessler said of the 
Serbian recruitment of displaced people for military offensives. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the symbolic reduction in aid was intended as a warning to Abdic but 
that the refugee agency could not completely halt supplies to Abdic loyalists 
because of concern for noncombatant women and children. 
</P>
<P>
 In eastern Bosnia, Karadzic informed the U.N. mission his forces will continue 
to block all fuel supplies to peacekeepers in Gorazde, Srebrenica and Zepa. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. mission is reluctant to use force to push through supplies even for 
its own soldiers, Williams said, for fear that resorting to any aggression 
would provoke retaliation by the Serbs who have considerably more firepower 
than the peacekeeping forces, especially in the case of defenseless BangBat.

SAME STANDARDS URGED FOR SMALL, LARGE AIRLINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PHILLIPS, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board, responding to growing concerns about 
the small aircraft that handle more than 10% of the nation's air passenger 
traffic, Tuesday recommended imposing on commuter airplanes the tougher 
standards required of major airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 In a long-awaited report, the board said commuter pilots tend to work more 
hours, report greater fatigue and do not receive the same level of training as 
those working for major airlines.It recommended that commuter carriers be 
brought up to the same training and safety levels as the major airlines, 
including the use of flight simulators, which are common in major-airline 
training but often missing in commuter training. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees air safety, has been 
accused of moving too slowly to crack down on commuter planes. The FAA agreed 
immediately with the board's recommendations. "One level of safety is a top 
priority of this agency and this Administration," FAA Administrator David 
Hinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson, who noted that the FAA has already adopted a number of equalizing 
regulations, said the FAA will soon release a proposal to require commuter 
pilots -- those flying planes with 30 or fewer seats -- to receive the same 
level of training as major airline pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Line Pilots Assn., which has staged a "one level of safety" campaign 
for months, praised the safety board's report. The Regional Airline Assn., 
which represents commuter airlines, said the board had produced a "quality 
study." 
</P>
<P>
 The safety board, which investigates major accidents, has no regulatory 
powers, but its recommendations carry weight with regulatory agencies such as 
the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's special report was prompted by commuter crashes in Hibbing, Minn., 
last December in which 18 were killed, and Columbus, Ohio, in January in which 
five died. Serious pilot errors were identified in both crashes.

RED DWARFS RULED OUT IN 'MYSTERY OF MISSING MASS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Overturning decades of conjecture over what the universe is made of, NASA said 
Tuesday that it has ruled out the possibility that red dwarf stars make up the 
dark matter that accounts for most of the universe's mass. 
</P>
<P>
 With the aid of the Hubble Space Telescope and a team of astronomers, the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it has concluded that dim, 
small stars called red dwarfs do not account for more than 90% of the universe 
as initially thought. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, red dwarf stars, thought to be abundant, are actually sparse in the 
Earth's galaxy. NASA, along with the European Space Agency, determined that the 
faint red stars rarely form and that there is a cutoff point below which nature 
does not make this type of dim, low-mass star. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our results increase the mystery of the missing mass. They rule out a popular 
but conservative interpretation of dark matter," John Bahcall, a natural 
science professor and leader of one of the teams, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Explanations centering on the birth of the universe, including the big-bang 
theory, show that less than 5% of the universe is made up of "normal stuff" 
like neutrons and protons. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that most of the universe is composed of unknown material that does 
not emit any radiation that can be detected by current technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible explanations for dark matter include black holes, neutron stars and a 
variety of exotic particles.

VIOLENT TROPICAL STORM KILLS 2, GROUNDS SHIP IN SOUTH FLORIDA

<P>
 A drenching Tropical Storm Gordon spawned a tornado that skipped through a 
retirement community Tuesday, killing one person. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm whipped up winds that grounded a 506-foot freighter just off the 
beach and took out a traffic signal, causing an accident that killed a pregnant 
motorist. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and rescuers went door to door in Barefoot Bay, looking for tornado 
victims in the dark, rainy weather. "It's pure hell out there," Sheriff's 
Officer Dallas Durr said. 
</P>
<P>
 One person was killed in the mobile home community of about 7,000 people on 
Florida's east coast, 40 miles south of Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others were in critical condition and at least eight people went to 
hospitals with minor injuries, said Michael Taggart, Brevard County fire 
marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 The tornado bounced along a two-mile path, destroying at least 40 homes and 
damaging at least 100 others, Taggart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elena Quicano, 36, of Hialeah was killed Monday when she was thrown from her 
vehicle in a three-car collision and run over by a pickup at a traffic light 
broken by the storm, police said. She was seven months' pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Between thundershowers Tuesday, the sight of the grounded Turkish freighter 
Firat just yards from shore in Ft. Lauderdale awed tourists and beach-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon moved into the Gulf of Mexico off Key West with 50 m.p.h. winds and was 
expected to slow down for a day or so after dumping more than 8 1/2 inches of 
rain on South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 100 people were confirmed killed in Haiti, and the independent Radio 
Signal FM on Tuesday reported the death toll was at least 400. The president of 
the Red Cross in Haiti, Dr. William Fougere, refused to give a figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people each died in Jamaica and Cuba as the deadliest tropical storm of 
the season spun through the Caribbean.

PENTAGON SAYS 5 ARMY DIVISIONS NOT AT THE READY; MILITARY: PREPAREDNESS TAXED 
BY MISSIONS IN HAITI, KUWAIT AND RWANDA, DEFENSE SECRETARY TELLS LAWMAKERS. 
REPORT IS LIKELY TO EMBARRASS CLINTON.

 The Pentagon disclosed Tuesday that five of the Army's 12 combat divisions 
have suffered a significant decline in military preparedness, primarily as a 
result of cash-flow problems stemming from the deployment of U.S. troops to 
Rwanda, Haiti and Kuwait this past year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to key lawmakers, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said that the 
erosion was caused because the Army was forced to cancel important maintenance 
operations and training exercises to offset the cost of the overseas 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The admission is considered likely to embarrass the Clinton Administration, 
which has denied allegations that military readiness is being impaired, while 
Republicans have warned that preparedness is being hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department officials said two of the divisions that have been affected 
were among the rapid deployment forces that are the first to go in any combat 
operation. But they said that the gap involves shortages in equipment and 
personnel and is being quickly eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the damage incurred in the other three divisions would require 
additional funding. Those divisions include one heavy armor and two infantry 
divisions, all in so-called "later-deploying heavy reinforcing" units that are 
among the third tier deployed in a war. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said in his letter that the Administration would seek supplemental 
appropriations to help bolster the Army's operations and maintenance budget to 
offset the cost of the overseas deployments. He did not say how much that would 
entail. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few weeks ago, Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch testified to 
Congress that U.S. troops are better prepared than they were before the 1991 
Persian Gulf War and that readiness is not a serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department officials insisted that Perry's letter, which was made 
public in an unusual, hastily called late-afternoon briefing, was drafted 
sometime Monday, after the secretary learned about the apparent erosion in 
readiness in the three divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the briefing came hours after the release of a letter by Rep. 
Floyd Spence (R-S.C.), in line to be the chairman of the House Armed Services 
Committee, questioning Deutch's assertion that readiness still is very high. 
</P>
<P>
 Spence and other conservatives have been warning repeatedly that the 
Administration has been cutting military spending too sharply to support the 
rise in peacekeeping missions, forcing the services to cut training and 
maintenance to meet budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In their briefing for reporters Tuesday, Pentagon officials said that the 
problem came to light as a result of periodic readiness reports that the Army 
requires of its units. The reports chart each unit's personnel, training, 
equipment on hand and serviceability of that equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent report, three of the five units in question were rated 
Category 3 -- second from the bottom -- "trained and ready to undertake many 
but not all" wartime missions. That means "the unit is deployable but it needs 
additional time" to get ready, officials said. The other two had relatively 
minor shortages in equipment and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said that the decline stemmed from a fiscal-year-end 
squeeze in which maintenance and training were canceled or deferred so the Army 
could stay within its budget. They said that the cuts would not have been 
necessary had Congress approved more funds in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the Administration requested $1.7 billion in additional funds 
in fiscal 1994 but received only $1.2 billion. And it frequently took several 
months before lawmakers approved the appropriation legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to Perry, Spence called the Administration's previous reluctance 
to concede any decline in military readiness levels "classic symptoms of 
denial" and cited a spate of anecdotal evidence from Army units that he said 
showed problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "While official Washington may be trying to convince itself of this illusion, 
the picture from the field is markedly and disturbingly different." He said 
that the Armed Services panel would conduct its own "field visits" next year to 
make its own assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), who will be chairman of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee next year, took a similar tack, arguing that the 
Administration already has overcommitted U.S. forces in Haiti and should bring 
the troops home soon.

DEMOCRAT WINS HOUSE RACE IN SQUEAKER; APPEAL VOWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic Rep. Sam Gejdenson came out ahead by four votes Tuesday after a 
recount of his two-vote victory in the nation's closest House race, but his 
opponent vowed to appeal to the courts and to the new GOP-controlled Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven-term congressman Gejdenson had 79,160 votes to Republican Edward W. 
Munster's 79,156 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Pauline Kezer declined to declare a winner. "I'm choosing 
my words carefully because it's a hot legal battle and I don't want to get in 
the middle of it," she said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Munster, who had also narrowly lost to Gejdenson two years ago, said he would 
file a challenge in state Supreme Court over the way absentee ballots were 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans said the outcome could ultimately be decided in Congress, where 
the GOP takes control in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The Constitution gives the House ultimate authority to decide who is seated, 
said Rep. Bill Thomas of Bakersfield, ranking Republican on the Committee on 
House Administration, which would oversee such disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gejdenson was out of the state and couldn't be reached for comment. But his 
political director denounced Munster's plan to contest the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just not the way our democracy works," Donna Parson said. "It's 
disgraceful that he's going to try to thwart the will of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Another dispute was brewing over the close Maryland governor's race, with 
Democrat Parris Glendening ending up ahead after a weeklong count of absentee 
ballots. Republican candidate Ellen Sauerbrey refused to concede. 
</P>
<P>
 The final, unofficial tally gave Glendening 706,531 votes to 701,126 for 
Sauerbrey. A handful of absentee overseas ballots remained to be counted, with 
certified results not expected until Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5,405-vote margin amounted to 0.25% of the votes cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendening's lieutenant governor is Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the eldest 
daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sauerbrey campaign again claimed there were irregularities in the 
election, but Glendening dismissed the charge as frivolous.

POLITICAL VETERANS DOMINATE CONGRESSIONAL CLASS OF '95; CAPITOL HILL: RECENT 
OFFICEHOLDERS OR OPERATIVES -- NOT NOVICES -- MAKE UP MOST OF THE NEW CROP. AS 
ONE OBSERVER SAYS, 'OUTSIDERS DON'T MAKE IT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Disenchanted voters might have sent congressional titans packing last week but 
that hardly means they are sending an army of Mr. Smiths to Washington to 
replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the 104th Congress that convenes in January will feature the least 
experienced crop of national lawmakers in nearly 40 years. At least 86 
first-term legislators will report for duty to the House, joining most of the 
110 newcomers -- a post-World War II record -- elected two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But the overwhelming majority of the new arrivals, many of whom are 
Republicans, are not the kind of novice citizen-legislators portrayed by James 
Stewart in the Frank Capra classic "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." An analysis 
by The Times shows that more than three-quarters of legislators in the freshman 
class of '95 either have held public office recently or were political 
operatives who filled party jobs or previously ran for office -- before being 
elected. The trend continues a pattern begun in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike the little-known GOP challengers who ousted House Speaker Thomas S. 
Foley in Washington state and former House Ways and Means Chairman Dan 
Rostenkowski in Chicago, few newly elected legislators are giant-killers. A 
majority won election to open seats created by incumbents' decisions to retire 
or seek higher office, also repeating the 1992 pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outsiders don't make it," said Gary Jacobson, a political science professor 
at UC San Diego who specializes in Congress. "The candidates who were able to 
take advantage of the anti-Washington and anti-Democratic sentiments were 
people who themselves were politically active and savvy and seized this as an 
opportunity to move into Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 One example was Republican Robert W. Ney, 40, a four-term state senator and 
teacher who won a race to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Douglas Applegate in 
Ohio. Another was Republican Thomas M. Davis III, a lawyer who ousted one-term 
Democrat Leslie L. Byrne in a highly competitive northern Virginia seat. Davis, 
45, chairs the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 14 candidates who had not held or sought political or party offices were 
elected to the House in 1992 and 20 in 1994, even though more than 250 such 
aspirants ran in those years. Experienced candidates remain better able to 
build formidable political and financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 The cadre of incoming lawmakers faces an institutional challenge. Will the 
Republican-dominated newcomers be in the vanguard of sweeping internal change 
-- as promised by the new House GOP leadership -- comparable to that achieved 
by the 1974 post-Watergate influx? Or will they largely be co-opted by a system 
that offers myriad benefits to incumbents, an experience that some say befell 
the heavily Democratic freshman class of '92? 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson said that many of this year's freshmen face a quandary: "You have a 
class of newcomers elected who are committed to an agenda for internal reform 
in Congress that probably works against their interests as members with any 
long-term perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 And he said that they must resolve another basic question: "Will they try to 
build up strong personal support in their districts by traveling home all the 
time and doing casework and trying to provide pork-barrel projects which they 
can claim credit for, which did not work for some of the Democrats who were 
defeated? Or will they seek to make policy in an ideologically based fashion 
rather than trying to cultivate support independent of their ideology?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even though voters elected mostly politically experienced newcomers, the past 
two cataclysmic campaigns have dramatically changed the face of Congress. In 
addition to shifting from Democratic to Republican majorities, both the House 
and Senate have significantly increased both the number of women and the number 
of minority lawmakers in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 The female contingent in the House jumped from 28 before the 1992 election to 
47 and is expected to be 49 next year. The tally in the Senate will have 
increased from two to eight. In the House, the black caucus has gone from 25 to 
38 members and the Hispanic caucus from 10 to 18. The Senate added its only 
African American and Native American in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-Democratic tide did not wash over black and Latino Democratic 
strongholds this year, largely because reapportionment created districts that 
were predominantly minority and Democratic, or made them even more so. At the 
same time, neighboring districts previously held by Democrats, which lost key 
pockets of black voters in 1992, fell to Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The two recent elections have yielded ammunition to bolster both the case for 
-- and the case against -- the increasingly successful national campaign to 
limit congressional terms. This is an integral part of the new GOP agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer is Congress primarily the domain of aged political barons. A full 
41% of the new House and nearly a quarter of the Senate will have served two 
years or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 The average tenure for House members will be seven years and 10 months -- less 
than two years longer than the six-year cap sought by many term-limit 
proponents. The figure in the Senate -- which will have added 24 newcomers in 
the last two elections -- will be 11 years and seven months -- a shorter tenure 
than the 12-year ceiling sought by many restrictionists.

JOURNALISTS CONVENTION TO BOYCOTT STATE; IMMIGRATION: LATINO ORGANIZATION VOTES 
NOT TO HOLD NATIONAL MEETINGS IN CALIFORNIA UNLESS PROPOSITION 187 IS 
INVALIDATED IN COURT OR REPEALED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Charging that Proposition 187 is "anti-Latino," the National Assn. of Hispanic 
Journalists has voted to keep the organization's national convention out of 
California unless the illegal immigration initiative is repealed by state 
voters or voided by court decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement appears to be the first concrete step taken by a national 
organization to boycott California as a result of last week's overwhelming 
passage of the sweeping ballot measure, which is designed to terminate 
non-emergency government-funded services for illegal immigrants and require 
educational, health and law enforcement officials to report suspects to state 
and federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colorado and Texas, Latino activists have announced that they are 
considering boycotts of California. Texas state Rep. Roberto Alonzo, state 
president of Mexican American Democrats, said he will ask Latino political 
leaders this week to boycott films, fruit and all other merchandise produced in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,700-member Hispanic journalists organization had been considering San 
Diego as one of three possible sites for its 1998 national convention. But in a 
15-0 vote, the group decided not to invite San Diego officials to make a final 
presentation at their March meeting at which the convention site will be 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly hope other Hispanic groups would join us in sending a very 
strong message to the voters of California that this kind of discrimination 
can't be tolerated," said Zita Arocha, executive director of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvatore Giametta, vice president of the San Diego Convention and Visitors 
Bureau, expressed concern at the organization's decision. "We certainly do 
understand there may be some negative fallout" from Proposition 187, he said. 
"No one can afford to turn away any business, and we're certainly disappointed 
if they aren't going to be considering San Diego."

SCHOOLS PLAN TO DROP THEIR PROP. 187 SUIT 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four San Jose school districts that went to court to block Proposition 187 
plan to drop their lawsuit because other legal challenges have temporarily 
barred enforcement of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no need for us to expend any dollars or legal fees to pursue this," 
said Joe Coto, superintendent of the East Side Union High School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Jose Unified School District and the Alum Rock and Franklin-McKinley 
elementary and intermediate districts also took part in the suit, filed last 
week in federal court in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 School districts in Los Angeles and elsewhere won a temporary restraining 
order last week in San Francisco that blocks enforcement of the measure's ban 
on public education for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of Proposition 187 argued that public money was being used to thwart 
the will of the voters. The San Jose Unified School District said it received 
at least 75 calls complaining about its suit. EDUCATION

STOCKTON DELAYS DECISION ON ALLOWING RESIDENTS TO CARRY WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than five hours of emotional debate, the City Council voted to 
delay until Monday a decision on whether to allow residents of this San Joaquin 
Valley city to carry concealed weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun enthusiasts and the National Rifle Assn. are backing a measure that would 
relax rules for granting concealed-weapon permits and require the Stockton 
police chief to issue a permit to any "good citizen."Supporters say arming the 
citizenry would allow residents to defend themselves and make the city a safer 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents argue that allowing thousands of people to carry concealed weapons 
would create a vigilante atmosphere, lead to an increase in accidental 
shootings and result in deadlier domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council heard testimony from dozens of people on both sides of the 
issue Monday night before postponing a vote for one week.

FEINSTEIN ADDS TO HER LEAD 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As county election officials continue to tally absentee ballots throughout the 
state, Republican Rep. Mike Huffington's chances of defeating U.S. Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein appear to be shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Tuesday, Democrat Feinstein held a lead of 131,082 votes out of more 
than 7 million cast in the Senate race, according to figures compiled by the 
secretary of state's office.After the polls closed Nov. 8, local voting 
officials had an estimated 700,000 absentee ballots still to be counted and 
Feinstein held a lead of 123,610 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 With 230,000 of those ballots now counted, Feinstein still clings to a slim 
lead, with 3,711,499 votes to Huffington's 3,580,417. To win, Huffington would 
have to capture almost 64% of the remaining ballots, which is thought to be 
unlikely.

QUITTING AT ANY AGE FOUND AID TO SMOKERS' LUNGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new study proves for the first time that smokers who quit wind up with 
healthier lungs, no matter how long they have smoked, researchers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The study involved more than 5,800 smokers who were victims of chronic 
obstructive lung disease, a combination of emphysema and bronchitis that is the 
fourth leading cause of death in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've seen proof that if you stop smoking at any age, 
you will have healthier lungs," said Dr. William Conway, a senior staff 
physician at Detroit's Henry Ford Hospital who was one of the researchers.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is the largest study ever conducted on the prevention of lung disease," he 
said. "It shows without a doubt that quitting smoking is the most effective way 
of preventing lung function decline due to emphysema and chronic bronchitis." 
The study was coordinated by the University of Manitoba and involved 10 sites 
in the United States, including UCLA, and Canada. It was published today in the 
Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The results "give the strongest evidence to date that smoking cessation 
results in substantial benefit to lung function," the report said.

OXNARD SUPPORTS VENTURA SITE FOR BALLPARK; STADIUM: THE PROPOSED HOME FOR A 
MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL TEAM IS FAVORED, DESPITE TRAFFIC AND COST CONCERNS. 
CAMARILLO HAS YET TO APPROVE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Oxnard stroked a solid single Tuesday, joining Ventura on base in a daring 
drive to bring minor league baseball to a barren Ventura field. But Camarillo 
may yet hit into a triple play when it goes to bat today. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite concerns about cost and traffic, the Oxnard City Council unanimously 
supported the recommended site for a new $15.6-million stadium just across the 
Santa Clara River from Oxnard near the Ventura Auto Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "There would be a tremendous impact on traffic there," Councilman Michael A. 
Plisky said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the two Ventura Freeway interchanges that would bear most stadium 
traffic -- Victoria Avenue and Johnson Drive -- are congested now even before 
5,500 fans begin to converge for a ballgame. Costly roadway improvements would 
be necessary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are two of the busiest intersections in the county and some of the most 
underdeveloped," Plisky said. "How can we determine the feasibility of this 
site if we don't know one of the major costs?" 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Councilman Bedford Pinkard said he was concerned that the road 
improvements would be too much for Ventura to handle, and that another site may 
need to be chosen. He mentioned that the parcel offered near Rice Avenue in 
Oxnard has better freeway access. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Ventura, Oxnard and Camarillo -- which are cooperating to bring 
a Class-A professional team to the county -- have agreed that the city where 
the stadium is built would pay for all needed public improvements except for 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "If those improvements are a little exorbitant for a city to assume, what will 
happen with this plan?" Pinkard asked. "We may have to look at the other sites, 
and that could delay the project. We don't want to be tied up with that for a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of a three-city stadium committee have also acknowledged that 
Camarillo may balk at approving a stadium -- much less paying for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no commitment of money (tonight), so I see no reason for it to be 
voted down," said Camarillo Mayor Ken Gose, a committee member. "But we know 
there is going to be some opposition to this. (The funding) is where the tough 
part will come. It's going to be very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Craven and David Smith of the five-member Camarillo City Council 
said Tuesday that the project would drain city coffers and they would not 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't believe that any public money should be spent on this," Craven 
said. "Even if it was to be located in my city, I would feel the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkard, who represents Oxnard on the committee, said that Camarillo will 
probably support the Ventura site, but may not contribute as much money as the 
other cities.  
</P>
<P>
 "The two cities may have to foot it," Pinkard said. "But we're going to start 
a very aggressive fund-raising campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 If all three city councils agree on where to put the ballpark, then they must 
decide whether to form a joint powers authority to pay for the stadium. A 
proposed Tri-Cities Sports Authority would own and operate the 5,500-seat 
ballpark and share its costs and profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Gagliardi, president of the California League, promised last spring to 
deliver a Class-A team to the area if someone would build a new park. The three 
cities spent about $85,000 to hire the Spectrum Group, an experienced sports 
consultant, to study the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we all knew coming in that it would be a tough thing keeping all the 
cities together," said Spectrum Group President Dan Young. "So far, we have all 
stuck together, but we'll see what happens tomorrow."

VENTURA CITY COUNCILMAN SUGGESTS RESTORING STIPEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Complaining that he is underpaid for the work he does, Ventura City Councilman 
Jim Monahan says the city should consider sending council members a check each 
time they convene under the title of Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 That happens about once or twice a month at regularly scheduled council 
meetings and can last two minutes to two hours, depending on the issue at hand. 
Nobody leaves the room. Nobody changes seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Every city in Ventura County, except Camarillo, has a redevelopment agency -- 
a legal change of name that allows the council to spend tax dollars set aside 
for property it has declared in need of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan proposes that each time the council convenes under the agency title, 
he and the other council members could get paid an extra stipend, perhaps $25 a 
session -- a bill that could mean an extra $750 per council member per year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to think, for the amount of time we put in, it's only fair," he 
said. "It's another entity. We wear two hats." 
</P>
<P>
 The stipend would come on top of the council's regular salary. The mayor now 
receives $8,400 a year, and Monahan and the other council members get paid 
$7,200 a year to perform their duties. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council members apply to receive their monthly expense accounts, which 
officials say most do regularly, their salaries rise even higher -- $12,000 a 
year for the mayor and $9,600 a year for the rest of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gregory L. Carson, who chairs Ventura's Redevelopment Agency, said 
he found Monahan's stipend idea interesting. "I'm going to wait and see what 
Jim comes up with," he said. "It is a financial hardship to be a City Council 
member."  
</P>
<P>
 Other council members, however, immediately blasted the proposal, saying they 
did not go into public service to get rich. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not about money -- it's about community service," said Councilman 
Gary Tuttle. "Do I find (Monahan) hypocritical? Yes, absolutely. . . . He 
thinks government is over-big, over-fat. But he's the first one in line for a 
pay increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan, who presented the idea at 11 p.m. Monday, just as the council was 
ending its weekly meeting, said he is merely trying to restore a practice 
dropped in the late 1970s, when he served his first council term. Back then, 
each council member received $25 every time the council met as the 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The city clerk, Barbara Kam, who also worked for the city in the 1970s, said 
she does not know why the council voted to stop paying that stipend. But as 
Monahan recalls it, the funds were slashed as part of a municipal money panic 
following the passage of Proposition 13, the taxpayer initiative that severely 
restricted the amount of property taxes the city received. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "But since that time, the city has allowed its staff and their salaries to 
grow," Monahan said. "But we never restored the amount that the redevelopment 
agencies received. It should've probably been restored, and it was an 
oversight." 
</P>
<P>
 The stipend proposal, however, comes 17 months after the council slashed the 
city budget, freezing some positions and eliminating others in an attempt to 
save money.  
</P>
<P>
 Even as Monahan outlined his plans for a new stipend, which he says would come 
out of agency funds, not general revenue, he also called for more funds for the 
Police Department. He said that since the city would be hard pressed to pay for 
more officers out of the main budget, it should consider reaching into city 
reserves to find the extra money.  
</P>
<P>
 If Ventura did revive the agency stipend, it would not be alone. Of the 
county's three other large cities -- Thousand Oaks, Oxnard and Simi Valley -- 
only Thousand Oaks does not pay its council members extra cash for each time 
they convene as the Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, for example, council members receive $10,800 a year, including 
expenses, and the mayor receives $12,000 a year, including expenses. In 
addition, each time the council meets as the Redevelopment Agency and each time 
it meets as the Housing Authority, council members take home $30 extra per 
meeting. Both the authority and the agency generally meet each week, at the 
same time the council does, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Oxnard City Council met 45 weeks a year, that would increase each 
council member's annual salary by $2,400. 
</P>
<P>
 But many council members in Ventura said the idea is not for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. Just flat no," said Councilman Jack Tingstrom. "I've never seen it, I 
don't need it, I don't want it. It's too controversial." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had no idea why Monahan proposed renewing the stipend now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim's Jim," he said. "He has a mind of his own and half the time, I have no 
idea where he's coming from."

SLAIN NURSE WAS KNEELING WHEN SHOT, EXPERT TESTIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Kellie O'Sullivan never had a chance to put up a fight, a ballistics expert 
testified Tuesday, saying the Westlake nurse was on her knees and under a 
leafy, low-slung tree limb in the Santa Monica Mountains when she was fatally 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a mannequin dressed in the clothes O'Sullivan was wearing when she was 
killed, Paul Dougherty also showed the Ventura County jury how the woman 
apparently was kneeling when the first shot was fired into her chest. 
</P>
<P>
 As she fell forward, two more shots were pumped into her back, Dougherty said. 
</P>
<P>
 When her partly decomposed body was discovered 12 days later, Dougherty said, 
O'Sullivan still was wearing her sunglasses and carrying her purse. 
</P>
<P>
 With murder defendant Mark Scott Thornton only a few feet away from the 
mannequin, which was propped up on the prosecution table, Dougherty used the 
model to re-enact the murder before the riveted jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense had asked to keep the demonstration out of the trial, but Superior 
Court Judge Charles R. McGrath allowed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence suggests the nurse was shot in the same spot where her body was 
found, Dougherty testified. Two other witnesses testified Tuesday that they 
found the body off Mulholland Drive under some large tree limbs that resembled 
a cave. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the angle of the shots that killed O'Sullivan and the small size of 
the area where her body was found, Dougherty said he concluded that she could 
not have been standing at the time of her death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe she was on her knees, and that's because of the physical 
limitations of the site," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to questions from Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley, Dougherty 
also said he concluded that O'Sullivan was unable to put up a struggle before 
dying. Prosecutors have said that she was caught off guard and never expected 
her assailant to shoot her. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's testimony appeared to be some of the most damaging to the Thornton 
defense. Thornton, 20, is charged in a multiple-count indictment with murder 
under special circumstances -- kidnaping and robbery -- that could send him to 
the gas chamber if he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say he kidnaped O'Sullivan from outside a Thousand Oaks pet store 
and took her to the mountains, where she was shot. They say Thornton then used 
her truck to kidnap his girlfriend and go on a five-day sojourn to Northern 
California and Reno, where he was eventually arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Dougherty testified that the three bullets extracted from O'Sullivan's body 
matched a .38-caliber revolver Thornton pointed at police officers during his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending most of the first two weeks of the trial establishing a motive 
for the killing, prosecutors this week have shifted their focus to the slaying 
of the 33-year-old nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 In other testimony Tuesday, the two people who discovered O'Sullivan's body 
described for the jury how they came to find it. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterinarian Richard Stevens and Tricia Beers, one of his employees, said they 
were among the more than 200 volunteers who combed the Thousand Oaks area in 
the days after O'Sullivan disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of Sept. 26, they testified, they were searching an area off 
Mulholland Drive because it seemed probable that someone could reach it with a 
four-wheel-drive truck without being detected. 
</P>
<P>
 Beers said she quickly realized that she might have stumbled onto the body. "I 
smelled something dead," she remembered. "I was hoping it was a deer, or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 The smell was coming from the thick foliage beneath a large tree in the 3100 
block of Mulholland. Stevens got on his hands and knees and crawled under the 
tree limbs, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my God! Oh my God!" the veterinarian said he screamed. Stevens said he 
emerged from the cave-like site and grabbed Beers. "It's her!" 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said the sight and smell left him disoriented. He told the jury: 
"Where Kellie's body was, I was approximately a body's length away." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, the first police officers who arrived on the scene described how 
they cordoned off the area and made certain that evidence was preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the jurors frowned in apparent repulsion when a Los Angeles County 
coroner's investigator described the difficulty in removing a body that had 
been exposed to the elements for 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have been worried that such testimony could make jurors less 
sympathetic toward the defendant. Investigator Mitchell Sigal also said 
O'Sullivan had been shot at the crime scene, testifying that no scuff marks 
were found on her shoes to indicate that her body had been dragged to the area 
where it was discovered.

PLAN TO FUND NEW COUNTY HOSPITAL WING OKD; HEALTH: FOES SAY $51-MILLION PROJECT 
MAY NOT BE NEEDED BECAUSE MEDICAL DEMANDS BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WILL DROP WITH 
PROP. 187. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A financing plan for a new wing at Ventura County's public hospital was 
approved Tuesday despite a pending lawsuit by its chief rival and complaints 
from taxpayer advocates that not enough studies have been done to warrant the 
$51-million price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors agreed unanimously to authorize the issuance of $51 
million worth of so-called certificates of participation to fund an expansion 
at Ventura County Medical Center. The certificates are bond-like debt that must 
be repaid with substantial interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents complained that there may be no need for the new wing because of 
the passage last week of Proposition 187, the controversial measure to deny 
most public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a lot of money to put out on a project that might not need to be 
built," said H. Jere Robings of the Ventura County Alliance of Taxpayers.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A report issued earlier this month by the state Health and Welfare Agency 
concluded that the number of patients taking advantage of public health care in 
Ventura County has grown fifteen-fold since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 County health care officials said the higher number of poor people served by 
the medical center would raise the amount the state reimburses Ventura County 
for caring for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 But under Proposition 187, most medical services would be denied to illegal 
immigrants, expansion opponents said, meaning there could be fewer patients to 
serve in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the 70% state share of the expansion cost is based on the percentage of 
poor patients treated at Ventura County Medical Center. If the patient caseload 
dips, so does the amount of money that the state would contribute toward the 
construction of the new wing. 
</P>
<P>
 The board decision Tuesday also allows county officials to retain a bond 
attorney to put together the financing package, which will cost almost $75 
million to repay over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposal has been around a long time. It has been studied," Supervisor 
Maggie Kildee said. "Those who are opposed to the project are still opposed to 
the project. We could study this forever." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the state will pay for 70% of the $51-million expansion, 
which consists of 105,000 square feet of new hospital space to consolidate a 
number of leased offices the hospital views as dilapidated and ridden with 
asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also include a multilevel parking garage for $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it rains outside, it rains inside," medical center volunteer Barbara 
Thompson said of the leased family care center, one of several clinics that 
would relocate to the new five-story, $33.2-million structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some rooms are closed off because they are unsafe. One wall of the waiting 
room is no longer vertical. It bulges," Thompson said. "All of the volunteers 
are very supportive of the plan. It's just basic common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 But several taxpayer advocates urged supervisors to wait until a lawsuit 
brought against Ventura County by Community Memorial Hospital is settled, and 
they complained that the state funds have not yet been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not seen any documentation . . . that the state has approved this 
project," Robings said. 
</P>
<P>
 The financing package presented by county health care officials assumes 
several conditions in concluding that the repayment will not cost the county 
more than 30% of the expense, estimated at more than $24 million over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It assumes that net incomes continue at present levels, state contributions do 
not decline, the hospital becomes more efficient and the state pays 70% of the 
cost from a fund set up to help public hospitals expand. 
</P>
<P>
 But Michael Saliba, executive director of the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn., 
said it was unwise to make those assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be more demands on the county general fund if those assumptions . 
. . prove to be untrue," Saliba said. "Before a decision is made, taxpayers 
deserve -- and you deserve -- a financial analysis and feasibility study." 
</P>
<P>
 Under current estimates, the county would be obligated to repay more than $24 
million over 15 years beginning in 1997. Of that amount, about $18 million 
would come from the medical center budget and the balance would come out of the 
county general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 No one from Community Memorial Hospital, situated two blocks from the county 
hospital in Ventura, showed up Tuesday to argue against the financing plan or 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the private hospital has claimed in a lawsuit that the county is going 
beyond its mission of treating only Ventura County's most needy patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 187 and health care reform, expanding the (county) health care facility 
by almost double is a waste of taxpayer money," said Donald L. Benton, a 
Community Memorial trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton said it is unlikely that the county will continue to see such dramatic 
increases in the number of poor people eligible for health care services at 
Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not going to be an expanding population," he said. "Therefore, the 
need of the county, in order to meet its legislative mandate, is going to 
diminish." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is still months away. But at a hearing scheduled Monday in Ventura 
County Superior Court, county attorneys will ask Judge Frederick A. Jones to 
rule that Community Memorial has no legal basis for making that complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 None of those concerns, however, convinced supervisors to rethink their 
support of the county hospital expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish I was going to be around when ground is broken," said Supervisor 
Maria E. VanderKolk, who opted not to seek reelection.

SERVICES TO CONTINUE FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS; COUNTY: LOCAL AGENCIES WILL STILL 
PROVIDE HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE BENEFITS UNTIL RECEIVING DIRECTION FROM THE 
STATE ON HOW TO PUT PROP. 187 INTO ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County will continue to provide health and social welfare benefits to 
illegal immigrants until it receives direction from state agencies on how to 
implement a ballot measure intended to halt those services, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the county has been advised by state health officials not to 
"attempt to interpret and implement Proposition 187 on an individual basis," 
county Counsel James L. McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are awaiting emergency regulations for enforcing the measure 
from the state departments of Health Services, Social Services, Corrections and 
other state agencies, McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, those regulations will guide what everyone does," said McBride, 
who presented an update on the status of Proposition 187 to the county Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 McBride said the county will be monitoring the outcome of several lawsuits 
that have been filed to block the measure's implementation, which could 
ultimately determine when, or even if, the county will be able to enforce its 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing is scheduled today in federal court in Los Angeles on a motion made 
by civil rights attorneys to suspend the measure. In a separate case, a judge 
last week temporarily barred the enforcement of the proposition's requirement 
that illegal immigrants be excluded from public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows what's going to happen?" McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, county officials said there is little they can do until they get more 
guidance from the state or the courts on how to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything about 187 is tied up in one lawsuit or another," said Supervisor 
Maria VanderKolk. "Nothing can be done until we hear back from the courts." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, illegal immigrants are eligible to receive restricted Medi-Cal 
cards that entitle them to state-funded prenatal services and long-term care. 
Emergency services are required to be provided without regard to immigration 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after he was reelected, Gov. Pete Wilson signed an executive order 
calling for the termination of prenatal and long-term health care for illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a recent memo from the state Department of Health Services, the county 
was advised that those programs cannot be discontinued without proper notice to 
the beneficiaries, which could take at least 60 days. The memo goes on to say 
that illegal immigrants already receiving long-term care will remain covered. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, county health officials said they have only received a handful of 
calls from people asking questions about Proposition 187 since the measure was 
approved by voters Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "There hasn't been much of a drop-off in the number of clients requesting 
services," said Paul Lorenz, administrative director of Public Health Services. 
The agency, which does not check the immigration status of beneficiaries, 
operates health clinics in Ventura, Oxnard and Simi Valley that provide 
immunization, physical examinations for children and birth control programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Fitzgerald, deputy director of the county's Public Social Services 
Agency, said she also has not seen any noticeable decline in the demand for the 
agency's services, which range from providing food stamps to offering financial 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald said this may be because many of the agency's programs already 
require that an applicant's citizenship be verified. Only two of the agency's 
programs, child and adult protective services, do not require such background 
checks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't ask if they are illegal aliens," Fitzgerald said, adding that 
beneficiaries of these programs are usually the victims of some type of 
physical or mental abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Until her agency receives more direction from the state, Fitzgerald said, 
"it's going to be business as usual."

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; ON A COLLISION 
COURSE WITH THE LAW 
</P>

 Richard Siddons was riding his bicycle, minding his own business, when all of 
a sudden -- Wham! -- he was sideswiped by a car making a right turn from a 
freeway exit in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But like a broken record, the accident repeated itself again and again, at 
least 20 times, authorities said. Each time, he allegedly pressured the auto 
driver into paying him $20 to $75 in "damages" on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 And the last couple of times the Tarzana man's bike was hit, Los Angeles 
police officers Humberto Fajardo and Theresa Gordon were watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Fajardo and Gordon work undercover for the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Traffic Division's Staged Collision Unit, a 2-year-old outfit that investigates 
suspicious traffic accidents in cooperation with the state Department of 
Justice and the National Insurance Crime Bureau, an industry agency that serves 
as liaison between insurance companies and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two years since the LAPD established staged accident units at each of 
its four bureaus, the Valley unit has made 60 arrests -- including Siddons -- 
and many more cases are under way. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Insurance Crime Bureau, which investigates suspicious claims and 
accidents, estimates that about 40% of more than 8,000 suspicious accidents in 
its 13-state western regional area occurred in Southern California, according 
to Bob Chambers, the bureau's regional manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau's database includes customer information from most major carriers, 
an invaluable investigative tool, Fajardo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of a Central California woman: the computer information showed 
that 14 members of her family had collected damages from traffic accidents in 
just two years. The woman was a "capper," working for an unholy doctor-lawyer 
alliance often found at the base of such insurance scams, Fajardo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would come down here for about half the year and stage accidents, then 
she would go back home and run a private business she owned," Fajardo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fajardo learned that the woman would often gather all the participants at the 
parking lot at Valley College, where she would instruct them in what story to 
tell while their cars were taken away and "wrecked" -- with artful damage that 
was often inflicted in cooperating auto body shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Using information obtained through an informant, Fajardo met the woman in the 
summer of 1992. Although she sometimes jokingly accused him of being a cop, he 
finally persuaded her, after six months, to let him make some money. 
</P>
<P>
 So, one day in November, 1992, he met her and her associates at a Van Nuys 
restaurant. While he waited, his car was taken away. It was returned not more 
than two hours later with a brand-new dent. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the woman laid out the scenario for the detective: "The accident was your 
fault, you just weren't watching the road. This is the gas station you called 
the police from, but they refused to respond to a non-injury accident. We 
exchanged information and went our separate ways," she told him. 
</P>
<P>
 The scam was aimed at Fajardo's insurance company, which would get hit with 
claims from other people in the ring, claiming to have been involved in the 
"accident" with him. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, convicted of fraud, served eight months of a three-year state 
prison term, Fajardo said, and was ordered to pay $292,000 in restitution to 
insurance companies for 180 accidents staged between 1984 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The detective refused to identify the woman, even after her conviction, 
because he is still investigating members of her ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple watch-and-arrest cases, like Siddons' comparatively crude scam with 
faked bicycle accidents -- he is awaiting trial on 20 counts of extortion -- 
are rare, the officers say. Most of their investigations involve doctors, 
lawyers and a web of co-conspirators that can take years to unravel, Fajardo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't arrest everybody right away," Fajardo said. "It takes time to 
collect paperwork from the insurers, review the documents and then find out the 
incriminating facts of a case." 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers estimated that losses from staged accidents in Southern California 
will cost insurers $65 million this year. "It's a big business," he said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; ROAD REOPENS AFTER REMOVAL OF SLIDE 
DEBRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 South Mountain Road near Santa Paula was reopened Tuesday after work crews 
cleared the last of an estimated 60,000 cubic yards of rock and earth dumped by 
a landslide in September. 
</P>
<P>
 W. Butch Britt, Ventura County deputy public works director, said the last of 
the debris was removed and the road reopened to motorists about noon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very glad to have been able to get the road back open," Britt said. 
"It took some juggling (of finances), but we were able to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 With the road closed, residents living east of the slide were forced to make a 
30-minute detour through Fillmore to reach Santa Paula. Britt said about 1,000 
motorists a day used the route. 
</P>
<P>
 So the county Board of Supervisors ordered that the road be reopened promptly, 
even though the work forced a one-year delay in the replacement of a bridge 
near Camarillo State Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is that we beat the weather and the actual cost of the project 
is about $30,000 cheaper than we originally thought it would be," Britt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Britt said Goleta-based Banner Construction Inc. will earn about $100,000 for 
the 10-week job. 
</P>
<P>
 County analysts said the road is located next to an unstable mass of rock and 
earth, and that another slide could be triggered at any time. A slide also 
closed the roadway in 1993. J.E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FEDERAL GRANT SOUGHT FOR QUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's supervisors agreed Tuesday to apply for a $5-million federal 
earthquake relief grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would go a long way toward funding more than $13 million worth of 
improvement projects targeted by county analysts in a report last week, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the $13.5-million wish list are repairs to reservoirs in Simi Valley, 
Fillmore and Piru damaged by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Other projects include constructing a bridge over Tapo Street near the 
Brandeis-Bardin industrial park in Simi Valley, installing emergency generators 
in Fillmore to increase the city's water-pumping capacity and improving roads 
cracked by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The completed grant application must reach Washington by the end of the month, 
and a decision is expected by Jan. 15, Chief Administrative Officer Richard 
Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg told board members that there is a good chance of getting the U.S. 
Department of Commerce award because of discussions several board members had 
with Secretary Ron Brown when he visited Southern California after the 
earthquake. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY OFFERS HALF-BLOCK DOWNTOWN FOR $100 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council on Tuesday agreed to sell one-half block in the city's 
downtown for $100 -- but only if the buyer builds 28 townhouses on the land and 
sells them to low- and moderate-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials said the land -- appraised at about $672,000 -- would be 
handed over for virtually nothing to keep the home prices down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a gift," said Councilman Andres Herrera. "It's an investment . . . 
to provide housing." 
</P>
<P>
 But poverty attorney Barbara Macri-Ortiz argued that the city was not getting 
its money's worth from the developer, who she said will make about $376,000 on 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The townhouses are expected to sell for between $94,000 and $127,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard paid about $1 million to buy the property and demolish old homes, said 
Oxnard Community Development Director Richard Maggio. In addition, the city 
underwrote about $257,000 in sewer and water improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The undeveloped 1.3-acre parcel between 6th and 7th streets and west of B 
Street is where the Oxnard Farmers' Market is now held. The market will be 
relocated next to nearby Plaza Park on North 5th Street, Maggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the original agreement proposed by Heritage Park Partners, the developer 
would have provided only nine of 28 low- and moderate-income housing units as 
required by law in a redevelopment zone such as downtown Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Partners in the development are Orange County architect David Ball and Ventura 
businessman Dennis Howarth. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council placed restrictions on the prices of all the homes so Oxnard 
can deduct the $1-million purchase from the amount it is required to spend on 
affordable housing in the city's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, 20% of all property tax collected by the Redevelopment Agency 
must be used for affordable housing. But Oxnard had not kept up with the 
requirement, falling $1.9 million behind. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: $700 OKD TO TRAIN SUPERVISORS-ELECT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taxpayers will spend up to $700 to provide training for the two candidates 
elected to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members agreed Tuesday to pay for a series of orientation seminars aimed 
at educating the supervisors-elect on the various duties of a county 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor-elect Frank Schillo, who will represent the Thousand Oaks area, 
said he attended the initial orientation in Long Beach on Tuesday on his way 
back from a trip to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very helpful to get started to understand the rules and regulations 
with having to be a supervisor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Mikels, who will take over Vicky Howard's seat on the Board of 
Supervisors representing Simi Valley, Moorpark and the Santa Rosa Valley, said 
she was too busy to attend the Long Beach seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mikels said she may attend the two follow-up orientations that are 
scheduled in Northern California next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really helpful, but I've done several of those types of training 
seminars with the League of California Cities," Mikels said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board on Tuesday agreed to cover the $350 registration costs for each to 
attend the seminar series. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; FIRE AT APARTMENT DISPLACES 2 FAMILIES

 Two families were left homeless Tuesday afternoon when their adjoining Santa 
Paula apartments were damaged by fire, according to the Ventura County Chapter 
of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the blaze at 130 W. Harvard Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire caused major damage to an upstairs apartment, forcing seven people to 
flee, including a 4-month-old girl. The downstairs neighbors -- a family of 
five -- were also forced from their home because of smoke and water damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Both families were placed temporarily in motel rooms and provided with meals 
at a local restaurant, said Richard Rink, disaster services director for the 
Red Cross chapter. IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; SHOPPING CENTER NEAR AIRPORT OKD 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council on Tuesday rejected a recommendation by the city 
Planning Commission and approved a shopping center across from an Oxnard 
Airport runway. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots groups opposed the project, arguing that it will increase the potential 
for disaster if a plane crashes while taking off or landing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned about a lack of a common-sense approach here," said David 
Ousley, president of the Ventura County Aviation Assn. "There is no 
(environmental impact report). . . . You have a moral obligation to make the 
area around the airport safe."  
</P>
<P>
 Citing potential safety hazards, the Planning Commission voted last month to 
block the project northeast of Ventura Road and 5th Street, which would include 
an Albertsons supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 But the City Council approved the project unanimously, because all buildings 
are outside the airport's safety zone and runway protection zone, the areas 
where stores and shops are prohibited by the county's airport Land Use Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration reviewed the project and also found that 
the buildings would not present a problem, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A significant portion of the shopping center's parking lot will be located 
within the safety zone, however. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

 The national trend of leasing instead of buying new cars appears to be bad 
news for cities who rely on auto dealers to generate tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern is especially high in Huntington Beach, with its Beach Boulevard row 
of car dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Several studies found that Huntington Beach may be losing $500,000 to $1 
million a year in tax revenue because of consumer desires to lease instead of 
buy. Car leases provide cities with less sales and use taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, nearly 50% of all car transactions are financed through 
leasing arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach officials are completing a report on the issue, which will be 
presented to the City Council. Today 
</P>
<P>
 The Placentia Chamber of Commerce is getting a jump on the holiday party rush. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will hold a pre-Thanksgiving mixer at the International House of 
Pancakes, 131 N. Kraemer Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber officials said the meeting will give business people a chance to meet 
and talk with their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 The mixer runs from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. The restaurant is at Kraemer Boulevard 
and Chapman Avenue. Information: (714) 528-7838.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; CHARITY AUCTION FOCUSES ON FANTASY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fantasy is the theme of an auction and dinner scheduled for Camarillo on 
Saturday to benefit Catholic Charities of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic Charities Director A. Diane Martell said 21 donated "fantasy 
packages" will be auctioned at the event, including a seven-day Mexican Riviera 
cruise for two, a trip to the Grand Canyon and vacations in Ojai and New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in keeping with the fantasy theme, guests will be able to purchase $25 
"fantasy balloons," with mystery prizes attached worth between $25 and $200, 
Martell said. In addition, a magician is scheduled to perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Martell said the idea is to make fantasies come true, not just for bidders who 
attend the $100-a-person benefit at Spanish Hills Country Club, but for people 
who will be helped with the money raised. 
</P>
<P>
 "The event is to benefit those families in Ventura County for whom three meals 
a day is a fantasy, those children for whom a permanent place to call home is a 
fantasy," Martell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said they hope the auction will raise $30,000 to help fund Catholic 
Charities' social services, counseling, child care and elder care programs, 
which last year served more than 29,000 people in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The dinner is scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m., with the auction to follow. For 
tickets or more information call Catholic Charities at 643-4694. IRA E. STOLL

<P>
 Hoping to improve the flow of traffic on Simi Valley thoroughfares, the City 
Council has agreed to install two new signals and upgrade three others. 
</P>
<P>
 New traffic lights will be installed at Alamo Street and Texas Avenue and at 
Royal Avenue and Vaquero Drive, the council agreed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, red left-turn arrows will be removed from the intersections of 
Bonita Drive and Madera Road, Cochran Street and Galena Avenue, and at Cochran 
and Stearns streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Removing the red arrows will allow vehicles more time to turn, traffic 
engineer Bill Golubics said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will spend $156,000 on the project. SARA CATANIA

 With more than $3.5 million in housing assistance available to residents whose 
homes were damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake, the Simi Valley City Council has 
hired a consultant to handle the funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, 336 loans and grants ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 will be 
awarded to needy residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has received more than 250 applications, and many residents will 
qualify for both a loan and a grant, said Dulce Conde-Sierra, deputy director 
of housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They continue coming in," she said. "The city is the last resort for 
assistance, and many people are just getting to the point where they realize 
they need some additional help." 
</P>
<P>
 The city will pay Comprehensive Housing Services of Fountain Valley $367,000 
to administer the program over an 18-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring a consultant rather than performing the work in-house will save the 
city about $83,000, according to a study reviewed by the council. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CITY SUBSIDIZES POLICE CAR PURCHASE

<P>
 Faced with a substantial increase in the cost of police cars, the Simi Valley 
Police Department will receive a subsidy from the city to buy seven new 
cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday agreed to pitch in an additional $23,000 to help 
cover the cost of the Chevrolet Caprices, which have increased in price by 
$5,000 each since last year, according to a staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices have gone up because General Motors stopped subsidizing the sale of 
police cars, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cruisers, which are purchased through the County of Los Angeles 
Cooperative Purchasing Program, now cost about $19,800 each. The department 
replaces police cars at 85,000 miles. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; COMMISSIONER WON'T SEEK REAPPOINTMENT 
</P>

<P>
 After four years as chairman of the Moorpark Planning Commission, Michael 
Wesner said he has had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointed to the post in 1990 by Mayor Paul Lawrason, Wesner said increased 
business at his private consulting firm precludes him from seeking another 
two-year appointment to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision is based completely on new demands from my job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Wesner backed out of a bid to run for the City Council because of 
his job commitments, he said. A computer consultant for law firms, Wesner said 
he recently received an offer that requires him to spend about 60% of his time 
out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wouldn't be able to attend the meetings every Monday night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointments to the Planning Commission are made by the mayor upon 
recommendation by the City Council. At least four residents have submitted 
their names for the post, including onetime Councilwoman Eloise Brown. The city 
will accept applications until Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 "I expect we'll make the appointments by the end of the month," Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning commissioners select which member will serve as chair.  
</P>
<P>
 Wesner said he would not rule out a future bid for public office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really totally depends on my private needs -- my first priority is my 
family and then comes work," he said. "I will remain involved at some level 
though." SCOTT HADLY

LIGHT RAIN TO DIMINISH BY MID-MORNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A storm front moving in from Central California is expected to bring light to 
moderate rainfall to Orange County this morning, weather forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain should begin countywide around dawn but taper off by mid-morning, said 
meteorologists with WeatherData Inc. However, showers may continue through 
mid-afternoon in isolated areas in the county, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm should drop between .10 of an inch and .50 of an inch of rain across 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look like that much precipitation," Curtis Brack of WeatherData 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 By tonight, skies should be clear and low temperatures in the 40s, Brack said.

PROGRAM TEACHES A NEW LESSON IN LIFE FOR THOSE WITH CEREBRAL PALSY; EDUCATION: 
ADULT SCHOOL AIMS AT FOSTERING LEARNING AMONG STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN DENIED 
MAINSTREAM INSTRUCTION BECAUSE OF DISABILITIES. 
</P>

 Rita Batcheler has cerebral palsy. But don't think of her as a victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that people don't do justice to the physically disabled," the 
56-year-old said Tuesday, speaking slowly and strongly from her quilt-covered 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Batcheler is one of 29 people with cerebral palsy participating in an unusual 
program at the Conejo Valley adult school, designed to encourage and educate 
those who have been denied mainstream schooling because of their disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have developed here is a program that takes the individual seriously 
and expects that he or she can produce and achieve goals," program director 
Darrell Potts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, programs for the disabled have focused on baby-sitting, not 
educating, he said. But that is not the case in Thousand Oaks, where the Adult 
Education-United Cerebral Palsy program has operated for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of programs like this have been shoved away to church basements and 
business complexes," Potts explained. "Most people with cerebral palsy are 
intellectually fine. . . . (But) they have been left out of the educational 
loop." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 700,000 people in the United States have cerebral palsy, a nervous 
system disorder that impairs motor functions such as speech and muscular 
movement. It is the most widespread lifetime disability in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 United Cerebral Palsy of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties administers the 
program in Thousand Oaks in conjunction with the Conejo Valley Unified School 
District. It is funded by state and federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the program's students -- or "clients" as they prefer to be called -- 
live in a cerebral palsy hostel in Westlake Village. Five days a week, they 
attend classes at the adult school from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a wide range of intellectual capabilities," Potts said. "Some people 
are still working on numbers. On the other hand, we have a few who are taking 
classes at Moorpark College two days a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Most participants attend exercise, language and computer classes each day. In 
the exercise class, men and women are able to leave their wheelchairs and roam 
the campus with the assistance of specially designed walkers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the computer class, the program's clients learn to type using customized 
keyboards, some powered by mouthpieces or sensitive kneepads. 
</P>
<P>
 One unique aspect of the program is a volunteer work project, where 
participants work part-time jobs in the Thousand Oaks area. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Runnfeldt, 41, works at Longs Drugs in Westlake Village every other 
Wednesday stocking shelves, a job she has enjoyed for the past eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," she said. "It makes me feel like I'm helping people." 
</P>
<P>
 But in return, Runnfeldt wishes people would look beyond her disability to see 
her as a person. Her frustrations are renewed every time a child stops and 
stares at her wheelchair, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they see me they ask their parents, 'What's the matter with her?' " she 
said. "It usually gets me upset, so I try to ignore it the best I can." 
</P>
<P>
 The men and women in the program are extremely image conscious because they 
have been treated as children all their lives, Potts explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Movies and news articles often perpetuate those stereotypes. As a result, the 
program's participants and staff members constantly strive to educate beyond 
the campus borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are dealt a label," Potts said. "It creates untrue, negative images."

SIMI APPROVES ICE RINK COMPLEX TO HELP YOUTHS AND ECONOMY; RECREATION: PROJECT 
WILL INCLUDE RESTAURANTS, SHOPS AND GYM. COUNCIL IS WARNED OF NOISE AND 
CONGESTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed Simi Valley ice rink and shopping center have won approval after 
the City Council decided that the economic boost and teen appeal of the project 
are worth the potential increase in noise and traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite long and loud protests from neighbors of the $20-million Iceoplex and 
grocery store complex, the council merely tinkered with the project's design 
before approving it unanimously late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The project calls for an array of services and activities for children and 
adults, including restaurants, shops, medical offices, a gym, pool hall and 
video arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 At the corner of Madera Road and Royal Avenue, the complex could ultimately 
grow to nearly 300,000 square feet built on 29 acres. The skating rink would 
open in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel pretty comfortable that they can solve many of the noise and traffic 
problems in the way they design the project," Councilwoman Sandi Webb said. "If 
these concerns are not met later on in the design process, we'll deal with it 
then." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 residents showed up at the council meeting to root for their 
side through a four-hour hearing. The council heard from 32 speakers -- 18 in 
favor, 14 opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters, pleading for more activities for the city's youths, showed a 
videotape of happy skaters at an Iceoplex in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The skating complex will host skating workshops and fund-raisers for the 
community, said Brad Berman, a partner for Iceoplex, which also operates 
centers in Fremont and Pittsburgh, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do proactive events to raise funds for really good causes," Berman said. 
"And we give a lot of young people something to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Candy Bosson said the complex would be a welcome convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a single parent, I can't think of anything better," Bosson said. "I can do 
a little grocery shopping, work out, and spend some family time with my 
daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Many opponents said they favored the ice rink, but not the traffic-heavy 
Albertson's grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 But the developers said they could not afford the rink without the adjoining 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Ken Constable presented a petition signed by 500 residents opposed to 
the project. The petition outlined several areas of concern, including traffic 
and safety, noise and pollution and compatibility with the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 One opponent, who said his house is a mere 210 feet from the planned grocery 
store loading dock, used elaborate diagrams to illustrate the disruptive effect 
of delivery trucks rumbling in at all hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, sporting stickers with "Save Our Simi" in large red letters, praised 
the proposed ice rink, but decried the construction of a grocery store in an 
already congested neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Wood Ranch project manager Craig Messi argued that another grocery store 
in the neighborhood would ruin business for the Ralph's at the Wood Ranch 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 To place another market within a mile of the Ralphs "would be very 
detrimental," Messi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A new market would cause us to struggle to stay alive as a viable center," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Judy Mikels scolded Messi, saying he was asking the council 
to overregulate development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we zone an area to allow commercial development, it is not our job to 
say what can or can't go in there," Mikels said. "We set the guidelines and 
send them off to make it work." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Davis, who objected to the boxy strip mall design of the 
project, led the council in directing the developer to make the project more 
aesthetically pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it is laid out now is just like a strip mall," Davis said. "Square 
building, square building, square building." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the council asked for "a pedestrian-oriented, village atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also chose a "Monterey Cannery" design, which includes corrugated 
metal roofing.

PGA GETS READY FOR FIGHT AS FOX PLANS NEW GOLF TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a development certain to send shock waves through men's professional golf, 
Fox Broadcasting said Tuesday it plans to co-sponsor a new golf tour in 1995. 
But PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said he won't let any PGA professionals 
play in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox would co-sponsor the tour with Executive Sports, an event management firm 
in Delray Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox reportedly plans to televise about eight tournaments in which 30 to 40 
players would compete. Total prize money would be in excess of $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 PGA Tour encompassed 50 events with prize money of $82 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox spokesman Vince Wladika told the Associated Press that Executive Sports 
approached Fox with the new golf tour proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Norman, who has sought a world tour for golf's top players for a long 
time, met with Executive Sports officials at Sherwood Country Club, where his 
Franklin Funds Shark Shootout will be played beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman, who did not return phone calls, is said to have called a players' 
meeting Wednesday afternoon at Sherwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The PGA Tour earlier Tuesday released a statement by Finchem about the new Fox 
tour, even though there has been no official announcement of the tour's 
creation. 
</P>
<P>
 Photocopies of Finchem's statement were left in players' lockers at Sherwood 
where the golfers played a practice round Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Finchem said the PGA Tour supports more international 
competition, but only if such projects meet certain rules: They must benefit 
golf, have the support of all golf organizations and be structured to help 
existing tours. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Finchem kept score, the game's over. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our view, the proposal from Fox and Executive Sports, as we understand it, 
fails to meet any of these three criteria," Finchem said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Finchem also said that if the 1995 Fox tour is staged as planned, the PGA Tour 
will fulfill its network television agreements as well as its contracts with 
title sponsors and tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Finchem said the PGA Tour will provide players for 1995 
tournaments and said he will do it, "by enforcing our television release and 
conflicting event regulations." 
</P>
<P>
 The PGA Tour does not allow players in its membership to play in events that 
are played at the same time as its events. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed golf tour would give Fox its third major sports property. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox outbid CBS for the rights to the NFL'S NFC package, agreeing to pay $1.58 
billion over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox also has an agreement to televise NHL games if the season begins. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hill, the president of Fox Sports, who could not be reached for comment 
Tuesday night, has previously expressed interest in also getting into the 
boxing business.

NAVRATILOVA LOSES, LEAVES TENNIS BEHIND; RETIREMENT: DEFEAT TO SABATINI AT 
VIRGINIA SLIMS CHAMPIONSHIP AND CLOSING CEREMONY BRING END TO SPECTACULAR 
SINGLES CAREER.

 The spotlight is turned off but the light doesn't dim. That's the way some 
champions leave. There are other ways. Some limp off, some are led away in 
handcuffs. Some are taken away on gurneys and leave their careers in an 
operating room. 
</P>
<P>
 A few, very few, leave when their careers are at their apogee. The great 
athletes anticipate the downward arc, hate the idea of it and leave rather than 
face it. 
</P>
<P>
 Martina Navratilova, 38, left singles competition Tuesday night in the same 
way she had joined it: fighting, snarling, conjuring just how she might win 
this point and then the next. Tennis lost its winningest player ever, when 
Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina rose to her opponent's level and eliminated 
Navratilova, 6-4, 6-2, from the Virginia Slims Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing play in the doubles competition, she will go into happy 
retirement after 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-anticipated match was often interrupted by spontaneous cheerleading 
from the crowd of 17,131 in Madison Square Garden. From them she gained 
approval and sustenance. The crowd did not chastise Sabatini, but was 
indifferent to her. Sabatini hardly noticed, such was her focus. Afterward, she 
was a gracious and conflicted winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the one side, I didn't want to be the one to beat her, on the other side 
it was a great honor to beat her," she said. "I got to know Martina off the 
court. I have to say that she is a great person." 
</P>
<P>
 The match was spectacular. Each point was fraught with import. Navratilova 
doggedly returned to the net even as Sabatini slid passing shots to every 
corner. Navratilova at the net is the purest expression of her defiance: Here, 
I will win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got blown off the court by somebody who was playing in another zone," 
Navratilova said. "If I had to lose a match, I guess I want to lose to Gabriela 
Sabatini rather than anyone else. Because she's a good human being." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabatini never cracked. She appeared calm in a manner that she has only 
sporadically shown before. Her game was all pinpoint lobs and sweeping topspin 
backhands launched from a swing that began somewhere in Buenos Aires. She 
pleased herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have played like that in moments in the last few weeks, but I have not been 
as consistent," Sabatini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steffi Graf defeated Brenda Schultz, 7-5, 6-3, and Jana Novotna defeated Iva 
Majoi, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, to advance in the $3.5 million season-ending tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Sabatini-Navratilova match the crowd clapped rhythmically 
anticipating Navratilova's retirement ceremony. A rope snaked down from the 
Garden ceiling, and was attached to a red and yellow banner puddled on the 
floor. The lights dimmed. Navratilova strode into the spotlight with an armful 
of flowers and a box of tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 As the banner was hoisted it revealed itself -- a field of red, within it a 
yellow tennis ball with the year 1994 on it, and, beneath, "Martina 
Navratilova" in huge white letters.  
</P>
<P>
 Urged on by shouts and cheers, Navratilova's banner was raised to the rafters 
of Madison Square Garden, placing her among the memories of the Knicks and 
Rangers. The first woman to be so elevated. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the presents. The women's tour made Navratilova a gift of a pearl 
white Harley Davidson. When Navratilova caught sight of the low-slung 
motorcycle being wheeled into the arena, she jumped up and down like a 
delighted child, jumped astride it and varoom-varoomed and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova is said to have inherited her nerves and emotions from her mother, 
who, during the postgame ceremony, stood on her tiptoes to see over 
photographers. With one hand she clutched her handbag and with the other she 
dabbed at tears. Later, Jana Navratilova could be seen hugging any available 
torso. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Navratilova has left, thoughts turn to what she has left behind. The 
legacy. She introduced weight training and vein-popping physical play to the 
women's tour. Her new-found strength drove a reluctant Chris Evert into a gym. 
For that alone, Navratilova may have contributed to the career longevity of 
players on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Her serve-and-volley game introduced the net to ranks of cloned baseliners who 
before had seen it only as an impediment to a serve. At the net, Navratilova 
allowed other players to see a potential weapon that offered possibility and 
dynamism to a game that had grown static and unyielding at the back of the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 She exposed to the world her intense competitiveness and never apologized, 
thus allowing a generation of women to fight too. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's terms, the length of Navratilova's career is not likely to be 
duplicated. Few players can expect to last half as long as Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova is excited about starting the second phase of her life even as she 
has described retirement as "hurtling into a question mark." 
</P>
<P>
 She leaves one passion and moves to others, telling the crowd, "So many 
friends I have here that I only have because of tennis. So I have to thank 
tennis for my life. Tonight is one night when I have a smile on my face and on 
my heart. Thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will miss this game, but I'm ready for my new life," she said.

THE RIVALRY: UCLA VS. USC; STRENGTH IN NUMBERS; USC TACKLE BOSELLI ADDED BULK 
AND IMPROVED HIS PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When you fill up a doorway and look as if you could bench-press a Buick, what 
do you do when your football coach tells you you're not strong enough? 
</P>
<P>
 If you're Don Anthony Boselli Jr., you head straight to the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach (John) Robinson really didn't need to tell me that," said Tony Boselli, 
a senior offensive tackle who rises to 6 feet 8 and weighs 320 pounds. "I'd 
already made up my mind last year I'd be a lot stronger for this season." 
</P>
<P>
 He has been highly regarded since his freshman season, but never, coaches, 
opponents and pro scouts agree, has he been as dominating as he has been this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be the first lineman taken in the draft," predicted Tom Boisture, 
player personnel director for the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Arizona Coach Dick Tomey: "The pro scouts who come to our practices after 
being at SC's tell me he's the best in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson says Boselli has passed the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "A defensive player can make two great plays in a game and people can remember 
that for years -- it's like hitting home runs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But to be recognized as a great offensive lineman, you need a long stretch of 
consistently great play over a long period of time, and Tony's done that." 
</P>
<P>
 Last January, Robinson and Mike Barry, who coaches the offensive line, 
discussed motivating Boselli to be an even better player. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, Robinson saw Boselli in Heritage Hall and called him into 
his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me I was a very good player, but he said he wanted me to be a great 
player," Boselli said. "He said if I raised my upper-body strength, I could 
take my game to the next level." 
</P>
<P>
 The pass and run blocking of left tackle Boselli and sophomore right tackle 
Norberto Garrido are credited by Barry for USC's five-game winning streak since 
a loss to Oregon on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 On the last two Saturdays, Boselli neutralized two respected defensive ends in 
Trojan victories -- Washington State's DeWayne Patterson and Arizona's Tedy 
Bruschi. Bruschi, who couldn't get past Boselli, eventually went to the other 
side and had similar luck against Garrido. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony has played well all year -- we knew that going in -- and he played 
extremely well against us," said Arizona defensive coordinator Larry Mac Duff. 
"He's the best offensive tackle we've been up against this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Boselli showed up at summer training camp weighing 295 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted more quickness last year, and I had that but I never really felt 
strong," he said. "Not nearly as strong as I feel now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked harder in the last off-season than I've ever worked in my life. I 
lifted a lot with Norberto and he really pushed me -- he's the strongest guy on 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I did the physical stuff I had to do. And I think I did the mental part, 
just making up my mind that I was going to play harder, that I was going to be 
a better player." 
</P>
<P>
 Boselli also credits a teammate from last year, linebacker-defensive end 
Willie McGinest, now of the New England Patriots. They collided in every USC 
scrimmage last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Willie's still the best player I've ever played against," Boselli said. 
"Working against him every day, that made me a better player and I hope he 
feels the same about me." 
</P>
<P>
 Between weight room sessions last summer, Boselli found time to work on the 
Coliseum reconstruction project, along with his roommate, quarterback Rob 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Boselli was sized up early as a world-class mule and he was assigned to 
hauling lumber. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much fun. And for a guy who in a year figures to draw a six-figure salary, 
it was a look at the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 "In football, even in two-a-days, you get long breaks," he said. "And there's 
an off-season. I was tired after my shift, and I found it hard to work out in 
the weight room at night. And construction workers work that hard all year 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Barry, hard work was the key to Boselli's improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day last winter in the weight room, I challenged him," Barry said. "I 
said to him, 'You know, you really haven't done anything yet. You made a couple 
All-American teams. You're sort of a third-place bowl game.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some nerve. This is a 5-11, 48-year-old coach telling a 320-pound 22-year-old 
-- with barbells in his hands -- he hadn't amounted to much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took it to heart," Boselli said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted very much to be as good a player as I could be. I wanted the same 
thing they did. Both Robinson and Barry challenged me." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry says it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a dominating tackle right now, and from the Oregon State game (Oct. 8) 
to now, if you charted his performance game to game, it'd be a rising line all 
the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, such a line would have dropped to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 At Arizona, in the fifth game of the season, Boselli went down in the first 
quarter with a dislocated kneecap. He sat out five games, but some were 
surprised he didn't sit out the rest of the season. He played in the last three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy that size, to come back that quickly from an injury like that, that 
showed me something about his character," said the Giants' Boisture. 
</P>
<P>
 Boselli said he briefly contemplated leaving school to make himself available 
for this year's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Robinson told me in our meeting that by getting stronger and playing 
harder this season, I'd stand much better in this year's draft, and I guess he 
was right about that too," Boselli said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason I thought about it at all last year was the frustration over 
the injury. The money wouldn't have had anything to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Boselli sounds like a Trojan blueblood. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm 50, I want to come back here and have people remember me," he said. 
"That's the part about SC I like the most, the football alumni tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Boselli could conceivably wind up back at USC as a 21st-century graduate 
student, when his NFL career ends. 
</P>
<P>
 He was awarded an $18,000 postgraduate fellowship last month by the National 
Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame. It's good for life, and Boselli 
said he would save it for after his NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
 And when he's 50, probably the best-known Tony Boselli story will still be in 
circulation. It will be the one about Scotty Lewis, a Baylor defensive end who 
trash-talked his way into near-dismemberment the night of Sept. 24, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, the week of the USC game, had a phone interview with a Daily Trojan 
reporter. He was thought to be one of the Southwest's best defensive linemen, 
but is better known now for his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Among some utterances about Boselli that Lewis came to regret: "He's 
overrated. He's a much better pass blocker than a run blocker." 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson taped the story to Boselli's locker. 
</P>
<P>
 Result: If the Boselli-Lewis matchup had been a fight, it would have been 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 On one run block, Boselli drove Lewis 20 yards downfield, into the end zone, 
where he pancaked him. Boselli then stood over Lewis, glaring, while Baylor 
trainers tried to revive their fallen stalwart. 
</P>
<P>
 After viewing films of Boselli's destruction of Lewis, Robinson approached 
Boselli and said, "You played very well. But is that it for you this season? Do 
you have any other games like that left in you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out he did.

MIKE DOWNEY: BAIT A PAIR OF HOOKS, THROW IN LINES, CATCH WORM, WEBBER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Webber's agent has been quoted extensively as to why the Clippers should 
make a big-money offer to Chris Webber. Duh, I wonder why Chris Webber's agent 
would want more money for Chris Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Make him the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Make him an offer he can't refuse, Donald Sterling, Andy Roeser, Elgin Baylor 
and all you crazy cats over at Clipper Central, because ask yourself the 
age-old Clipper question: "What have we got to lose?" 
</P>
<P>
 Webber would immediately turn the Clippers from the Fab None into the Fab One. 
</P>
<P>
 As currently constructed, the Clippers will become a playoff contender by: (a) 
1996, if they sign their 1995 lotto pick, whoever he shall be; (b) 1998, if 
they sign their next three picks, or (c) 2001, if a comet crashes into the 
planet Jupiter, thereby eliminating the winner of the NBA's Interplanetary 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 With Webber, however, things accelerate. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight: (a) Five-figure crowds start coming to the Sports Arena again; (b) 
The Clippers can begin advertising their own players rather than their 
opponents', and (c) Webber can be a big help to Coach Bill Fitch in calling 
timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 (Provided, of course, Webber can beat out Tony Massenburg or Matt Fish for 
playing time -- a big, big if.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers need help. It is available in two forms -- one, Webber might be 
had for a price, or two, Dennis Rodman might be available if anyone in San 
Antonio can find him. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I don't happen to believe that Rodman would be a smart acquisition for 
the Clippers in a trade, namely because: 
</P>
<P>
 (a) First thing you know, those navel and nipple earrings get infected and 
Dennis has to be benched; (b) Madonna starts showing up and causes a ruckus by 
dating all 11 other Clippers, and (c) Rodman averages around 0 points a game, 
and there are already enough Clippers averaging 0 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, let's talk Lakers. There isn't a player alive that the 
Lakers could use more right now than Dennis Rodman. Fact is, the Lakers can't 
rebound to save their lives. If they could, they would have playoff potential 
and I mean right now. And maybe Magic Johnson could find the Worm's number on 
his Apple computer and persuade him to show up for practice once or twice a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, San Antonio isn't likely to aid a club in its conference, no 
matter how nutty Rodman is. Same way Golden State isn't likely to let Webber 
come to terms with either Los Angeles club, no matter how high the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 But why not try? 
</P>
<P>
 Come on, Clippers, see what Webber wants. He is 6 feet 10, 250 pounds, and, 
unlike any other Clipper, he could start for any team in the league. Webber's 
presence would keep the Clippers from: (a) challenging the NBA's worst record 
of all time; (b) drawing 4,000 fans and announcing it as 8,000, and (c) I don't 
know what (c) is exactly but I'll bet it's bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yeah: 
</P>
<P>
 (c) We wouldn't have to drive all the way to The Pond just to see a player 
named Fish. 
</P>
<P>
 No other NBA team has a $3.5-million annual salary slot open, as the Clippers 
do. We are all aware that Webber, who majored at Michigan in greed, would 
demand payment of $3.5 million a year for, oh, around 40 years. But, my 
friends, Chris Webber would also become the greatest Clipper in Clipper 
history. Instantly. Now. Today. The best. Ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Up there in Oakland, young Chris has all but filed for a divorce from Warrior 
Coach Don Nelson on the grounds of incompatibility. He says he would gladly go 
to the Washington Bullets (first time anyone has ever made that statement) to 
be reunited with Michigan chum Juwan Howard, who sat beside Webber in their 
Greed 101 class. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors can keep Webber by matching any offer. But will they want to? 
That is the multimillion-dollar question, because Webber could be demanding as 
much as one-tenth of a billion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay this much to a player who publicly dissed and embarrassed you? Yes, the 
Warriors probably would. Then again, maybe they wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 All I wonder is: (a) Do Sterling, Roeser and Baylor intend to sit back and 
watch their current team go 8-74? (b) Wouldn't Webber be better than whoever 
next year's lottery pick is? and (c) Come to think of it, wouldn't a place 
called The Pond be a nice place for a Webber? More Mike Downey

WITH PREMIUM ON UNLEASHED FURY, BOXING HAS GIVEN JAMES TONEY . . . ; LICENSE TO 
RAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps only in boxing is uncontrollable rage something to be nurtured rather 
than reported to the proper authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 James Toney is, by all appearances, a two-fisted time bomb, unfit for 
circulation in the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Miller, the fighter's 74-year-old trainer, acknowledges that the anger 
that makes Toney unbeatable in the ring makes him frightening outside it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell him a lot of times, 'Young man, if there wasn't any game like boxing, 
you would self-destruct,' " Miller says. "You can't take that type of mental 
attitude out in the business world every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Where would Toney be if not for boxing? 
</P>
<P>
 "Dead," Miller says without hesitation. "Out there today, these kids carry 
pistols. They shoot each other. Who's going to fight him fair? I tell him all 
the time, 'James, all the tough guys are dead.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Kallen, Toney's 48-year-old manager, knows her hell-bent champion will 
someday have to walk the streets as Joe Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 It scares her. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the plumber shows up late, you can't just come up and slam him to the 
ground," she says. "You have to deal with people." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, though, rage has paid Toney nice dividends. There is time later for 
therapy to purge his demons, to psychoanalyze how a man's father might come to 
shoot his mother six times while cradling a baby -- James -- in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The prescription so far has been to harness Toney's raw energy and pent-up 
anger and then unleash it with calculated detonations between the ropes every 
few months, cash a paycheck, then line up the next victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney, you might say, is Jackie Kallen's Manhattan Project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's helped me 46 times," Toney says. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney is 44-0-2, is considered one of the world's best pound-for-pound 
fighters and is poised to defend his International Boxing Federation super 
middleweight title against Roy Jones Jr. on Friday night at the MGM Grand in 
Las Vegas, where people are walking on eggshells. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney, 26, is the modern-day Jake LaMotta, the original Raging Bull who is 
Toney's inspiration. Toney rehearses his part daily in West Hollywood at Mickey 
Rourke's Outlaw Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent day, the fighter stopped training cold and cleared the room with 
thunderous authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get the . . . out!!" he yelled from the ring. "I just don't give a . . . You 
all understand English? I just don't give a . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Toney minions, well conditioned to his outbursts, executed the order. 
</P>
<P>
 This, apparently, is standard operating procedure before a fight. Anything can 
set Toney off and sometimes it is as simple as Toney's seeing a person in the 
gym he does not like. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to let him simmer down," Kallen says. "If you put your hand in 
boiling water, you're going to get burned. There's nothing anyone can say to 
control him. You can't. You learn. It's like a red alert, like a tornado 
warning. You hear it and get out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 It is all part of the process. But it's never comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only place where it's appropriate," Kallen says of Toney's behavior. 
"If he was an assassin, I could see him going out and going, boom-boom, walking 
away and going to eat a hot dog. Literally. I'm used to it. I'm willing to work 
with it. I don't say I condone it. It's not about accepting it, it's about the 
fact that this is what he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Kallen knows the wild mood swings are not normal. Toney, at one moment, can be 
unabashedly sweet, playful as a kitten, lavishing Kallen with diamond rings, 
pink teddy bears, $100 sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The next, she's running for the storm shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or not, this is a kinder, gentler Toney, a Peace Corps volunteer 
compared to the person Kallen met when she and the boxer first crossed paths. 
</P>
<P>
 That was 1989, Detroit. Kallen, a former entertainment columnist before she 
became Tommy Hearns' publicist in 1978, walked in on a sparring session at 
about the time Toney was trying to break Tom Dempsey's field goal record with a 
spit bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Who is that? And what's wrong with him?' " Kallen recalls. "Someone 
said 'That's James Toney. He's crazy.' I thought, 'Hmm, that's interesting.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Toney, from Ann Arbor, Mich., was a street thug who, at 16, had already shot a 
man and exchanged dope for dollars. Toney's first manager, known as Johnny Ace, 
had a crack cocaine distribution business going on the side until he was gunned 
down in a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just talked to him, right?" Toney says. "A half-hour later, he got 
blown away." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone kept leaving Toney. He never knew his father, also James and also a 
fighter. Only recently did Toney learn that when he was 3 months old, his 
father shot his mother, Sherri, while she was holding James. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherri survived and lived to become one of her son's inspirations. Toney's 
father later went to prison on a rape charge. He is expected to be released 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney has not tied a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree. In fact, his 
family won't tell him when James Sr. is getting out. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . my dad," Toney said. "I'm glad he's not around me now because my butt 
would be where he is, in prison. Because I'd have to kill him." 
</P>
<P>
 Toney formed his life philosophy early. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like people because you don't know who to trust," he says. "People 
you can trust go ahead and stab you in the back at the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Kallen has always had a soft spot for problem cases. She is married and has 
two grown children, but always imagined herself running a home for waywards. 
She has been a steadying influence.  
</P>
<P>
 Kallen's devotion apparently knows no bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's in the cards to be shot by one of my fighters, maybe that's a fitting 
way to go," she says. "Trying to save someone's life." 
</P>
<P>
 Most saw the savage in Toney but she saw the salvageable. 
</P>
<P>
 "To see somebody pick up a chair and slam it through a window, or put his fist 
through a glass door, or pick up a scale and throw it across the room, I had 
not seen that kind of rage," Kallen says. "It wasn't in my background." 
</P>
<P>
 She also saw a menacing, tenacious fighter who liked what he did for a living 
and was willing to take on all comers. Kallen hounded matchmakers for bouts 
until Toney emerged from obscurity in May 1991, when he scored a technical 
knockout over Michael Nunn, then the International Boxing Federation 
middleweight champion, in the 11th round. 
</P>
<P>
 At the weigh-in, Nunn had playfully patted his opponent on the head. Toney 
blew all circuits and the fighters had to be separated. 
</P>
<P>
 That prefight scene has been played out many times since. 
</P>
<P>
 After the George Foreman-Michael Moorer fight this month, Toney told Jones 
during a television interview: "I'll knock your punk ass out." 
</P>
<P>
 They keep lining up the best fighters in the business, and Toney keeps mowing 
them down -- Nunn, Iran Barkley, Tim Littles, Prince Charles Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Running out of challengers, Toney says the Jones fight will be his last at 168 
pounds. Toney, who struggles to make his fighting weight, plans to eat his way 
into the heavyweight division within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants a piece of the action in a division where some boxers -- Michael 
Moorer to name one -- claim not even to enjoy fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roy (Jones), he don't like to fight either," Toney says of Friday's opponent. 
"I like to fight. If you don't like to fight, you shouldn't be in the game. But 
it always shows, like Michael Moorer -- Bam! -- knocked out. Now he can retire 
and be a cop like he always said he wanted to be. I'll knock out Roy Jones and 
he can retire and become a basketball player, like he always wanted to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like boxing. When I lose the desire, I'm going to call it quits. I go to 
every fight card when I'm home. I watch it on TV every Tuesday -- ESPN has its 
shows. I watch it on my satellite." 
</P>
<P>
 Toney is a paradox, a man given to spontaneous bursts of violence, yet a boxer 
steadfastly disciplined when it comes to his career. 
</P>
<P>
 To strengthen his resolve, he purposely trains in the heart of Hollywood, a $5 
cab ride to any temptation. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for theories that boxers must retreat to log-cabin isolation to train 
for big fights. 
</P>
<P>
 From his hotel room, Toney can hear the back beats from the House of Blues. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people have to train outside, in the woods, they're not disciplined," he 
maintains. "I'm a disciplined person. I'm around House of Blues, but believe it 
or not, I haven't been outside my hotel. Only time I'm outside my hotel is to 
go to Gold's Gym. That's a center of attraction right there. They've got movie 
stars, porn stars that work out there. That's temptation right there." 
</P>
<P>
 There is strength in resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out in the woods, I'd probably go crazy, fight everybody in camp." 
</P>
<P>
 As if he doesn't do enough of that anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 They say Toney has simmered. The birth of his daughter, now 23 months, was an 
important step. Toney also plans to marry in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've changed a lot, because I've wanted to change," Toney says. "I don't 
fight as much outside the ring as I used to. I have a daughter -- that's a lot 
of responsibilities right there." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Miller, his trainer: "He's 100% better than he used to be, but he's got 
to get 100% better." 
</P>
<P>
 Axiomatically, Miller says Toney's ring success is related to his temper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once that fire goes out, that's it for James Toney as a fighter," Miller 
says. "That's his makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller puts up with Toney's rages because he recognizes the fighter as one of 
the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "He takes a better punch than Tommy Hearns," Miller says. "Tommy was just as 
vicious in the ring. He didn't have as many outbursts as this kid, but when 
that bell rang he was a different guy. But Tommy would have had big problems 
with this guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Kallen has a game plan to ease Toney back into society once his career is 
over. She hopes to work Toney into her husband's construction business. She 
thinks he will have spent most of his anger by then. 
</P>
<P>
 "His rage, it sort of mellows with age," Kallen says. "You can only be so mad 
for so many years. He's getting a lot of it out through boxing, so hopefully by 
the time he retires, he'll be physically sated, kind of like an overeater. He's 
tasted everything, what more can he taste?" 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, Toney rumbles on, plowing through his rages and sparring partners, 
while others debate who's going to play him in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the media to say James Toney was a great fighter before everybody 
who's an honest person," he says. "That he never ducked nobody. That's all I 
want you to say. I'm delighted the media says I'm like LaMotta, Ray Robinson, 
that I'm a throwback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying I'm better than them or anything like that. I'm just happy to 
be named in that class. Those guys, they were great fighters. I just wish I 
could have seen them fight live."

LANGSTON WINS SIXTH GOLD GLOVE, DEDICATES AWARD TO JIMMIE REESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pitcher Mark Langston of the Angels won his sixth Gold Glove, his fourth in a 
row, on Tuesday and dedicated the award to Jimmie Reese, the longtime Angel 
coach who died this year at age 92. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston started 18 games and had 27 putouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Reese) had a great deal to do with my fielding success, as well as the 
defensive skills of my teammates," Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Mattingly won his record ninth Gold Glove at first base and New York 
Yankee teammate Wade Boggs earned his first at third base in American League 
awards announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle became the first AL outfielder to win five 
consecutive Gold Gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattingly's ninth award, and fourth in a row, moved him past George Scott for 
the most in the AL at first base. Keith Hernandez holds the National League 
record with 11 at the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pride myself on defense and felt this year that we were strong as a team 
defensively," Mattingly said.

USC OPENS POST-RAVELING ERA TONIGHT; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: TROJANS PLAY HOST TO 
NEW MEXICO STATE, DEFENDING BIG WEST CHAMPION, IN PRESEASON NIT OPENER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The post-George Raveling era for USC basketball will officially begin tonight 
when the Trojans play New Mexico State in a first-round Preseason NIT game at 
the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Parker, who was named interim coach for the season after Raveling's 
retirement Monday, will coach his first game against the defending Big West 
champion before a national television audience on ESPN at 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Not an enviable task for any new coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fortunate in that I've been working with the team since the start of the 
season," said Parker, who had been an assistant at USC for the last seven 
years. "It would be more awkward if I had to make the total change today. The 
adjustment isn't that bad, since I've been acting (as head coach) from the 
first day." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker and assistant Jack Fertig had been working as co-coaches since Raveling 
was hospitalized after a traffic accident Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "The circumstances that led to this change are very unfortunate, but it's good 
to know that Coach Raveling had enough confidence to relinquish the job to me," 
said Parker, who was a head coach for six seasons at Wayne State in Detroit. 
"Now it's up to me to get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Mike Garrett said Monday that although Parker is listed as 
an interim coach, the job is his to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect him to win and be dominating right away, but I do hope to see 
that in the future," Garrett said. "I want to see Charlie's style and how he 
relates to kids and how they play for him. Also, to see how our fans like our 
style." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's coaching future is important for USC's recruiting for next season. 
The early signing period for high school seniors ends today and the Trojans are 
behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker and his staff have to play catch-up, now that Raveling -- known for his 
relentless recruiting -- no longer is in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way things happened, we were hurt with early signings," Parker said. "A 
positive thing for us, however, is that a good number of talented players are 
still available because they have not yet committed." 
</P>
<P>
 With three scholarships to give for next season, the Trojans already have 
received a letter of intent from Damion Dawson, a 6-foot-3 point guard from 
Long Beach Poly, and hope to have a commitment from a top recruit from 
Tennessee by the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are still in the picture with the top two players in Southern 
California, Paul Pierce of Inglewood and Tommy Prince of Compton Dominguez, who 
plan to make their choices in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, a 6-foot-7 guard-forward, is regarded as the West Coast's top player 
after averaging 23 points and 10 rebounds a game as a junior. He lists USC 
along with Arizona, California, Nevada Las Vegas, Oregon and UCLA as his top 
six. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, a 6-5 guard-forward, is a versatile player who averaged 15 points and 
eight rebounds a game last season. UNLV, Oregon, UCLA and USC are believed to 
be his final four schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "With so many players signing late, it's to our advantage that they are doing 
that," Parker said. "Hopefully, they'll get a chance to see some exciting 
basketball and for us to win some games." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's up-tempo style may be the best way for the Trojans to win this 
season. Aside from two unproven seven-footers in Kirk Homenick and David 
Crouse, USC will feature a small lineup that already has lost one of its top 
rebounders, senior Tremayne Anchrum, who is sidelined because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to change a few things in picking up the tempo and do more 
gambling-type things on defense," Parker said. "The changes will be gradual but 
we'll have a solid base of what Coach Raveling has already done." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Raveling, USC traditionally was a slow-starting team that peaked for 
Pacific 10 Conference play. In years past, however, the Trojans' preseason 
schedule was dotted with weaker opponents. That will not be the case this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does USC play New Mexico State, but the Trojans will also face 
Temple, Utah, Houston and Southern Methodist before the start of Pac-10 play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to stick together," senior Lorenzo Orr said. "We'll come 
out with a more run-and-gun style. You'll see certain players do things they 
haven't done in the past. We'll have the best of both worlds." 
</P>
<P>
 The question is, will they have enough of those worlds?

NHL STARS WELCOMED HOME BY REBORN RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH KNOBEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five years ago, the Soviet government branded them traitors. Now, they're the 
toast of the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 When Russian hockey stars started to defect from the Soviet Union in 1989 to 
play for big bucks in North America, the government got angry, calling the 
players capitalists and criminals. Soviet fans grew despondent, sure that they 
would never see their favorites skate on Russian ice again. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to a more forgiving Russian government -- and a labor dispute that 
has stalled action in the NHL -- a "Dream Team" of more than 20 Russian NHL 
stars returned home for a recent five-game series against local teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL squad included some of the league's top talent: Sergei Fedorov of the 
Detroit Red Wings, the league's most valuable player last season; Alexander 
Mogilny of the Buffalo Sabres and Pavel Bure of the Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are glad to welcome them in Russia," Oleg Soskovets, Russia's first deputy 
prime minister, said at a gala Kremlin reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past is forgotten. They came to an absolutely new country, to an 
absolutely new society." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the players, like Mogilny, had not been home for years because 
criminal proceedings had been started against them when they left. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a thrill to come back here," he said after the closing game on 
Nov. 7. "Everywhere we went, it was a warm welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 One element of new Russian reality -- tight security -- was particularly 
evident during the tour. Because some Russian NHL players have received threats 
from extortionists in the past, each was protected by round-the-clock 
bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectators had to pass through metal detectors on their way into Moscow's 
Palace of Sports for the closing game and security guards with high-tech 
communications gear were placed in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Russia has changed dramatically, the action on the ice was just as it 
had been in Soviet days -- bruising and tough. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final game of the series, the NHL team -- calling itself the Stars of 
Russia -- defeated Moscow's Red Army team, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 5,000 content fans, among them Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the NHL 
team jumped to a 6-1 lead. But with the crowd jumping, the Red Army rallied in 
the third period, scoring four goals and sending the fans home happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "All our fantastic players here at once -- I love it!" said Mars Monsurov, an 
army officer who brought his young son, Sasha, to his first hockey game. "It 
may only be a training game, but it's great anyway."  
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the series, the NHL team faced serious challenges. The Stars of 
Russia even lost once, 5-4, to the Yaroslavl Torpedo. 
</P>
<P>
 With owners and players in the NHL still far from agreement, some of the Dream 
Team members are considering deals with European clubs to keep them on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 And tour organizers hope to bring the Kings' Wayne Gretzky here in December, 
if the lockout continues.

RELATIONSHIPS / ORANGE COUNTY: IT'S ALL RELATIVE; SOME PARENTS ARE OPTING TO 
HAVE KIDS CLOSE TOGETHER. UNLESS FAMILIES ARE PREPARED, THAT FIT MAY BE TOO 
TIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Growing up, Sandra Zoumer was very close to her two sisters. The middle child, 
Zoumer had a sister 18 months older and a sister one year her junior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of our closeness in age, my sisters and I played with one another and 
were involved in the same school activities. As teen-agers, my younger sister 
and I even double-dated," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 When Zoumer decided to have children, she wanted the same close relationship 
for them, so she planned to have her kids less than two years apart. Today she 
has three daughters 9, 8 and 6 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen any jealousy between the girls," says Zoumer, who divorced 
their father when the oldest child was 4 and married her current husband two 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, the girls cheer each other on," she says. "They're really united 
and even consider themselves the Three Musketeers." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it's less common to space children close together in age than it used 
to be 15 to 20 years ago, there are still some parents who choose to do so for 
a variety of reasons, says marriage, family, child counselor Janet Whitney of 
Coastline Counseling Center in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "If having children close together is planned and anticipated with joy, and 
the parents are disciplined and organized, then the experience can be a 
positive one," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Close age spacing has some advantages for parents. "Adults pass through the 
physically demanding baby years more quickly and can rid their house of baby 
apparatus. They can also plan the same activities for the children," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the advantages of close age spacing, the prospect can be physically 
and financially draining for parents, especially in the beginning, when they 
are dealing with an infant and young toddler at the same time. These pressures 
are greatly increased when a child comes unplanned, Whitney says. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney encourages parents to consider not getting pregnant again until the 
previous child reaches at least his or her second birthday. She says optimum 
spacing is three or four years, so that children get adequate attention before 
the next sibling comes along. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of parents think that children (born) close together will be perfect 
little buddies," Whitney says. "The fact is, children born close together have 
more of a sense of competition, unless parents are aware of this propensity and 
work toward avoiding potential rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
 Competition is especially a problem when the children are the same sex and 
similar in appearance and personality. This childhood rivalry is sometimes so 
strong it reaches into adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I counsel two young women who are a year apart in age and both very 
beautiful," Whitney says. "The younger one recently became extremely depressed 
because she wasn't homecoming queen like her sister had been last year. She 
made it onto the court, but that wasn't good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Competition between siblings close in age stems from the fact that children 
don't generally begin to act like individuals and realize that the world 
doesn't revolve around them until they reach the age of 2. Before that time 
they are unable to separate from their parents, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering this, it's very important that the older child gets adequate 
attention after the baby comes, Whitney says. "An 18-month-old needs physical 
attention too, even if that means holding the baby in your arms and having your 
toddler in a backpack." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage close relationships between children, they must be taught not to 
compete against each other, and shouldn't be treated as a unit, Whitney says. 
Each child needs individual attention from the parents and the ability to go 
off at times and do his or her own thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoumer says she is fully aware of the possibility that her three girls might 
compete and has always stressed that they don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never compare the kids," she says. "Instead, I always tell them to do their 
best and not compare themselves to each other. I focus on their individual 
accomplishments. As a result, I haven't seen any sibling rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
 Zoumer, 37, a Mission Viejo writer, also makes sure not to treat the children 
as a unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they're close in age, it's easy to consider them a conglomerate because 
they play together and are at similar stages," she says. "The trick is to treat 
them as individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Zoumer children get special, separate time with their parents, including 
on their birthdays. The birthday girl gets to go out to lunch alone with her 
father and spend the afternoon alone with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a treat for the girls to get me all to themselves," Zoumer says. 
"They open up and talk about things they might not bring up otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 The only disadvantage of the close spacing Zoumer can see is the fact that 
they will all hit college at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of her chaotic relationship with her brother, who was 14 months older, 
Linda Hill, 40, wanted to make sure that her son and daughter, who are two 
years apart, would have a much different relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember my brother being sweet when we were younger, but as he got older, 
he would terrorize me," says Hill, 40, who is an office manager/bookkeeper in 
Newport Beach. "My brother would do things like slap and pinch me and drink my 
malt from McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
 Their relationship hasn't improved much over the years. Although Hill and her 
brother no longer fight, she hasn't spoken with him in a year, and doesn't 
consider their relationship close. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who divorced when her children were young, feels that how a parent 
reacts to the situation of close spacing determines the relationship between 
the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother never encouraged my brother and me to bond," she says. "I was 
determined that my son and daughter would be close, so I told them throughout 
the years to love and protect one another. I never permitted any hitting. If 
they had a disagreement, they were taught to sit down and talk it out." 
</P>
<P>
 This worked, as her children, now 19 and 21, have always been close. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they were young they played together, and in their teens they hung out 
together and double-dated. They're still very close," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 During her first marriage, Jan thought she wouldn't have children. That 
changed when she remarried. Today Jan, 38, who asked that her last name not be 
used, has a 4-year-old daughter, a 2-year-old son and a 5-month-old baby boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan's third child wasn't planned, but she feels things are working out well 
and that the children are close. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids all like to play together," says Jan, who lives in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan's husband, Philip, 53, a high school teacher, agrees. "Although it's hard 
to tell yet with the youngest, the older two are very close," he says. "Just 
recently our 2-year-old went on a weeklong trip with his mother and our 
daughter stayed home with me. When we picked them up at the airport, my 
daughter sprinted across the sidewalk, picked up her younger brother, swung him 
around and exclaimed, 'I missed you so much.' " 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the transition between each child, Jan and her husband told the kids 
that the new baby was someone for them to play with. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she is overjoyed with motherhood, Jan, who works four days a week on 
the technical staff of a large computer company, admits that having three kids 
close in age can be challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's physically demanding to have three young children," she says. "I'll stop 
in the checkout line at the store and will feel myself dozing off. I rarely get 
a block of sleep at night because the 4-month-old and 2-year-old constantly 
need me. Fortunately my husband is in this 100%." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Stay-at-home mom Deann Chiado, 27, had a son four years after her first son 
and decided to stop at two. She was shocked, therefore, when she became 
pregnant just six months after giving birth to her second child. She and 
husband Jim, 29, have found having kids close in age very challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 Deann says her oldest, who is now almost 6, hasn't had much trouble with his 
new siblings. "He had his time with me and doesn't seem to be jealous," she 
says. Her 21-month-old son, however, has had some problems dealing with the 
attention Deann must give to his 5-month-old baby sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "My second son is still very young so he wants to be held a lot, which is hard 
when you have a baby," she says. "He's constantly right there kissing and 
touching her. He also wants whatever she has. If she has a bottle, he has to 
have one too." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it doesn't leave much time for Deann and Jim, they make sure to give 
each child individual attention every night. They put the baby to bed first; 
then they read to the second child, put him to bed, and spend a final half an 
hour or so with the oldest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think the individual time prevents them from resenting each other," 
says Jim, who is a research and development manager in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was ecstatic to have a daughter, Jim admits that having the second 
two children close together has been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have liked them spaced out more in age," he says. "I think they tend 
to fight more when they're closer in age." 
</P>
<P>
 Deann agrees that the spacing is far from ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard at the baby stage and physically exhausting," she says, noting that 
dinner is an obstacle course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I start making dinner at 4 o'clock and feed the kids before Jim comes home at 
6:30 or 7. Then when he gets home, I hold the baby while he eats. Then he holds 
the baby while I eat. In the meantime, we're both busy watching the two boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Deann doesn't know whether her second two children will be emotionally close 
because they are close in age. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think they'll be really good pals, but at other times I wonder if 
they're going to fight more. I guess time will tell."

SCHOOL WORK; THINK COLLEGE IS ONE BIG PARTY? GET REAL. RISING FEES AND A 
NO-NONSENSE ATTITUDEMEAN MORE TIME ON THE JOB, LESS IN CLASS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What's the point of going to school, if you have no time to be a student? 
</P>
<P>
 The thought must cross Joe Ponce's mind as he stands amid the din of UCLA's 
Cooperage cafeteria, wearing a blue work apron. 
</P>
<P>
 He loves to play basketball, and his student fees help keep the nearby rec 
center courts open. "But they close before I get off," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't have time to play anyway. After serving pizza and scrubbing pots, 
he's got studying to do and an early class the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Big deal, some say, he ought to learn the value of money. Working one's way 
through college is an honorable tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's tougher than ever. While the price of burgers and books has tripled 
in the past two decades, minimum wage has barely doubled. Students must put in 
longer hours just to tread water. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that the relative decline of grant funding and the burden of ballooning 
educational costs -- UCLA fees, for example, are $4,072 for the year, more than 
six times the 1974 cost -- and it's easy to see why some students are sinking 
under the load. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many students say they would rather pay as they go -- and forgo running 
for student office, debating philosophy late into the night or playing 
basketball. Worried about their future earning potential in an uncertain job 
market, they minimize debt by working long hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be a different ethic," says a UCLA graduate student who was a 
freshman in the early '80s. "Today, students are less concerned about a growing 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Ponce, a 21-year-old English major and aspiring teacher, rushes to the 
cafeteria after class and works until 8:30 p.m., then drives to the one-bedroom 
apartment he shares with two others to study. The alarm rings too soon for an 8 
a.m. class. He takes three courses, a full load under UCLA's quarter system, 
logs 21 hours -- at $7.50 per -- in the cafeteria and wedges in six more as a 
tutor each week. He needs to work more, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponce gets grants that cover most of his fees. But even though he scrimps and 
saves, bills outpace his income. So, like many of his peers, he has made up the 
difference with student loans -- $10,000 worth. And, when those weren't enough, 
he rang up $3,000 on plastic -- also a growing trend. 
</P>
<P>
 A junior, he is a little more than halfway to his degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how many units I've got, or how many I've got to go. But I just 
want to get out," Ponce says in a tired voice swallowed by the clatter of the 
Cooperage. "I can't afford it." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of UC undergraduates work, and their hours on the job have been 
steadily increasing. Since the UC President's Office began studying the trend 
in 1979, median hours have climbed more than 20%, to 17.6 per week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten percent work more than 25 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Campuses nationwide report similar findings, says Arthur Levine, president of 
Columbia University's Teachers College, who has studied the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Public school officials are quick to point out that financial aid has risen 
along with fee increases. That tends to help the poorer students, but those 
from middle-class families receive only self-help aid -- loans and work-study 
-- not cash grants. As a result, students whose parents make $30,000 to $60,000 
work longer hours -- a median 18.8-hour week -- than their richer or poorer 
peers, according to the same UC study. 
</P>
<P>
 An increase in such self-help aid has created a "perverse incentive" for 
colleges to raise tuition, says Patrick Callan, director of the California 
Higher Education Policy Center, an independent think tank in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colleges have been trying to justify raising tuition," he says. "They're not 
interested in hearing how tough it is for kids to go to school." 
</P>
<P>
 He also believes colleges and universities have avoided studying the impact of 
work on students' intellectual and personal growth. "More and more, we are 
changing the ground rules without any discussion," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dennis Galligani, a UC assistant vice provost, says an upswing in 
graduation and retention rates suggests work habits are a non-issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "One would assume that we have more dropouts because of the economy," 
Galligani says. "But the data show that students are persisting and getting 
through." And, he adds, loans are available to qualified students who don't 
want to work. "It's an individual choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Many struggling students, particularly those at community colleges, say they 
would much rather keep their full-time jobs than cut back on their hours enough 
to qualify for financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren McDowell, 27, is studying criminology at Los Angeles Southwest College 
while working at Northrop. He attends classes in the morning, then drives a 
forklift from 4 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. "It's kind of hectic studying," he says. But 
financial aid is not an option. "I make too much money." 
</P>
<P>
 Margarete Allen, a Cal State Northridge graduate student, says she has noticed 
a growing work ethic among young people. She went straight to a job out of high 
school in 1964 and theorizes that, as women began trading home for the 
workplace, families came to accept, even to expect, that children would do the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in high school, the students who worked were considered the 
boneheads -- not college material. Now they're all expected to work," she says. 
"It used to be that students were students. Now everybody does two things." 
</P>
<P>
 Not Mark Earhart. He does four. 
</P>
<P>
 He studies business administration at Cal State Northridge, works as a file 
clerk 25 hours a week at Kaiser hospital in Panorama City, has an internship 
with Fox TV and referees football games on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 What amounts to a 37-hour workweek has led to worse grades than he might have 
gotten otherwise, he says, but he will trade A's for the sense of security a 
job brings. Besides, he enjoys spending money. 
</P>
<P>
 Earhart wishes he had worked less and gone into debt to buy a full college 
experience at a private college, he says. Then quickly adds: "I guess it would 
depend on how long it would take to pay it off -- on how much I could have made 
when I got out. I didn't want that (debt) hanging over my head while I was 
trying to establish a career and a family." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Hal Pruett, director of student psychological services at UCLA, has watched 
rising prices translate into higher stress on campus. Over the past 10 years, 
and particularly over the last five, complaints of depression, anxiety 
disorders, relationship problems and inability to concentrate have multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't come in saying, 'I'm working too much,' " he says, but it isn't 
hard to figure out. 
</P>
<P>
 Many also suffer from lack of sleep, either because they are too busy or too 
worried about deadlines or finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Time-management and stress-reduction techniques may help, but some anxieties 
persist. "At one time, students were confident that a job awaited them after 
graduation," Pruett says. "But now futures are uncertain." 
</P>
<P>
 As vice president of the National Sleep Foundation, Mary Carskadon knows where 
students find the time to do more and more. Although sleep deprivation has been 
linked to heart disease, automobile accidents, even the Exxon Valdez oil spill, 
busy students don't seem to worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Carskadon, a Brown University psychology professor, sees a macho attitude 
toward lack of sleep. "You never hear students brag about how late they slept 
or how much sleep they got," she says. "It does become a point of honor to be 
getting less." 
</P>
<P>
 But sacrificing sleep for studying may be a bad idea. When the body is in a 
"low ebb," such cognitive functions as memory operate at reduced capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 After a freshman year spent nodding off in early classes, Ponce tries to get 
at least five or six hours each night, at the expense of study time. 
</P>
<P>
 And his busy schedule ultimately does more than shave points off his GPA. It 
keeps him in school longer. "If I had more time to study, I would be a 
fourth-year senior, instead of a fourth-year junior," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Experts are uncertain how much work is too much. According to a national study 
by Alexander Astin, director of UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute, 
student performance slips slightly as work hours top 10 per week, and clearly 
suffers with 20 or more on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Astin says those in the workplace for long hours score lower in everything 
from graduation rates to grade-point averages to satisfaction with the college 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, a number of studies, including Astin's, also indicate that students 
with a moderate work schedule, say 10 or fewer hours per week, do better than 
those who don't work at all. A part-time job, preferably on campus, can be a 
good thing, honing time-management skills and offering peer interaction -- "the 
single most important influence on a student," Astin says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're hanging out with your peers a lot and they're talking about 
attending graduate school, you're going to be much more likely to attend 
yourself," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Astin study does not distinguish among types of jobs or types of peer 
interaction. It is unclear whether an on-campus job slinging burgers is better 
than an off-campus one. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Peters, 22, manages four restaurants on the campus of his alma mater, 
Stanford University. He never applied for financial aid, he says, because he 
thought his parents' income made him ineligible. But because they had two other 
children to educate, Peters had to help pay his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding a college job as a restaurant manager was an invaluable experience, he 
says, offering a challenge that led to a career. "A lot of what you're learning 
here is how to deal with people, how to communicate your ideas," he says of his 
overall academic experience. "A job is just an addendum to your education." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he warns, some students get so carried away with work they forget why 
they're in college. "Especially with some of the professors well-connected with 
Bay Area entrepreneurs, you can find yourself with a lot of power at a young 
age, and the academic side kind of loses it," Peters says. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduate teaching assistants at UCLA say work clearly interferes with some 
students' performances. To help, many allow student workers to switch to 
already full evening classes, leaving daytime classrooms cold and lonely. Some 
assistants also report giving failing students extensions on assignments -- or 
even passing grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than await the outcome of students' conflicting allegiances to work and 
school, the faculty of Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn., adopted the 
Hamline Plan. It seeks to integrate student working experiences into lectures 
and discussions, leading to such course titles as "Cultural Perspectives in the 
Workplace," in the anthropology department, and "The Helping Professional at 
Work," taught by a psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Jerry Greiner says the program, up and running for eight years, was 
designed to attract those who want a liberal arts education and a job. The 
students, he says, "aren't just interested in knowledge for knowledge's sake." 
</P>
<P>
 While the UC system isn't planning any curriculum changes, Regent Ward 
Connerly says, it is trying to create more student job opportunities, courting 
private business for internships and encouraging administrators to fill more 
campus jobs with students. The regents have also discussed raising admissions 
standards to reduce enrollment -- and the demand for financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, barring drastic change, many young people will continue their dual 
lives as students and employees. And whether work adds to or detracts from 
their college experience will depend on the individual. 
</P>
<P>
 For USC's Erin La Combe, 21, who gave sororities and football games a try but 
found them uninspiring, the chance to work is a blessing. Internships and 
research jobs have given her a jump on the career track. 
</P>
<P>
 But for UCLA junior Audrey Wong, 20, who was on her high school volleyball and 
track teams as well as the student council, a job in the Cooperage is a 
necessary evil. "I wish I could work less, but you have to pay those bills," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ponce would have liked more time for basketball and academics, the 
soon-to-be fifth-year senior is just grateful to be in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to be in school and to be able to pay for everything, or, at least, 
borrow to pay for everything."

REBEL WITH A CAUSE ABANDONS THE LIMELIGHT; POLITICS: COMMON CAUSE'S FRED 
WERTHEIMER IS ABOUT TO TAKE A BREAK. WILL CONGRESS GET ONE? NOT A CHANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SLAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred Wertheimer looks like the friendly neighbor in a sitcom -- the bald, 
bespectacled older guy dispensing advice to the nice young folks next door. 
</P>
<P>
 But mention his name on Capitol Hill and the reaction can be anything but 
neighborly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He acts as though he has a monopoly on reforming the political process," 
sputtered Rep. Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.), a target of Wertheimer's lobby, 
Common Cause. "The cause of campaign-finance reform will move more quickly with 
him gone." 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly a quarter-century of prodding politicians to change the way they 
raise money to run for office, Wertheimer announced in October that he was 
resigning from the leadership of Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In his almost 24 years with the self-described good-government lobby, 14 of 
them as president, he has exasperated and infuriated scores of officials, along 
the way becoming almost as much an institution in this city as the system he 
would so like to reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before Congress-bashing was fashionable, Wertheimer was inveighing 
against the "corrupt" advantages of incumbency and the "arms-race mentality" of 
political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, a combination of Democratic delay and a Republican filibuster 
killed the best chance yet to limit campaign spending, reduce the role of 
political-action committees and extend public financing -- already provided to 
presidential candidates -- to congressional races. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Congress had enacted the (recent) reforms urged on it by Fred Wertheimer, 
it would have a much higher approval rating from the American people," said 
Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.), one of Wertheimer's few defenders on the Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 But others said Wertheimer was part of the problem, adopting a rigid attitude 
that delayed agreement until it was too late to pass legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fred has worshiped at the altar of public financing for so long that he would 
sell his first-born son for it," said Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.). 
</P>
<P>
 Wertheimer said his decision to step down had been made months earlier and 
that personal criticism wasn't a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 At 55, he wouldn't have lasted this long if he were thin-skinned. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio Congressman Wayne Hays, the salty-tongued chairman of the House 
Administration Committee in the 1970s, used to call him that "baldheaded 
bastard" from "Common Curse." 
</P>
<P>
 "I tend to take almost nothing that happens up there (Capitol Hill) 
personally," Wertheimer said in an interview at Common Cause headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an inherent tension built into what Common Cause does. Our issues 
are quite different than those of other people who worry about clean air or 
having a dam built. We are talking about your personal life, your professional 
life, your money and your integrity. It's going to lead to people getting angry 
with you." 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the Nov. 8 elections, Wertheimer, who will remain at 
Common Cause until a successor is chosen next year, promised to be just as 
tough on the new Republican leadership in Congress as he has been on the 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though many Hill watchers believe the chances for reform will be slimmer, 
Wertheimer said he sees a big opportunity to push Republicans to keep their 
promises of change. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would focus on the next House Speaker, Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), 
"because he has spent his career attacking the House as a corrupt institution." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Wertheimer talked about the subject that has absorbed most of his adult 
life, he looked his questioner straight in the eyes with an intensity that was 
a little disconcerting and gave a sense of how uncomfortable he has made 
politicians feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Born and bred in Brooklyn, a graduate of the University of Michigan and 
Harvard Law School, he imbibed his reformist zeal from an accountant father who 
"believed in playing by the rules" and a mother with "a great sense of fairness 
and justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many in his generation, Wertheimer said President John F. Kennedy's 
call to public service was also a powerful influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Wertheimer's first goal was to work on Capitol Hill, which he 
pursued with characteristic determination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a job at the Securities and Exchange Commission and every six months 
would send out letters to 20 or 30 congressmen who sounded interesting. Three 
years later, Silvio Conte wrote back.  
</P>
<P>
 "Conte (D-Mass.) was a wonderful representative and a great teacher," said 
Wertheimer, who worked for the congressman for a few years. "I've had wonderful 
teachers and mentors and colleagues, like John Gardner and (Watergate 
prosecutor and former Common Cause chairman) Archibald Cox." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner, a liberal Republican who served as secretary of Health, Education and 
Welfare in the Johnson Administration, founded Common Cause in 1970 to open 
government to greater public scrutiny and participation. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization reached its membership peak of 300,000 in the Watergate era 
and now has about 250,000 members and chapters in all states except Wyoming, 
Idaho and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, its tactics were relatively genteel, but got tougher in the 
face of continuing resistance to campaign-finance reform primarily from House 
Democrats and Senate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 In a controversial tactic in 1990, Common Cause took out ads against 13 
Democrats, among them Torricelli, implying that their acceptance of PAC money 
in general implicated them in the savings and loan debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a major blunder," said Kenneth Gross, former head of enforcement at 
the Federal Election Commission and now a lawyer specializing in campaign 
finance and ethics at the Washington office of the New York firm Skadden, Arps. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were his supporters -- not (Sen.) Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). He went for the 
jugular," Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wertheimer, not surprisingly, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Democrats kept campaign-finance reform off the floor of the House for 16 
years. Then (in 1990) they came forward with a phony bill and they wanted it 
blessed as reform. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There's this unbelievably difficult concept for Washington to understand: In 
order to change, you have to change. Washington loves the notion of change 
without doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Although recent efforts have failed, Common Cause claims numerous successes: 
public funding of presidential campaigns; "sunshine," or open-meeting laws; 
tougher ethics rules for the executive branch; the investigation that led to 
the resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas), and the 1989 bill that 
banned members of Congress from accepting speaking fees from special-interest 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Another contribution to the political process was on view outside Wertheimer's 
office just before the recent elections. A group of young staffers sat munching 
bagels while turning reports filed to the Federal Election Commission into 
press releases on campaign spending. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wertheimer has been with the group almost since its inception. He sought a job 
there after leaving Conte's office, while his wife, Linda, briefly supported 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the fall of 1970, we had been married for about a year and this place was 
just being formed. I knew I could do something I didn't want to do any time, so 
why rush into it? We decided Linda should find a job. There was this new thing 
called National Public Radio. That's how Linda started at NPR and I started out 
at Common Cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Wertheimer rose from being a tape editor to host of the acclaimed 
program "All Things Considered." 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the Wertheimers, who have no children, occupy a niche in the city's 
liberal Establishment. They relax with journalist friends such as Cokie and 
Steven Roberts (the former with NPR and ABC, the latter with U.S. News & World 
Report). 
</P>
<P>
 Although ties with the media -- especially the editorial boards of major 
newspapers -- are said to be a key factor in his influence, Wertheimer said the 
couple doesn't "spend a whole lot of time socializing with the power structure 
in this town. We're old. We're tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to describe his typical engagements in a month, he said, "Going to a 
couple of movies on a Saturday night and dinner at the Pines of Rome," an 
untrendy restaurant in suburban Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fred lives by all the rules he tries to force down other people's throats," 
said Nina Totenberg, legal affairs correspondent for NPR and the ABC TV program 
"Night-line." 
</P>
<P>
 In characteristically prudent fashion, she said, the Wertheimers' mortgage on 
their Georgetown townhouse was paid up before they bought a spacious Victorian 
bungalow in Washington's premier wealthy liberal neighborhood, Cleveland Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the new house, another luxury they have permitted themselves is trips 
to Paris for major birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
 They may travel more once his successor is chosen, Wertheimer said. He was 
otherwise unsure of his future except to say that he will remain involved in 
the reform effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do like fighting for what I believe in," he said, his eyes shining. 
</P>
<P>
 Reminded of all the politicians he has tangled with over the years, he looked 
suddenly youthful, and grinned. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that my resignation makes a number of people happy -- well, 
whatever I can do to bring happiness into this world," he said. "On the other 
hand, they shouldn't be too happy if they think I'm going to disappear from 
their lives. I'm going to be around."

'90S FAMILY; COMPETING WITH BIGGEST PARTY OF YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAULA LYNN PARKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Planning a birthday celebration for your child in the middle of writing 
holiday greeting cards and wrapping presents takes organization as well as some 
psychological maneuvering so the child feels acknowledged and valued, experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can pull off a December party," said Alison Boteler, a Connecticut-based 
author of several books on entertaining, including "The Children's Party 
Handbook" (Barron's, 1986). "It's just harder because you are competing with 
the biggest party of the year, Christmas Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Plan early: Boteler suggests that the planning start before Thanksgiving. 
After you decide on a theme and location, set a date. "Making the invitations, 
decorations and (party) favors early will save yourself a lot of the 
last-minute hassles," she added. Then give people more notice by sending the 
invitations out earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Roylee Brown of Irvine said that with nine children, two of whom have December 
birthdays, she has to be organized. "I'm very calm. I couldn't do it if I 
wasn't. I'm ready for Christmas way in advance." 
</P>
<P>
 * Separate the celebrations: "I'd separate the birthday celebration by as many 
days as I could from the holiday," said psychologist Diane Ross Glazer, who 
specializes in child therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Others suggest putting the birthday decorations in a different room or corner 
of the room from the Christmas decorations. If the birthday is very close to 
Christmas, have the family celebration on that day and the party with friends 
either early or late. Some experts and parents suggested a theme unrelated to 
Christmas as the best for a December birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to do something to make the distinction between the birthday 
party and just another Christmas party because you want the child to feel their 
birthday is a special day," Boteler said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Patti Giapapas of Los Angeles always plans a Christmas-themed party for 
her daughter Anne, who turns 11 on Dec. 23. Making ornaments or seeing a 
Christmas-release movie has become a tradition in their family. 
</P>
<P>
 * Accentuate the positive: If your Christmas child feels blue about getting 
presents only once a year, say " 'I understand why you're feeling sad, but 
let's look at it another way,' " Glazer said. "A parent has to point out the 
wonderful side: It's special being born near a special holiday, the stores are 
beautiful, people are happy, the stores have more toys to choose from." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Downs of Los Angeles, said his son, Jared, 7, likes his Dec. 16 birthday 
because it is near his dad's Dec. 11 birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Save something for January: A child with a December birthday has more than 
the usual after-the-holidays letdown, experts say. Boteler suggests saving a 
piece of birthday cake in the freezer and an unopened gift. Then in January, 
exactly a month later, open the present and enjoy the cake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something to look forward to," added Boteler.

'90S FAMILY; DECEMBER DILEMMA; A CHILD'S HOLIDAY-SEASON BIRTHDAY CAN COMPLICATE 
AN ALREADY HECTIC TIME. BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO KEEP IT SPECIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Paul Desaulniers isn't crazy about the timing of his Dec. 18 birthday. "You 
have to wait so long for your birthday, then Christmas is right next to it. It 
would be better if you waited half a year (after Christmas) then got 
something," said Paul, an Irvine eighth-grader who will turn 14 next month. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Anne Giapapas, who will turn 11 on Dec. 23, sees a few drawbacks in 
her birth date, she added, "I enjoy it a lot. I get double the presents 
(around) Christmas so it's like a big, big holiday." 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, a child's December birthday can complicate an already frenetic 
time of year, requiring extra effort from parents to keep the day from being 
lost in the winter holiday shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm overwhelmed at the holidays anyway," said Anne's mom, Patti Giapapas of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just one more thing to make it crazier." 
</P>
<P>
 With shopping to do, presents to wrap, parties to attend, goods to bake and 
bills to juggle, some parents might be tempted to downplay the birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Diane Ross Glazer cautions against that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents have to be really careful not to steamroll over the birthday but to 
see it as a celebration, not as a stressful event," said Glazer, who has 
offices in Woodland Hills and Santa Monica and teaches parenting classes at the 
Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "A child's birthday is the only holiday that is individually theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 The importance of that occasion has grown in the last few decades as our 
culture has become more individualistic, said psychotherapist Jeffrey Hutter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The individual's accomplishments and milestones are celebrated. Birthdays are 
the quintessential individualistic event," said Hutter, who has a practice in 
Santa Monica and teaches personal development classes through UCLA Extension. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend in some social circles, Hutter said, has been for birthday parties 
to include entertainment, hired clowns and catered meals. 
</P>
<P>
 A family who regularly celebrates birthdays this way is under particular 
stress and pressure to continue the practice for its December child. 
</P>
<P>
 And while psychologists say that acknowledging a child on his or her birthday 
will build self-esteem, even more critical is that the birthday is celebrated 
with the same enthusiasm as everyone else's in the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they go all out for the other children's birthdays and the child with the 
Christmas birthday feels lost in the rush, the child will feel not equal to or 
as good as," Glazer said. 
</P>
<P>
 One way children measure parity is in the number of presents, psychologists 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 On the score card of quality and quantity of gifts, children with December 
birthdays often feel cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Desaulniers said his 17-year-old sister, whose birthday is in April, 
always gets "bigger and better" gifts than he does. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother disagrees. "I make a conscious effort" to see that he is treated 
equally, said Lyn Garner. "I make it equal. I'm a December birthday so I've 
made sure" he wasn't cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 And combination Christmas/birthday gifts are a slight that some children never 
forget, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Downs of Los Angeles, who will turn 46 on Dec. 11 and whose son Jared 
will turn 8 on Dec. 16, remembers years of combination gifts from some aunts 
and uncles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd feel a little cheated," he said, "but it didn't bother me." The annually 
shifting start of the eight-night Hanukkah celebration has led some Jewish 
parents to deal creatively with late-November or December birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Some celebrate the child's birthday twice, as it falls on the Gregorian and 
Hebrew lunar calendars, psychotherapist Hutter said. "There's no end to the 
ways people can creatively deal with a birthday and a holiday," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have scheduled combined Hanukkah/birthday parties, said Rabbi Aharon 
Simkin of Young Israel in Northridge. Simkin, whose birthday is Monday, has 
himself in the past celebrated combined Hanukkah/Thanksgiving/birthday parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The birthday can get lost a little," he acknowledged. "But what's more 
important -- a holiday that everyone is celebrating or your own personal 
holiday?"

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; TEACHING KIDS TO THINK ON THEIR OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lessons about violence start early. When kids complain, "Mommy, he hit me," 
parents may reply with a knee-jerk, "Don't hit him back, go tell the teacher." 
Or maybe, "Hit him back, otherwise he'll keep hitting you." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, according to one researcher, is that both answers encourage kids 
to stop thinking. On a larger scale, it contributes to a generation of kids who 
don't know how to think because they've been told for too long what to think, 
said clinical psychologist Myrna Shure of Hahnemann University in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids who can think of more than one way to solve a problem are less likely to 
fail," she said. "They're less likely to feel frustrated, aggressive, to 
experience a sense of powerlessness or be socially withdrawn." 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the very feelings that lead to the major social problems of the day 
-- violence, substance abuse, teen pregnancy, depression. "Telling kids not to 
do something, if anything, makes them want to do it more," Shure said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her book, "Raising a Thinking Child" (Henry Holt, 1994), Shure describes 
how parents can guide children toward solving their own problems by using 
dialogues about their conflicts. The techniques work best with 4- to 
7-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents can build a base with very young children by using games to ensure 
they understand words like "different," "before," "after" and "not." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when children are hitting, for instance, parents can ascertain the 
nature of the problem by asking a non-threatening question such as: "What 
happened before he hit you?" Next, they can ask each child how he felt when 
hit, or when he hit someone. Then, they ask what happened next. Last, they ask, 
"Can you think of a different way to solve this problem?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not work the first time, or the first 10 times," Shure said. "Remember 
the goal is not always to solve a problem now. It's to set the stage for a 
style of thinking so that the child can take over." 
</P>
<P>
 If they say, "I don't know," parents can say playfully, "I bet you can," or "I 
know if you think really hard, you can come up with an idea." 
</P>
<P>
 When they do, parents should say, "Good thinking," to reinforce that they are 
thinking, not what they are thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 One mother said as soon as she brought her second son home from the hospital, 
his older brother started grabbing his toys. "I was getting so tired of telling 
him to stop. I thought, 'There has to be a better way.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After learning the techniques, she said, "I started saying, 'How do you feel 
in nursery school when someone takes something away from you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Bad, Mom.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'That's how Phillip feels. What can we do?' 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I guess we can give him another toy.' I was really impressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Not every kid will respond, but Shure said her longitudinal research shows 
that this kind of training produces thinking and feeling kids who are less 
likely to hurt other people. She said she has achieved results with kids from 
all social and economic backgrounds, kids with Attention Deficit Disorder, shy 
children and normal kids. Her program is being used in about 50 schools across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children can learn solutions and consequences at 4," she said. "But the 
earlier you are training them to think this way, the faster the impact on 
either reducing or preventing behavior problems that later predict more serious 
problems such as violence and substance abuse."

'90S FAMILY; YOU, TOO, CAN SURVIVE THE HOLIDAY VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN O. RYAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember the old days of spending the holidays with relatives, especially the 
ones you barely knew? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the holidays are here again. Now you're the parent, the aunt, the uncle 
or the grandparent and the thought of several days of family togetherness is 
making you feel more than a little anxious. 
</P>
<P>
 Holidays being stressful enough, preparing your children and your hosts for 
your stay can make the difference between a good time and needing another 
vacation when the trip is done. 
</P>
<P>
 In his latest book, "Touchpoints: The Essential Reference" (Addison-Wesley, 
1994), noted pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton discusses telling children old 
enough to understand what behavior you expect of them and rehearsing it ahead 
of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Learning manners should be on a short-term basis. You can't expect small 
children to live up to those expectations for a lengthy visit," he said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazelton recommends that grandparents be respectful about treats, indulgences 
and their own children's efforts to discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Fisk-Maletz, a Westlake Village marriage, family and child therapist, 
and mother of three, reminds parents not to lose their sense of self. 
</P>
<P>
 "When many of us return to our parents' homes, we stop behaving as functional 
adults. We no longer become our children's parents, but our parents' children," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Discuss with your hosts ahead of time your children's likes and dislikes, said 
Newport Beach family therapist and grandmother Claire J. Lehr, who co-authored 
"Club Grandma, Etiquette, Privileges, and Official Duties of Today's 
Grandmother" (Long Meadow Press, 1994), with her daughter Leslie Lehr Spirson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone needs to communicate their needs. Don't make assumptions about 
meals, sleeping arrangements or baby-sitting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Comply with the house rules even if you don't agree with them, Fisk-Maletz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holiday visits are not the time to try and change something that's bothered 
you for years. Choose your battles." 
</P>
<P>
 All agree that flexibility is essential to a positive visit and offer these 
additional tips for a smoother stay: 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure everyone you're visiting knows your itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Infants are notorious for not sleeping well in strange environments. If you 
believe your baby will keep the entire house up all night, stay at a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stick to a baby's eating and sleeping schedule. Bring all your own supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't expect babies who are passed around a lot to be happy. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your child is old enough to crawl, discuss child-proofing for household 
hazards and breakables. This will ultimately put your hosts at ease and keep 
you from constantly telling your child "no." 
</P>
<P>
 * Plan activities so kids can let off steam. Find out what sights are near 
where you'll be staying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bring favorite items from home for fun and comfort. Find out what toys your 
host might have on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't force children to be affectionate when they are unsure or 
uncomfortable about someone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Share positive memories with your children about the relative you're going 
to visit. Show them old pictures of when you were a kid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be respectful of your hosts' wishes. Pitch in and don't interfere. 
</P>
<P>
 * Try to find some solitude. Take a walk or a bath for self-preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be appreciative. Bring a gift. Send a thank-you note with a photograph.

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; HARVEST OF HOPE FOR FOOD CENTER CHARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The second annual Harvest Luncheon and Fashion Show recently yielded a bumper 
crop of donations for the Food Distribution Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a sellout crowd of 425 guests and generous underwriting, the 
Harvesters netted more than $55,000 for the center, which supplies food to 
Orange County charities at minimal cost. The $75-per-person luncheon, which 
included a showing of the St. John 1995 cruise collection, took place at the 
Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach. Seasonal Fare 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a group of mostly professional women from all areas. We have doctors, 
lawyers, accountants, you name it," said Jill Johnson-Tucker, co-founder of 
Harvesters. 
</P>
<P>
 With an eye toward their guests' busy schedules, organizers offered a 
well-timed, activity-packed luncheon and show staged by Saks Fifth Avenue that 
had many women back in their offices by midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief silent auction, guests were ushered into the ballroom that had 
been decorated in a harvest theme. At each table stood towering topiaries 
adorned with pine cones, miniature pumpkins, cranberries, evergreen and other 
fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 A cornucopia of food quickly followed, with waiters serving such seasonal fare 
as spicy corn chowder with smoked pheasant served over a puff pastry oak leaf, 
swordfish medallions and basil mashed potatoes, and apple tarts with caramel 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Saks followed with a fast-paced showing of the St. John collection, which 
featured models sporting 85 different outfits in less than 45 minutes. Grass 
Roots Campaign 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson-Tucker and Jennifer Van Bergh founded the Harvesters in 1993 as a 
support group for the Food Distribution Center, which provides food for 277 
local charities. Word of the first luncheon spread mainly by word of mouth: 
</P>
<P>
 "We called 50 of our friends and they called their friends," Van Bergh said. 
"Every person we asked joined." 
</P>
<P>
 For the group's 50 members, being able to contribute to the community without 
giving up a lot of precious time has been a winning formula. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't make a lot of demands on their time. We just try to make as much 
money as possible with this one event," Johnson-Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The food center collects food from grocery stores, manufacturers, government 
surplus and food drives and sells it for minimal cost (about 6 cents per pound) 
to the charities. Most of the food would otherwise be thrown out due to 
overstocking, damaged packaging or manufacturing errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every dollar we collect we provide 35 meals," said Ron Blake, director of 
the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the luncheon will provide 1,980,000 meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people don't know there's hunger" in an affluent area like Orange 
County, said Judy Steele, luncheon committee member. "But feeding the hungry is 
a major, major problem." An estimated 16% of the local population is at risk of 
hunger. 
</P>
<P>
 Other faces in the crowd were Susan Orth, Sandy Sewell, Sandy Fainbarg, Carol 
Mays, Bonnie Kremer, Terry Callahan, Debbi Elliott, Stephanie Grody, Paula 
Cole, Allison Kearns and Kristin Heeschen. KATHRYN BOLD

 She sat in the waiting room thumbing through a magazine. As he entered, she 
looked up and smiled. The game had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 To make a painful story short, Mike fumbled the ball. His conversation was 
abrupt, his anxiety was apparent and he panicked and forgot to ask for her 
phone number, which was the whole point of the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Not an untypical start here at the Date Coach, the training camp for the 
romantically challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Run by Whittemore, a clinical psychologist, at his offices near John Wayne 
Airport, the Date Coach aims to teach men and women -- but mostly men -- why 
they are not attracting the type of dates they want. 
</P>
<P>
 No hopeless cases need apply. The Elephant Man would be wasting his money. 
People with serious emotional problems are referred instead to Whittemore's 
psychological practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who see the Date Coach, Whittemore says, don't really have trouble 
getting dates. They just want to do better. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large, they are very, very successful people. It's not just the fact 
that I'm located in Newport Beach and these sessions are $80 each. They are 
professionals and very highly functioning." These kind of people consult 
coaches to improve their golf or tennis games, Whittemore says. So why not get 
coaching for the Big Game? 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell people, you can't not play the game. I'm talking about the courtship 
game that has been guided by evolutionary forces for hundreds of millions of 
years. You can play it well or play it badly, but you must play it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Date Coach will not teach you how to forge lasting, meaningful 
relationships. He teaches only the opening moves -- how to get a phone number, 
set up a first date and conduct it so it could lead to more. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is not as easy as it sounds, says Mike. He's 35, lives in upscale 
Corona del Mar, brings home about $150,000 a year, has average looks and is in 
shape, but he was striking out with the women he found attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys just come by it naturally, and other guys, it's a complete mystery. 
Me, it's a mystery. It's what I missed out on when I was in high school. I 
didn't date until college, and I had no idea how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trying to approach a stranger when you're putting a lot of pressure on 
yourself is frightening. Having someone coach you -- you know, 'This is how the 
game is played' -- it was contrary to almost everything I'd come to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's not surprising, says Whittemore, because recent beliefs have been 
founded on a fallacy. Psychologists, and people in general, are rediscovering 
the basic differences between what the sexes find attractive in one other. 
While men and women have been moving toward political, social and economic 
equality during the last 30 years, "equality does not mean sameness," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The fallacy, he says, was the assumption that since men and women should be 
treated and paid equally for equal work, "that must mean at the heart of the 
matter, except for obvious anatomical differences, they must be the same. This 
is a very, very big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men of my generation, the baby boomers, grew up at a time when we were taught 
not only to regard women as social and economic equals but to treat them the 
way we would want to be treated. So men started treating women by being overly 
compliant and overly deferring to their judgment -- 'Where would you like to 
go? It doesn't matter to me.' And the women were turned off by this, because 
the men came across as indecisive and weak and too eager to please." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Whittemore says, women absorbed the same cultural fallacy, 
"and they tried to relate to men in a way that they knew they would be 
impressed by. They were impressed by signs of accomplishment, power, success 
and wealth. Emphasizing their own achievements proved effective in their 
professional lives, but it wound up being a turnoff if they carried it over 
into their romantic lives." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's just basic evolutionary psychology, says Leland C. Swenson, professor 
of psychology at Loyola Marymount University, who for eight years has studied 
and published articles on human sexual attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of very complex human behavior is shaped by our evolutionary past," 
Swenson says. The rigors of primitive times made most desirable the male who 
could provide the best nest and both provision and protect it. That lesson, 
genetically imprinted, accounts for the typical modern woman's attraction to 
taller men possessing the symbols of accomplishment and means, Swenson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise in primitive times, the most desirable females were the ones most 
likely be the best child-bearers. That translates today into the youth and 
beauty mystique that attracts the typical man. 
</P>
<P>
 Swenson's study of what was most attractive to members of the Great 
Expectations video dating service in Los Angeles showed some striking 
confirmation of evolutionary psychology, he says. For example, the women who 
most frequently received invitations for a first date were the youngest -- 
between 20 and 29. But men in the same age group received the fewest 
invitations; they were too young to have piled up significant resources, 
Swenson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this paint women as love mercenaries and men as domineering lechers? 
</P>
<P>
 Not at all, says Whittemore. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I hope to do is correct a lot of the misplaced shame in our 
society over what people want. All the way through the various species we find 
the females being drawn to the dominant males, because they are going to be the 
best providers and best protectors for them and their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I'd put it in a very positive sense: not that it's not wrong but 
that it's right. It shouldn't be the only criteria, but I think there's nothing 
wrong with that being a kind of instinctive pull." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's on the right track," says Rosalyn M. Laudati, a clinical 
psychologist practicing in Newport Beach and Brea. "I don't see anything 
disrespectful, really. Feminism, I think, has come full circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '70s when feminism was hot, some women wanted to take command in 
courtship. Many bombed miserably and didn't like it, so it's fizzled. I think 
everyone's much more comfortable about it now. We women don't have to pay the 
tab to feel equal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't imply that there hasn't been a change in women becoming more 
independent, but there has been a return to more traditional courtship 
behaviors. Men and women just feel more comfortable with that." 
</P>
<P>
 But many men have either forgotten or never learned the traditional skills, 
says Keiko Sharyn Faeta, who as one of Whittemore's assistants has played the 
prospective date in perhaps 25 role-playing encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these guys are attractive, you know," she says, "but sometimes they 
can barely get away fast enough. They get so embarrassed. One man couldn't ask 
for the number, and it was all pretend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different for them when it comes to human relations. They're good with 
stocks and figures, but when it comes to one-on-one eye contact, when they have 
to use personality and a bit of wit and charm to lure women to talk to them and 
maybe see them again, they lack the confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike admits that's a description of him and the reason he signed up for 
coaching. His first session with Whittemore was a discussion of his past 
experiences and of just what flirting is for men and women. And there were 
guidelines -- what to look for, what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two of us talked about strengths," Whittemore says. "It's very important 
for people to know what their strengths are. Most of the people who come to me 
don't fully appreciate the power and the attractiveness that they already have. 
They need the feedback on that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secondly, there are things they can do -- sometimes they're just little 
things -- that can make a huge difference. Eye contact, speaking more slowly, 
projecting relaxation and confidence, taking control of the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not game-playing in the sense of inauthenticity. It's not a matter of 
being phony or violating individuality. It's a matter of eliminating negatives 
and doing some things that are actually more true to yourself and therefore 
more attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 When Mike arrived for the second session, he knew what was in store. "My 
mission, if I chose to accept it, was to go in strike up a conversation, get a 
phone number and get out. Which is a scary mission." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike knew what the coach wanted. "His basic approach for getting a phone 
number is not much more than this: You identify someone who's giving 'approach 
me' signals with her eyes, start up a conversation, and within the first three 
to five minutes you ask for a phone number. Then you go on a few more minutes, 
politely end it and leave. No promises, nothing. It's kind of hit-and-run, 
which goes contrary to everything I thought." 
</P>
<P>
 The tactic is designed to permit the woman the role that comes naturally -- 
judging the attractiveness of the male and making the decision on whether the 
encounter should go any further. The man briefly displays confidence, wit and 
adroitness without any implication that he is romantically needy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds easy. It isn't, says Mike. 
</P>
<P>
 He had trouble initiating a conversation, let it lapse several times, then 
became so intimidated he left without asking for the phone number. "She was 
very attractive, yeah. Part of the service is convincing you that you can 
approach some of these women, that they're not out of your league." 
</P>
<P>
 He did better on the next try with a different assistant. He got the phone 
number, then ambled away nonchalantly. "Paul says if you go in and hang around, 
they don't like it. But if you just take off, it gets them to thinking, 'Hey, 
he asked for a phone number, then walked away. What's going on?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The next step is a telephone call to the assistant to set up a simulated first 
date -- coffee at a coffee shop. "You don't call back the first day," Mike 
says. "They see that as kind of needy. By the time you call back the third or 
fourth day, hopefully she's been thinking about you." 
</P>
<P>
 Faeta, who has received a score of such training phone calls, says the 
students are supposed to propose a time and place and ask whether that's 
convenient. "But some are so nervous they don't even wait for a response. They 
don't know how to relax and listen and be a little more spontaneous. My 
impression is that some are so nervous they write it out, but it comes off too 
scripty and weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Then comes the actual simulated date. After each of these steps, the 
assistants report back to Whittemore, who then confers with and coaches his 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like he's studied it very carefully, and I think it's great what 
he's doing." says Laudati. "More men should go. I see of these these poor 
schlemiels who don't know how to go to square one." 
</P>
<P>
 But does it work? Mike says he thinks so. He stopped his coaching sessions 
when he started getting phone numbers out in the real world and one led to a 
serious relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 But after six months, it's over, and Mike is back on the playing field and 
considering a brushup course. "It's very hard. What I'm finding out as far as 
dating goes, it's all a matter of confidence. I have asked women as attractive 
and more attractive than Keiko for phone numbers. I haven't gotten them, but 
I've tried. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not necessarily a personal rejection -- more like 'I have a boyfriend' 
or 'I'm a lesbian' or 'I just broke up and hate men right now.' Paul says the 
best hitters strike out seven out of 10 times. If you get one out of five phone 
numbers, you're doing all right. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the relationship stuff beyond that, I still haven't figured it out. But I 
don't think anyone has." The Do's and Don'ts of Flirting 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the tactics Paul Whittemore teaches clients at the Date Coach 
in Newport Beach: 
</P>
<P>
 Men How to Approach an Attractive Woman 
</P>
<P>
 * Establish eye contact. 
</P>
<P>
 * If her eye contact seems inviting, initiate a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Project nonchalance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid controversial or personal topics. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use humor; it is particularly effective. 
</P>
<P>
 * Project calmness and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 * Project energy and vigor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Listen as well as talk, but retain control of the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give your first name with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask for her telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once you have a telephone number, depart gracefully, making no promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * Wait for her to start the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jump the gun. Wait for the "go" signal in her eye contact. 
</P>
<P>
 * Appear too needy or too eager to please. This implies desperation, a 
turn-off. 
</P>
<P>
 * Focus on yourself or her in the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sound too serious. Don't blame or complain except 
</P>
<P>
 in obvious jest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mumble or talk too softly. This implies nervousness and lack of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 * Relinquish control of the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Conduct an interview. Chat, don't interrogate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put anyone down, especially yourself, even in jest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Overlook her comfort and interest levels. Back off if she is uncomfortable 
or bored. Women 
</P>
<P>
 How to Encourage a Man's Approach 
</P>
<P>
 * Give warm, friendly eye contact. 
</P>
<P>
 * Smile. 
</P>
<P>
 * Occasionally, smile coyly; that is, look away, then back. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tilt your head, toss your head and touch your hair, which communicates that 
you're interested in him. 
</P>
<P>
 * During his conversation, lean forward, nod and laugh or giggle when 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Touch his hand or forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 How to Discourage a Man's Approach 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid eye contact. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be serious and intense. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take control of the conversation and be confrontational or oppositional. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be critical, complaining or blaming. 
</P>
<P>
 * Act cold and unyielding. 
</P>
<P>
 * Project independence and self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 * Project over-attachment to family, job or causes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Speak quickly, loudly and harshly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Show no appreciation of anything about him. 
</P>
<P>
 * Appear demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 * Project prudishness.

R S V P; RELIVING FRANCE'S ERA OF ELEGANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "She's the next queen of France, you know," murmured a gentleman with a French 
accent. He referred to an elegantly clad matron, a small crowd swirling around 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't she beautiful?" sighed another. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, France is a republic and the royal family is trying to regain the 
throne." 
</P>
<P>
 You didn't know? 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Parisian Romance Ball, where, if you could manage to put the 
Biltmore Hotel's impossible parking mess out of your mind, the belle epoque 
seemed like yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 No ordinary theme party this. 
</P>
<P>
 The pretenders to the French throne -- Duchesse Gersande d'Orleans and her shy 
daughter, Princesse Diane -- as well as gendarmes on horseback, and yipping and 
yelling cancan dancers were all part of the back-in-time atmosphere that makes 
this annual fund-raiser for the Los Angeles Master Chorale seem like no 
ordinary Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is over the edge," said Suzanne Marx, fund-raiser for the Ronald Reagan 
Library. "It's always like this, every year." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our first time, and we are overwhelmed," said David Haspel, who runs 
a communication company, as he and his wife, Jane, sat down to a table covered 
in gold damask and laden with a cascading two-tiered flower arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the know credit Elizabeth Hirsch, a super-charged woman in a 
strapless gold lace ball gown. She has chaired the event for seven years, with 
eagerness to make the evenings, well, magnifique.  
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was the Venetian Fantasy Ball of 1780," she said. "We did Victorian 
England. We did Renaissance Italy. We did Vienna. We did America, the Kennedy 
era. 
</P>
<P>
 "The belle epoque almost denied the changes that were coming -- the new 
technology, electric lights, the motor car. That's the part of the belle epoque 
we're looking at, the dreamy part that didn't want to change," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 So while guests sipped French wines and dined on quail in brandied cherry 
sauce, French lyric coloratura soprano Isabelle Sabrie sang from a half-moon 
balcony and members of the Master Chorale serenaded in French. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the duchess was impressed. "It's so gay! So entertaining! It's 
fantastique!"  
</P>
<P>
 As guests trekked out to find their cars, they clutched their favors -- books 
on Paris daguerreotypes, written in French -- and may have wondered what would 
ever top this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year," said Hirsch, "we're talking Russian."

UCLA GRAD EMPLOYEES OPT FOR UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TY TAGAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They teach, grade papers and research like professors, but they don't get paid 
like them. 
</P>
<P>
 As budgets vaporize, UCLA's graduate student employees say they have been left 
to pick up the pieces, putting in extra unpaid hours to keep up with a growing 
workload. 
</P>
<P>
 They want a union to fight for better wages and job descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most undergrads will tell you most of what they learned was taught by 
(teaching assistants) rather than faculty," says Mike Miller, lead organizer 
for Student Association of Graduate Employees (SAGE). 
</P>
<P>
 He says graduate student employees deserve the right to bargain collectively. 
</P>
<P>
 But UCLA administrators say their students don't really want a union, don't 
really need a union and don't qualify for one anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,500 graduate students teach, grade papers, tutor or keep tabs on petri 
dishes. Together, they oil the academic machine. And, Miller says, many must 
choose between doing a good job and doing their own homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a cue from UC Berkeley graduate student strikes in 1989 and 1992 and 
union organizing efforts on campuses across the country, SAGE -- with financial 
and technical help from the United Auto Workers union -- has collected enough 
signatures to qualify for union representation. 
</P>
<P>
 But UCLA so far has declined to recognize SAGE as a bargaining representative. 
Its position is that the teaching and research that students do under faculty 
supervision is education -- not work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think of these folks as students first and then as apprentice employees 
way on down the list," says Robin Fisher, an associate dean of the graduate 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our major contention right now would be that because of the apprenticeship 
nature of these positions, they're not union job categories." 
</P>
<P>
 He says the university does its best to ensure that graduate student employees 
keep their hours down to 15 to 20 per week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some work more, he concedes, but "it's tough deciding how many of those 
outside hours are really necessary and how many are put in simply because 
somebody is really interested in what they're teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kathleen Komar, another associate dean of the graduate division, 
students who feel exploited can take their grievances to the administration, 
but few have done so. She says most of the union noise is coming from a few 
students motivated by outside agitators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that all the students recognize that SAGE is really the UAW," 
she says. "I would just hate to see people drift into a process that they don't 
understand or haven't been informed about." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, the SAGE organizer, says few graduates report exploitation for fear of 
reprisals. And, he adds, the students know what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the student organizers brought their case before the state Public 
Employment Relations Board, along with signed union membership cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The board counted the signatures and compared them to the university roster, 
determining that a majority of graduate students wanted the union. The 
university is challenging the finding. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision in the students' favor could force the university into 
negotiations, but, with appeals, the hearings could take years. Meanwhile, SAGE 
recently staged a sit-in in the chancellor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 If the members decide to strike, Miller believes the public will support their 
cause. "We're not the baseball players. We don't make a lot of money, so people 
aren't going to think that we don't deserve anything."

 BAD TIMING: If you're about to fall asleep at the wheel, it might be a good 
idea to make sure the police chief isn't watching. Take the case of a motorist 
in Reseda on Monday night. Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams spotted 
the car weaving between lanes, and alerted officers. . . . The motorist did not 
get a ticket. "We just gave him a lecture and let him go," said Lt. John 
Dunkin. 
</P>
<P>
 FIGHTING SPIRIT: Like George Foreman, the teen-age boxers in Augie Maldonado's 
Las Palmas Youth Group didn't pay attention to the odds. Forced out of a public 
park by the city of San Fernando in September, they are now forging links with 
other youth groups (B1). . . . "It's beginning to work," Maldonado says. "Kids 
from different areas don't see each other as enemies. They're seeing each other 
as friends." 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT STRIKE? Spring arrived early on the CSUN campus Tuesday -- it was media 
day for the school's baseball and softball teams. One woman on the spot is new 
softball Coach Janet Sherman (above), who takes over a team that made it to the 
NCAA championship game last year. . . . Sherman is replacing Gary Torgeson, who 
won 636 games in 13 seasons, more than any coach in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 CRUDE JOB: Poor Jeff Fisher. The former Taft High receiver this week was named 
head coach of the worst team in football, the Houston Oilers. The Oilers (1-9), 
in fact, look like they couldn't beat the current Taft squad. . . . In 1975, 
Fisher set a City Section record with 12 receptions for 258 yards against 
Chatsworth High. He was selected West Valley League Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 TEEN SNITCHES: It might soon become profitable for Antelope Valley high school 
students to inform on each other. The school board tonight will consider a 
program offering $25 to those reporting classmates with weapons or drugs on 
campus (B1). . . . The district promises confidentiality. "The intent is to 
reduce violence on campus," says board member Sue Stokka. Michael Arkush and 
Timothy Williams

 The Rams' defense ranks 16th in the NFL, but is it stopping teams when it 
counts? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is no, if you ask free safety Anthony Newman. The defense ranks 
27th in the NFL in third-down efficiency, giving up 62 first downs in 133 
attempts by opponents (46.6%). Only Philadelphia (74 of 158 for 46.8%) has a 
lower rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman blamed mental mistakes.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not taking care of business," Newman said. "We're dropping coverage, 
we're not putting pressure on the quarterback. It's the whole defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders converted eight of 16 third-down attempts in their 20-17 victory 
Sunday, including a 12-yard pass to Tim Brown on third and five that set up 
Jeff Jaeger's game-winning 44-yard field goal in the fourth quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 "We fight so hard to get teams in third and long, and we think we have them," 
Newman said. "We get lazy and we're not in it mentally. We'll get that 
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 "These long drives are killing us, and we have them third and 12. We know 
better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 On third and long, the Rams regularly substitute two defensive backs -- 
usually Robert Bailey and Wymon Henderson -- for linebackers Shane Conlan and 
Joe Kelly. Is that move raising concern with Coach Chuck Knox? 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, we've been playing pretty good on third-down conversion defense," 
Knox said. "You have to put your best cover people out there. I don't think you 
can attempt to cover their extra wide receiver with a linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a pretty good job two weeks ago (against Denver) and Sunday (against 
the Raiders). A week ago, we were talking about stopping a team on fourth down 
that has one of the greatest comeback quarterbacks in the game (John Elway)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Conlan's pile-driving hit on Raider running back Harvey Williams that 
saved a touchdown? Last season, Conlan might not have been in on a 
fourth-and-goal situation at the one-yard line.  
</P>
<P>
 Conlan, considered one of the league's best defenders against the rush, was 
routinely pulled out in goal-line situations by the Rams' coaching staff, who 
said the linebacker was too beat up to continue on a physical down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of puzzling," Conlan said. "That's something I do pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are 4-6 and have lost four of their last six games by a combined 16 
points. Considering the close losses, does Knox think the 4-6 record is a 
realistic reflection of how his team is playing? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that is reality," he said. "We're playing a lot of young people, 
first- and second-year guys. And the other thing is that we haven't had 
stability at the quarterback position. That's no fault of anybody's because 
both quarterbacks (Chris Chandler and Chris Miller) have been injured." MIKE

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: GOALKEEPER MANEUVERS KEEPING SOCCER 
COACHES BUSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're a coach getting your team ready for the start of the NCAA playoffs, 
you want everything upbeat and positive. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't to be for Cal State Fullerton soccer Coach Al Mistri. He and 
assistant Bob Ammann decided Tuesday to indefinitely suspend starting 
goalkeeper Mike Kornock for missing practice. Mistri said Kornock won't play 
when the Titans meet San Diego in a first-round game at 7 p.m. on Saturday at 
Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a practice scheduled for Saturday and Mike opted to do something 
else," Mistri said. "He had indicated he wanted to visit his girlfriend in 
Arizona over the weekend." Controversy has been simmering at goalkeeper since 
junior Justin Johnston played well as Kornock's replacement in Fullerton's 3-2 
overtime victory over top-ranked Indiana last month. Johnston played the last 
54 minutes and held Indiana scoreless after Kornock went out with a red card. 
</P>
<P>
 The red card also kept Kornock out of the lineup in the next game against 
Notre Dame, and the coaches felt Johnston again played well in a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Titans met California a week later, Kornock was back in the 
starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a difficult decision at the time, but we didn't want him to think that 
one decision that cost him the red card put him on the bench," Ammann said. 
Fullerton won, 5-2, but Ammann said Kornock didn't play particularly well. "I 
told him that I thought both goals he gave up were soft," Ammann said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next game against Loyola Marymount, Johnston was in the starting 
lineup, and the Titans won, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had decided a long time before to have Justin play that last game to give 
him some more experience if we needed him in the playoffs," Mistri said. 
"Kornock had been our starting goalkeeper in 18 of 19 games, so it's not like 
we had shown a lack of confidence in him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kornock was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri and Ammann said they didn't think they were snubbing Kornock by not 
starting him against Loyola Marymount. "We did the same thing last year when we 
let him start the last game of the season when he was backing up my brother, 
Mike," Ammann said.  
</P>
<P>
 While Mistri would have preferred sailing calmer waters this week, he remains 
hopeful the incident won't detract from his team's focus on Saturday's game. 
"This group can do it," Mistri said. "We had our biggest win of the season with 
Johnston in the net." 
</P>
<P>
 And who will back up Johnston? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking around the recreational leagues on campus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't joking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director John Easterbrook is pleased the Titans were able to be the 
host for Saturday's tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be good for our coaches, our players and our fans to have the game at 
home," Easterbrook said. "It's always an advantage for any team to be playing 
at home, and I think our fans will support it. We're really excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook said Fullerton had to guarantee the NCAA $4,500 to get the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figure we'll need a crowd of about 1,000 to break even," he said. "The 
team has been averaging just under that for home games, so we should be fine if 
our fans turn out for it the way we think they will. After all, there are only 
32 soccer teams in the running for the national championship now, and our team 
is one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook, who is in the first few months of his job, said he would like to 
see more Titan teams be host to NCAA events. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take continued improvements in the baseball stadium, however, for the 
school to be considered for a regional despite the longtime success record. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tougher financially in baseball too," Easterbrook said. "It usually 
takes a six-figure bid to get a baseball regional, and then you still can't be 
assured of getting one." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Coach Bob Hawking gets his first look at his men's basketball team against 
outside opposition when the Titans face the Blue and Gold Fleet team in an 
exhibition at 7:35 p.m. Thursday in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know much about the other team," Hawking said. "From what we do 
know, they're mostly former college players from the Bay Area. I think most 
played at the University of San Francisco and St. Mary's. But it will be a good 
test for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking was pleased with the Titans' weekend scrimmage. "The execution was 
better and I could tell the conditioning was better," Hawking said. "We've been 
getting some good play from several different people." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking said he hasn't committed to a starting lineup. "We probably won't do 
that until Thursday," he said. "We're having some real good competition at 
several spots, and it's still real close." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cross-country Coach John Elders was happy Heather Killeen was able to squeeze 
into the field for the NCAA championships next Tuesday at Arkansas after her 
recent misfortune in the NCAA regional and the Big West meet. 
</P>
<P>
 She finished 12th in the regional last weekend in Tucson, Ariz., despite more 
physical problems. But they were less severe than the trouble she had from 
bronchitis in the Big West meet when she faded from first to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was similar to what happened to her at the Big West, but not quite as 
bad," Elders said. "She had just moved into seventh place with about 100 meters 
to go, then she had another loss of strength, and several runners went past her 
just before the finish of the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Elders hopes she can be back at full strength for the nationals with another 
week to recover. "She really deserves a chance to compete in the nationals, and 
she can definitely run much better than she's run in the last couple of weeks 
if she's healthy," he said. Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, at least we got the monkey off our back," said women's volleyball Coach 
Mary Ellen Murchison, referring to the Titans' first victory of the season, a 
3-1 triumph over Utah State on Saturday. The victory broke a 35-match losing 
streak. The Titans, 1-26, close their season this weekend with a matches 
against New Mexico State at 7 p.m. Friday and Nevada at 2 p.m. Saturday. 
Jennifer Lipski leads the team in kills with 199. . . . Fullerton's Eddie Soto 
is tied for second in scoring in Far West Region soccer with 35 points on 16 
goals and three assists.

AGOURA GOES TO ANOTHER LEVEL FOR WATER POLO PLAYOFF MATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRYAN RODGERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A last-minute protest by San Luis Obispo High nearly forced Agoura to change 
the site of today's Southern Section quarterfinal water polo match, but the 
Chargers kept the match on campus by raising the water level of their pool in 
keeping with Southern Section guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura's pool is six feet deep, six inches shy of the standard required under 
national high school rules.The Southern Section forces its members to adopt the 
national guidelines once teams advance to the playoff quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Coach Jason Rosenthal is annoyed with the late protest by San Luis 
Obispo, saying the Chargers did not learn of the complaint until Tuesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have hosted second- and third-round matches here before and nobody has 
ever said anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did they wait until the day before a playoff match to complain? I filled 
the pool, so if they want to measure it, they can measure it all they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Before raising the water level, Agoura considered moving the match to Royal's 
home pool in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Chargers would have been forced to play at 1:30 p.m. because 
Royal is playing its quarterfinal match against Cabrillo today at 3:15 p.m.

 SEASON AT A GLANCE: Blair (5 foot 10, 175 pounds) has played sparingly at 
running back this season but as a defensive back has played every down. Coach 
Phil McCune decided Blair was better suited than the team's other backs to play 
offense against Oxnard and was put in the starting backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 WEEK AT A GLANCE: In a game the Cougars needed to win to make the Southern 
Section playoffs, Blair gained 201 yards in 12 carries, including touchdown 
runs of 37 and 66 yards, to help Ventura post a 57-32 victory over Oxnard. He 
also returned an interception 48 yards for another score. Blair had managed 
only 244 yards in 44 carries over the first nine games. "It was phenomenal," 
McCune said. "He played great."

SIDELINES; USING A LOT OF LOFT, O'LAUGHLIN COMPLETES MOST IMPORTANT PASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He already has championship rings from Southern Section titles he earned in 
football and basketball at Glendora High, plus a Big Ten Conference ring he 
earned as a backup for the Illinois football team. 
</P>
<P>
 And a year from now, J.J. O'Laughlin, Cal State Northridge's highly touted 
quarterback, will have yet another band to show off. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Laughlin is engaged to Kathleen Shannon, the setter on the Northridge 
volleyball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon and O'Laughlin met at Illinois. He transferred to Northridge last 
fall; she followed this past summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months ago, while Shannon was back home in Chicago staying with her 
parents, O'Laughlin scheduled a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 After treating Shannon to dinner at a swank restaurant, O'Laughlin talked her 
into taking the elevator to the top of the Sears Tower, the world's tallest 
building. There, on one knee, he proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists within earshot applauded when Shannon agreed and O'Laughlin handed 
over an engagement ring. 
</P>
<P>
 He's good all right. How many quarterbacks take a knee and still hit pay dirt? 
</P>
<P>
 Rivalry sacked: USC-UCLA, it's not. But as rivalries go, the football opener 
between La Canada and Crescenta Valley highs has determined bragging rights 
along Foothill Boulevard for the past 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the recent decision by first-year La Canada Coach Jim Clausen to 
discontinue the rivalry -- at least for two years -- has ruffled the Falcons' 
feathers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not happy," said Bob Canfield, Crescenta Valley's athletic director. 
"You don't just discontinue a rivalry. It's one of our top two gates of the 
season. I don't understand why they're doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 Clausen cited a difference in enrollment. Crescenta Valley has more than 2,000 
students compared to La Canada's approximately 1,100. And even though Crescenta 
Valley holds only a 10-9 series edge, the Falcons have won the last three 
games, including a 28-0 drubbing this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just trying to do what's best for my kids right now," Clausen said. "We 
need to get our program on par with theirs. It's a great opening game for CV, 
but it's not what I'd call a good opening game for us. I'd like to schedule 
them again, maybe after a two-year hiatus." 
</P>
<P>
 Weighty predicament: Oak Park High will play host to Riverside Notre Dame on 
Friday night in the opening round of the Southern Section Division IX football 
playoffs. But one look at some of the Titans' mammoth linemen had Oak Park 
Coach Dick Billingsley wondering if his team won't be lining up against the 
Notre Dame that calls South Bend, Ind., home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the biggest high school team I've ever seen," Billingsley said. 
"They've got one guy at 295 (pounds), two guys at 285, two guys at 265, three 
guys at 235, a guy at 230 and three guys at 220." 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park's game plan? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to run like bunnies and get out of the way," Billingsley said. 
Quotebook 
</P>
<P>
 At least one Northridge football player emerged a winner from last week's 
boycott of practice. When a reporter mentioned to lineman Jonathan Beauregard, 
who is accused of attempted murder, that the actions of his teammates were 
taking the spotlight off his problems, he cracked: "Write all you can. Keep it 
coming." Honors 
</P>
<P>
 Midfielder Mathew Davis and fullback Ross Linhart of the Cal State Northridge 
soccer team were selected to the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation's 
All-Pacific Division second team in voting by coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a junior, scored four goals and paced Northridge with nine assists to 
tie for the team lead in scoring with 17 points. Linhart, a junior, was the 
Matadors' top defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Midfielder Ron Lou, another junior, received honorable mention. Stats 
</P>
<P>
 In Bob Burt's first five seasons as football coach at Cal State Northridge, 
his teams never had a losing season and were 34-21 overall. Northridge hasn't 
had a winning season in the past four, however, and is 15-24 in that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the pack: The Thousand Oaks High boys' cross-country team is 
starting to dominate the Southern Section's all-time list for team times over 
Mt. San Antonio College's three-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers set the section record of 77 minutes 56 seconds in winning last 
year's Division I finals and they turned in the No. 2 performance with a 78:19 
mark in last month's Mt. SAC Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, their top five runners compiled a cumulative team time of 78:32 
in the Southern Section preliminaries to move to fourth on the all-time list. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo, the 1989 state Division I champion, ranks third on the list with a 
78:27 clocking and the 1985 Saugus squad is fifth at 78:36. 
</P>
<P>
 Dig it: Middle blocker Heather Anderson has moved into fifth on the Cal State 
Northridge career list in digs with 929. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2 senior from Fresno Clovis High is 48 shy of fourth-place Kathleen 
Dixon, who had 977 digs from 1987-90. Things to Do 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, 2 p.m., at The Racquet Centre, Studio City: Defending champion Taft 
High will play Palisades in the City Section 4-A Division girls' team tennis 
final.

High, will leave Cal Lutheran to play junior college football, Kingsmen Coach 
Joe Harper said.

 Hernandez could not be reached for comment, but Harper said his impression is 
that Hernandez wants to play junior college football as a means to earning a 
Division I scholarship.

HUNTINGTON BEACH'S WENDT OUSTS LAGUNA BEACH FROM THE PLAYOFFS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Outside hitter Melissa Wendt had 28 kills to lead Huntington Beach to a 
five-game victory over Laguna Beach in a Division I quarterfinal, 15-10, 13-15, 
15-17, 15-5, 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers (16-3) face Manhattan Beach Mira Costa, which beat Santa Barbara 
San Marcos, in Thursday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach (19-3) fought off game point, 14-13, in an emotional third game 
to win, 17-15. With momentum on the Artists' side, and a 2-1 game advantage, it 
looked as though the Pacific Coast League champions would prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huntington Beach scored seven unanswered points with senior Kim Watts at 
the serving line, and Laguna Beach was only able to come up with one more 
before dropping the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Using an almost flawless slide attack -- run to the right, hit cross-court to 
the left -- junior middle blocker Jill Meyers added 15 kills to Wendt's 28. 
Coach Rocky Ciarelli was happy to discuss Wendt, Meyers and Gale's class 
status. "All juniors. I like it when I say that -- 'juniors."' HEATHER STEVENS

<P>
 The Saxons are young and inexperienced, so they might take some lumps this 
season. "We're emphasizing getting better with every practice and every game," 
Prange said. Hoggatt is the most experienced player, and he only started two or 
three games last season, Prange said. "He's the only one with a whole season of 
varsity experience. Dan and Tony (Moss) need to score and rebound for us." 
McBride, who starts at running back for the football team, should be the point 
guard. Popal, up from the junior varsity, and Thomas, the freshman MVP, are two 
of the team's best shooters. Both will see significant action. Moses, JV MVP, 
will also see time at off-guard. Goulding and Hollenbeck are key reserves on 
the front line. "This team has the best work ethic of any I've had," Prange 
said. "That's what makes me excited because I think they can improve." SCHEDULE

 Danley, a 28-year coaching veteran at Katella, is excited about this season's 
team. "This could be one of our better years," Danley said. "We could be a top 
five team in the county." There are lots of reasons for Danley's optimism, 
starting with the Knights' front line. Returning all-league players Clayton and 
Pahl will be tough for opponents to deal with. Clayton, a 6-5 forward, is a 
versatile player who is explosive around the basket. Pahl averaged 12.5 points 
last season and is a force in the low post. It gets better. Danley said his 
point guard, Romero, will turn heads this season. "He's only a junior, but he's 
one of the best in the county," Danley said. "He's quick, and handles the ball 
well. He reminds me of Rick Aberegg." Aberegg was one of Danley's best, 
averaging 27.5 points in his senior season at Katella in 1970. Armbruster, 
Barnwell and Burfeind are Danley's three other top-notch players this season. 
"This is the first time in a few years where we have a legitimate six players 
who could be called starters," Danley said. "For us, it's not going to be who 
we play but how we play." SCHEDULE

 Kennedy missed the playoffs last season for the first time since 1985, but 
Mayberry hopes the team will return to prominence. "We just have to get back to 
playing at that level," Mayberry said. "If the seniors come through to lead the 
way, I think we have the best sophomores and juniors we've had in some years." 
Dreessen was the team's leading rebounder and second-best scorer last season, 
and he will be a key figure inside for the Fighting Irish. Van Otterloo gives 
Mayberry another big body inside and Zuschlag started at times last season. 
Petrie was a reserve guard last season and Murakami helped the junior varsity 
win the league title before coming up to the varsity late in the season. Both 
will play point guard. Tsuboi will play off-guard, but Bowen is one of the 
team's best shooters and he will play guard and forward. "Purnell will have to 
play somewhere, too," Mayberry said. "He's the best leaper in the program." It 
all adds up to an improved season. "We have a tough nonleague schedule," 
Mayberry said. "We also open league with Katella and Cypress, so we'll find out 
how good we are in a hurry." SCHEDULE

 Cypress should contend for the league championship with 10 players returning 
from last season's fourth-place squad. In the backcourt, first-team All-Empire 
selection Mitchell returns after averaging 15 points. Forwards Boberg and 
Boulton are also solid performers who each averaged 10 points last season. 
Boulton also averaged 10 rebounds last season although he played part of the 
season with a hairline fracture in his ankle. "Boulton will be a real surprise 
to some people," Gorrell said. "He has a nice touch and will defend our 
opponents' best big man." Bunn, Gingras, Harris, Mitchell, Solheim and Shelton 
are capable of making significant contributions and will all push for playing

 The Centurions are coming off their best season ever, but lost all their 
starters. The two biggest losses are the Harmon brothers. Thomas, a first-team 
all-county player who averaged 18 points, graduated and his younger brother, 
Ike, has transferred to Santa Ana Valley. Century has no player taller than 
6-2, but will be a quick and pesky defensive team. Beltran and Arrington are 
small but strong guards, and both are good defensive players. Aguirre could be 
one of the team's top offensive threats, but he only averaged three points last 
season. "He's not flashy, but he gets the job done," Coombs said. Diaz and 
Lopez are young, but both are fine shooters. Benavides, Bugarin and Ros will 
also contribute. "Everyone is interchangeable," Coombs said. "We'll be able to 
run, and although we won't have Thomas scoring 18 or 20 a game, we could have 
different leading scorers every night. But our defense is what will keep us in 
games." SCHEDULE

 Although Katella and Cypress are considered the favorites, league coaches 
figure El Dorado, Century and Kennedy could all make it interesting. "It's a 
very tough league," Tivenan said. "There could be a very good team in fourth or 
fifth place when January comes around." Although El Dorado tied for fifth last 
season, a year of experience should help it this season. Miller is a top-flight 
point guard who averaged 11.5 points last season. Simonsen averaged 6.3 points 
last season and is in his third year on the varsity. Sammons is the team's top 
post player and is quick around the basket. "He plays bigger than he is," 
Tivenan said. Ayer, a 6-5 center, could be one of the county's top sophomores, 
Tivenan said. "He's our second-best three-point shooter with good perimeter

STATE OKS COMPROMISE ATTACK ON AIR POLLUTION; SMOG: PLAN SUBMITTED TO U.S. 
CALLS FOR ALTERNATIVE FUELS, ELECTRIC CARS. BUT AUTO, TRUCKING INDUSTRIES GAIN 
CONCESSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barely meeting a key federal deadline, the state Air Resources Board on 
Tuesday unanimously adopted a sweeping plan that aims to clean up California's 
smog with an array of hotly contested strategies that could cost consumers and 
industries billions of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
 After 25 hours of stormy testimony from business owners and environmentalists, 
the air board approved a compromise plan that pushes advanced technology in 
cars and trucks and includes concessions drafted to accommodate the oil, 
trucking and auto industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Provisions that will force widespread use of much cleaner alternative fuels 
and electric vehicles in California after the year 2004 were kept in the plan 
as a high priority. As a compromise, though, the board decided that it was too 
soon to determine how stringent a future standard might be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan also relies heavily on a voluntary strategy drafted by Texaco and 
the trucking industry to use public money to buy and scrap thousands of older, 
polluting cars and diesel trucks beginning in 1996 in the four-county Los 
Angeles Basin, the state's smoggiest region. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of buying cars at $1,000 apiece would be about $75 million a year by 
1999. No sources of funds have been determined, but the ARB says the effort 
might be financed through a $7 annual fee tacked onto vehicle registrations or 
a $100 fee on new cars. 
</P>
<P>
 California's new blueprint for battling ozone outlines an ambitious 15-year 
agenda that is supposed to finally achieve the Los Angeles Basin's elusive goal 
of healthful air in 2010, the year mandated by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, California had until Tuesday to submit a strategy outlining 
in detail how it would comply with a national health standard for ozone in six 
regions of the state or face more onerous rules and sanctions from the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-member air board was under direction from Gov. Pete Wilson to protect 
the state's struggling economy but still meet federal clean air mandates as it 
wrestled with how to slash ozone -- the pervasive, lung-damaging main 
ingredient of smog -- by about 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must understand what our actions mean to each and every sector of the 
economy," said Jacqueline Schafer, chairwoman of the ARB. "We are in 
competition with other states to ensure that California's quality of life is 
the best. That means that in attempting to ensure our environmental future we 
must be cognizant of the economic mortgage required." 
</P>
<P>
 The board decided in a 7-0 vote to strike a compromise over new technology for 
cars because a proposal by the ARB staff last week prompted outrage from 
environmentalists and businesses that support alternative fuel technology. But 
in a concession to the trucking industry, the ARB made standards forcing 
alternative fuels in heavy-duty trucks a lower priority, setting no stringent 
long-term emissions goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan gives high priority to the proposal to begin scrapping old cars 
in the Los Angeles Basin at a pace of 6,000 vehicles in 1996, increasing to 
75,000 a year in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 But local air quality officials fear that the scrap program is too unrealistic 
and unenforceable to satisfy federal mandates, especially for the Los Angeles 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's the wrong way to go," said James Lents, executive officer of 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the agency that regulates air 
pollution in the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and businesses that back alternative-fuel vehicles 
criticized the ARB for giving in to influential industries. They said it is 
unfair to impose new fees on residents to pay for scrap programs when most of 
the burden should remain on industries that produce polluting vehicles and 
fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CARB board wimped out on this whole thing," said Henry W. Wedaa, Orange 
County's representative on the Air Quality Management District Board and its 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should the public pay for this?" he said. "Why shouldn't the industries 
creating the problem solve their problem? This is just another typical scheme 
to get out of cleaning up their emissions. The real story behind the story from 
my perspective is that nobody wants to use alternative fuels." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Hirsch, a senior manager at Southern California Gas Co., said last 
week's draft version made "a mockery of the people like us who have tried to 
advance this technology so far." But Tuesday's final plan "puts back some teeth 
for increased technology," he said. "It's a good solid compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Auto, trucking and oil executives, however, said the ARB was too optimistic in 
gauging the extent that alternative fuels and electricity could power cars and 
trucks in 2005. The price of alternative-fuel vehicles remains too high and too 
many technical shortcomings exist to guarantee widespread use, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives contend that a program to scrap old vehicles would cost 
billions of dollars less and save jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This serves as a model for how employers and the air board can work together 
to find things that do not cause as much job loss but meet the same air quality 
goals," said Allan Zaremberg, senior vice president of the California Chamber 
of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Air board member Jack Lagarias, who suggested the compromise Tuesday, said the 
plan "will send a message to (vehicle and fuel) manufacturers that advanced 
technology is still an answer to California's air quality problems." He said it 
was important to leave open to debate in the year 2000 how stringent a standard 
is necessary and reasonable by then. 
</P>
<P>
 For 25 years, the ARB staff and board have been unwavering in setting tough 
state mandates that force cleaner fuels and vehicles. But they have been under 
increasing pressure from Gov. Wilson's office in recent months to incorporate 
less costly alternatives recommended by the oil and trucking industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although eclipsed during much of the debate by the controversy over the 
vehicle scrapping programs, the new plan contains hundreds of important and 
aggressive measures regulating pesticides, consumer products ranging from 
aerosol paint to nail polish, and businesses from aerospace to auto mechanic 
shops. It also requires California heavy-duty truck operators to cut diesel 
exhaust in half by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is a compilation of measures to be imposed by the ARB and six 
regional districts, including the AQMD, as well as some national standards for 
railroads, airlines and other interstate sources under consideration by the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's goal is to create an anti-smog program strong enough to replace 
proposals developed by the EPA that have been criticized by virtually every 
business and government agency as onerous and economically disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
 "California's economy has a loaded gun to its head," Wilson's chief economist, 
Phil Romero, said at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero said the state plan would be 30% to 80% less expensive than the federal 
version. An economic consultant hired by the ARB at Wilson's request estimated 
that the state plan would cost $6 billion a year compared to $8 billion a year 
under the federal plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The ARB's plan, however, may not be specific enough to win the approval of the 
EPA, which has veto power. David Howekamp, chief of the EPA's western regional 
air division, said it lacks such necessary details as a strategy for funding 
the scrapping programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would have to address those issues," Howekamp said. "They have to have 
enforceable measures for this to be an approvable plan." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA has six months to determine if the plan is complete and a year after 
that to approve or reject it. 
</P>
<P>
 Schafer challenged the EPA to act quickly in accepting California's plan as a 
replacement of the federal version and also to adopt some national pollution 
standards for sources such as railroads and airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Submitting the (plan) today sent the message that California is willing to 
accept its responsibility no matter how difficult it may be," Schafer said. 
"California simply wants the federal government and EPA to accept the same 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a vocal opponent of the federal plan, 
praised the ARB Tuesday for "including many constructive proposals to achieve 
clean air and preserve jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The scrapping program is designed only for Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and 
San Bernardino counties, but could be expanded later. 
</P>
<P>
 The air board acknowledged that there is no easy source of funding for buying 
old cars and new fees are likely to become an explosive issue for Californians. 
Legislative approval is necessary before the program can begin, and the 
California Chamber of Commerce and oil industry officials have pledged to the 
ARB that they will persuade state legislators to pass a funding bill next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to cars, the plan prescribes the scrapping of 1,600 old, high 
polluting diesel trucks per year in the basin beginning in 1999. Fewer would be 
scrapped from 1996 to 1998. The ARB suggests low-income loans or government 
subsidies to pay the truckers to replace their old vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Zane, who directs the Coalition for Clean Air, said trying to buy such 
large volumes of vehicles is a "bogus, ephemeral notion . . . utterly, utterly 
absurd. Scrapping does have its place, but we should not see it as a substitute 
for new technologies." 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD officials say they also worry that the attempt to retire so many old 
vehicles will fail, leaving the Southland unable to meet health standards. "We 
think they are being overly optimistic," Lents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lents said he doubts that $1,000 will be enough to persuade motorists to sell 
their vehicles, which in most cases would be over eight years old. In an 
experimental program, Chevron and other oil companies have bought and scrapped 
5,000 cars since the summer of 1993, but have started to run out of willing 
sellers and have already upped offers to $1,500, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co. Executive Engineer Mike Schwarz acknowledged that the public, 
not the car and oil industries, would pay for the scrapping program. But he 
said that even if auto makers are forced to produce new technologies, they 
still would pass the cost to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is how, not whether, California citizens should pay for the 
measures in this plan," Schwarz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the concessions, some business leaders say the burden on California 
companies remains far too high. The plan "will have a dramatic and adverse 
effect on California's economy," said United Parcel Service executive Ken 
Churchill.

37.5% DECLINE IN DEATHS CREDITED TO HELMET LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its first year, the California motorcycle helmet law produced a 37.5% drop 
in fatalities from motorcycle collisions and saved as many as 122 lives, 
according to UCLA researchers who have conducted what they termed the 
"definitive" study of motorcycle safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonfatal head injuries also decreased significantly after implementation of 
the law in January, 1992, and there were sharp declines in the time injured 
motorcyclists spent in intensive care units and in the hospital after nonfatal 
accidents, the UCLA team reports today in the Journal of the American Medical 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorcyclists who did not wear helmets suffered a disproportionate share of 
injuries: Although fewer than 0.5% of motorcyclists did not wear helmets, they 
accounted for 15% of deaths and serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is it saves all of us a lot of money when you prevent someone 
from dying or becoming a paraplegic and ending up on the state rolls for 
assistance," said Ray Biancolana, deputy director of the state Office of 
Traffic Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, fatalities involving motorcycle and motor-scooter drivers 
and passengers actually rose in the helmet law's first year, from 29 in 1991 to 
37 in 1992, according to the coroner's office. However, fatalities dropped 
dramatically in 1993, to 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-helmet motorcyclists contend that there are other factors responsible for 
the decline in deaths, especially aggressive licensing and rider education 
programs. "That is not reflected in the medical studies," said Larry Alger, 
marketing director of Bikers Against Manslaughter. "The important thing is not 
to crash in the first place, and that stems from proper education and 
licensing." 
</P>
<P>
 Biancolana, however, noted that the education and licensing programs were 
initiated in the 1980s. Such programs are responsible for the ongoing decline 
in motorcycle fatalities, he said, but an additional, sharp drop in deaths 
occurred after the helmet law went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers found that there were 523 fatalities in 1991, compared to 327 
in 1992, a drop of 37.5%. Using two different techniques to predict the number 
of deaths that would have occurred in 1992 without a helmet law, they concluded 
that 92 to 122 lives had been saved by the law. The proportion of helmet use 
increased from 43% of motorcyclists in 1991 to 99.5% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatality rate dropped from 70.1 deaths per 100,000 motorcycles in 1991 to 
51.5 per 100,000 in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the deaths were among motorcycle drivers, but the study also found 
that the number of motorcycle passenger deaths dropped, from 66 in 1991 to 20 
in 1992, a 69% decrease. Some of that decrease, however, resulted from the fact 
that there were fewer passengers in 1992, although the actual numbers have not 
yet been determined, said UCLA's Corinne Peek, co-author of the study with 
David L. McArthur and Jess F. Kraus of UCLA and Alan Williams of the Institute 
for Highway Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Among riders injured but not fatally, the average number of days spent in the 
hospital decreased by more than one day, the average number of days spent in 
intensive care decreased by 21.4% and the total number of surgical procedures 
decreased by 13%. 
</P>
<P>
 In large part because of the California study, the American Medical Assn.'s 
Council on Scientific Affairs issued a new report in today's journal calling 
for adoption of nationwide mandatory helmet laws for motorcyclists and 
bicyclists.  
</P>
<P>
 The California results play a significant role in promoting the council's 
support for the recommendations, said council member Dr. Mitchell S. Karlan, a 
cancer surgeon in Beverly Hills. The helmet laws and the rider education, he 
said, "are good public health and good preventive medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 By the beginning of this year, 23 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto 
Rico had laws mandating helmet use for all motorcyclists. Twenty-four other 
states had partial laws, most requiring use by riders under age 18. Three 
states, Colorado, Illinois and Iowa, had no helmet laws. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the most recent figures from the federal Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, 9,913 people died in motorcycle crashes in the United 
States from 1989 through 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Several studies in other states have shown reductions in motorcycle deaths 
resulting from helmet laws, but many of those studies involved relatively small 
populations, which limited their statistical reliability, Peek said. 
</P>
<P>
 California, in contrast, has large numbers of motorcycles, which can be ridden 
year-round, making it ideal as the site for such a study, McArthur said. 
Moreover, in anticipation of the law's passage, the UCLA group was able to 
begin collecting data in January, 1991, a year before the law took effect. 
Because the data was gathered prospectively, Peek said, injuries and fatalities 
are less likely to be missed and the numbers are generally considered more 
reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new data is combined with that of previous studies, she said, it is 
clear that "motorcycle helmet laws greatly increase helmet use, they definitely 
save lives and they prevent injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Mark I. Pinsky contributed to this story. Saving Lives 
</P>
<P>
 Although deaths from motorcycle accidents have been declining for years, a new 
UCLA study shows that the 1992 motorcycle helmet law reduced deaths that year 
by 37.5%

BELL RINGER WHO CENTERED LIFE ON MISSION DIES AT 99; OBITUARY: SAN JUAN 
CAPISTRANO'S PATRIARCH PAUL ARBISO IS REMEMBERED AS THE CITY'S 'LIVING LINK 
WITH THE PAST.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Paul Arbiso, who was known as the living embodiment of historic San Juan 
Capistrano and as the beloved bell ringer who welcomed the swallows home every 
year on Swallows Day, died in his sleep Monday night at age 99. 
</P>
<P>
 As the city's patriarch since 1952, Arbiso was a connection with San Juan 
Capistrano's rich frontier history, someone who could regale listeners with 
tales of life before automobiles, freeways and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was our living link with the past," Mary Tryon, a spokeswoman for the San 
Juan Capistrano Historical Society, said Tuesday as family and friends mourned 
his death. "He was born before the turn of the century and lived here all his 
life. Paul was the one person who remembered the mission before all the 
restoration work started." 
</P>
<P>
 The Juaneno Indian's lifelong work centered on Mission San Juan Capistrano. He 
played in its dusty stables as a child and picked up his first job there in 
1908. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the first automobile ever seen in San Juan Capistrano," Arbiso 
recalled in a 1992 interview. "We kids saw it coming down the road and we 
started screaming about the horseless buggy." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Arbiso became head gardener for the mission's famous rose gardens, 
a job that would remain his passion after retirement at age 93. Even after 
retiring, he would return to the gardens after Sunday Mass, often clipping 
roses that he would present to women around downtown San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "His heart was in that beautiful rose garden," said Msgr. Paul Martin, the 
mission's pastor. "He loved them and they certainly loved him." 
</P>
<P>
 As bell ringer, a job he held for more than 60 years, Arbiso would pull on the 
thick ropes of the mission's giant iron bells to announce a death or the birth 
of a child in town. But his fame came on March 19 each year, when media from 
around the world would assemble to watch for the fabled return of the swallows. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Arbiso's job to ring the mission bells to symbolize the sighting of the 
first swallow of spring. He took the job seriously, but he couldn't help but 
poke fun at the inevitable reporter who didn't know the return of the swallows 
was mostly myth. 
</P>
<P>
 "When do you think the first swallow will come?" he was asked one year by a 
journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, probably right after Mass," Arbiso replied, meaning that the first 
swallow would make an appearance only after he left church and could sound the 
bells. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbiso, whose nickname was "Mocho," a reference to three fingers he lost in 
France during World War I, was asked many times over the years about the secret 
to his longevity. His answer was always the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made good clay," he would reply. The translation was left to friends, who 
said Arbiso was referring to living a simple, clean life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never got mad or excited," said Bob Dunn, the historical society's vice 
president and a close friend and neighbor of Arbiso. "That's how you get to 99, 
never sweat the small stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cha Cha Bellardes, a distant cousin who works at the mission: "A lot of 
people looked to Paul as a father. He would go to the Swallows (saloon) and 
everyone would come up to him and ask questions about the city's history." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who met Arbiso at the mission in 1961, described him as a "wonderful 
man. He was the best of the community embodied in one person." 
</P>
<P>
 Arbiso conceded little to the passing years. Until becoming ill in recent 
weeks, he was a familiar sight downtown, walking to Sunday Mass at the mission 
or visiting friends. 
</P>
<P>
 He maintained a love for an occasional sip of red wine and, of course, 
gardening, keeping a small vegetable patch that produced corn, squash, beets 
and radishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had a doubt that he would make 100," said his daughter, Alice 
Gastelum. "We were going to have a big blowout (on his birthday). But he died a 
beautiful death, just going to sleep comfortably while we watched." 
</P>
<P>
 The ringing of the mission bells during Swallows Day and other occasions will 
be left to Arbiso's grandson, Michael Gastelum. 
</P>
<P>
 The historical society has decided not to name a replacement patriarch for 
Arbiso or matriarch Evelyne Marie Lobo Villegas -- who died in April -- until 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have an old-fashioned period of mourning," Dunn said. "It's a matter 
of respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn said his enduring memory of Arbiso will be of his friend who, at age 99, 
rang the mission bells for a final time at Lobo Villegas' funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the last dramatic thing I saw him do," Dunn said. "I'll forever 
remember him ringing those bells and getting that pattern exactly right. I'll 
always remember him as a serene, quiet man whom I came to love very dearly." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his daughter, Arbiso is survived by three grandchildren, six 
great-grandchildren, seven great-great grandchildren and many other family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 A rosary will be said at the Mission San Juan Capistrano on Friday at 7:30 
p.m. Funeral services, followed by the patriarch's traditional procession, will 
be held Saturday, beginning at 9:30 a.m., at Serra Chapel on the mission 
grounds.

WEST VALLEY SCHOOLS NO. 1 CHOICE IN OPEN ENROLLMENT; EDUCATION: TAFT HIGH AND 
TWO NORTHRIDGE CAMPUSES TOP THE LIST AS 10,000 STUDENTS DISTRICTWIDE DECIDE TO 
TRANSFER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The results are in: Nearly 10,000 Los Angeles students -- including more than 
half in the San Fernando Valley -- are attending new schools this fall thanks 
to a new open-enrollment policy allowing parents to choose campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The most sought-after elementary, middle and senior high schools in the Los 
Angeles Unified School District -- and those with space available -- were Taft 
High in Woodland Hills, and Nobel Middle and Castlebay Lane Elementary, both in 
Northridge. Taft enrolled 488 new students, Nobel 130, and Castlebay 98, school 
district records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the open-enrollment policy, mandated by a 1993 state law and carried out 
by the Board of Education last spring, parents could select schools with 
available classroom space as long as racial balances remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Many state and local educators hailed the new law as a way of giving parents 
greater freedom to improve their children's education by selecting schools. 
Traditionally, school attendance boundaries have been rigidly enforced and 
parents had to obtain special permits to send their children to schools outside 
their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the open-enrollment seats offered at 375 schools throughout the 
district were snapped up by new students. Districtwide, 19,200 seats were 
offered and 9,810 were filled. Valley students signed up for 5,623. Nearly 400 
students enrolled from private schools, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles school board President Mark Slavkin said he was pleased with the 
first year's results but said he wants the district to release another 
significant piece of information: a list of the schools that students are 
fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that feedback is important," Slavkin said. "We should be looking at 
those schools." 
</P>
<P>
 One intent of the law was to improve the overall quality of schools by 
injecting free-market competition into public education. If a school is losing 
numerous students, it could be viewed as one indicator of a weak educational 
program. Some, however, have criticized the choice movement, saying that 
disadvantaged students do not have the ability to leave neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some principals and board members said they were not surprised by the heavy 
demand for seats on West Valley campuses. Parents perceive these schools to be 
safer suburban campuses with more experienced teachers, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials were pleased to find that students in some areas were returning 
to their neighborhood schools. Several voluntary integration programs have 
allowed students to travel to schools outside of their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 At Garfield High on the Eastside, for instance, 108 new students enrolled. At 
Lincoln High, also on the Eastside, 114 showed up. Both schools heavily 
promoted their campuses during neighborhood meetings to lure resident students. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a degree of subjectivity -- safety, the instructional program, 
discipline . . . all these things are in play when parents choose," Slavkin 
said. "It's not just a numerical figure based on test scores." 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda High School Principal Bob Kladifko, who lost about 100 students, said 
he believes the ethnic and racial makeup of schools weighed heavily on 
decisions, with some parents looking for "whiter" campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shocker, but that's what I'm hearing," Kladifko said. "It had good 
intentions -- to give people a choice -- but the choice they're taking is 
racially motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 Other principals, however, downplayed the race issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone thought there would be a tremendous increase in the white student 
population and a decrease in the minority population," said Ron Berz, the 
principal at Taft, where white enrollment increased only slightly. "I go by the 
facts and it's just not that significant." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Taft received the most applications of any district school and many 
parents credited the academic program, a new statewide ranking of high schools 
does not place Taft at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which ranked schools on performance standards, including test 
scores, dropout rates and curriculum, placed Taft behind El Camino Real High in 
Woodland Hills and Birmingham Senior High in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, several parents said Tuesday they believe Taft is a superior 
school. Edith Blanco, who lives in Sun Valley but sends her two sons to Taft, 
said the school is safe and provides challenging courses. Her teen-agers' home 
school is Polytechnic High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather take the 45-minute drive in the morning and after school to make 
sure they're in a better school," Blanco said. "I'm willing to sacrifice my 
time because my children are important. I'm really grateful that this came 
along; otherwise you're limited to the schools where you live." 
</P>
<P>
 Taft also had the most available seats of any high school in the district, 
which also contributed to its high number of applications.  
</P>
<P>
 Dotty Spector, who lives in Canoga Park and sends her son to Taft, said he 
always wanted to attend the school. "It's about time parents and students are 
allowed to have choices," Spector said. 
</P>
<P>
 While dozens of schools advertised for students last spring in newspapers and 
in 30-second television spots that aired on the school district's station, many 
campuses, mainly in South-Central Los Angeles and East Valley, did not have the 
space for new students. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators, who determined the classroom seats available, were required to 
keep space open for area students. As a result, many popular schools, such as 
Carpenter Avenue Elementary in Studio City and Third Street Elementary in 
Hancock Park, could not accept any students under open enrollment. Van Nuys 
High had room for just 20 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents shopped for campuses last spring, visiting classes and even attending 
school plays. Many parents applied at several campuses to ensure their children 
were accepted to at least one of their top choices. Schools with more 
applications than space held lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing parents to choose schools has an added benefit to many schools, 
according to administrators and parent groups. "I think when parents pick 
schools, they're so relieved and happy to be there . . . they feel it's their 
obligation to participate," said Harriet Sculley, president of the San Fernando 
Valley's Parent Teacher Student Assn. "Absolutely, it will help parent 
involvement." 
</P>
<P>
 It's already paid off at Nobel. "People are truly supportive and interested in 
their children's education," said Rita Davis, the Nobel principal. "We do have 
real good parent participation and we're proud of that."

O.C. REPUBLICANS IN LINE FOR NEW ASSEMBLY POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a time Orange County Republicans never dreamed would arrive so soon. 
</P>
<P>
 With last week's surprising series of Election Day victories, the GOP is on 
the brink of seizing control of the state Assembly. In one swift stroke, the 
Orange County delegation -- a conservative clan once dubbed "cavemen" for their 
ideology -- could go from a bunch of outsiders to perhaps the most potent bloc 
of votes in the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a last-minute political miracle by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and 
the Democrats, the Orange County group -- who make up nearly one-quarter of the 
GOP majority -- can finally be in a position to truly make their mark under the 
Capitol dome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County will and should reap disproportional benefits," said 
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), who won't enjoy the new majority 
status because he is vacating his seat early next month to run for the state 
Senate. "One reason is, there's so many of them. No. 2 is because they provide 
the philosophical basis that the Assembly Republican caucus will have." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the newfound prestige come the perks of the party in power, be it a 
better parking space in the Capitol's subterranean garage or a better grade of 
carpet on the office floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Many among the Orange County GOP delegation have long subsisted in 
dungeon-like quarters. Assemblyman Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside), for instance, was 
shoe-horned during his freshman term into a tight, two-room Capitol office with 
nary a window to be found. He and others representing Orange County could get 
the office equivalent of front-row center -- big windows with views of leafy 
Capitol Park, newer furnishings, much more space. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the delegation pooh-pooh such improvements, saying it would be against 
the Republican creed to spend very much on remodeling or other perks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how the view out of one's window has a lot to do with how one 
performs," said Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Placentia). 
</P>
<P>
 Added Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), "Those are under-the-dome 
things that really have little significance in the scheme of things." 
</P>
<P>
 A more tangible benefit would be the additional staff and office equipment -- 
computers, typewriters, laser printers -- that heretofore only the Democratic 
majority had enjoyed. "The Democrats had budgets three and four times those of 
most Republicans," Ferguson said. "As the majority party, you have the 
resources to run the government and the resources to help yourself get 
reelected because you control the government." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, several Orange County Assembly members would probably be named to 
chair prime legislative committees. The new assignments would not only provide 
added prestige and campaign fund-raising prowess, but also give a lawmaker as 
many as three or four additional staff members, the sort of brain trust needed 
to tackle big-picture, omnibus policy legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans were always at a disadvantage in trying to research 
legislation," noted Pete Conaty, chief of staff for Assemblyman Mickey Conroy 
(R-Orange). 
</P>
<P>
 All the members of the Orange County delegation remain tight-lipped about 
their prospects for committee chairmanships. But conventional wisdom under the 
Capitol dome suggests that Conroy would end up chairing the Utilities and 
Commerce Committee and that Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) would get 
Education or Natural Resources. Morrow could be in line for Judiciary or 
Health. If he wants it, Johnson could head the powerful Ways and Means 
Committee, although his plans to run against Ferguson and Allen for the Senate 
seat being vacated by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) might prompt him 
to defer. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest Orange County winner would probably be Pringle, the current 
assistant minority leader. Though he is not beloved among GOP moderates, the 
Orange County conservative is in line to assume the No. 2 spot in the Assembly 
and would be the heir apparent to GOP leader Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Curt Pringle in particular is going to be a real player in the 
process," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's taxpayers would also benefit, Johnson said. For years the 
county has gotten the short end of the stick when funding formulas were 
concocted. For everything from health care to schools, a disproportionate share 
of the funding went to urban areas represented by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been cheated by a Legislature dominated by big city Democratic 
politicians," Johnson said. "There has to be some opportunity for some 
correction in those inequities." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Orange County's delegation would finally be freed to more 
effectively push its conservative economic and social agenda. Bills that once 
were killed or bottled up in Democrat-controlled committees now would have a 
chance to reach the Assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy, for one, is already gearing up to revive the bill he pushed 
unsuccessfully this past year that would allow the paddling of convicted 
juvenile graffiti vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the delegation, meanwhile, talk of pushing for tax cuts and 
bigger incentives to attract business to California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether you're talking about crime, illegal immigration or jobs and the 
economy," Johnson said, "some of the important issues for us are going to rise 
to the top."

RECALL CAMPAIGN TARGETING PROP. 187 FOES; IMMIGRATION: O.C. ORGANIZERS OF 
MEASURE SAY L.A. SCHOOL BOARD PRESIDENT AND A COUNCILWOMAN ARE FIRST OF DOZENS 
OF ELECTED OFFICIALS THEY WILL WORK TO OUST.

<P>
 Gearing up for the "second phase" of their campaign, the Orange County 
organizers of the Proposition 187 movement say they are targeting the first of 
what may be dozens of elected officials across the state for recall. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Los Angeles news conference today, organizers will announce they will 
seek the ouster of Los Angeles Board of Education President Mark Slavkin. And 
if that effort gains momentum, Robert Kiley, who spearheaded the 187 campaign, 
said Los Angeles City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg is next on their hit list. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Los Angeles officials advocate legal action to block Proposition 187, 
which cuts off education, welfare and non-emergency medical services to illegal 
immigrants. Eight lawsuits, including one by the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, have temporarily stalled the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 backers are outraged that public funds are financing lawsuits 
against the measure, which was approved by 59% of the electorate Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't going to stand by and watch this thing die," said Kiley, a Yorba 
Linda political consultant and founding member of the Save Our State committee. 
"We are going to see how this pans out. We've got to start someplace and if we 
spread ourselves too thin we might lose our credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials, who won a temporary injunction 
in federal court last week against the measure being implemented at schools, 
said the district could lose up to $650 million in federal funds if they are 
forced to question students' legal status. Under Proposition 187, schools would 
be required to verify the immigration status of students and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said they believe that any recall efforts will fail, and that 
Proposition 187 will be declared unconstitutional in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, I think that people will find that upholding the Constitution is 
not something for which people should be punished," Slavkin said. "People are 
in an angry mood and are looking for targets to vent their anger." 
</P>
<P>
 To get an election scheduled to oust board members, recall proponents must 
gather the signatures of 15% of the registered voters in the school board 
district. Slavkin's district, which includes part of the west San Fernando 
Valley, has about 350,000 voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Orange County 187 organizers are also planning to hold statewide 
seminars by the end of next week to instruct volunteers how to recall elected 
officials.

THE GIFT OF SHARING; CHIEF TELLS OF LIFE ON RESERVATION -- AND YOUNG AUDIENCE 
PLEDGES ASSISTANCE

 His arms folded majestically and a headdress of white feathers cascading down 
his back, the Special Chief of the Great Sioux Nation stood with kindergartners 
Tuesday watching Sioux dancers perform amid chanting voices and beating drums. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the dances, the kindergartners at Castille Elementary School, who 
will dress up as pilgrims and Native Americans for a Thanksgiving feast next 
week, heard from the chief about real Native American children their age who 
live on reservations under very different conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Phil Stevens told the spellbound audience of about 400 kindergarten 
through third-grade children who live many miles away, with names like Natasha 
Never Miss A Shot and Melanie Old Man. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are just like you in many respects. They love their mothers and fathers 
and dogs," he said. "Many of them don't have any electricity, running water, no 
telephones or refrigerators. They live in little houses with two bedrooms, and 
as many as 23 people in them. It is so cold and people don't have homes of 
their own." 
</P>
<P>
 The presentation launched a countywide "Gift of Thanksgiving" toy drive. 
Stevens asked the children to pick a slip of paper with the name of a child at 
Lone Man School on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and bring a gift 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The toy drive, sponsored by the Red Cloud American Indian Society Inc. in 
Irvine, will also gather gifts from other Orange County schools for children on 
four Sioux reservations in North and South Dakota and Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Betsy Matias' kindergarten and first-grade class watched intently as the 
dancers performed the fancy feather dance and explained the tradition of eagle 
feathers. "When an eagle feather falls on the ground, it's as if a brother has 
passed away," said dance leader Bob Wolf. "It means someone has fallen in war 
or battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Others waved their hands wildly, clamoring to be chosen to participate in the 
friendship dance. They joined hands with the dancers, ages 5, 7, 9 and 14, to 
practice dance steps in a circle onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the Indian dances because they were wearing shirts with feathers. 
They were pretty," said kindergartner Danielle Glidden, 5. "I want to pick two 
names. I want to give earrings to the girls and a truck to the boys like my 
brother has." 
</P>
<P>
 Dustin Barthel, 5, said he learned Native Americans "live in different houses 
than us. The way they live is harder because they don't have (running) water or 
lights." 
</P>
<P>
 After the dances, the class made butter and corn muffins in preparation for a 
feast next week when they will dress up as Native Americans and pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
 First-grader Roya Aminzadeh, 6, knew all about the spirit of Thanksgiving. She 
had already picked out her gift. "I'm giving candy to them," she said. "I've 
got 100 candies and I'm giving them all my candy. I'm going to pick three names 
because I have a lot of candies." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the toy drive's start in 1987, requests for gifts have been steadily 
climbing. Requests this year nearly doubled from last year, jumping from 3,500 
to 7,000. With contributions from corporate sponsors, the society hopes to 
gather about 8,000 gifts this year, Stevens said. The group also wants to 
include toothbrushes and toothpaste with the gifts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't know how isolated they are. There is often nothing in the 
refrigerator on Christmas Eve," Stevens said. "For most of the children, these 
will be the only gifts they receive during the holiday season."

6 FOUND GUILTY IN $10-MILLION BOILER-ROOM SCAM; COURTS: VICTIMS NATIONWIDE WERE 
MISLED INTO THINKING THEY HAD WON EXPENSIVE PRIZES AND WERE TOLD TO SEND MONEY 
FOR THEM. 
</P>

<P>
 A federal jury Tuesday found six Orange County men guilty of defrauding more 
than 1,000 mostly elderly people from across the nation of more than $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was one of the largest prosecutions so far in Operation Disconnect, a 
federal crackdown on boiler rooms that sell bogus investments or goods costing 
far more than their value. The FBI last year made 240 arrests involving 
boiler-room scams in 13 states, including California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased with the verdict," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Bart H. 
Williams. "Orange County is sort of a hotbed for telemarketing fraud. We hope 
this shows the government intends to prosecute even very sophisticated frauds. 
This was very sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
 Convicted were Timothy J. Laros and Paul C. Cooper of Huntington Beach, who 
prosecutors said owned and managed four companies that ran boiler rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The telemarketers either told the victims that they had won expensive prizes 
such as cars as part of promotional campaigns for health and safety products, 
or they exaggerated the chances of winning them, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The salespeople made thousands of calls a day all over the country, 
prosecutors said. Victims were told to send hundreds and sometimes thousands of 
dollars for items worth far less. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight days of deliberations following a 5 1/2-month trial, the jury 
convicted Laros and Cooper of conspiracy, two counts of mail fraud and 15 
counts of wire fraud. The companies' controller, Fred Bakhshekooei of Laguna 
Hills, was convicted of the same counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Three others, general manager Joseph Robles of Orange and salespeople Kam Foo 
and Darrell Vartanian of Huntington Beach, were convicted of two counts of wire 
fraud and one count of mail fraud each. 
</P>
<P>
 Foo and Vartanian were two of the companies' top salesmen, generating between 
$300,000 and $400,000 a year, Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors expect to ask U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler to 
sentence the six men to four to eight years in federal prison when they return 
to court on Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies involved in the scam were United Safety Associates of Huntington 
Beach; Life Pro International of Tustin; American Superior Products of Costa 
Mesa and Fountain Valley, and Midwest Home and Family of Huntington Beach and 
San Antonio, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI fraud investigation that led to the arrests last year was a response 
to mushrooming complaints, FBI officials have said. One estimate shows that 
nine of 10 Americans have received at least one suspicious solicitation from a 
telephone sales outfit.

O.C. STUDENTS OUTPERFORM PEERS, STATE REPORT SAYS; EDUCATION: SCHOOLS WIN HIGH 
MARKS IN SUCH CATEGORIES AS SCORES ON STANDARD TESTS, SENDING GRADUATES TO UC 
OR CAL STATE SYSTEMS, LOW DROPOUT RATES. 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County high school students outperformed their peers across the state, 
according to a new report card from the Department of Education, placing more 
students in the state university systems, scoring better on standardized tests 
and compiling a lower dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Orange County schools fared better than groups of 100 demographically 
similar schools from throughout California, and many ranked in the top 25% of 
schools statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm impressed with the scores," said William Habermehl, Orange County's 
assistant superintendent for instruction. "It's indicative of a lot of hard 
work by students and teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 This week marks the first time the state has published a school-by-school 
report card giving each school an overall grade on a 100-point scale. Though 
much of the data is from previously published reports, the compilation of 
"average performance values" for each school is the closest California has come 
to ranking its schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the Orange County schools receiving an overall score, Sunny Hills High in 
Fullerton ranked No. 1 with 66.3. Statewide, the highest score was over 90 
points, for the highly regarded Gretchen Whitney High, a magnet school in 
Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased," said Kenneth Jones, superintendent of the Fullerton 
Joint Union High School District, which includes Sunny Hills. "They've 
established a very strong academic climate. If you go up to that school, you'll 
see kids studying very hard. I think that's why they do well. And we have a lot 
of great teachers up there too." 
</P>
<P>
 But only 48 of the county's 70 high schools were assigned an overall score 
because many -- including all schools in the Irvine Unified and Anaheim Union 
High School districts -- did not report some of the data used in the 
calculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills also ranked No. 1 in the county on many individual criteria: 
graduates enrolling at University of California or Cal State University 
campuses (39.2%); dropout rate (0%); and students completing courses required 
for admission to the UC system (74.8%). 
</P>
<P>
 But University High in Irvine posted the highest percentage of students 
passing Advanced Placement tests, which earn college credit (80.3%). And Corona 
del Mar High had the most students surpassing national averages on the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test and the American College Test (68.1%). 
</P>
<P>
 Other criteria used to compute the overall scores included California Learning 
Assessment System scores, and the number of students enrolled in geometry and 
other college preparatory classes. Most of the data was from 1992 or 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Waldfogel, acting superintendent of Irvine Unified, said his district has 
never provided the state with data about enrollment in college preparatory 
classes, which made Irvine schools ineligible for the catch-all average grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The averaging is not something that I'm impressed with," Waldfogel said. 
"Anytime you average data like that, I think you've risked creating a very 
false impression." 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide statistics showed student performance improving in all criteria 
except enrollment in UC and Cal State schools, which officials attributed to 
the rising costs at those institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Orange County schools that landed near the top of the local rankings for 
individual criteria include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Villa Park High and Canyon High, both in Orange Unified, which posted high 
numbers of students completing college-preparatory courses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Foothill High in Santa Ana, Kennedy High in La Palma and Cypress High, which 
each had less than 1% of their students drop out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fountain Valley High, Foothill High and Esperanza High in Anaheim, where 
more than 30% of the students passed Advanced Placement tests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Canyon High, El Dorado High in Placentia, Irvine High, Laguna Beach High and 
Esperanza High, all of which sent more than 25% of their graduates to UC or Cal 
State schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar High, Laguna Hills High, Brea-Olinda High, Laguna Beach High 
and Mission Viejo High all had more than 60 points on the overall score. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovering near the bottom of the scale, with less than 40 points, were all four 
Santa Ana high schools; Rancho Alamitos High and Santiago High, both in Garden 
Grove Unified; and Tustin High. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, 39 of the 48 Orange County schools receiving overall scores 
outperformed groups of 100 schools with similar socioeconomic profiles and 
English proficiency levels. And all but seven local schools exceeded the 
state's average overall score. School Report Cards 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Education has for the first time released 
school-by-school performance reports for every public high school. They are 
derived by averaging 10 factors to compute an "average performance value." The 
highest possible score is 100. Here is a list of the performance reports for 
Orange County high schools, and some of the factors included in the 
calculation: 07,32,06,09,08,06,06,09 Drop College UC/CSU SAT/ APV/100

FULLERTON TENTATIVELY OKS REPEAL OF 2% UTILITY TAX; GOVERNMENT: THE CITY WILL 
CONTINUE TO CUT COSTS THROUGH ATTRITION AND REDUCTIONS IN EMPLOYEE BENEFITS IF 
FINAL APPROVAL IS GIVEN NEXT MONTH, OFFICIALS SAY. THE LEVY HAD LED TO RECALL 
OF 3 COUNCIL MEMBERS.

<P>
 The City Council tentatively voted Tuesday to repeal the city's controversial 
2% utility tax, an issue that had triggered the ouster of three council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is expected to pass with final approval at the Dec. 6 City Council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tax never had community support," Councilman Chris Norby said. "I think 
it was pushed through and it's caused a great deal of divisiveness in the 
community. And before we can really move on, we have to put it to bed." 
</P>
<P>
 The vote Tuesday was 4 to 1, with Councilwoman Jan M. Flory dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Flory is expected to vote against the tax again in December along with Don 
Bankhead, one of the recalled council members, who will be sworn back into 
office after having won in last week's election.  
</P>
<P>
 Flory noted Tuesday that none of the candidates endorsed by the Fullerton 
Recalls Committee, which led the recall movement over the tax levy, were 
elected last week. That, she said, signifies that the voters of Fullerton would 
rather pay the utility tax than lose services. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax, if repealed next month, will terminate Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for the loss in revenue, the city will continue to cut costs 
through attrition and reduction of public employees' retirement funds and 
health benefits, Councilman Peter Godfrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can actually do it," he said. "We're going to take the load off the 
taxpayer's back." 
</P>
<P>
 Flory countered: "Haste makes waste. There's a reason for that saying. We're 
being asked to ditch this utility tax without a plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Some cuts may be necessary because it is not certain how the state plans to 
balance its budget, city officials said.

L.A. HIGH SCHOOLS GET MIXED MARKS IN STATEWIDE STUDY; EDUCATION: OF THE 55 
RATED, MORE THAN HALF RANK BEHIND SIMILAR CAMPUSES IN PREPARING STUDENTS FOR 
COLLEGE. BUT MOST MAGNET SCHOOLS OUTSHINE THE COMPETITION. 
</P>

 More than half the high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District are 
doing worse than similar schools across the state at preparing their students 
for college, but others -- including four of the district's six magnet high 
schools -- are performing far above their counterparts in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-five of the district's high schools were included in the state's annual 
measurement of high school achievement, which combines results of several 
standardized tests with such factors as completion records on college 
preparatory courses and graduation and dropout rates. 
</P>
<P>
 This year for the first time, the state publicly released an average score 
that can be used to rank the schools, although state analysts cautioned against 
placing too much value on such ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because a school has a high performance rating doesn't mean it's the 
best school in the state or the district," said Paula Wenzl, an education 
consultant with the state Department of Education. "It just means that it 
scored highest on these tests this particular year." 
</P>
<P>
 The California High School Performance Report scored every school in the state 
based on data from the 1992-93 school year, then compared it to 100 other 
schools with similar student populations.  
</P>
<P>
 By that comparative measure -- which included the percentage of students with 
limited English skills and the percentage whose families receive welfare -- 29 
Los Angeles Unified schools were below average and 20 were above average. Six 
were at or near average. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified administrators said the findings neither surprised nor 
depressed them, but rather bolstered their resolve to continue education 
reforms that include decentralizing the 640,000-student district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It tells me what I kind of knew already: We've got a huge problem going," 
Supt. Sidney A. Thompson said. "I'm the first to say we've got a long way to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson suggested that the weighting for similar student populations may not 
have adequately compensated for challenges faced by urban Los Angeles 
teen-agers, such as the temptations of gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he was pleased by the high ranking of the district's college-bound 
students, who scored above the statewide average in both college preparatory 
class completions and attendance at University of California or California 
State University campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge to this school district is what we're doing with the students 
who are not college bound," Thompson said. "They drop out, they fail in school, 
they're bored in school, they also have to work because the family needs to pay 
the rent. . . . That is the real telling challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the district's top-ranking schools, particularly striking was the four 
magnet high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of those campuses -- the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies and the 
King/Drew Medical Magnet in Watts -- were rated first and second in the 
district and performed well above schools of similar compositions statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two campuses also are by far the smallest high schools in the district, 
with 485 and 248 students, respectively. Most other high schools have at least 
1,000 students and sometimes more than 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other magnet high schools -- Bravo Medical Magnet east of Downtown and the 
Downtown Business Magnet -- both performed better than schools elsewhere with 
similar student bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest-ranked school in the state report also is a magnet school: 
Gretchen Whitney High School in Cerritos, in the neighboring ABC Unified School 
District. But Whitney admits only talented students who score high on a 
standardized test. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators and administrators said that even without such selective entrance 
requirements, Los Angeles Unified's magnet students tend to fare better in 
surveys because their students have chosen the schools. Once admitted, they 
remain motivated by curriculum tailored to their interests and by contact with 
professionals in their fields of study. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they see the career possibilities ahead of them, then high school is not 
just something to be gotten through, it's a step on the way to a career," said 
Richard Battaglia, magnet program coordinator for Los Angeles Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's top-ranked Center for Enriched Studies in the Fairfax district 
is no stranger to academic honors. Last year it became the first secondary 
school in Los Angeles Unified to win the prestigious National Blue Ribbon 
School designation from the U.S. Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Marion B. Collins, who as head counselor helped open the center as 
the district's first specialized or "magnet" school in 1977, on Tuesday cited 
several factors in the school's success. They include the individual attention 
made possible by its small size and its low turnover rates among teachers and 
students, its academic orientation and its dedicated staff and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes real dedication for teachers to work as hard as ours do," Collins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also had high praise for the parents, who send their youngsters from all 
over the sprawling district and who make it clear that school is a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the spectrum, even when the significant obstacles faced by 
their students are considered, a number of Los Angeles schools ranked dismally 
low. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom-ranking high school was Locke in South Los Angeles, built as part 
of the recovery plan after the 1965 Watts riots. Phone calls to Locke's 
principal were not returned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also settling to the bottom were four other high schools located in poorer 
areas of Los Angeles: Jefferson in South-Central, Manual Arts near USC, Jordan 
in Watts and Hollywood High. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Locke, the four have high dropout rates, according to the state report, 
ranging from 52% at Jefferson to more than 73% at Manual Arts. Both Jordan and 
Locke recorded a decline in college preparatory course enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, the picture was far rosier, however, with all indicators up from 
the first ranked study -- which was released only to schools in 1990 -- except 
for declines in enrollment at both University of California and state 
university campuses. State analysts attributed that decline in part to 
increased fees at those institutions.  
</P>
<P>
 The report provided fuel for school-choice advocates, including those who back 
the school voucher concept under which parents would be awarded vouchers that 
could be used at public or private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a voucher initiative was rejected by voters last November, Los 
Angeles Unified began permitting parents to choose any school within the 
district beginning last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Districtwide, the most requested schools were all in the San Fernando Valley: 
Taft High in Woodland Hills, and Nobel Middle School and Castlebay Lane 
Elementary, both in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 But parent choice did not mirror the state performance report findings. Taft, 
for instance, ranked below nearby El Camino Real High in Woodland Hills and 
Birmingham High in Van Nuys.

SIMPSON ATTORNEYS ASK JUDGE TO BAR NEWEST PROSECUTOR; COURTS: DEFENSE TEAM 
CITES CHRISTOPHER DARDEN'S ROLE IN GRAND JURY PROBE OF AL COWLINGS. PROSECUTION 
GETS PERMISSION TO COMPARE DOGS' HAIRS TO THOSE ON GLOVE, CAP.

 Escalating their attack on the prosecution team in the O.J. Simpson murder 
trial, defense attorneys said Tuesday that they have filed a motion asking 
Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito to remove one of the government lawyers from 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion was filed late Monday under seal, but Simpson's attorneys said 
outside court Tuesday that they are seeking the removal of Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Christopher A. Darden, who was added to the Simpson prosecution team last week. 
They have previously voiced their anger about the prosecutor's assignment 
because Darden oversaw the grand jury investigation of Al Cowlings, Simpson's 
close friend who was at the wheel during the infamous low-speed pursuit from 
Orange County to Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Darden, he's a fine lawyer, but he was involved in another investigation 
that was supposed to be separate," said Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of 
Simpson's lead attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they pick jurors and debate a host of remaining legal issues, lawyers 
for both sides continue to build their cases and collect evidence. Tuesday, 
prosecutors received permission to clip hairs from two dogs -- one owned by 
Simpson and another belonging to his son but kept by his ex-wife, Nicole Brown 
Simpson, who was killed along with Ronald Lyle Goldman on June 12. Simpson has 
pleaded not guilty to the double murder. 
</P>
<P>
 In a declaration filed with the court, Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark said 
"white to tan animal hairs characteristic of dog hairs" were found on a bloody 
glove discovered outside Simpson's Brentwood mansion. Prosecutors want to have 
the FBI laboratory examine those hairs to determine whether they match those of 
the dog found wandering outside Nicole Simpson's home after the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 They also want to compare hairs from a knit cap found at the crime scene to 
samples taken from Simpson's dog. If the hairs match the respective dogs, it 
would put hair from Simpson's pet at the crime scene and from Nicole Simpson's 
animal at her ex-husband's home -- bolstering the prosecution charge that the 
ex-football star committed the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The request for hairs is just the latest in the continuing attempts to figure 
out whose hair and blood is at the crime scene. DNA tests have shown that blood 
drops at the scene match Simpson's genetic makeup, but defense attorneys have 
raised questions about some hairs located on and around the two bodies and have 
secured hair samples from the police detectives to see if any of them match. 
Simpson's lawyers are hoping to show that detectives used sloppy techniques in 
collecting samples. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted the hair of the cops," Cochran joked Tuesday. "They want the hair 
of the dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 The attempt by Simpson's attorneys to disqualify Darden, meanwhile, was the 
latest flare-up in the defense's continuing protest that the grand jury 
investigation of Cowlings was merely a ruse to develop more information against 
Simpson. Prosecutors deny the defense allegations, and have said that they 
painstakingly kept the two cases from overlapping. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran has also suggested that Darden was added to the government team 
because he is black and a predominantly black jury has been selected to hear 
the case. But Cochran said Tuesday that was not a focus of the defense motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending the assignment of Darden to the prosecution team, Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti said last week that the move had long been contemplated because of 
Darden's highly regarded legal skills and had not been thought up after the 
jury was sworn in. But Simpson's attorneys latched onto that statement to 
suggest that prosecutors had failed to keep the Cowlings and Simpson cases 
separate, as they claimed, but rather had always planned on using information 
gathered in the Cowlings case against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have Mr. Garcetti saying he planned to put (Darden on the Simpson 
case) all along," Cochran said. "We're a little concerned about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district attorney's office has not formally responded to the 
latest defense motion, prosecutors say there is no conflict created by Darden's 
oversight of the Cowlings case. As long as the "dominant purpose" of that grand 
jury investigation was to seek evidence against Cowlings, not to 
surreptitiously gather information about Simpson, there is no problem with 
prosecutors later deciding to use evidence from the Cowlings investigation in 
the Simpson case, prosecutors have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, they have added, there is no conflict with Darden joining the 
Simpson prosecution because all the information from the Cowlings case can 
legally be shared with the Simpson prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence collected by the grand jury would probably be of interest to both 
sides in the Simpson case because authorities in the Cowlings investigation 
were attempting to determine whether Cowlings helped his lifelong friend flee 
from police June 17. Evidence of flight to avoid prosecution can be introduced 
to suggest a defendant's consciousness of guilt, but Simpson's attorneys have 
said that he was distraught and contemplating suicide when he and Cowlings were 
seen on the freeway that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts described the defense's call for Darden's removal as unusual, 
and some suggested another possible motive. "I think the real issue is that 
Chris Darden is a very good lawyer," said Gerald Chaleff, a prominent Los 
Angeles defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two sides wrangled over dog hairs and Darden's place on the 
prosecution team, they returned to court Tuesday to continue picking alternate 
jurors for the trial.  
</P>
<P>
 Of six prospective alternates interviewed, three were allowed to remain on the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 One is a 33-year-old woman who works for a moving company in Altadena. She 
said she was not surprised when she heard that Simpson had been arrested in the 
murders of his ex-wife and Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black men get picked on quite a bit," that woman said in response to a 
question from Shawn Chapman, a member of Simpson's legal team. "I felt the 
finger would be pointed there." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark questioned the woman at length, but the 
prospective juror insisted that she could be fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Another prospective juror retained on the panel said he had served on a 
previous case that Clark prosecuted. That five-month trial ended in guilty 
verdicts and the prospective juror, a 39-year-old postal worker from Gardena, 
called the prosecutor "very sharp." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro questioned the man extensively 
about his feelings toward Clark, the postal worker said he could set his 
positive impressions aside. 
</P>
<P>
 The last prospective juror retained Tuesday described a long history of 
contacts with police. Most of those, he said, were unfair. He asked, however, 
to speak privately to the judge and the lawyers about the specifics. That man, 
31 and unemployed, insisted he could be fair to police witnesses despite his 
past experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 All three were asked to return Dec. 5., when the attorneys for the two sides 
will exercise peremptory challenges to remove panelists.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, the first three prospects interviewed were all dismissed 
for expressing views that might favor one side or the other. Although their 
views of the evidence differed, all three also expressed reservations about 
serving on a trial that could last six months and that could force them to cut 
off ties with friends and family during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 One jury prospect, a 54-year-old man from Eagle Rock, was dismissed after 
saying he considered DNA tests highly reliable and felt that Simpson is 
probably guilty. Ito excused the man, who said as he left that his feelings 
were hurt at not being kept when he pledged to be impartial. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't believe me," he said to reporters. "They didn't believe I'd be 
fair." 
</P>
<P>
 He was followed by a man whose views seemed likely to favor Simpson. Among 
other things, that panelist said he had heard questions raised about the 
validity of police and prosecution testing of DNA samples collected in the 
Simpson case. That man, a 59-year-old meat cutter from Carson, was challenged 
by prosecutors and excused. 
</P>
<P>
 Another candidate for one of the 15 alternate slots said she too was inclined 
to believe that Simpson was guilty. In fact, when Cochran reminded her that 
Simpson was "cloaked in the presumption of innocence," she laughed out loud. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "As it stands right now, he seems to be a guilty man," said that woman, a 
72-year-old retiree from the San Fernando Valley. "But the defense has not put 
on its case." 
</P>
<P>
 The same woman said she had a number of police officers and FBI agents as 
friends, and she expressed misgivings about interracial marriage "because it's 
not fair to the children." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other panelists interviewed Tuesday, the woman said she would have 
difficulty serving on a long trial, and Ito eventually cut off the questioning 
of her, saying: "I'm going to grant you your wish. You're excused in this 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Selecting alternates for the Simpson case has proved even more difficult than 
finding a panel of 12 jurors. So far, more than half of the prospective 
alternates who have been questioned have been excused; only 11 out of 29 have 
been asked to return Dec. 5. Six of the prospective alternates have failed to 
show up for questioning, one of several signs that the panelists may be 
unenthusiastic about serving as alternates. 
</P>
<P>
 If fewer than 15 alternates remain after peremptory challenges are exercised 
in December, another group of potential jurors waits in the wings, but calling 
that group in would further delay the oft-postponed proceedings.

BULLET ENDS FOOTBALL STAR'S JOURNEY TO A BETTER LIFE; VIOLENCE: FAMILY AND 
TEAMMATES MOURN LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE LINEBACKER KASUN CHARLES. HE HAD HOPED 
ATHLETICS WOULD BE A TICKET OUT OF HIS GANG-PLAGUED NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By all accounts, 21-year-old Kasun Charles had a life full of choices. A star 
linebacker for Long Beach City College, he was being heavily recruited by 
football powerhouses across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Football, Charles figured, was a means to a good education and a ticket out of 
the tough, gang-plagued Wilmington neighborhood where he lived with his 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2, 230-pounder with a 3.0 grade-point average kept his distance 
from those who lived by the gun, pausing only long enough to give them his 
respect. But sometimes, when you're cheek-by-jowl with trouble, that's all it 
takes to become a victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The option Charles had sought so hard to create for himself vanished when he 
was shot and killed one night last week in a shooting that police said stemmed 
from ongoing tension between Wilmington's black and Latino gangs.  
</P>
<P>
 He had lived with a tension that surrounds countless young adults struggling 
to find a higher path in neighborhoods where gang violence is common. Their 
lives inevitably crisscross with those they grew up with as children, people 
whose lives are steeped in warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles' funeral Tuesday in San Pedro drew about 600 mourners -- a multiethnic 
collection of neighbors, teammates and others, packed in a small chapel at 
Green Hills Mortuary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always told him that he could do anything he wanted to do with himself," 
said his mother, Irma Irving, who lives in a nearby section of Los Angeles. "It 
was up to him. He had the choice. He wanted to make something out of himself. 
Football was only a means to an end. He wanted to be a lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear how Charles died. Police said he and a friend were driving 
home from the funeral of a slain friend on Nov. 7 when they were confronted by 
a group of Latino men on Blinn Avenue. An argument escalated into a fight. Then 
someone pulled a gun and shot Charles, who was black, several times. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles and his friend "were driving in a car and stopped and approached these 
. . . guys and a fight was on," said Los Angeles Police Detective Roosevelt 
Joseph. "Why they stopped? We don't know. The only person who can give us the 
whole story was the guy (who) was with Charles. He is stating that he doesn't 
know why they stopped," Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles was gunned down less than four blocks from his home. Not long after 
the shooting, his mother said, she rushed to the scene and found her son lying 
in a pool of blood. The police had taped off the area and refused to let her 
through, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to get to my boy and the policeman said, 'It's just another gang 
shooting,' " Irving said. "I said, 'That's not just another shooting. He's my 
son.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide detectives said Charles was not considered a gang member, but his 
friend has a record of gang involvement. Police have arrested two suspects, but 
neither is believed to be the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting sent shock waves through the Long Beach City College campus, 
where the football team has a 9-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "The news devastated our team," said Don Kloppendurg, a defensive coach on the 
team who recruited Charles to play at the two-year college. "He was a natural 
leader, one of the most heavily recruited linebackers in the state."  
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, the team released some of its emotions in a victory over Mt. 
San Antonio College with a 38-35 victory. With the players wearing Charles' 
number 9 on their helmets, the team increased the possibility of a postseason 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They spoke with their play," said Offensive Line Coach Mike Reisbig.  
</P>
<P>
 Weighing 180 pounds when he joined the team, Charles put on about 50 pounds 
through sheer determination and hard work, his coaches said. He became the best 
player on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the spirit of the team; he knew how to hype everyone up," said Adrian 
Sykes, a 21-year-old defensive back. "It's hard to believe that we're not going 
to see him again." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials announced that the Long Beach City College Foundation office 
was collecting donations for the Kasun Charles Funeral Fund.  
</P>
<P>
 Charles' mother said her son had remained friends with the young men in the 
run-down neighborhood but had a different style.  
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to make something of himself," she said. "He wanted a better life 
for himself." 
</P>
<P>
 At the funeral, one of those young men, Duke Maldonado, 22, remembered Charles 
as the one on the block who encouraged everyone to go back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a good person," he said. "He used to clown a lot, but he was always 
positive." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother remembered that her son loved fishing and snorkeling and enjoyed 
mountain walks. Most people, she said, remembered his winning smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his death, she said, he was leaning toward going to USC to finish 
college. He had received several plane tickets for trips to out-of-state 
colleges that were recruiting him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were celebrating," she said. "Everything (was) going just like he wanted 
it."

JERRY RUBIN OF 'CHICAGO 7' HIT BY A CAR; ACTIVISM: THE VIETNAM WAR PROTESTER 
TURNED BUSINESSMAN IS REPORTED IN CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER BEING STRUCK WHILE 
JAYWALKING IN WESTWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Former Chicago Seven anti-war activist Jerry Rubin was reported in critical 
condition Tuesday at UCLA Medical Center after he was hit by a car while 
jaywalking in Westwood, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers said the Yippie turned businessman was crossing Wilshire Boulevard at 
mid-block between Selby and Manning avenues about 8:30 p.m. Monday when he was 
struck by a car heading west on Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin, 56, who lives in a high-rise Brentwood apartment, was taken by 
ambulance to the medical center, where he underwent several hours of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car -- a 1991 Volkswagen GTI -- was not held or cited, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin -- along with the late Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner -- founded the 
Youth International Party, or Yippies, during the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's members were major players during anti-Vietnam War demonstrations 
outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, 1968. Black 
Panther leader Bobby Seale and seven others -- among them Rubin and Hoffman -- 
were charged with conspiracy to incite violence and crossing state lines with 
the intent to riot. 
</P>
<P>
 The court proceedings began in September, 1969, becoming known as the Chicago 
Seven trial after federal Judge Julius Hoffman severed Seale's case from the 
others and ordered him bound and gagged when he protested the crusty jurist's 
rulings. Seale eventually was convicted of contempt of court and sentenced to 
four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial of the seven other defendants -- Rubin, Hoffman, Rennie Davis, David 
Dellinger, John Froines, Tom Hayden and Lee Weiner -- became a dramatic 
spectacle during which the wild-haired defendants stomped on the judicial robes 
they elected to wear in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it certainly was a microcosm of the times, but it also was theater, 
so it was an exaggerated statement of the times," Froines said later. 
</P>
<P>
 After 4 1/2 months of testimony, all but Froines and Weiner were found guilty 
of the intent-to-riot charges. All were acquitted of the conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rubin, Hoffman, Davis, Dellinger and Hayden were sentenced to prison, 
their convictions -- along with Seale's -- were overturned by the U.S. 7th 
Circuit Court of Appeals, which cited errors by Judge Hoffman and criticized 
his courtroom demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the Chicago Seven remained true to their Yippie roots, Rubin 
evolved, discovering est, yoga, bioenergetics and a smorgasbord of 
self-awareness programs that eventually led him to venture banking on Wall 
Street and the creation of a "networking party" for Yuppies. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin's evolution did not sit well with Hoffman, who squared off with him in a 
series of "Yippie-versus-Yuppie" debates in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman was found dead in 1989, apparently a suicide. Rubin was the only 
member of the Chicago Seven to attend the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin -- who has the same name as a Venice activist -- continued to prosper, 
becoming an independent marketer for a Dallas-based firm that sells a 
nutritional drink called Wow that contains kelp, ginseng and bee pollen. Bobby 
Seale became one of his salesmen. In an earlier interview, Rubin estimated that 
he made $600,000 in 1992.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 4 DOCTORS 
CHARGED WITH PAYING REFERRAL KICKBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four physicians have been charged with paying illegal kickbacks to a medical 
referral firm under investigation for workers' compensation fraud.  
</P>
<P>
 The physicians allegedly paid for patient referrals from L.A. Management, a 
former Sherman Oaks firm under investigation for possibly paying kickbacks to 
get patients from companies that process workers' compensation claims for some 
employers and insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of L.A. Management is unusual because most probes of 
workers' compensation fraud target large medical chains that treat employees 
who have applied for benefits from employers and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn said the four doctors paid up to $250 for 
each patient seeking a medical examination. The physicians were charged Monday 
in Los Angeles Municipal Court with from one to six misdemeanor counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged were Gerald Paul, an orthopedist on the staff of Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center; Harvey Alpern, a Century City cardiologist; Ivor Harewood, a 
Los Angeles surgeon, and Dr. Emil Soorani, a Santa Monica psychiatrist.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CORONER 
REPORTS ON DEATH OF TITO JACKSON'S EX-WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An autopsy on the body of Michael Jackson's former sister-in-law found 
patterns of injuries to "support a hypothesis of assisted drowning," the 
coroner's office reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Delores Jackson, 39, died Aug. 27 after she was pulled from a swimming pool 
about 4 a.m. by her boyfriend, Donald Bohana, at his home in Ladera Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 She was married to Tito Jackson for 16 years until their divorce in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier said the cause of death was listed as 
"asphyxia, due to or as a consequence of drowning, alcohol intake and blunt 
force traumatic injuries." Her blood-alcohol level was 0.22%, Carrier said.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Medical Examiner David Posey's autopsy report, which he signed Nov. 7, 
indicated the "blunt force traumatic injuries" he found included cuts on her 
lip, tongue and ears, a bruise on her head and muscle hemorrhage in her neck 
that "appears fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 The report was turned over to the Sheriff's Department and the district 
attorney's office, Carrier said.

VENDOR SLAIN, WIFE SHOT IN ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An ice cream vendor was fatally shot Tuesday and his wife abducted and wounded 
during a robbery in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman killed the man in the 3400 block of West Lawrence Street, then 
jumped into his ice cream truck and drove away as the dying man's wife screamed 
for help, said Inglewood Police Sgt. James TenBrook. Less than a mile away, the 
robber stopped the truck, shot the woman, took her purse and ran, he said. The 
woman "miraculously received only a graze wound" to the head, TenBrook said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; HOMEOWNER COMPACTING SOIL IS SERIOUSLY 
INJURED IN HILLSIDE FALL

<P>
 A homeowner doing repair work Tuesday on a steep hillside was found 
unconscious after falling 100 feet to Coast Highway below. Robert Boyer, 52, 
was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo with 
shoulder, arm and back injuries, said Sheriff's Lt. Tom Davis.His condition was 
not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said Boyer, who lives in the 2900 block of La Ventana, where a 
landslide occurred in 1983, had hired several laborers to help him with a 
mechanical compactor, a heavy piece of machinery that tamps dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer told neighbors that he had left a garden hose on some years ago and the 
water had eroded a rear portion of his back yard, which he was repairing, said 
Emory Farr, 62, Boyer's next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer was working about 1:30 p.m. when he fell, Farr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was patting the dirt down with a compactor," said Farr. "And the next 
thing I know, there's a guy who came running up to our house and said he fell." 
</P>
<P>
 Farr said he immediately dialed 911 and went to see if he could help, but by 
that time, Boyer had tumbled to the bottom of the hillside.DAVID REYES

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; RECALLING THE POINT OF HOLIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cities, agencies and organizations throughout the county are approving 
proclamations and making promises to remember the original Thanksgiving Day at 
the request of Los Amigos of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The community activist group passed out more than 100 pledge sheets urging 
organizations to remember the holiday so people will realize that everyone in 
the United States, with the exception of Native Americans, comes from immigrant 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real spirit of Thanksgiving is that it's a celebration of family and 
friends," said Galal Kernahan, a Los Amigos spokesman. "Family are our own kind 
and friends are of every kind, and that's the point we're trying to make." 
</P>
<P>
 He said many people forget the story of Thanksgiving and celebrate the day by 
watching football games instead of giving thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1620, refugees arrived in the United States by ship and suffered through a 
miserable winter but survived with the help of Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 By the next fall, "the newcomers got together with the Americans to celebrate 
life and friendship," Kernahan added. "In a letter dated Dec. 11, 1621, an 
immigrant named Edward Winslow explained how the first Thanksgiving was 
organized 'so that we might . . . rejoice together.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kernahan said that 100 Black Men of Orange County, the city of Lake Forest, 
the Green Ribbon Campaign, Alto Care Medical Group, Alliance Working for Asian 
Rights and Empowerment and Victory Outreach Church have already made the 
"Remembrance Thanksgiving" pledge. The second annual informal campaign is 
endorsed this year by the Orange County Human Relations Commission. MIMI KO

<P>
 When 12-year-old Staci Eisman's older brother was hospitalized last summer for 
15 days, the only thing that relieved his boredom was her constant supply of 
videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Staci wants to help ease the stress of hospitalization for young people 
throughout Orange County with videotapes donated for pediatric wards. 
</P>
<P>
 When her brother Todd, 15, was in the intensive-care unit at Fountain Valley 
Regional Hospital and Medical Center, suffering painful complications from 
surgery, a hospital videocassette player and his sister's tapes helped keep his 
morale up, said Staci's mother, Jan Eisman, an Irvine business consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 In the pediatric ward, the hospital provided a portable videocassette player 
to be shared among the young patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would just kind of freshen up their supply," Eisman said of the family's 
videotape donations, "so other kids could also enjoy them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a number of county hospitals make video equipment available, 
longer-term patients quickly discover the supply of videotapes for children is 
limited, Eisman said. 
</P>
<P>
 This prompted Staci to make an appeal to the congregation of University 
Synagogue in Irvine for videotape donations. Since setting up a collection box 
at the synagogue last month, Staci has received 89 videotapes. Her goal is to 
receive 150 tapes by the end of November, when she plans to distribute them 
among county hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way, kids can take their minds off their surgery or whatever's happening 
to them," Staci said. "It's just something to help keep them busy." 
</P>
<P>
 Donations may be made at University Synagogue, 2955 Main St., Suite No. 320, 
Irvine. RUSS LOAR

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE; BLAST AT 
MOBIL REFINERY BLAMED ON GAP IN PIPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fiery explosion at a Torrance refinery last month apparently occurred when a 
gap in a pipe allowed flammable gases to escape into the air, Torrance fire 
investigators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The gases were ignited, probably by a nearby heating unit, leading to the Oct. 
19 explosion at the Mobil Oil Corp. refinery that injured 28 workers, according 
to the report from the Torrance Fire Department.Investigators did not blame any 
individual or procedure for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 They focused on a 6-inch pipe running about 25 feet above the ground in a pipe 
rack near the refinery's alkylation unit. That pipe had been disassembled at a 
flange fitting, with one open end sealed and one left unsealed, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of the fire, a Mobil worker who apparently thought the pipe was 
intact began opening a valve in the pipe, the report said. When he saw a white 
vapor cloud forming below him, he started to close the valve but the explosion 
occurred. Gases in the pipe consisted of propane, butylene and butane, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement Tuesday, Mobil said it would use the report in its own 
investigation, which it said would be finished soon. The accident also is being 
probed by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District and by an independent consulting 
firm.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
TEACHER, 6 OTHERS PLEAD NOT GUILTY IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood middle school teacher and six other men pleaded not guilty 
Tuesday in Van Nuys Municipal Court to charges that they killed a Reseda man 
who accidentally drove into a parked pickup truck owned by a guest attending a 
party in the teacher's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the guests were gang members and teen-agers who were drinking alcohol 
and smoking marijuana, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Denneth Thaddeus Jackson and the others were charged with using pool cues and 
chunks of wood, as well as their fists and feet, to beat to death Julio 
Aguilar, 23. The dead man's brother, Jose Aguilar, 21, who was also beaten, 
remained in serious condition Tuesday at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Madison Middle School in North Hollywood, where Jackson was popular with 
students as a history teacher in the seventh and ninth grades, counselor 
Stephanie Palmer said, "The students are distressed. . . . They can't reconcile 
the image of Mr. Jackson the teacher with the Mr. Jackson that could have done 
this."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; NOISE ORDINANCE MUST GET NEW COUNCIL'S OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's first noise ordinance was approved by the City Council on Monday 
night but to become law still must win passage from the newly elected council 
that takes office next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Term limits forced Mayor Clarence J. Turner, Councilwoman Evelyn R. Hart and 
Councilman Phil Sansone out of office. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected to replace Hart and Sansone, respectively, were Planning Commission 
Chairwoman Norma Glover and former Newport Beach City Atty. Dennis O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's replacement remains uncertain because mayoral candidates Ron Winship 
and Thomas Edwards finished just 26 votes apart, with some absentee votes still 
being counted. 
</P>
<P>
 The noise law, scheduled to come before the new council Nov. 28, classifies 
all city properties as residential, commercial or industrial and assigns 
acceptable noise limits for each. 
</P>
<P>
 It would bring together noise regulations that have been scattered throughout 
ordinances governing other matters, such as public nuisances and construction 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
 As the ordinance has evolved over the past three months, the two primary 
sticking points have been air conditioners and gas-powered leaf blowers. 
</P>
<P>
 The council outlawed the leaf blowers within 200 feet of residential areas on 
a 5-1 vote Monday, with Turner opposed. The provision would allow gas blowers 
in commercial and industrial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Air conditioners legally installed before April 22, 1981 -- when the city 
first started to impose noise controls -- would be required to operate below 65 
decibels in residential areas through the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 New units would be required to operate at 55 decibels or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulating air conditioners has proved problematic because many areas of the 
city have closely quartered homes with minimal side yards, where most air

<P>
 Directors of the San Clemente Historical Society, calling a controversial 
130-room resort hotel proposed for a hillside area south of the city pier 
"massive," have recommended that the City Council not approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the city Planning Department, society President Dorothy Fuller 
said the proposed Beachcomber Resort Hotel in San Clemente's Pier Bowl area 
would be "a tragic mistake" for the city.The hotel would be built above the 
beach where the 11-unit Beachcomber Apartments Motel and the historic Robison 
home are located. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Jordan, the hotel's architect, said the project strictly adheres to the 
requirements outlined in a preliminary plan approved by the City Council in 
October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The society's letter was written as a response to a preliminary report on the 
environmental impacts of the project. A consultant is now preparing the final 
environmental report, and public hearings for final action on the hotel could 
start by January, said Jim Pechous, an associate planner for the city.LEN HALL

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; REVAMPED SHOPPING CENTER TO DEBUT FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anaheim Plaza, reincarnated as a $30-million, open-air discount shopping 
center, will have its grand opening on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real success story," Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said Tuesday. "The 
rebuilding turned out to be a fine project and will be a great convenience to 
residents." 
</P>
<P>
 The formerly enclosed mall has been transformed into a 50-acre outdoor center 
with stores linked by covered arbors and walkways. The new commercial center 
will be anchored by a Wal-Mart store, which is scheduled to open in January. 
Several other stores quietly opened earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a different property now," said Jan Wohlwend, general manager. 
"It's spectacular. It's very exciting to see plans that you have been working 
so hard on finally come to fruition." 
</P>
<P>
 The new center has 400,000 square feet of retail space and, rather than 
competing with other area malls, it has been positioned as a "value-oriented" 
plaza targeting bargain hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anaheim Plaza now has its own niche as a popular-priced shopping center 
giving the choice of strong national retailers," Wohlwend said. "It also gives 
the convenience of parking and access to stores." 
</P>
<P>
 The old mall was built in 1955 and was a tremendous success during the 1960s. 
It was renovated in the early 1970s and continued to draw crowds, but then age 
and development of more modern malls in surrounding cities caused its 
popularity to decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The closing of a Robinson's department store in 1987 started a series of 
defections from the mall and, in the end, there were only a handful of shops 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the city approved a redevelopment project by the mall's owners, the 
State Teachers Retirement System, which called for the mall's conversion to a 
discount center. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said the revitalization of the center "will lead to other successes in 
the future because it will help to revive the commercial properties near it." 
</P>
<P>
 It is estimated that the rejuvenated Anaheim Plaza will bring about $800,000 
each year to city coffers, roughly twice the amount the plaza contributed 
before the Broadway department store departed in 1992, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big, big plus for Anaheim," Councilman Irv Pickler said. "I think the 
plaza will do very, very well and that people are looking forward to it 
opening. It is something that is needed." Plaza Redux After a year of 
reconstruction, Anaheim Plaza, one of Orange County's oldest indoor malls, 
reopens Friday as an open-air discount shopping center. Some background on the 
new shopping center: Cost: $30 million Acres: 50 Anchor store: 
146,000-square-foot Wal-Mart, which opens in January. Retailers: Mervyn's, Ross 
Dress For Less, Pay Less ShoeSource, Old Navy Clothing Company, among others. 
Jobs: 1,000 full- or part-time.GREG HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; SHELTER OPENS ITS DOORS TO MENTALLY ILL HOMELESS 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County officials christened the first homeless shelter for the mentally 
disabled Tuesday, 2 1/2 years after the county Board of Supervisors overcame 
neighborhood opposition and approved the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Beacon House, which is run by ESA Inc., should be welcoming its first 12 
residents within the week, said the nonprofit group's executive director, 
Dennis White.The six-bedroom home is the first to offer comprehensive care to 
homeless people who have been certified as being mentally disabled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 White acknowledged that the six months of aid and shelter offered by Beacon 
House will not help a significant number of Orange County's homeless. An 
estimated 12,000 people are without shelter, and 33% of them are mentally ill, 
according to the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dent, but it's a beginning," White said. "Most of (the residents) have 
been sleeping in doorways and under bridges." 
</P>
<P>
 Mentally ill homeless residents already attend day programs run by the 
county's mental health services, but they are on their own at night, White 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beacon House will provide counseling and try to help able residents find jobs. 
Others will be placed in halfway houses or other facilities at the end of their 
stay, White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's opening was a relief to directors of ESA, HomeAid, FHP Inc. and 
other groups that contributed to the home. The project's first grant came from 
the California Department of Housing & Community Development in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 ESA had to appeal to the Board of Supervisors in 1992 after being denied a 
permit by the county Planning Commission. Additional grants gave ESA $356,000 
to purchase and renovate the home on Drew Way. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors gave their approval, but ESA had to agree to a long list of 
conditions that will guarantee neighbors' safety. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CYPRESS; NEW VENUE FOR BINGO WILL ALLOW SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Band and athletic team boosters for Cypress High School have found a new home 
for their fund-raising bingo games where bingo and smoking will be allowed to 
coexist. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday night approved a conditional-use permit that will 
allow bingo games -- formerly held at a local school -- to be played in a 
now-vacant store in the Cinnamon Square Shopping Center, in the 61000 block of 
Ball Road. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 parents and teachers who attended the council meeting broke into 
applause as the council unanimously approved the new bingo venue. School 
officials said Cypress High would have lost thousands of dollars in booster 
funds had a new bingo hall not been found. 
</P>
<P>
 That is because a federal law, which will take effect Dec. 26, forbids smoking 
in any school building, at any time, if the school receives federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The public school system in Cypress, like virtually all public schools in the 
nation, gets some federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the boosters hold their fund-raising bingo games at Lexington 
Junior High School. Spokesmen for the boosters said that many, if not most, 
bingo players are cigarette smokers and that the games would fail to draw 
participants if smokers were barred. The boosters thus appealed to the council 
to allow bingo games in a commercial building.BILL BILLITER

WHITEWATER FIGURE'S EX-WIFE TO BE TRIED IN EMBEZZLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susan McDougal, whose ex-husband put together the failed Whitewater investment 
deal that has dogged President Clinton, was ordered Monday to stand trial in 
Santa Monica on charges of embezzling more than $150,000 from conductor Zubin 
Mehta and his wife, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeffrey Semow said the seven felony counts stem from forged 
checks and unauthorized credit card purchases made during three years when 
McDougal was Nancy Mehta's personal assistant and bookkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The irregularities came to light in 1992 when a bank called Mehta for 
permission to exceed a credit card's $10,000 limit -- a card Mehta said she 
never knew existed, Semow said.  
</P>
<P>
 McDougal and her husband at the time, James McDougal, a failed Arkansas 
savings and loan owner, were partners of President Clinton and his wife, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, in the Whitewater real estate investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater continues to be investigated for alleged improprieties, amid 
denials that it was anything another more than a money-losing investment for 
both couples. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal's attorney in the local embezzlement case said his client is innocent 
because she had full authority from Nancy Mehta for the disputed expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 "All expenses were for the Mehtas' benefit and are with their approval," 
attorney Leonard Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine said financial records will show that Mehta on occasion used the credit 
card she says she knew nothing about. He chalks up the charges to a falling-out 
between the two women after McDougal resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Semow agrees that there was a falling-out, but said it stemmed from Mehta's 
discovery of the alleged deception by McDougal, whom she had thought of as a 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Mehtas traveled extensively, McDougal ran their household and paid 
the bills, Semow said. The Mehtas deny granting permission for McDougal to use 
their credit card for personal expenses, including trips to Arkansas and Texas, 
and clothing purchases at Saks Fifth Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 On one trip to Dallas, the prosecutor said, McDougal spent $9,000. "She went 
on one heck of a shopping spree," Semow said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal contends that these expenditures were agreed-upon overtime payments 
for added responsibilities that she took on when she replaced the couple's 
bookkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal is free on $20,000 bail.

JURORS VIEW KEY TAPE AT FLEISS TRIAL; COURT: VIDEO DEPICTS ACTIVITIES THAT LED 
TO ARREST OF THE ALLEGED 'MADAM TO THE STARS.' DEFENSE CONTENDS SHE WAS ENTICED 
INTO BREAKING THE LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Jurors sat transfixed Tuesday as they watched a videotape of undercover police 
officers and four alleged prostitutes socializing in a Beverly Hills hotel 
suite -- scenes from the now-infamous evening that led to the arrest and trial 
of accused Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss on charges of pandering and possession 
of cocaine for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills undercover Detective Sammy Lee took the stand in Los Angeles 
Superior Court and explained the contents of taped phone calls between him and 
Fleiss, and a videotape of four women and four men at a hotel suite that had 
been bugged by police. The tape was played and halted at various moments during 
his morning testimony.  
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, the daughter of a prominent pediatrician, has pleaded not guilty to 
the charges. Her arrest last year sent shock waves through Hollywood as rumors 
began circulating about her alleged clientele, said to include entertainment 
stars and industry executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight, the 28-year-old high school dropout became a media sensation. But 
her trial, which began this week, will focus on the evening in June, 1993, that 
was captured on tape. Jurors must decide whether Fleiss broke the law, as 
prosecutors maintain, or was pushed by bullying, deceptive police into 
committing a crime, as her attorneys claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, posing as a wealthy Hawaiian businessman of Japanese descent, arranged 
with Fleiss for four "girls" to entertain his three colleagues at a luxurious 
Beverly Hills hotel suite, according to tapes and his testimony.  
</P>
<P>
 The night before the planned party, one woman arrived at Lee's suite, as he 
had arranged with Fleiss, the tapes indicated. After about 15 minutes of 
conversation, Lee said he and the woman moved into the suite bedroom, where 
they discussed having sex and he paid her $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 When the woman was partially disrobed, Lee's telephone and beeper rang -- a 
precaution that police had arranged so Lee would not have to compromise the 
investigation, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I explained to her that I had to leave," said Lee, who acknowledged that the 
woman gave him a hug while she was partially dressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you ask for the hug?" asked Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9:35 a.m. the next day, the day of the planned party, Lee said he called 
Fleiss to thank her for the woman who had come to his hotel room and to make 
sure arrangements were set for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks for last night. Everything was just as you said it would be," Lee 
said, according to a tape of the telephone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 In this conversation, Lee told Fleiss that he wanted to buy cocaine and have 
one of the women bring the drug to the hotel suite -- a request that Fleiss 
agreed to, according to the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss' lawyer, Anthony Brooklier, sharply questioned Lee, pounding home his 
theme that Fleiss had been induced to commit a crime. On the stand, Lee said 
that he had gotten into a popular Westside club and asked a friend of Fleiss to 
introduce him to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heidi Fleiss didn't ask to be introduced to you, correct? It was your idea," 
Brooklier said. "You asked for her telephone number? She didn't offer it, 
correct? . . . If you don't contact her, she probably never calls you. But you 
do call, correct?" 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Fleiss' troubles have piled up. In federal court, she and 
her father were charged in August with money laundering and tax evasion; they 
both pleaded not guilty. One month later, she was arrested after drug tests -- 
which she had been ordered to take as a term of her probation -- indicated she 
had used stimulants and depressants.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Fleiss, dressed in an elegant black suit with cuffs of velvet, 
appeared composed during the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 More on Heidi Fleiss: * Articles from The Times' archives bring it all back: 
the media hoopla, the rumors in Tinseltown and the life and fast times of the 
alleged "madam to the stars."

MAN AGAIN FOUND GUILTY OF MURDER; COURT: JURY DISREGARDS WITNESS-STAND 
CONFESSION BY SHELDON SANDERS' BROTHER THAT HE FIRED THE FATAL SHOT. IT WAS THE 
THIRD TRIAL IN THE KILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a witness-stand confession by his brother that he had fired the rifle 
shot that apparently killed an 18-year-old Compton high school senior in 1985, 
Sheldon Sanders on Tuesday was found guilty of second-degree murder by a jury 
in Compton Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, which heard testimony from five witnesses placing Sheldon Sanders, 
29, at the scene of the crime with a carbine in his hands, deliberated a day 
and a half before reaching a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Sanders' third trial in the case. The first trial resulted in a hung 
jury, the second in a conviction. Sanders had served eight years of a sentence 
of 17 years to life before he was released in April by a federal appellate 
court, which reversed the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tuesday's verdict, Superior Court Judge Gary Hahn immediately remanded 
Sanders to jail. At a sentencing hearing scheduled for Dec. 1, Hahn will direct 
Sanders to finish his original sentence, prosecution and defense lawyers said. 
Because of the use of a firearm in the commission of a crime, Sanders is not 
eligible for probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system played itself out and withstood the test," said prosecutor Frank 
Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Rowan K. Klein, who had focused on contradictory statements 
that witnesses had made to police investigators shortly after the shooting on 
July 11, 1985, said he was stunned by the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was noteworthy in that it was a rare example of a federal court 
interceding in a state criminal matter, legal experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ordered Sanders' release in 
April, found that his lawyer in the second trial had "evidenced a Gargantuan 
indifference to the interests of his client and clearly prejudiced his client's 
defense" by failing to call Sanders' brother Xavier as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 The brother claimed that he had been prepared to testify in Sheldon's defense 
eight years ago but that his brother's attorney had told him "to leave the 
court building." 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier finally testified on Nov. 3, saying he had fired a rifle at the Compton 
home of Norman Gregory after the Centennial High School football player and his 
brother David had fought with Sheldon and damaged a Sanders family car. 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier said he had accompanied Sheldon back to the Gregory house, where he 
fired one shot at a car in the driveway, then aimed a shot toward the house. 
Norman Gregory, who was standing behind a security screen in the front door, 
was struck in the neck and fatally injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Clustered around the victim in the doorway were two of his brothers and two 
friends, all of whom testified that Sheldon had fired the shot. But three of 
the four, as well as Norman's sister, who watched from a neighbor's yard, had 
told police that it was Xavier who fired the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein suggested in his final argument that the prosecution witnesses, 
uncertain about who had been the shooter, had cooperated to ensure that a 
member of the Sanders family was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the time he has served, Sheldon Sanders could be eligible for 
parole next year.

 Brad and Robin Smith and their three children are the city's Family of the 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Partin presented the Smiths with a plaque after the City Council 
announced that they had won the annual Family of the Year competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, families are nominated for the honor, and a volunteer committee 
picks the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Partin, in reading the city's proclamation, said that the Smiths "have been 
found to be fine examples of a loving family and active in their church." 
</P>
<P>
 Partin added: "There is a great deal of love and devotion in the Smiths' home, 
and the Smiths are a close family who enjoy camping trips and strive to include 
both sets of grandparents in all family outings and activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Smith, an educational consultant, grew up in the city and attended 
Cypress High School and Cypress College. His wife, Robin, a homemaker, grew up 
in Fountain Valley. The couple have lived in the city for the past four years 
and have two daughters, Amber, 9, and Autumn, 6, and a son, Landon, 21 months 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Smith said she did not know the family had been nominated until she was 
told they had won the annual honor. "I was surprised but thrilled," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She thinks spending time together is essential to maintaining a strong family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan family vacations and spend quality time together," she said. "At 
least once or twice a week we do things totally involved as a family. We also 
are involved with our girls' school and things like that." BILL BILLITER

 Two workers in the truck, who are employed by a private contractor, were 
injured and taken to local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers were removing traffic cones to reopen three eastbound lanes of the 
freeway near Harbor Boulevard about 5 a.m. when the motorist drove over a line 
of cones and crashed into their truck, Caltrans spokesman Albert Miranda said. 
The motorist, Hiroshi Sakai, 24, of Anaheim, also struck an attached trailer 
holding a lighted arrow meant to divert traffic, Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured workers are employed by a subcontractor handling lane closures on 
Caltrans projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Tristen, 18, of Winton, a Northern California city, was listed in fair 
condition in the intensive-care unit at Anaheim Memorial Hospital. John Bodmer, 
37, of San Leandro suffered leg fractures and was taken to UCI Medical Center 
in Orange, where he was in critical but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they do not know why the accident occurred. Another motorist 
reported that traffic was going about 55 m.p.h. at the time, and excessive 
speed was not considered a factor in the crash, said Officer Joan Rivas, a 
spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush-hour traffic was snarled for three hours after officials closed all 
eastbound lanes at the scene of the crash and diverted motorists to Harbor 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers were finishing up a night's work on a freeway sealing project, 
Miranda said. They had reopened two lanes, but the fast lane remained closed by 
a line of cones, he said. The arrow sign towed by the truck was still lighted 
when it was struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after the crash, a second motorist struck debris and crashed into the 
center divider before the CHP was able to close the freeway. Rivas said the 
second driver was not injured. KEN ELLINGWOOD

COUNTY TO SET UP ANTI-CRIME ADVISORY COUNCIL; PANEL: MULTI-AGENCY GROUP WILL 
RECOMMEND PROGRAMS TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND WORK TO IMPROVE EXISTING 
EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In an attempt to more sharply focus and coordinate the county's crime-fighting 
efforts, the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to 
establish a multi-agency advisory council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Criminal Justice Coordination Council will replace the 
Legal-Judicial Systems Committee -- made up of judges and court administrators 
-- that has served in an advisory capacity to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 With 29 members, the new council will include county leaders in education, 
probation, public health and others with a stake in preventing or responding to 
crime, including the president of the League of California Cities and a 
citizens' advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose is to try to help coordinate the entire criminal justice arena 
and not just the courts," said David Kiff, executive assistant to Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley, who proposed expanding the Legal-Judicial Systems Committee he 
founded in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Coley of the county administrative office said the new council, which is 
modeled after a similar organization in Los Angeles County, will recommend new 
anti-crime programs to the Board of Supervisors and work to increase the 
efficiency of existing programs by eliminating duplication and promoting 
greater interagency coordination. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner, former director of Orangewood Children's Home 
for abused and neglected children, will serve the first two-year term as 
chairman of the new council.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Board of Supervisors invests about half a billion dollars annually in 
public safety, and the council will provide an opportunity to make 
recommendations on the best use of these funds," Steiner said.  
</P>
<P>
 Interagency coordination is vital, Steiner said, citing anti-gang activities 
as an example. "We have probably half a dozen programs to deal with gangs in 
Orange County and it is important that these efforts not be fragmented."  
</P>
<P>
 He said the advisory council, which will meet quarterly beginning next month, 
will also recommend innovations. The council will immediately study the 
feasibility of creating a "drug court" in Orange County to deal exclusively 
with cases involving the illegal sale and use of drugs, Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the proposal had been fully discussed over the past 18 months, Coley 
said, there was little discussion Tuesday about the proposal to form the 
multi-agency council, which will cost the county $236,000 annually, mostly in 
administrative salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Coley said officials representing all facets of Orange County's criminal 
justice system heard testimony last month from Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed 
Edelman about the successful track record of the Countywide Criminal Justice 
Coordination Committee that Edelman established in Los Angeles County 13 years 
ago.  
</P>
<P>
 And Orange County officials also did their own investigation. "Our agencies 
talked with their counterparts in Los Angeles and every one of them gave it 
rave reviews," Coley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Bellman, spokesman for Edelman, said the committee's coordinating efforts 
helped Los Angeles County launch a pilot drug court program last spring. He 
said the program directs nonviolent first-time drug offenders into intensive, 
court-supervised drug rehabilitation programs as an alternative to jail.

2 TESTIFY IN FRAUD TRIAL ABOUT EX-SALESMAN'S CHARMS; COURTS: BOTH WOMEN SAY 
JAMES BORZYNSKI WOOED THEM AND MADE OFF WITH $82,000 THAT THEY LENT HIM TO PAY 
TAXES. HE HAS DENIED ANY WRONGDOING. 
</P>

<P>
 Two women took the stand Tuesday to tell a parallel tale of broken promises of 
love and money in the trial of a former used-car salesman accused of conning 
three women out of $87,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Norton, 47, said that within a few weeks of meeting James Borzynski in 
the summer of 1993, he had charmed her with his sense of humor and 
"sensitivity." The Aliso Viejo woman testified that he told her he was an 
attorney who needed help paying his back taxes and could easily repay her. 
</P>
<P>
 He also told her that he loved her and wanted to marry her, Norton testified 
in Orange County Superior Court during the opening day of Borzynski's trial.  
</P>
<P>
 "He said he wanted me to become a part of his life and spend the rest of his 
life with me," Norton said. "I believed him. I hoped everything was going to 
fall into place, or I was going to be in deep yogurt." 
</P>
<P>
 But soon after the widowed Norton gave him $51,000 from her husband's life 
insurance, she said, he disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Borzynski, 45, a former Laguna Niguel resident, is charged with three counts 
of grand theft by false pretenses. He was arrested last November in Tiburon, 
Calif., after 10 California women alleged he had swindled them out of as much 
as $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Borzynski answered personal ads from women seeking 
companionship and then posed as a widowed Newport Beach lawyer who was in 
trouble with the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The two women who testified Tuesday were the first of five who will take the 
stand, although only three are pressing charges, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph 
D'Agostino. 
</P>
<P>
 Borzynski has denied all wrongdoing. Defense attorney Dennis P. O'Connell 
argued that Borzynski was not guilty of fraud because he was honest about his 
financial difficulties. The women also often saw him drinking heavily, 
O'Connell said, and should have known that he was a bad risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it a fraud when someone says he's broke, he's $200,000 in debt and you see 
he's a chronic drinker?" O'Connell asked. "I don't think so, when you give 
money to someone under those circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as promises of marriage are concerned, O'Connell said, the women "heard 
what they wanted to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney also insisted that Borzynski had intended to pay back the 
women's loans, but was arrested before he could. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women who testified Tuesday said that Borzynski pressured them to stop 
dating other men and to quit their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Valerie, 44, who has asked that her last name not be used, said she too was 
charmed by Borzynski, who claimed to be a Harvard graduate. He also sang songs 
during their dates, she said, and the lyrics to one of them said, "I want to be 
your soul provider." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County woman said she was so in love with him that she once 
cried and begged on her knees for his forgiveness when he became angry after 
learning that she was suspicious of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that he really cared a lot for me," she said. "He told me that over 
and over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Valerie, who was selling her Laguna Niguel condominium when she met Borzynski, 
gave him about $31,000 before he disappeared, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Borzynski could face up to five years and four months in prison.

UC IRVINE BIASED, DISABLED DOCTOR ALLEGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former medical resident at UC Irvine accused the medical center Tuesday of 
discriminating against him and interfering with his career because he is 
visually impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Pankaj Khemka, 28, of Orange, who has vision problems associated with 
being an albino, said he was charged with a series of "petty" violations this 
summer as an internal medicine resident, including being late to work a few 
times and practicing in the emergency room while wearing shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 He said at a news conference Tuesday that he believes the real issue is his 
disability, but he did not provide documentation. The violations mean that he 
did not receive credit for the last month of his three-year residency and thus 
could not take his board examinations in August, Khemka said. 
</P>
<P>
 A University of California attorney declined comment, saying university 
regulations prohibit discussing personnel matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Khemka's accusations came at a news conference Tuesday afternoon arranged by 
his attorneys and a publicist, just before an administrative hearing was to 
begin on the violations. But the hearing was postponed for the day as attorneys 
for both sides tried unsuccessfully to work out a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Khemka has difficulty seeing things at a distance and must use glasses and a 
special scope under some circumstances, but he said his disability does not 
affect his performance as a physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Khemka, now doing a fellowship in infectious diseases at UCI, said he has 
spent the past 12 years at the school, first as an undergraduate, then as a 
medical student and resident. Until recently, he said, he always received 
superior evaluations as a resident.

FIRE AT SUBSTATION KNOCKS OUT POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire in a Southern California Edison substation near the Huntington Beach 
Pier cut off power to about 15,000 customers in the northern section of the 
city as well as western Santa Ana, an Edison spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Power was restored to all customers within 45 minutes, according to Ken Perry, 
a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire started just after 8 p.m., when a circuit breaker in the unoccupied 
substation failed, Perry said. Company officials went to the station and 
extinguished the blaze, which caused minor damage.

SEAL BEACH OKS LOWER SPEED LIMITS NEAR MCGAUGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR , SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved lower speed limits near McGaugh Elementary 
School, an action prompted by the death of a 12-year-old boy in July who was 
struck by a car while standing on a sidewalk across from the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed limit on Seal Beach Boulevard will be reduced from 40 m.p.h. to 25 
m.p.h. in a zone extending to 375 feet north of the Bolsa Avenue school.The 
25-m.p.h. speed limit on Bolsa Avenue will be lowered to 15 m.p.h. in the 
school area. Both speed limits will apply only when children are present. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say new speed limit signs will be in place within several 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 McGaugh Elementary School parents were stunned by the death of Christopher 
Schneider, who was hit by a car while waiting to walk his bicycle across Seal 
Beach Boulevard. They formed the Christopher Committee to push for lower speed 
limits, pedestrian barriers, warning lights and other safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the members of the Christopher Committee are thrilled that we've taken 
these first steps," said parent Renee Handler, a witness to the accident. "The 
community has suffered a real tragedy. Obviously, we think there are more 
things that need to be looked at." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent traffic study of the school area refers to the coming and going of 
students as "mass confusion" and reports that up to 24,000 cars pass by the 
school each day. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Jerry L. Bankston said the city is considering additional 
measures, including relocating the school bus pickup area, lowering speed 
limits on nearby Riviera Drive, moving bike lanes, widening sidewalks, 
re-synchronizing traffic lights and installing a specially marked school 
crossing.RUSS LOAR

REWARD CONSIDERED FOR CONTRABAND TIPS; ANTELOPE VALLEY: DISTRICT WOULD PAY $25 
TO STUDENTS PROVIDING INFORMATION LEADING TO THE SEIZURE OF DRUGS AND GUNS ON 
CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 High school students in the Antelope Valley could earn a $25 reward for 
informing on classmates with guns or drugs on campus under a proposed new 
program that will be considered at a school board meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the Antelope Valley Union High School District hope that the 
rewards will reinforce their "zero-tolerance" position concerning weapons and 
illegal substances and say that the identities of student tipsters will be 
concealed to protect them from retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every precaution would be taken to prevent that," said Sue Stokka, a school 
board member who expressed few reservations about the plan. "We certainly would 
not want this action to backfire on us. The intent is to reduce violence on 
campus." The measure, which backers expect to be adopted, would provide the 
money for tips that lead to the seizure of banned items. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other school districts, including Los Angeles Unified, operate hot 
lines to gather information on illegal activity on campuses, cash rewards for 
such tips are much less common. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's Conejo Valley Unified School District distributes promotional 
materials on behalf of the local WeTip program, which offers rewards of up to 
$1,000 for information about crimes on or off campus. The program and its 
reward money are managed by a local nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year in Memphis, Tenn., the City School District launched a 
"Weapon Watch" program that promised $50 rewards for student tips that led to 
the seizure of guns and knives. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators in the 12,000-student Antelope Valley Union district, which 
includes five four-year high schools and a continuation campus, were 
unavailable Tuesday to describe exactly how their proposed reward program would 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 At their meeting tonight, school board members will be asked to add a new 
provision to the district's operating policies, authorizing "a reward of $25 to 
any student who will provide information to school personnel which will lead to 
the confiscation of any weapon or illegal substance on campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Board president Billy Pricer said board members endorsed the idea during a 
public discussion last spring. He said the program was not brought before the 
board sooner, for official adoption, because of a clerical oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer, who plans to vote in favor of the rewards, said he believes the tips 
will come from youngsters who are tired of seeing drug abuse and intimidation 
with weapons on their campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority are good students," said Pricer, who runs a nonprofit 
counseling program for troubled teen-agers. "They're like a lot of people in 
our society, saying 'enough is enough.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He believes the board will adopt the program with little dissent. The Antelope 
Valley board, led by a highly conservative majority, engaged in a bitter legal 
dispute with state officials earlier this year after refusing to administer the 
controversial California Learning Assessment System (CLAS) tests. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the Antelope Valley district declined to join other public 
agencies in court challenges against Proposition 187, which denies public 
education to undocumented residents and requires school officials to report 
"suspects" to immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said the reward proposal is in line with the district's tough 
stance against truancy and crime on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have come out with school posters and bumper stickers that emphasize that 
we have zero tolerance for weapons, drugs and graffiti," said Stokka. "This 
adds to the zero tolerance (message). We want it out there." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dave Kennedy, a history teacher at Quartz Hill High School, questioned 
whether many students will inform on their classmates for $25. 
</P>
<P>
 "The size of the reward is not persuasive," he said. "So the question is, what 
do they hope to achieve by it? If there's a code of silence, $25 is not going 
to break down that code. Students who are going to talk will do it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Fields, director of campus security at Antelope Valley High School, 
acknowledged that some students already tell his staff about weapons and drugs, 
even without a reward. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added, "The $25 may increase students' involvement, as far as letting 
someone know there are perpetrators around." 
</P>
<P>
 Fields said the success of the program may hinge on how well it protects the 
identity of student informants. "They do not want to have their names become 
public knowledge for fear of some type of retaliation," he said.

UP FOR THE COUNT; SAN FERNANDO YOUTHS ORGANIZE FOR SELF-IMPROVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rudy Campa, 52, dances lightly side to side in the shadows, dressed in sweat 
shirt, dark pants and white sneakers. His partner is Ernie Rodriguez, 16, a 
former member of theSanfers, a San Fernando-based gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Campa -- once a drug addict, convict and gang member himself -- weaves and 
bobs, then comes at Ernie. Campa keeps his guard up, his fists enveloped by 
worn leather mitts. Ernie, in a pair of boxing gloves, does not back off. He 
connects with a combination of swift punches to Campa's mitts. 
</P>
<P>
 Their figures -- that of an older, wiry man and a younger, lithe pupil -- cast 
weird shadows beneath the light bulb on the wall behind the headquarters of the 
youth organization Salud on Celis Street.  
</P>
<P>
 The two boxers are connecting. And that is the point of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the city of San Fernando banned Campa's group of about 50 youth 
boxers, both male and female, from a corner of the tennis court in Las Palmas 
Park, where the group had trained, saying it was stirring up trouble and 
causing fights there.  
</P>
<P>
 It was after their exile, the youths say, that the police began harassing 
them. Some of the teen-agers, who are mostly Latino, thought about quitting the 
program -- which provided them access to a positive, active peer group. Many 
considered going back to whatever it was they did before -- hanging out at the 
mall, cruising, trying to find beer, avoiding homework, avoiding home. 
</P>
<P>
 But two months later, the group is still together, better organized, larger 
and, its leaders say, wiser after its struggle with the city and its police. 
And the group has a new name: the Las Palmas Youth Group -- chosen to remind 
members of their struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxing continues on a reduced level, with teen-agers training on their own and 
sparring with Campa in the back of the building on Celis Street.  
</P>
<P>
 And supervised by Augie Maldonado, an anti-alcohol activist who received a 
$72,000 grant from the San Fernando Valley Partnership in January to run youth 
programs for high-risk teen-agers, the group convenes weekly meetings, using 
parliamentary procedure. There they plan parties, boxing exhibitions and 
community service activities. The next activity is a yard cleanup day for 
senior citizens in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is the organization of the events -- and the struggle, the give-and-take 
with the city and the police force -- that provides the most valuable lessons 
for the teen-agers, Maldonado says, and the kids agree.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good thing going in the park," said Laura Urib, 14, one of Campa's 
boxers. "But it's even better now. We thought we'd all separate. But this is 
something unique. With the problems we had with the police, it's different. We 
stayed together. We tried to do something about the problem, and we're more 
determined to prove we can make something good happen."  
</P>
<P>
 The youths' enthusiasm and drive to succeed has earned them a reputation that 
extends beyond the boundaries of San Fernando. Youth organizations like the 
Blythe Street Youth Leadership group from Panorama City and students from the 
Phoenix Academy, a residential drug treatment center and school in Lake View 
Terrace, have dropped in for lessons in boxing, leadership and practical 
civics.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the teen-agers, like Ernie, quit gangs to join the group. Others said 
they joined because it's clean, safe and fun. Whatever the reasons, members 
agree that their exile from the park -- which occurred after several fights 
broke out there and questions arose about the group's nonprofit status -- has 
brought them closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Campa, who said that starting the youth boxing program was a dream he held 
onto during his 32 years in a California state prison, agrees: "They thought 
they were closing the door on us, but we just opened up a whole new one."  
</P>
<P>
 The troubles in Las Palmas Park began Aug. 13, when two teen-agers began 
fighting during a Salud banquet there. Campa intervened, telling the boys to 
put on boxing gloves if they wanted to pound out their differences. The boys 
obliged, boxed for about three minutes and then shook hands. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials objected to Campa's way of handling the problem and 
protested the lack of headgear or mouthpieces in the boxing program.  
</P>
<P>
 After another fight in the park during a baseball game, the City Council 
decided Sept. 12 to ban the group from the park. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when several alleged incidents of police harassment began, the youths 
said. Police Chief Dominick Rivetti confirmed that the department is 
investigating the allegations, but declined to comment further.  
</P>
<P>
 About 10 of the youths who had attended the meeting said they were roughed up 
afterward by several members of the San Fernando Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were walking down San Fernando Road toward the mall," said Ronnie Campa, 
20, who was with the group that evening. "A police car pulled up behind us and 
a cop started yelling at us: 'What are you guys -- stupid?' He was mad because 
we crossed when the light was red."  
</P>
<P>
 Two more squad cars then arrived, said Campa, who is Rudy Campa's son. 
</P>
<P>
 Campa said one of the officers asked Robert Vasquez, 14, if the light had been 
green when the group walked through the intersection. The police officer did 
not like Robert's response and slapped him a few times, Campa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie said one of the officers pushed him several times, trying to goad him 
into a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie and Ronnie Campa said they were angry about the way they were treated 
and asked Maldonado what they could do about it. Maldonado suggested a meeting 
with the police. That meeting, during which the teen-agers told an officer 
about that incident and several others, resulted in Rivetti's decision to 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There were issues raised during that meeting that are being checked out," 
Rivetti said. "I don't release the conclusions of department investigations. 
But I can tell you the allegations had nothing to do with racial 
discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers say that there have been fewer problems since their meeting 
with police, and the group views that as a victory: "They expected us to say 
something back to them, to like, do something bad because of the way they 
treated us. But Rudy and Augie, they say, 'Just be polite and show them 
respect,' " Ernie said. "It's not easy, but that's what we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado said it's the first lesson many of the teen-agers have learned about 
how to exercise restraint and pressure for change "in a positive way." 
</P>
<P>
 "They found out that if they don't give up, it works, and they're proud of 
themselves," Maldonado said. "They should be."

VOTE ON QUAKE REDEVELOPMENT DELAYED; REBUILDING: COUNCIL DELAYS DECISION AFTER 
RESIDENTS DENOUNCE PLAN TO USE CRA POWERS TO RENOVATE SHATTERED AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Following nearly three hours of mostly angry public testimony, the Los Angeles 
City Council delayed a decision Tuesday to use redevelopment powers to rebuild 
earthquake-damaged neighborhoods in Sherman Oaks and Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment project was the first of six projects to be considered for 
hard-hit areas in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood. But the opposition 
raised Tuesday signals an uphill battle for the other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, a redevelopment zone in Sherman Oaks and Studio City would 
include commercial and residential blocks along Ventura Boulevard and in 
adjacent neighborhoods. It would divert property taxes to provide residential 
and commercial loans and money to rebuild streets and public buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents urged city officials to reject the plan, saying they do not 
trust the city's Community Redevelopment Agency to spend their tax dollars and 
to wield the right to condemn private property. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear to the people who have looked into this that the CRA is not the 
way to go for Sherman Oaks," said Lynn Solky, a resident and business owner in 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing strong sentiments on both sides, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who 
represents the area, suggested that the city could tentatively establish the 
redevelopment project but delay for about 10 months the sale of bonds to raise 
funds, giving the council time to back out of the plan in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 A CRA attorney said he was unsure if state law would allow the city to delay 
the sale of bonds but said he would study the idea further and return with an 
answer when the council reconsiders the proposal Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the council is scheduled today to consider establishing an 
emergency redevelopment zone in the northeast Valley communities of Mission 
Hills, Pacoima and Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest redevelopment area is proposed around the epicenter of the 
earthquake, in Northridge, Chatsworth, North Hills and Granada Hills. In 
another signal that support for the redevelopment zones is shaky, Councilman 
Hal Bernson, who represents the area, said he still has many questions about 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still not sold completely on it," he said. "It's not going to be an easy 
road regardless of how we go." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal for redevelopment zones takes advantage of emergency provisions 
of the state's redevelopment law that allow local agencies to establish project 
areas in disaster zones without completing the time-consuming environmental 
studies required when traditional redevelopment areas are established. 
</P>
<P>
 The law allows the agencies to keep all the property tax generated by new 
construction in a project area and use that money to pay for improvements such 
as new streets, parks and sewers, as well as loans for quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the proposed boundaries of the redevelopment area, about 700 
residential buildings comprising 10,000 dwelling units and more than 200 
businesses suffered damaged, according to CRA officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The 900-acre project would generate $18.8 million, which would be offered to 
home and business owners in the form of low-interest loans. However, the 
redevelopment guidelines require that 20% of the housing funds be set aside for 
tenants with moderate or low incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Once established, the CRA and the council would have limited powers to condemn 
abandoned and blighted property -- a provision that makes many property owners 
nervous. Some homeowners suggested the city form a committee of residents and 
give it authority on how the project is managed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Residents have to have some say to keep the CRA from running over the 
citizens," said Gordon Murley, head of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon 
Assns. 
</P>
<P>
 Many opponents cited a 1993-94 Los Angeles County Grand Jury report that 
criticized the CRA's management practices and excessive overhead costs. The CRA 
has also encountered problems in North Hollywood where one manager received 
death threats and the agency has experienced financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the council said their vote on whether to support a zone in Sherman 
Oaks would rest heavily on Yaroslavsky's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky said he believes the redevelopment plan is a good way to help 
quake victims. But he said he was hard-pressed to make a decision because he 
leaves office Dec. 5 to take a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors and would not be in office to see the project through. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no decision that I can make that won't subject me to criticism," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He rejected suggestions by some of his council colleagues that he is simply 
unwilling to take a stand on a controversial subject. He said he is trying to 
find a solution that will appeal to opponents and supporters of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment proposal was backed by the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce 
and other business owners who said it is needed to rebuild the community's 
commercial base. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only plan I can see that can help those who are still left out 
there," said Nancy Schmidt, president of the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the speakers at the hearing said they opposed the idea primarily 
because of the CRA's checkered history in managing redevelopment projects in 
Hollywood, North Hollywood and Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs called criticism of the CRA a "scathing indictment of 
the agency" that "calls into question the viability of the agency in the 
history of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky agreed that the CRA's reputation has made it difficult to sell the 
idea to the public. "This agency has such a sad credibility problem that it 
makes it impossible to rationally deal with this," he said. Proposed 
Redevelopment Area The Community Redevelopment Agency wants to create a 
900-acre redevelopment zone in Sherman Oaks, one of the hardest-hit areas in 
the quake. A portion of local property taxes will be diverted to pay for 
reconstruction, new construction fand public improvements. Source: Community

<P>
 Whether in a hat or with a cat, in a box or with a fox, the children at 
Castlemont School in Woodland Hills will spend this week learning to love 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the private elementary school's yearly celebration of National Book 
Week, students dressed up Tuesday as their favorite book characters. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Book Week theme is, "Books for Everyone and Everyone for Books." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers introduced youngsters to the rest of the school, explaining which 
literary figure each had chosen to be for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the characters represented were a couple Cats in the Hats, several 
Sleeping Beauties, an Encyclopedia Brown or two and at least one Mr. Cheese 
Head, said Joyce Gallien, assistant director at Castlemont and coordinator of 
the school's Book Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on hand for the celebration was Diane Wolkstein, a writer, storyteller 
and teacher, who read to the children. 
</P>
<P>
 To incorporate what the youngsters learned about storytelling with their 
regular reading program, Castlemont teachers will have their classes create a 
project to be sent to Wolkstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard some teachers talking about it at lunch and they want their students 
to write their own folk tales," Gallien said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recording stories written in groups on cassette and making books of bound 
poetry were other ideas that were tossed around the faculty lunchroom after 
Tuesday's event. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; WATER DISTRICT OFFERS FREE COMPOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After much preparation, the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District is now 
offering free compost to its customers, as well as to clients of the Triunfo 
Sanitation District. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday, on the first day the compost was offered, 48 customers showed 
up at Rancho Las Virgenes Composting Facility, the district's new 
sludge-recycling facility, said Bobbe Wymer, the district's spokeswoman. A 
total of 20 cubic yards of the product was given away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who came," Wymer said, "ranged from people in Mercedeses, who put 
five-gallon buckets into the trunks of their cars, to people in pickup trucks 
who filled up the back." 
</P>
<P>
 The state-of-the-art sludge-processing facility -- which has been touted as 
the answer to the area's recycling needs -- opened in September. Sludge is 
carried by pipe from the Tapia Water Reclamation Facility, about two miles 
away, and processed at Rancho Las Virgenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the free composting program, customers can come every Saturday and take 
home a limit of one pickup truck full per customer, Wymer said. Customers must 
provide their own containers and load the compost themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Landscapers and other commercial enterprises are not eligible for the compost, 
which is safe to use on gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy wanted to bring his dump truck, and I told him he couldn't," said Jim 
Graham, the facility's compost marketing coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickup hours are 9 a.m. to noon each Saturday at the facility, at the 
intersection of Las Virgenes and Lost Hills roads in Calabasas, Wymer said. The 
facility will be closed on Dec. 24 and 31 for the holidays. It will be open 
Nov. 26, the Saturday after Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 The district plans to contact the program's participants later and ask how 
them how well the compost is performing, said Graham. "We want to know how well 
their plants like it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In three months, the district's Board of Directors will review the program to 
see how well it is working, said Wymer. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the district has approved a contract with Carson-based Kellogg 
Supply Inc., which will market most of the compost generated by the facility, 
Graham said.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the five-year contract, Kellogg will provide free sawdust needed to make 
the compost, Graham said. In exchange, Kellogg will get the finished compost 
for free. 
</P>
<P>
 The district must buy back the compost that is provided to Las Virgenes' 
customers, Graham said. The facility is now producing 350 cubic yards per month 
of compost. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; ACTOR TO DELIVER MOTIVATIONAL SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Greed is not good, you got that Gordie? 
</P>
<P>
 The ruthless, competition-driven, rip-their-throats-out credo of the Gordon 
Gecko-styled corporate greed mongers of the '80s has become as unpalatable as 
the movie character's greased-down look and power suspenders. At least that's 
the opinion of actor Richard Hatch, who moonlights as a personal motivator. 
</P>
<P>
 The vilified wheeler-dealer of the '80s movie hit "Wall Street" is the 
antithesis of today's real-life, kinder, gentler, corporate team player, who, 
having learned the valuable lessons of the '80s, is able to look beyond today's 
bottom line, claims Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
 He will pitch his message to the Calabasas Chamber of Commerce on Thursday at 
11:30 a.m. at the Calabasas Inn, 23500 Park Sorrento. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the days when maximizing profits was the be-all, end-all, says Hatch. 
And business people who don't realize that will end up, at worst, like Gordon 
Gecko, or at best, with not-so-satisfied customers or clients.  
</P>
<P>
 The new credo, Hatch says, is simple: Do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of doing things for money, we should do things because we care about 
people, and then money will follow," Hatch said. "Customers want to feel like 
people care about them. People want to be treated like human beings. People are 
tired of having people lie to them, talk them into things they don't want to 
buy, products that don't live up to their hype." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch, who has appeared in such TV series as "The Streets of San Francisco," 
"All My Children," and "Battlestar Galactica," said the transition from actor 
to personal growth motivator was a natural one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since I have been an actor, I have been into communication," he said. 
"And for me, acting was a wonderful way to move through the fears and the 
insecurities." 
</P>
<P>
 Marilynn Jones, a chiropractor and member of the Calabasas Chamber of Commerce 
who has heard Hatch speak and helped recruit him for Thursday's talk, said she 
is sold on Hatch as a motivator. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really empowers you," she said. "You float out of there a foot off the 
ground. He really made you feel like you can do whatever you want." 
</P>
<P>
 "The '80s were a very greed-oriented, self-indulgent nauseating decade," added 
Jones. "I hope when he says that the '90s are for service and not for greed, I 
certainly hope it's true. It sounds like a wonderful idea." 
</P>

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's "Hazmobile" will visit Reseda beginning Thursday as part of the 
Bureau of Sanitation's household hazardous waste collection program. 
</P>
<P>
 People are asked to make appointments for hazardous-waste disposal by calling 
the hot line at (800) 98-TOXIC, or (800) 988-6942, said Jackie David, the 
bureau's public information director. 
</P>
<P>
 Callers will then be told where to take the materials, she said. They also 
will be sent a map to direct them to the collection center. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointments can be scheduled between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., David said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Reseda, appointments can be scheduled on Thursday, Friday and Saturday and 
Dec. 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, motorists are not allowed to transport in their vehicles more than a 
five-gallon container, or more than 50 pounds of hazardous waste, she said. The 
so-called Hazmobile transports the materials for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hazmobile program is part of a countywide effort co-sponsored by the Los 
Angeles County Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 Among wastes that are considered hazardous are paint, motor oil, pesticides, 
cleaners and other common household materials labeled toxic, corrosive or 
flammable liquids and poisons, David said. The collections are conducted to 
prevent people from disposing of the materials illegally, such as by dumping 
them in sewers, she said. FRANK MANNING

<TEXT>
<P>
 With more than $3.5 million in housing assistance available to residents whose 
homes were damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake, the Simi Valley City Council has 
hired a consultant to handle the funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, 336 loans and grants ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 will be 
awarded to needy residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has received more than 250 applications, and many residents will 
qualify for both a loan and a grant, said Dulce Conde-Sierra, deputy director 
of housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will pay Comprehensive Housing Services of Fountain Valley $367,000 
to administer the program over an 18-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring a consultant rather than performing the work in-house will save the 
city about $83,000, according to a study reviewed by the council. SARA CATANIA

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; DRUG REHAB CENTER TO DEDICATE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A drug treatment program that began 23 years ago in a cramped Sun Valley 
building will celebrate the opening of a $10-million facility at the end of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a wide range of emotions for many of us who have been here a 
long time," said Jack Bernstein, executive director of Cri-Help, which will 
dedicate its new George T. Pfleger Center, 11027 Burbank Blvd. in North 
Hollywood, on Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We literally lived from month to month," said Bernstein of the first couple 
of years of the program, which survived partly because the landlord understood 
and supported the agency's work to fight drug dependency. "Some months we 
didn't pay the rent, to pay other bills." 
</P>
<P>
 The program eventually moved into a building that was previously an orphanage 
for Jewish boys. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Hollywood site was purchased in 1975. As part of a one-year, 
$10-million project, the old building on the site was torn down and replaced 
with a modern facility, Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is named after a benefactor, the father of one of the center's 
former clients. A Newport Beach foundation in Pfleger's name decided to pay $8 
million of the building costs shortly after Pfleger died three years ago, 
Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Living quarters and counseling areas for the center's 65 clients have been 
completed, but a second phase of construction, which will include a lobby and 
offices, has yet to be finished, Bernstein said. Singer Natalie Cole is 
scheduled to attend the dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 Cri-Help's financial situation improved over the years as fund-raising efforts 
improved and as the group won contracts from the California Youth Authority to 
serve as a treatment facility for inmates shortly before their release, or for 
those on probation after serving sentences in Los Angeles County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been able to attract a certain number of clients who could afford to 
pay for services," Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group aims to help those who have completed detoxification programs to 
learn to stay off drugs and get back into society. "The way it is now, if 
people complete our program, everyone is working by the time they leave here," 
Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was founded in 1971, Cri-Help was one of the first to provide 
long-term recovery programs for drug addiction. The program offers professional 
counseling, a literacy program, family groups, AIDS education and support 
groups and help in finding jobs. More than half of Cri-Help residents are 
indigent. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PARKING STRUCTURE REOPENS AT GALLERIA

 More than 400 black and yellow top hats were thrown into the air at the 
Glendale Galleria Tuesday morning as mall employees, city officials and 
business representatives celebrated the official reopening of a 1,500-space 
parking structure damaged by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 11 months after it was heavily damaged by the quake, the parking 
structure at the north end of the mall and adjacent to the Broadway department 
store, will provide space for the holiday shopping rush. 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary loss of the structure, along with other damaged parking 
facilities, caused a shortage of about 2,000 parking slots, mall officials 
said.

<P>
 Marketing director Mellisa Beissner said the mall welcomes the restored space 
because of the success the Galleria has had, despite the inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our sales are currently trending at a 15% increase over last year during the 
same quarter," she said. "We anticipate an extremely busy holiday season . . . 
and are glad to be able to accommodate our customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Razed in August, the structure's road to recovery required the use of 33,000 
tons of concrete, 260 miles of steel beams, 135 workers operating on a 
fast-track construction schedule and $12 million, partially funded by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds were provided by the Glendale Associates Limited Partnership, which 
consists of the city's redevelopment agency, developer Donahue Shriber and The 
Broadway, J. C. Penney & Robinsons-May department stores, all owners of that 
section of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 With help from the city, the partnership acquired a low-interest federal loan 
to pay a $4.5-million insurance deductible on the structure.  
</P>
<P>
 While the structure was being rebuilt, mall shoppers parked in newly created 
lots across the street on Central Avenue or were shuttled in every 15 minutes 
from the Los Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Beissner, about 145,000 people have opted for the shuttle since 
the service began a month after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan on continuing to utilize the new parking lots, as well as the shuttle 
service, on weekends," Beissner said. "People have gotten accustomed to (the 
shuttles) and enjoy using them." ANTONIO OLIVO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; DOCTORS PURCHASE MEDICAL CENTER 
</P>

<P>
 A group of physicians have purchased Thompson Memorial Medical Center in 
Burbank for an undisclosed amount of money from the nonprofit foundation that 
owned and operated it for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The multimillion-dollar deal, which becomes final today, enables the 
physicians to obtain complete control of the hospital buildings they had been 
leasing since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tremendous amount of space to add additional hospital wings, 
surgical centers and expand the facilities, and now that they own the property 
they can do so as they desire," said Robert N. Jensen Jr., executive director 
of Burbank Community Hospital Foundation, which sold the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson Memorial was previously known as Burbank Community Hospital. It 
opened in 1907 as a 16-bed facility and was founded by Dr. Elmer H. Thompson, 
who made house calls by bicycle and horseback. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Community Hospital Foundation, a 15-member board of trustees, 
owned and operated the hospital for about 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, a group of more than 60 physicians began leasing the buildings, 
purchased the hospital's equipment and supplies and renamed the site Thompson 
Memorial Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the doctors involved in the deal, such as Chief of Staff Joseph 
Turcillo, work at Thompson Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital and foundation officials say that the sale will probably improve 
service for patients but that it will make little difference to employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think that it is the physicians involved who can best determine 
quality-of-care issues," Turcillo said. "It's not an administrator far away . . 
. You're not some unknown, separate corporate entity that owns these 
hospitals." VIVIEN LOU CHEN

 To offer a little holiday cheer to San Fernando Valley residents infected with 
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and others affected by it, the Valley HIV/AIDS 
Center will team up with a Thrifty Drug Store in Van Nuys for a two-part 
project.  
</P>
<P>
 A Christmas tree, adorned with cards imprinted with the names of children who 
are HIV-positive or have parents who are HIV-positive, will be set up at the 
Thrifty store. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons will be asked to pick one of the cards and buy a gift for the child. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents have spent so much money on medication that there's not enough 
left to buy toys for the kids," said Ana Vargas, a representative of the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Case managers who work directly with families affected by the virus are 
gathering names of children for inclusion on what Vargas called the "giving 
tree." 
</P>
<P>
 The second part of the project is a gift-wrapping booth that will be set up 
the last week before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Center volunteers will gift-wrap presents at the store for a $4 
donation to benefit the center. MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: QUAKE-DAMAGED BUILDING SET AFIRE 
</P>

<P>
 Arsonists started two fires in a vacant medical center in Mission Hills on 
Tuesday, causing extensive damage to two floors of the building and putting one 
firefighter in the hospital with minor injuries, Los Angeles Fire Department 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no other injuries.The injured firefighter, whose name was not 
released, was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center and treated for heat 
exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires, set about the same time on the second and fifth floors, caused 
serious structural damage to the Indian Hills Medical Center at 14935 Rinaldi 
St. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chances of two accidental fires starting on two different floors is not 
likely," Assistant Fire Chief John W. Callahan said. After examining both 
floors, the Fire Department's arson investigators concluded that both fires 
were set by unknown people who used combustible materials left in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires began about 11:15 a.m., officials said. Ten engine companies and 
some 40 firefighters met thick, heavy smoke rising from both floors. They 
extinguished the fires within an hour and checked the entire building for 
flames that might have been overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 The staircase on the east side of the building buckled from the intense heat 
and flames, Callahan said. By late Tuesday, officials had no dollar value on 
the damage and no information on the owner of the seven-story medical center, 
which was vacated after sustaining damage during the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. Squatters, reported to have been staying in the boarded-up 
building, were believed to have started the blaze after entering through a 
broken window, Callahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they have had problems with squatters in buildings left vacant 
since the earthquake. "The key is to keep (buildings) secured and to keep 
people out of there," Callahan said. ERROL A. COCKFIELD JR.

TEACHER'S IMAGE DOESN'T JIBE WITH PICTURE OF ACCUSED KILLER; CRIME: STUDENTS 
CAN'T BELIEVE THEIR ROLE MODEL HELPED BEAT A TRUCK DRIVER TO DEATH. DENNETH 
JACKSON PLEADS NOT GUILTY. 
</P>

<P>
 Those who knew Denneth Thaddeus Jackson as a North Hollywood middle school 
teacher are struggling to reconcile their memories of a supportive and fiercely 
moral role model for his students with the Jackson arraigned Tuesday for 
allegedly helping gang members beat a man to death after a minor traffic 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we heard what happened, everyone who knew him immediately thought that 
he had been there to stop it, not hurt someone," said Joanna Kunes, principal 
of Madison Middle School, where Jackson was wildly popular with students as a 
history teacher in the seventh and ninth grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard to reconcile the very positive and upbeat image with the 
report of what happened this weekend," said Kunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under overcast skies Tuesday, school counselor Stephanie Palmer tried to help 
students make sense of the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students are distressed," she said. "They don't want to believe it could 
happen. They can't reconcile the image of Mr. Jackson the teacher with the Mr. 
Jackson that could have done this." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was like the perfect teacher, y'know?," said one of Jackson's ninth grade 
students. "He was real cool, and when he talked, his students listened, not 
like other teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, Jackson's students asked when their favorite teacher was 
coming back, and at lunch, many wrote letters to him. "They just can't process 
it," said Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and six other men pleaded not guilty Tuesday in Van Nuys Municipal 
Court to charges that they killed a Reseda man who accidentally drove into a 
parked pickup truck owned by a guest attending a party Saturday in Jackson's 
apartment on Amigo Avenue in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the guests were gang members and teen-agers who were drinking alcohol 
and smoking marijuana, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and the others were charged with using pool cues and chunks of wood, 
as well as their fists and feet, to beat to death Julio Aguilar, 23. His 
brother, Jose Aguilar, 21, remained in serious condition Tuesday at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the school, Jackson's admirers talked about his almost magical way with 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "They connected very early to him, and very strongly," Kunes said. "He had an 
excellent rapport with students. This whole thing is startling, stunning, 
shocking." 
</P>
<P>
 His best friend at the school, fellow teacher Roy Kassebaum, 24, said 
Jackson's goodness extended to everyone around him. "When I needed him he was 
there, and vice versa, although I leaned on him a lot more than he leaned on 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews with teachers, students and one of his college professors, the 
portrait that emerges of Jackson is of a man who talked little about his past, 
was proud of his Latino heritage and saw himself as a leader, especially of 
young people. He was respected by those younger and those older than he was.  
</P>
<P>
 Before his arrest on Saturday, Jackson appeared to be beating the odds after 
what he described to Kassebaum and others "as a rough time growing up," 
including flirtations with -- and possible membership in -- a street gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally from San Antonio, Tex., he moved to Los Angeles and was graduated 
from Cal State Northridge in June, 1994, with a bachelor's degree in Chicano 
studies and obtained a teaching job under the Los Angeles Unified School 
District's emergency credential program. 
</P>
<P>
 Of mixed ancestry -- Latino, African American and Native American -- Jackson 
took a particularly strong interest in Latino culture, friends and professors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of those handful of kids who you could see sparks go off when it 
came to learning," said Lorenzo Flores, who teaches writing courses in the 
Department of Chicano Studies at CSUN. "He was in the writing lab every other 
night, either working on a paper or helping someone on their paper." 
</P>
<P>
 About Jackson's possible gang involvement, Flores said: "He was trying to get 
away from that lifestyle, trying to get his education. College had changed 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 While applying for a teaching position at Madison, he told the principal that 
he had previously taught students held in the county's detention system, Kunes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when he got the job," said Flores. "He had elation on his face and 
he told me, 'I'm a teacher! I'm a teacher!' For me, it was like, 'Wow! All 
right!' It was very personally satisfying for me. He's a kid that you root 
for." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 17 new teachers at the North Hollywood middle school this year, 
Jackson was one of the few who were able to get into the flow almost 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 During the anti-Proposition 187 demonstrations that recently swept across 
campuses, for example, he counseled students to think twice about leaving 
classrooms to march in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told them, 'The only way to protest this is to stay in school and get an 
education,' " Kassebaum said. "They listened to him. He was a peacemaker; 
that's one of the reasons it's so hard to believe this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's goal was to organize a Chicano club at the predominantly Latino 
school and start teaching classes in Latino culture and heritage. "One of the 
reasons he wanted to be a teacher is to pass on his pride," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Jackson, those arraigned on murder charges were Brian 
Hernandez, 19, Van Nuys; Jose Luis Macia, 21, North Hills, and Oswaldo Ramos 
Perez, 19; Richard Lee Baker, 20; William Ronald Davis, 18, and Marvin Lewis 
Foster Jr., 22, all of Reseda. They were ordered held in lieu of $1.5 million 
bail, and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Finch, 23, of Reseda -- who owns the truck that Aguilar drove into -- 
was charged with attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon. He was held 
in lieu of $500,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Two juveniles, 15 and 17, who were arrested in connection with the beating 
death, have been released to the custody of their parents.

DOCTORS CHARGED IN KICKBACK CASE; MEDICINE: NORTHRIDGE ORTHOPEDIST IS AMONG THE 
FOUR ACCUSED OF PAYING TO GET WORKERS' COMPENSATION PATIENT REFERRALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Northridge doctor and three other physicians have been charged with paying 
illegal kickbacks to a medical referral firm that is under investigation for 
workers compensation fraud.  
</P>
<P>
 The physicians allegedly paid for patient referrals from L.A. Management, a 
former Sherman Oaks firm under investigation for possibly paying kickbacks to 
get patients from companies that process workers' compensation claims for some 
employers and insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of L.A. Management is unusual because most probes of 
workers' compensation fraud target large medical chains that treat employees 
who have applied for benefits from employers and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn said the four doctors -- a cardiologist, a 
surgeon, a psychiatrist and an orthopedist -- paid up to $250 per head for 
patients seeking medical examinations. The physicians were charged Monday in 
Los Angeles Municipal Court with from one to six misdemeanor counts. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Management listed a Sherman Oaks mailbox as its business address. 
However, the firm's telephone has been disconnected and the company is believed 
to have shut down some time after investigators seized its bank records in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say L.A. Management acted as a middleman between doctors and 
third-party administrators -- insurance service firms that handle workers' 
compensation claims for some employers and insurance firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical referral or marketing firms such as L.A. Management often are used by 
administrators when they want to get quick doctor's appointments for workers 
with injury claims. Doctors, in turn, use referral firms to add more patients 
to their rosters. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies and employers have sought to blame "workers' comp mills" 
that treat large numbers of employees as the main cause of expensive abuse in 
California's workers' compensation system. But experts say fraud exists 
throughout the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors charged were Dr. Gerald Paul, an orthopedist on the staff of 
Northridge Hospital Medical Center; Dr. Harvey Alpern, a Century City 
cardiologist; Dr. Ivor Harewood, a Los Angeles surgeon, and Dr. Emil Soorani, a 
Santa Monica psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said seized checks indicated that L.A. Management received $1,000 
from Paul; $6,750 from Alpern; $5,000 from Harewood, and $4,750 from Soorani. 
Alpern was charged with six counts of making illegal payments, while Paul was 
charged with three counts. Harewood and Soorani were each charged with one 
count. 
</P>
<P>
 California law prohibits doctors from paying for referrals on a per-patient 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews Tuesday, the doctors denied paying any illegal kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Harewood said he paid L.A. Management only to collect unpaid bills. Attorneys 
for Alpern and Soorani said those doctors used L.A. Management purely for 
advertising purposes. Referral firms commonly place physicians names' in 
directories and other listings of medical services, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a form of advertising where no one is harmed and patients are 
helped," said Leonard Levine, Soorani's attorney. "The more access they have to 
doctors, the better their chances of getting the best care." 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy City Atty. Ruth Kwan, head of the city attorney's consumer 
protection unit, said that some checks made out by the doctors to L.A. 
Management bore notations "specifically relating to patients that were 
referred." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the search warrant and affidavits in the case, investigators are 
also looking into whether L.A. Management committed insurance fraud by 
illegally inflating doctors' bills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the alleged scheme, physicians and clinics represented by the firm sent 
it bills after examining patients. L.A. Management then allegedly inflated the 
medical charges and passed along the higher bill to third-party administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 The higher charge ultimately would be paid by employers. An affidavit said 
L.A. Management added from $350 to $1,200 to bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also are probing how L.A. Management got its business from 
administrators. Authorities said they are specifically trying to determine if 
L.A. Management paid kickbacks to the administrators, any of their employees, 
or any of the employers and insurers the administrators serve. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, the four doctors face up to one year in jail and/or a $10,000 
fine per count.

REVISION OF L.A. SEWER FEES URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to complaints from San Fernando Valley residents, Los Angeles City 
Councilman Hal Bernson called on city officials Tuesday to reevaluate how they 
calculate sewer service fees and devise a more equitable formula. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is no way to gauge how much sewage each business and home puts 
into the city's sewer systems, the sewer service fee is based on the amount of 
water used, assuming that most of the water is returned to the sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bernson said the assumption is often wrong, particularly for Valley 
residents with large lots who put most of their water into gardens, orchards 
and lawns and not into the sewer system. In hot climates, more water is spent 
outdoors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest grievance I hear in my community is about our inequitable system 
of sewer services charges," he said. "People believe this is highway robbery 
and they are mad as hell about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson has asked that city officials consider revising the formula to provide 
a break for water customers with large lots that are located in hot climates. 
</P>
<P>
 The formula proposed by Bernson would mirror a formula being considered by 
city officials for calculating water rates. 
</P>
<P>
 A citizens committee appointed by Mayor Richard Riordan has suggested that the 
city's Department of Water and Power provide breaks for customers with large 
lots in hot climates. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson asked that city engineers and utility officials study his proposal and 
draft a report for the council within 90 days.

INSPECTOR IS SENTENCED FOR FALSIFYING QUAKE CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first of four building inspectors charged with falsifying inspection 
reports after the Northridge earthquake pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 
three years probation, 200 hours of community service and ordered to pay $5,100 
restitution, the U.S. attorney's office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis Hawkins, 36, of Moreno Valley, was working for Vulcan Disaster 
Services, which contracted with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to 
inspect the damages suffered by those who had filed disaster assistance claims. 
</P>
<P>
 For between $30 and $40 per inspection, Hawkins was supposed to personally 
inspect the damaged home and verify the identity of the applicant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hawkins later admitted to authorities that she never inspected the damage 
of between 10 and 20 applicants and made up the information in her reports, 
according to Assistant U.S. Atty. Nathan Hochman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins was originally charged with falsifying six reports but pleaded guilty 
in July to one of those charges. Her attorney was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would have to drive from the Moreno Valley into the San Fernando Valley 
to conduct the inspections and after a while, it just wasn't worth it to her to 
make that drive," Hochman said. "It was easier to just falsify the numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence, handed down Monday, was for falsifying the report on a Mission 
Hills home. In it, Hawkins detailed $6,600 damage to the homeowners' vacuum 
cleaner, washer, refrigerator and kitchen range. None of those items, however, 
was in need of repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Although in some cases, Hawkins approved more money than people actually 
needed, in other cases, her failure to inspect homes deprived disaster victims 
of entitled funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four inspectors charged with submitting false reports, one other has 
also pleaded guilty and awaits sentencing, Hochman said.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 people have been charged with submitting false claims; 29 have 
pleaded guilty, Hochman said. Sentences for those applicants have ranged from 
several hundred hours of community service to six months in jail, Hochman said.

 A convenience store clerk shot an armed robber and scared off his accomplice 
Tuesday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men, one armed with a semiautomatic pistol, came into the Arrowhead Market 
in the 600 block of West Avenue J about 6:45 p.m. and ordered store clerk 
Manhal Samaan, 30, to give them all of the store's money, Deputy Jeff Cannon of 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Samaan reached under the counter for his own handgun and shot one robber, 
Cannon said. Both robbers then fled the store. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, Christian George, 18, of Lancaster, came to Antelope 
Valley Hospital Medical Center with a bullet wound in his chest, Cannon said. 
Deputies arrested George on suspicion of attempted robbery. He was listed in 
critical condition at the hospital. The investigation is continuing, Cannon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber's gun was found at the store, Cannon said. The second robber was 
still at large, Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Samaan was not injured. JEANNETTE REGALADO

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COURT 
REJECTS APPEAL BY EX-LAPD OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court declined Monday to hear an appeal by an ex-assistant 
Los Angeles police chief who sued the city over an investigation into whether 
his religious beliefs affected his job performance.  
</P>
<P>
 Robert Vernon, an elder in Sun Valley's Grace Community Church, said the 1991 
Police Commission-ordered probe hindered his ability to practice his religion. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in charge of the Los Angeles Police Department's Office of Operations 
under former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates from 1978 to June, 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am very disappointed that the court declined to hear my case, where my 
career and reputation were destroyed by religious bigotry," Vernon said in a 
statement released by his attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Attorney David Casterline said "the Supreme Court's declination to grant a 
review sets a dangerous precedent affecting all public employees and religious 
persons."  
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said the nation's highest 
court validated the decision to look into the allegations about Vernon.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; BEREAL 
ELECTED PRESIDENT OF NAACP BRANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles (Buddy) Bereal, a 48-year-old youth worker, has been elected president 
of the Pasadena branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a counselor with Community Youth Gang Services, an anti-gang program 
operated by Los Angeles County, Bereal will head the 750-member NAACP branch 
for two years beginning in January. 
</P>
<P>
 He received about 90% of the votes cast by members Sunday at the Jackie 
Robinson Center in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Pasadena city employee, Bereal in 1975 filed a discrimination lawsuit 
against the city that resulted in an overhaul of hiring policies, enabling more 
blacks and Latinos to gain entry-level jobs in police, fire and skilled trades. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the city's police and fire departments were cited in an American 
Civil Liberties Union study as being the most ethnically and gender diverse in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena branch of the NAACP began in 1919. It has an office in the 
Japanese Cultural Institute in Pasadena and a yearly operating budget of nearly 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of 22,000 branches nationwide of the 85-year-old civil rights 
organization.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 TEEN-AGERS HELD AFTER BOMBS FOUND IN 
MAILBOXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two teen-agers have been arrested on suspicion of placing "acid bombs" in two 
mailboxes, causing a resident to suffer minor burns when caustic fluid from one 
of the homemade devices spilled on her, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The plastic bottle filled with acid and nestled in smoldering trash apparently 
was designed to make the mailbox explode but malfunctioned, said Sgt. Noel 
Lanier of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear whether the other acid bomb -- discovered Sunday in the same 
Sand Canyon neighborhood -- detonated as planned, but no one was injured, 
Lanier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews in the area, where homes are separated by lots several acres in 
size, led to the arrests Monday night of Jason Michael Kenney 18, and a 
15-year-old who was not identified because he is a juvenile. Both youths live 
about half a mile from the vandalized mailboxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenney was in custody Tuesday at the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station in 
lieu of $500,000 bail, Lanier said. A deputy at the station said Kenney is 
scheduled to be arraigned today in Newhall Municipal Court on felony charges of 
making and possessing an explosive device. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old is in custody at San Fernando Juvenile Hall, according to 
sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured woman, 53-year-old Susan Williamson, suffered first-degree burns 
on her legs but declined to be treated at a hospital. She said she was hurt 
when she returned home from work about noon Monday to check her mail and 
instead discovered a crumpled soft-drink bottle that oozed yellow liquid as she 
removed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I stood there, my pantyhose disintegrated," Williamson said. "It was 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The liquid caused a tingling sensation, but was not painful, Williamson said. 
She said she used a nearby garden hose to wash down her reddened legs several 
times, declining suggestions from paramedics that she seek medical help. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the acid bomb spread quickly among neighbors, Lanier said, and 
investigators soon learned of the other device found a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators do not know why the bombs were placed in the 
mailboxes, or whether the people who found them were intentionally targeted, 
Lanier added. 
</P>
<P>
 Acid bombs typically consist of a weak acid liquid placed in a container and 
mixed with other substances, Lanier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Depending on the temperature, they may explode immediately," he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MURDER RETRIAL STARTS FOR MARTIAL ARTS 
INSTRUCTOR; COURTS: PROSECUTOR TELLS JURORS IN NEW CASE PROCEEDING THAT 
PERSONAL JEALOUSY WAS MOTIVE IN TAE KWON DO STAR'S SLAYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Canyon Country martial arts expert strangled a rival co-worker, dumped her 
partially clothed body along a Santa Clarita roadside and then lied to police 
about his location on the night of the killing, a prosecutor alleged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations began the retrial of Stuart Edward Milburn, 28, who is charged 
with killing 29-year-old Veronica Estrada as she walked home last December from 
the Canyon Country tae kwon do studio where they both taught. Milburn's first 
trial, also in Los Angeles Superior Court, ended in a hung jury in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz, who has contended that Milburn killed Estrada 
out of personal jealousy, told jurors Tuesday during opening statements in the 
retrial that three separate motorists have placed Milburn near the scene of the 
slaying on Soledad Canyon Road around the time Estrada is believed to have been 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when you hear all the facts . . . you'll come to the conclusion that 
Stuart Milburn killed Veronica Estrada," Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada, who was one of the American Taekwondo Assn.'s top-ranked female 
competitors, was a promising prospect to win an upcoming world championship, 
Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Milburn held no titles and had failed to garner similar 
accolades for his martial arts accomplishments, Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Darryl Mounger disputed the prosecutor's claims, telling 
jurors that a witness will testify that she saw Milburn place a Christmas card 
in her gym bag at the tae kwon do studio around the time Estrada was strangled. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the times and you look at the credibility of the witnesses . 
. . I'm sure at the end of this case you will find that Mr. Milburn is 
innocent," Mounger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn's father, Stuart H. Milburn, a retired 27-year veteran of the Los 
Angeles Police Department, was the first witness to testify and is expected to 
continue his testimony today. In an interview outside the courtroom, Milburn 
maintained that his son is innocent and said prosecutors lack physical evidence 
to place his son at the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "All evidence shows he is innocent," Milburn said of his son. "He was never 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The body of Estrada, who had been named instructor of the year at Taekwondo 
USA in Canyon Country where she and Milburn both taught, was discovered last 
Dec. 16 in heavy brush along Soledad Canyon Road. Police said she had been 
strangled and sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 The first trial in the case ended with only eight of 12 jurors voting to 
convict Milburn of first-degree murder. However, Milburn was acquitted of a 
forcible sodomy charge and later some of the jurors said they considered the 
prosecution's evidence to be weak.

MIKE PENNER: MCNALL IS FOREVER INDEBTED TO HIS GOLD-PLATED CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We should be grateful, one supposes, for any hockey news that lands on the 
front page of the sports section these days. 
</P>
<P>
 But this? 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce McNall, agreeing to plead guilty to federal charges that he defrauded 
banks for than $236 million before and during his tenure as owner and president 
of the Kings? 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce McNall -- who not too long ago was the most powerful man in hockey, who 
brought both Gary Bettman and the Mighty Ducks into the NHL (for better or 
worse) as chairman of the league's board of governors -- facing a maximum 
prison term of 45 years? 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers boggle the mind. 
</P>
<P>
 At $50 million per NHL franchise, McNall allegedly defrauded enough money to 
buy nearly five teams. That's almost a whole new division. Imagine such a 
new-look NHL, complete with Northeast, Central, Atlantic, Pacific and Lompoc 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 And 45 years? On paper, that would take inmate McNall to the year 2040. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the Kings have won the Stanley Cup by then? 
</P>
<P>
 Will the NHL have played a game by then? 
</P>
<P>
 Realistically, McNall probably faces a sentence between five and nine years, 
and after all the legal outflanking and recircling is complete, it could shrink 
even further. 
</P>
<P>
 But what lies ahead for McNall is not half as significant as what he has left 
behind -- a 10-year trail of deceit and chicanery, according to federal 
prosecutors, that casts a pall over everything McNall accomplished and 
attempted to accomplish in hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall brought Wayne Gretzky to Los Angeles. Yes, he did, but by what means 
and to what end? Along with several players and draft picks, McNall threw $15 
million into the pot to complete the Gretzky trade in August of 1988. You 
wonder about those $15 million now. Was a sham company propped up to serve as 
pseudo-collateral for a loan McNall otherwise could not qualify for? Were those 
funds diverted from another McNall holding that would hit the canvas in 
bankruptcy court, leaving so many creditors empty-handed? 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky himself was collateral. Was the most sensational transaction in NHL 
history simply another way for McNall to trump up his portfolio? McNall the 
coin collector often stated that he who owns the most valuable coin holds the 
power in the market. The same principle applies to hockey. In Gretzky, McNall 
had the most valuable hockey player in the world. And that enabled McNall to 
make friends, impress potential clients and influence bank loan officers. 
</P>
<P>
 If Gretzky happened to make the Kings Smythe Division contenders in the 
process, well, talk about your happy byproducts. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall used Gretzky. Befriended him, trotted him out at cocktail parties, 
talked him into recycling some of those huge paychecks into buddy-buddy joint 
business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall and Gretzky bought football teams together, $450,000 baseball cards 
together, million-dollar race horses together. And, when McNall needed to use 
one of those horses as collateral in 1991, court papers assert that McNall told 
the bank he owned "100%" of the horse, when Gretzky was actually in for 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall and his executives allegedly did this without Gretzky's knowledge, 
meaning they deceived Gretzky. In the 18-car pileup of charges facing McNall, 
this amounts to little more than a scratch. But the gall involved is 
overwhelming -- trying to slip one past the most revered name in the game in 
order to plug one leak in a rapidly cracking empire. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall made the Mighty Ducks possible. You know the fable: McNall and Michael 
Eisner are pals, McNall talks Eisner into investing in the NHL, McNall clears 
the way for expansion into Orange County and everybody lives happily ever 
after, to the tune of 17,174 a night at The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey in Anaheim generally has been a good thing -- at least when there was 
hockey in Anaheim -- but McNall's motives here were less than purely 
altruistic. 
</P>
<P>
 By late 1992, when the Ducks were born, McNall was badly strapped for cash. 
Put an expansion team in the next county, less than 40 miles away, and -- 
presto! -- a mammoth indemnity fee is headed for the McNall coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, McNall received $25 million for his part in the creation of 
the Ducks, the largest indemnification in league history. The Ducks are to pay 
the entire amount over a period of years, but again, collateral is collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 (At present, the note is held by Bank of America, which suffered losses of at 
least $40 million in its dealings with McNall.) 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Ducks are here because the Minnesota North Stars are not. Stars 
owner Norm Green originally wanted to move his team to Anaheim before the 
1993-94 season, but McNall, then chairman of the board of governors, talked him 
into a detour to Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because McNall preferred an expansion team in Anaheim, bringing that $50 
million expansion fee with it. That way McNall gets richer, the board of 
governors gets richer, everybody's back gets scratched. 
</P>
<P>
 Except Minnesota, as close as it gets in this country to Canadian hockey 
culture, loses its major league hockey team. Disgraceful, yes, but a small 
price to pay if it keeps McNall, the man who was essentially running the league 
then, afloat for another 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 This was around the same time McNall was brokering a commissionership for 
Bettman. Look where that's gotten us. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, Bettman and McNall were going to drag hockey by its cauliflower ears 
into the '90s, and, sure enough, they have succeeded. Work stoppages, 
bankruptcy proceedings, plea bargains, pending prison terms -- yep, everything 
about the sport is up to date. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly a decade, we have wanted to believe that McNall was good for 
hockey. McNall wants us to believe it still. Hasn't Gretzky been great? Haven't 
the Ducks been fun? Didn't we get a charge out of the Kings' playoff run in 
'93? 
</P>
<P>
 Even giving McNall that much, in light of the evidence now before us, one more 
question must be asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it worth it?

ANAHEIM GROUP CONSIDERING NEW STRATEGY TO SATISFY RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County group trying to keep the Rams in Southern California will 
consider revising its strategy following a Tuesday meeting in which club 
President John Shaw re-emphasized the team's desire for a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of a proposal by the Save the Rams task force has been a $60 
million renovation of Anaheim Stadium, converting it from multipurpose to a 
football-only facility. But a remodeled Big A might not be enough to keep the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still view Anaheim as one of our alternatives, but a new facility is a 
high priority for us, and we're still striving to accomplish that," said Shaw, 
who met for 2 1/2 hours with Save the Rams co-chairman Leigh Steinberg at Rams 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said he stressed to Shaw that a remodeled stadium would include many 
of the revenue-producing perks that St. Louis and Baltimore are offering with 
new facilities -- upgraded luxury suites that would command a higher price, the 
conversion of the view level into an exclusive club level and the lowering of 
the field to improve sight lines and create more premium, lower-level seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we'll have to take another look at this issue," Steinberg said. "John 
emphasized that (a new stadium) is really important." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said he will continue to press NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue about 
the league's possible investment in a Los Angeles-area stadium project, an idea 
Tagliabue floated in October. Hollywood Park and Long Beach have been mentioned 
as potential sites, and Steinberg has been promoting Anaheim and its plan to 
create a sports/entertainment corridor around the existing stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But a new, football-only stadium might not fit into Anaheim's master sports 
plan. When the Angels last summer made overtures of exploring other options 
unless a new baseball stadium was built, Save the Rams came up with a plan it 
believed would appease both franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Its recommendation: Build the baseball stadium, at a cost of about $100 
million, and transform Anaheim Stadium into a football-only facility for $60 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 A new football stadium could cost between $160 million and $200 million. 
Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said the city would consider building one as long as the 
project would not require ongoing public funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's no annual public subsidy, if there was enough private-sector 
interest in trying to pay for it, I think it could be possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the stadium renovation, Save the Rams has promised the Rams a 
$50-million infusion of cash through the purchase of a minority interest in the 
team, a new $12-million practice facility, sales of 45,000 season tickets and 
the income from approximately 100 luxury boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 When the question of how the group will back its proposal arose Tuesday, 
Steinberg said he told Shaw that if the Rams stay, he will give the team a 
check for the amount of 45,000 season tickets and all the luxury boxes -- an 
estimated $18 million to $20 million -- before the start of training camp next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said area businesses will be heavily involved in such guarantees, 
but he would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he has taken the view "that anything they are offering could 
ultimately be supported," but guarantees weren't a major part of Tuesday's 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg, who said his long-standing request to meet with Ram owner Georgia 
Frontiere "was taken under advisement" by Shaw Tuesday, said he remains 
encouraged that Orange County has a chance to keep the Rams, despite rumors 
that a deal already has been struck with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer this process continues, the stronger we grow in Orange County," he 
said. "We're still in the ballgame."

FLYING IN FORMATION; QUARTERBACK O'NEIL NO LONGER BELIEVES HE NEEDS TO BE 
SUPERDUCK TO WIN AT OREGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAUM, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Watching his Oregon teammates upset USC without him seven weeks ago, Danny 
O'Neil decided it was time to give up the role of Superduck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to be the offense earlier in the year, thinking I had to perform 
for us to win," said O'Neil, former Mater Dei quarterback. "Then when I saw us 
win at USC without me, I thought I really didn't need to be the hero each week. 
I'm just letting it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 And what a happening it's been. Oregon has won five consecutive to climb to 
No. 12 in the national rankings, its highest since 1964. A victory Saturday at 
Oregon State will clinch the Ducks' first Rose Bowl appearance in 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon and O'Neil seemed headed nowhere three games into this season. The 
Ducks were 1-2 and the losses, to Hawaii and Utah, were ugly. Although Oregon 
did come back to beat Iowa, O'Neil was far off the form of his junior season in 
1993, when he threw for a school-record 3,224 yards and 22 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, he came down with an infected finger and missed the 
game at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup Tony Graziani led the Ducks to a stunning 22-7 upset, their first 
victory over the Trojans in Los Angeles since 1971. That game looms large in 
retrospect. If Oregon and Southern Cal finish 7-1 in the Pac-10, Oregon will go 
to the Rose Bowl because of that victory. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil traces the Ducks' turnaround to that Oct. 1 afternoon in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure what happened, but it seems like the team said, 'It just doesn't 
matter. Let's win.' It showed this team could definitely play some good 
football," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil didn't exactly catch fire after that, either. He was supposed to sit 
out the Washington State game, but had to play when Graziani was injured and 
wound up throwing 17 consecutive incompletions in a 21-7 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week, he was solid in a 23-7 victory over California. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fans still booed the four-year starter at every opportunity, labeling 
him the quarterback who couldn't come through in the clutch, who had never 
brought a team from behind in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the upsets over Washington and Arizona, when O'Neil rallied the 
Ducks on consecutive weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed all four passes on a 98-yard scoring drive that put Oregon ahead 
for good against Washington and passed 15 yards to Josh Wilcox for the only 
touchdown in the 10-9 victory over Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most of the attention went to Oregon's "Gang Green" defense, and the 
offense noticed. The last two weeks, against Arizona State and Stanford, the 
Ducks took to the air for 89 points. In those two games, O'Neil has thrown for 
573 yards. He has had no interceptions in the last three games. In the last six 
quarters, he's thrown nine touchdown passes, raising his total to a 
conference-leading 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got tired of just scraping by and understood that if we want to be a great 
team, a Rose Bowl team, we've got to have a Rose Bowl offense, not just a Rose 
Bowl defense," O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
 The return of favorite receiver Cristin McLemore, a former Marina High star, 
has helped. After missing two games because of a sprained right ankle, McLemore 
returned against Arizona and caught three of O'Neil's six touchdown passes in 
last week's 55-21 rout of Stanford. McLemore, a junior, holds the Oregon record 
for touchdown receptions with 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some special chemistry," O'Neil said. "We're just on the same page. 
We understand what each other is thinking."

MEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW / THE MASTER'S; OATES TRYING TO EXTEND MASTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So what does Bill Oates, the second-year men's basketball coach at The 
Master's College, do for an encore? 
</P>
<P>
 How about guide his team to a victory or two in the NAIA Division I 
tournament? The new season begins tonight at home against Walla Walla (Wash.) 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 During his initial season at the school, Oates directed the Mustangs to a 28-5 
record and their first appearance in the NAIA championships, where they lost to 
Georgia Southwestern, 98-86, in the first round in Tulsa, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Emeka Okenwa, the team's leading scorer (17.1 average) and rebounder 
(9.8) and point guard Andy Thompson (10.2 points and a team-high 7.3 assists) 
were lost to graduation. But Oates has a solid nucleus. Six players return from 
last season's eight-man rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to the mix two junior college transfers and an improved reserve who saw 
limited action last season and Master's should have plenty of depth. 
Nonetheless, Oates does not appear to be concerned with topping -- or even 
matching -- last year's accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really not concerned about measuring ourselves against last year," he 
said. "We just want to get this team's players to complement each other so they 
can play well together this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Forwards James Mosley (6-foot-3 junior) and Matt Kordik (6-6 junior), center 
Leo Gorauskas (6-9 sophomore), and guards Doug Leaman (6-2 senior) and Mike 
Penberthy (6-2 sophomore) are expected to start tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley (15.9 ppg), Leaman (11.6) and Penberthy (9.9) are the team's leading 
returning scorers. Each shot 43% or better from three-point range last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorauskas averaged 5.7 points and 3.6 rebounds, and Kordik averaged 18 points 
and seven rebounds for Rancho Santiago College. Rogerio Soares, a 6-6 senior 
forward, averaged 6.5 points a game for the Mustangs last season, and Matt 
Ratzlaff, a 6-7 senior forward, averaged 4.3 points. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mosley (no relation to James), a 6-foot junior guard, is a transfer from 
East Los Angeles College. Senior Colin Lubsey, a 6-5 forward who averaged 6.9 
points and 4.7 rebounds per game as a starter last season, will not join the 
team until January because he has only one semester of eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 When he transferred from Creighton to Master's in the spring of 1993, Lubsey 
had only three semesters of eligibility left. "I think we'll definitely be a 
better ballclub in the second half of the season when we get Colin back," Oates 
said. "But we're going to need to develop early on or we could be in trouble 
with the schedule we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Bakersfield, two-time defending NCAA Division II champion, and 
traditionally strong NAIA teams Azusa Pacific, Westmont and Biola are all on 
the Mustangs' schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific and Westmont advanced to the second round of the NAIA tournament 
in March. Biola lost to Master's, 93-80, in the final of the NAIA Far West 
Region Independents tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Far West Region Independents winner receives an automatic berth in the 
NAIA tournament.

PROPOSITION 187 PROMPTS WBC TO BAN TITLE FIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The World Boxing Council, based in Mexico City, announced Tuesday it would ban 
title fights in California through at least March 30 to protest the recent 
passage of Proposition 187, which if enforced would cut off education, welfare 
and non-emergency medical aid to the state's estimated 1.7 million illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the government of California is doing is the same thing (as South 
Africa) -- racism," WBC President Jose Sulaiman said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Sulaiman said Mexican boxers who fight in California during the boycott would 
be sanctioned and added that the WBC position would be reviewed after March, at 
which time the ban might be extended. 
</P>
<P>
 The WBC is the biggest of the several bodies that organize international 
boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 Implementing the boycott may be moot. The two WBC champions the ban would 
likely affect, light flyweight champion Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez and junior 
lightweight title holder Gabriel Ruelas, do not figure to defend their titles 
in California before March 30. CHRIS DUFRESNE

BOYS' BASKETBALL '94-'95: EMPIRE LEAGUE; CONSISTENCY IS VITAL TO KATELLA'S 
SUCCESS; BASKETBALL: DANLEY EXPECTS THIS QUALITY IN EVERYTHING FROM CLAYTON'S 
INTENSITY TO THE KNIGHTS' LEVEL OF PLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LaByron Clayton and his Katella teammates have Coach Tom Danley excited, and 
that's not an easy thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Danley has coached at Katella for 28 years and the Knights have been to the 
playoffs 26 times. Last season, Danley won his 500th game, but offered only a 
mild response to the milestone victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of attrition and age," Danley said after the game. "Five 
hundred wins just says I'm getting old." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning isn't getting old for Danley. The Knights pushed his record to 514-211 
last season, and Clayton and a host of talented returning players have the 
coach thinking of a championship season for the Knights this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton is one reason for this optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton, a 6-foot-5 senior, is a dynamic, athletic player who earned 
second-team All-Empire League honors last season. He averaged 12.4 points and 
showed he was able to dominate a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "LaByron is capable of being an impact player," Danley said. "He reminds me of 
Dan Wright, who played for us in the early 1980s. He was only 6-4, but could 
dominate a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wright had great leaping ability and he knew how to intimidate opponents by 
just playing hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Danley hopes Clayton's intensity is consistent this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want him to pick his spots, but consistency will be a key," Danley said. 
"We want to see the effort game in and game out." 
</P>
<P>
 That was something Danley didn't see last year -- from Clayton or the rest of 
the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it was, but we didn't feel like a team," Clayton said. 
"Everyone went their separate ways last year. But we're a lot better this year. 
Everyone is more together. Everybody is on the same track." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin eliminated Katella from the second round of the Southern Section 
Division II-A playoffs last season, but the Knights' early exit helped motivate 
them this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The summer went well," Clayton said. "I think we only lost three of 26 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 But Danley wasn't completely satisfied with his team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "In summer league, the kids got ripped a couple times," Danley said. "There 
were times when we should have won by 15 points but it was close because we 
weren't playing to our potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to maintain our intensity." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the intensity Clayton showed against Los Alamitos, which won the Empire 
League last season with league MVPs Ryan Staniec and Tim Lin. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I dunked on Staniec in one of the Los Al games," Clayton said. "That was 
one of my favorite moments." 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton hopes he'll have a few more moments like that this season. 
</P>
<P>
 After living in various parts of the country, Clayton has found a home in 
Orange County. He is the youngest of four children, and the family has stayed 
in Anaheim for the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom has had to move around because of her job as a nurse," Clayton said. 
"I was born in Wisconsin, but I've also lived in Gary, Ind., Reno, even a small 
town in Mississippi. I loved Reno because it was a 24-hour town, but we lived 
in a real small town in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't just go around the corner to a store to find what you needed. 
But it made me more appreciative for for what I have now." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he has a drive to go to college, a goal Danley said is within reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "College coaches are sending me letters, but I'm not really that excited about 
it," Clayton said. "Don't get me wrong, I like it, but we're trying to get 
ready for the season and win the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Coach Danley isn't always teaching us about basketball. I've learned a 
lot about life from him." 1993-94 IN REVIEW

</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos won the league championship with league MVPs Tim Lin and Ryan 
Staniec leading the way. Lin averaged 16.7 points and made 101 of 207 
three-pointers and Staniec averaged 16.4 points for the Griffins, who advanced 
to the Division I-AA quarterfinals under league coach of the year Steve Brooks. 
. . . Sharp-shooting guard Mike Thimgan led Esperanza, which finished second. 
The Aztecs, who also had all-league players Josh Greer and Mike Lawson, were 
eliminated in the second round of the Division I-AA playoffs by Fountain 
Valley. Esperanza and Los Alamitos have moved to the Sunset League. . . . 
All-league players Nick Roditis, LaByron Clayton and Mike Pahl helped Katella 
finish third. Knight Coach Tom Danley, in his 28th season at Katella, posted 
his 500th career victory in the Sunbird tournament at Western High. Katella 
lost to Tustin in the second round of the Division II-A playoffs. . . . Cypress 
all-league guard Derek Mitchell and the Centurions finished fourth but earned 
an at-large berth to the Division II-A playoffs. Cypress played at top-seeded 
Compton Dominguez in the first round and lost, 75-42. . . . Loara missed the 
playoffs, though guard Scott Davis, a first-team all-league selection, averaged 
21 points. First-year Coach Tim Tivenan and El Dorado struggled and tied Loara 
for fifth.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: JUDGE ITO FEEDS THE HAND HE'S BITTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Howard Rosenberg 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The following column should not be read by jurors or prospective alternate 
jurors in the Simpson-Goldman case because it could prejudice their opinions 
about the judgment of the judge. So this is what KCBS-TV Channel 2 means by 
"team coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise is that the newest member of the "Action News" team should turn 
out to be Judge Lance A. Ito, the Superior Court jurist and blistering media 
critic who on several occasions has sternly admonished some of the press for 
shabby, sensational, tabloidesque coverage of the case that finds O.J. Simpson 
about to be tried for the knifing murders of his former wife, Nicole Brown 
Simpson, and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, unpredictably, unimaginably, inconceivably, here come de judge. Ito's 
taped appearances this week as an affable interview subject on "Action News" at 
11 p.m. (they started Sunday) delivers quite a different message from the one 
the public is accustomed to hearing from him in the courtroom. If you can't 
suppress 'em, join 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 To put it another way, there's an ancient Japanese word that describes 
anti-polluter Ito's decision to appear on Channel 2 this week and merge himself 
with the polluters: chutzpah . 
</P>
<P>
 The interview of the century with the judge of the century regarding the trial 
of the century on the Los Angeles television station of the century? Oh, stow 
it! This was nothing more than typical hype of the century from "Action News," 
which on Monday night fit Ito and Arnold Schwarzenegger into the same newscast. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In other times, Ito's chatty sit-down with worshipful anchor Tritia Toyota 
("They have to be very proud of you," she commented to the judge about his 
parents Monday night) would have come and gone without comment, just one more 
November ratings sweeps trifle barely admissible as news. Yet as someone who 
has publicly pronounced his contempt for some of the press -- at one point even 
speaking of possibly "terminating the media coverage of this case" -- Ito's 
curious partnership with Channel 2 has him exchanging judicial garb for the 
robes of a hypocrite. You'd think that he was taking lessons from Michael 
Jackson or Tom and Roseanne by using for self-aggrandizement the very media he 
complains about. 
</P>
<P>
 If he were to favor any television news operation with his presence, you'd 
think he'd offer himself to one with a better record. Heading the list would be 
"The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" on PBS, just about the only newscast anywhere not 
to have shrilly exploited this case in one fashion or another. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, by agreeing to be interviewed on Channel 2 by Toyota (they're old 
pals, former Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Robert Philibosian said on ABC's 
"Nightline" Monday), Ito is rewarding a station whose coverage of the 
Simpson-Goldman case has at times been among the city's most frantic and 
irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about your controversies. Why, "Action News" hasn't received such 
attention regarding this case since it broke -- and failed to correct -- the 
erroneous blockbuster that shortly after the murders of his ex-wife and 
Goldman, O.J. Simpson had taken a bloody golf bag with him on a flight to 
Chicago. Or was it the time, more recently, that "Action News" was forced to 
apologize on the air for erroneously reporting -- and repeatedly swearing on a 
stack of Bibles -- that Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark had likely compromised 
much of the prosecution's case by an appearance she made at O.J. Simpson's 
Brentwood estate during an early search of the house and grounds?  
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that not only was Channel 2 way off about the time of Clark's 
appearance, but it also had vastly overstated the implications even if she had 
arrived at the Simpson place when it said she did. 
</P>
<P>
 So . . . this is the station that Ito has selected for his "exclusive" 
interview debut, rewarding it for past reporting indiscretions matched in this 
case only by the sometimes shoddy work of KNBC-TV Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, he's boosted Channel 2 during the sweeps, one of those four 
months a year of intense audience measurement that help set advertising rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dribbled out like a trail of bread crumbs for viewers to follow, Ito's 
interview has been deployed as a sort of sweeps serial, accompanied by the 
inevitable gaudy promotion, ranging from full-page newspaper ads to on-air 
glorifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Channel 2 has shrewdly used the Ito interview to juice its 11 p.m. 
newscast, an especially critical half hour because of its position preceding 
"Late Show With David Letterman." Theoretically, the better the 11 p.m. 
newscast does in the ratings, the more viewers it delivers to the Letterman 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 The in-house verdict on the Ito appearances from ever-prim 11 p.m. anchor Ann 
Martin, who always sounds as if she's doing the news with a teacup balanced on 
her knee? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's wonderful to hear a little more from our judges," Martin said 
after Monday's Ito segment, in which he continued to speak of his roots while 
also modestly insisting that he was a "flash in the pan" compared to Joseph A. 
Wapner, the former jurist made famous by the syndicated "People's Court." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing for sure, the impatient Wapner would have ruled Toyota out of order 
Monday for going back on the pledge she said she made to Ito not to broach the 
Simpson-Goldman proceedings with him. "So what is in this envelope?" she asked 
about the oft-discussed mysterious manila container that Simpson defender 
Robert Shapiro turned over to the court some time ago. Ito good-naturedly said 
he didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the controversy over his Channel 2 stardom predictably continued to 
swirl, with even "Nightline" weighing in Monday as a measure of just how 
overblown the coverage of this case has been. With Philibosian taking Ito's 
side, defense attorney Leslie Abramson joined the second-guessers, saying Ito 
was a bit starry-eyed and "got suckered into" the interview. "He's like all of 
us, a kid inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the "kid" image may fit neither Abramson nor Ito, her criticism of 
the judge fits perfectly. By appearing on Channel 2, he has personally reopened 
the door to media overkill and has only himself to blame if the door now gets 
ripped off its hinges.

 For many rock fans, the idea of Neil Young jamming with Led Zeppelin might 
seem like an impossible dream. 
</P>
<P>
 But it could happen Jan. 12 at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, where 
both acts will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. All-star jam 
sessions often follow the gala banquet, and while there's no guarantee they'll 
play together, Young and Led Zeppelin -- who head the just-announced list of 
new inductees -- will likely be the big attractions for the 10th annual 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and Led Zeppelin were named in their first year of eligibility by a 
panel of more than 600 record executives, musicians and critics, as were Al 
Green, the Allman Brothers Band and the late Janis Joplin. The iconoclastic 
Frank Zappa, who died of cancer last year, was elected in his second year of 
eligibility as a solo artist, while Motown's Martha & the Vandellas made it in 
their seventh try. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But those who long to see Joni Mitchell and the Velvet Underground taking part 
in the celebration will be out of luck -- again. Mitchell was passed over for 
the second year, and the Velvets -- the short-lived but influential '60s group 
fronted by Lou Reed -- for the fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
 Other notable acts that were passed over include the Jackson 5 and 
Parliament-Funkadelic. Each was in its first year of eligibility, which comes 
25 years after an act's first recording. According to Hall of Fame guidelines, 
only seven acts can be voted in each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Hall of Fame voters have expressed concern that the continued exclusion 
of the Velvets and Mitchell indicates an emphasis on popular acts over less 
mainstream but artistically valued performers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inductees are all very worthy, but it's astonishing to me that Joni 
Mitchell and the Velvet Underground have been left out again," says voter Bill 
Flanagan, editor of Musician magazine. "It's shameful. . . . (It represents) a 
fairly narrow view of what constitutes rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto-born Young, who was also eligible as a member of the Buffalo 
Springfield (passed over for the fourth time this year) and will be again next 
year as part of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, has charted a singular, mercurial 
path. In the '70s he was simultaneously a top figure in the California 
folk-rock scene and a daring rocker, and at 49 he serves as a musical father 
figure for such alternative-rock forces as Pearl Jam and Sonic Youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Led Zeppelin's induction comes on the heels of the hit "No Quarter" album, 
which reunites the group's singer Robert Plant and guitarist Jimmy Page. Their 
planned tour is expected to be among next year's top attractions. The English 
group's powerful, blues-based sound and legendary debauchery formed the 
archetype of heavy metal in the late '60s and early '70s. The band's original 
lineup included bassist John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham, who died in 
1980 from asphyxiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Green, 48, was to the '70s what Otis Redding was to the '60s -- a stunning 
voice and a visionary who expanded the language of soul music by venturing into 
country and rock territory for material. At the core of his trademark Memphis 
sound was the struggle between the secular and the sacred, with the latter 
increasingly becoming his focus through the '80s and '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 When Janis Joplin died at age 27 in 1970, she was the top female singer in 
rock, known for her powerful, raspy voice and feeling for the blues, as well as 
for her brash persona and flamboyant lifestyle.  
</P>
<P>
 Georgia's Allman Brothers Band was arguably the premier instrumental ensemble 
in rock in the early '70s, with the fluid guitar work of Duane Allman and 
Dickey Betts leading soaring, blues-based excursions. The group's creativity 
dipped some after Allman's 1971 death, but the group has been a popular touring 
act in recent years. From his first albums leading the Los Angeles-based 
Mothers of Invention, Zappa made it clear that he stood apart from the rock 'n' 
roll world. He considered himself more an avant-garde composer and social 
commentator than pop musician, and his canon of complex music -- often mated 
with puerile, mocking humor -- is to many as much an embodiment of rock 
individuality as Young's. 
</P>
<P>
 Though ultimately overshadowed by the likes of the Supremes and the Four Tops, 
Martha & the Vandellas were one of Motown's first star acts, with 1964's 
"Dancing in the Streets" serving as a party anthem and, later, a call to action 
for the '60s youth culture.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hall of Fame will also honor the '40s-'50s vocal group the Orioles as an 
early influence, and former Billboard magazine editor Paul Ackerman as a 
non-performer inductee.

A STANDING OVATION FOR 'SUNSET'; 'BOULEVARD' WINS FOUR HONORS, WITH 'FOOL MOON' 
AND 'FALSETTOS' EARNING THREE EACH IN LOS ANGELES' FIRST COMPETITIVE, 
PEER-JUDGED THEATER AWARDS

 "Sunset Boulevard" took home four Ovation Awards, more than any other show, as 
the first competitive, peer-judged theater awards to cover most of Los Angeles 
County were presented in a glittery program that attracted 1,250 people to the 
Alex Theatre in Glendale Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fool Moon" and "Falsettos," both presented under Center Theatre 
Group/Ahmanson auspices at the Doolittle Theatre, took three trophies each, and 
another show from the same series, "Five Guys Named Moe," won two honors. 
Together with an award for "Carpa Clash," a Center Theatre Group show at the 
Mark Taper Forum, they gave CTG nine Ovations -- the most to a single 
production company. 
</P>
<P>
 The top winner among small theater productions was "Men on the Verge of a 
His-panic Breakdown," at the Celebration Theatre. It won an award for best 
world premiere for playwright Guillermo Reyes and also was named best play in a 
smaller theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunset Boulevard" and "Fool Moon" garnered awards for best musical and play, 
respectively, in the larger theaters. The Blank Theatre Company's revival of 
"The Fantasticks" at the Egyptian Arena Theatre was named best musical in a 
smaller theater. It was the only award that came with a cash prize -- $1,000, 
given in the memory of the late producer Franklin R. Levy by his friends and 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "The End of the Day," at the Coast Playhouse, won two awards, for costumes and 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Mariette Hartley was a last-minute replacement as emcee, filling in 
for John Larroquette, who couldn't make it because of a family emergency, 
Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Theatre LA, an organization of 123 theater companies and producers, 
has previously presented Ovations for lifetime achievement, this year's 
Ovations were the first for specific achievements -- and the first competitive 
Ovations. The period of eligibility was from September, 1993, through August, 
1994.

TUCHMAN TO LEAVE LACMA BUT RETAIN TIES TO MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maurice Tuchman -- who only a year ago won a legal battle to retain his 
longtime position as the L.A. County Museum of Art's senior curator of 
20th-Century art -- will leave the museum on Dec. 1. However, he will not sever 
connections with the institution that has employed him for 30 years or the 
department he founded. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon his official departure, Tuchman, 57, will assume the honorary title of 
senior curator emeritus of the 20th-Century art department. He also will serve 
the museum as guest curator for a major contemporary art exhibition, "Hidden in 
Plain Sight: Illusion and the Real in Recent Art." The exhibition will open at 
LACMA in 1996 and travel to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing Tuchman's change of status on Tuesday, LACMA president William 
A. Mingst praised the veteran curator for bringing distinction to the museum. 
"Maurice holds a special place in the heart of the museum. We are particularly 
grateful to him for his contributions to our collections. His creativity and 
vision have had and will continue to have a lasting impact on LACMA," Mingst 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuchman could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 A Columbia University-educated art historian and Fulbright scholar, Tuchman 
founded LACMA's 20th-Century art department in 1964 and became a high-profile 
personality in the art world. But early in 1993 -- during a tumultuous period 
when the museum suffered harsh budgetary cutbacks and Michael Shapiro briefly 
served as its director -- Tuchman was effectively demoted to a newly created 
position as senior curator of drawings. He filed suit and was reinstated last 
November as part of a confidential settlement.

TV RATINGS; 'SCARLETT' OPENS AT NO. 1 BUT ABC STILL WINS WEEKC BS' MINISERIES 
"SCARLETT" RACKED UP GOOD BUT NOT GREAT RATINGS WITH ITS FIRST INSTALLMENT 
SUNDAY NIGHT. THE DRAMA, STARRING JOANNE WHALLEY-KILMER AND TIMOTHY DALTON, 
ATTRACTED ENOUGH VIEWERS TO RANK AS THE WEEK'S TOP-RATED PROGRAM, BUT AUDIENCE

THE SEQUEL TO ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR MOVIES OF ALL TIME, "GONE WITH THE WIND." 
INDEED, FIGURES RELEASED TUESDAY BY THE A.C. NIELSEN CO. SHOWED THAT PART 1 OF 
"SCARLETT" WAS WATCHED IN ABOUT 20.4 MILLION HOMES--THE SAME NUMBER AS THE 
AVERAGE "HOME IMPROVEMENT" EPISODE THIS SEASON (ALTHOUGH THE ABC SITCOM WAS OFF 
A BIT LAST WEEK BECAUSE IT AIRED ON ELECTION NIGHT). TWO TV MOVIES ON CBS LAST 
SEASON SCORED HIGHER RATINGS. CBS' STRONG SHOWING ON SUNDAY--"60 MINUTES" AND 
"MURDER, SHE WROTE" ALSO FINISHED IN THETOP 10--WAS NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP ABC FROM

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: THE FED IS WALKING A FINE LINE WITH YEAR'S 6TH RATE 
HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board has made "cash" investments king this year by 
pumping up short-term interest rates. With Tuesday's sixth Fed rate boost of 
1994, the crown still rests easy on cash's head, many Wall Streeters say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's 0.75-point rate hike sparked instant rallies in stock and bond 
markets, but they didn't stick. Virtually all of the buying excitement faded in 
a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 By the close, the Dow industrials had lost a minuscule 3.37 points to 
3,826.36, and bond yields finished mixed, with the 30-year Treasury rate at 
8.03% from 8.07% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, stocks' and bonds' response was by far the most muted market 
reaction to any of the Fed's rate increases this year and a far cry from what 
transpired when the central bank last raised rates on Aug. 16. That day, the 
Dow index jumped 24 points and the 30-year T-bond yield tumbled from 7.50% to 
7.36%. 
</P>
<P>
 After six rate hikes -- the previous two or three of which were widely and 
wrongly hailed on Wall Street as the Fed's "last" for a while -- many investors 
now are understandably reluctant to view the latest increase as some kind of 
watershed. 
</P>
<P>
 Having underestimated the strength of the economy for most of this year and 
the Fed's response to it, it's difficult for most veteran investors to believe 
that Tuesday's rate boost was the final one in this economic cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, rates have reached levels that, in theory, should begin to 
have a meaningfully restraining effect on the economy -- and therefore on 
investors' fears of significantly higher future inflation and interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Fed -- and the rest of us -- are lucky, the outcome will be a 
moderately growing economy in 1995. But if Chairman Alan Greenspan and his 
cohorts have overdone it, the surprise could be that recession will become the 
next big worry. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the best strategy for individual investors at this point? Here's a look 
at prospects for bonds, stocks and money market investments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bonds: Narrowing the spread. Most economists had expected the Fed to raise 
rates half a point Tuesday, so the 0.75-point boost clearly caught the market 
somewhat off guard. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Fed putting more serious upward pressure on short rates to rein in 
the economy, investors immediately adjusted other short- and intermediate-term 
yields accordingly. The yield on the two-year Treasury note jumped to 7.10% 
from 7.03% on Monday. Even five-year T-note yields rose, to 7.68% from 7.64%. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, longer-term bond yields dipped or held steady. The result: a 
further "flattening" of the so-called yield curve. That is, the spread between 
short-term interest rates and long-term rates continued to narrow Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in 1993, 30-year T-bonds yielded three points more than two-year notes 
(7.21% versus 4.20%). On Tuesday, that spread fell to just under one point 
(8.03% versus 7.10%). 
</P>
<P>
 What's the message in a narrowing yield spread? Some Wall Streeters say it's a 
sign that the market increasingly believes the Fed will be successful in 
engineering a slowdown in the economy that keeps inflation low. "It tells you 
that what the Fed wants to happen may be happening," says Stan Nabi, strategist 
at Bessemer Trust in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 If the market believed that the economy and inflation were poised to roar in 
1995, long-term bond yields might still be rising as rapidly as short-term 
yields. Instead, even though long yields have jumped this year, the pace of 
increase hasn't kept up with short yields, especially since summer. 
</P>
<P>
 That is bolstering some market players' hopes that long-term yields are 
nearing a peak for this economic cycle -- which could finally begin to draw 
buyers back to long bonds. Yet many pros still advise approaching the bond 
market with caution. Nibbling is OK; huge bets aren't wise. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Flanagan, economist at Dean Witter Reynolds, says the best the long end 
of the market can expect is some stability for awhile, but not a sharp decline 
in yields. Typically, long yields fall dramatically only when the Fed finally 
begins to cut short rates again. And notably on Tuesday, the Fed made no 
reference to this rate hike possibly being the last -- the unfortunate comment 
that Greenspan optimistically allowed in August. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks: Mostly a lose-lose proposition? No surprise that stocks quickly sold 
off after the brief post-rate-hike rally at midday Tuesday, many Wall Streeters 
say. With short-term interest rates at their highest levels in more than three 
years, the stock market is increasingly finding itself wedging deeper between 
the proverbial rock and hard place. 
</P>
<P>
 If the market fantasizes that Tuesday's Fed rate boost might be the final one, 
the conclusion that naturally follows has to be that the economy is slowing -- 
a problem for corporate earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
 If the market figures the Fed isn't nearly done raising short rates, the 
competition for investors' dollars from money market accounts and bank CDs (let 
alone bonds) will only become more intense. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the last Fed rate increase, in August, the stock market overall has gone 
nowhere. But under the surface, investors have been dumping the industries that 
suffer first from a bona fide economic slowdown, while hunting for industries 
whose growth may not depend on the economy generally. That's a stock-picker's 
game -- which means it's possible to make money in the market today, but not 
without great effort.

QUINCY JONES-LED GROUP FORMING TV JOINT VENTURE; ENTERTAINMENT: DEAL WITH 
TRIBUNE CO. MAY CREATE LARGEST MINORITY-CONTROLLED BROADCASTING COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN and JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Entertainment executive Quincy Jones, businessman and former Hall of Fame pro 
football player Willie D. Davis and other partners are expected to announce 
today that they are entering into a joint venture with Tribune Broadcasting to 
form what could become the largest minority-controlled broadcasting company in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The creation of the Jones-Tribune group, which will seek to buy TV stations in 
major markets, is the latest in a string of repercussions from Fox Television's 
unexpected move earlier this year to snatch away eight station affiliates from 
rival CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 It also comes as established broadcasters are increasingly partnering with 
minority-controlled firms in order to extend their reach beyond current Federal 
Communications Commission caps on station ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some other such ventures, however, Jones and his partners will own a 
majority interest in the venture. Other partners are said to include talk show 
host Geraldo Rivera and "Soul Train" producer and host Don Cornelius. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial details were not available, but Daily Variety reported that the new 
venture could eventually invest up to $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first stations the group is said to be purchasing is WATL-TV in 
Atlanta, currently owned and operated by Fox. The Fox station would then become 
an affiliate of fifth network WB Network, which Warner Bros. is launching in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribune, the Chicago-based media company that also owns KTLA-TV in Los 
Angeles, will have a role in launching the WB Network and has an option to 
purchase a stake in it. In addition, Jones is expected to fold his WNOL-TV in 
New Orleans into the new company. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last month, Fox Television Stations, a unit of Rupert Murdoch's News 
Corp., said it would invest up to $20 million to help form a black-owned 
station group. The new company, to be named Blackstar Communications, will buy 
TV stations and then convert them to Fox affiliates. Under current FCC 
regulations, a company is allowed to own 12 TV stations reaching 25% of the 
country, but minority-controlled broadcasters are allowed to own 14 outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC, CBS and NBC, as well as the fourth network, Fox, and the two upstart 
networks planned by Warner Bros. and Chris-Craft/Paramount, are looking for 
ways to lock up long-term affiliation agreements in the wake of the current 
upheaval in broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuffle among some of the country's biggest TV stations began last winter 
after Fox raided key CBS affiliates, triggering a domino effect of affiliation 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, in order to secure long-term affiliation contracts, the networks and 
network-affiliated station groups are investing directly in TV stations. The 
frenzy in station trading, however, has also pushed up the prices for TV 
stations, which had been depressed for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a musician and longtime hit record producer, has strong ties to Warner 
Bros. and parent company Time Warner Inc., which is a backer of his Quincy 
Jones Entertainment. He is also the executive producer of the NBC sitcom "Fresh 
Prince of Bel-Air." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, a former all-pro defensive end for the Green Bay Packers, is owner and 
president of All Pro Broadcasting Inc., a radio station group. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Renaissance Communications Corp. said Tuesday that it will buy 
KDAF-TV in Dallas from Fox TV Stations Inc. for $100 million, while selling 
KDVR-TV to Fox for $70 million. The purchase-and-swap deal is subject to FCC 
approval.TRIBUNE BROADCASTING CO

FORD IN TALKS TO SELL FRAMES FOR ELECTRIC CAR PRODUCTION; AUTOS: PLAN WITH 
CALIFORNIA FIRM COULD HELP THE COMPANY MEET THE STATE'S 1998 NO-EMISSIONS 
DEADLINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first such move among big auto makers, Ford Motor Co. disclosed Tuesday 
that it is in talks to sell car frames without the engines to U.S. Electricar, 
a Santa Rosa, Calif.-based company that converts gasoline autos to electric 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 If adopted, the plan could help Ford, the nation's No. 2 auto maker, meet all 
or part of California's 1998 deadline for electric cars. A key attraction is 
that it could give Ford credit toward meeting the tough California mandate 
without having to invest heavily in an assembly line to build its own electric 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, it would allow U.S. Electricar to sell cars at lower prices, 
because it would avoid the labor and other costs of removing conventional 
engines and drive trains before adding the electric power. U.S. Electricar 
could also widen its market by selling cars that have the Ford name and 
warranty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Converters are very good at low-volume products that they can do quickly and 
maybe more efficiently than Ford can do," said Beth Ardisana, an 
alternative-fuels planning specialist at Ford. The collaboration would also 
allow Ford to better understand the market for electric cars, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other (auto) companies are looking at this as an alternative," said Ted 
Morgan, chairman and chief executive of U.S. Electricar. Morgan hopes that 
eventually a deal with Ford will drop his converted-car price from double that 
of gasoline models to just 30% above standard price. 
</P>
<P>
 While the cars may be cheaper for consumers, however, they would also have a 
more limited performance than the so-called ground-up vehicles, which are 
designed only to be electric. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement announced Tuesday calls for Ford and U.S. Electricar to develop 
standards for electric car conversions, quality-control methods, customer 
service agreements and warranties. The companies could adopt a final sales 
agreement by next summer, a Ford spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 18 months, Ford has had a similar agreement with companies that 
convert Ford trucks to natural gas. These F-series pickups are now on sale in 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the larger state plan to curtail air pollution submitted Tuesday to 
federal authorities, California has mandated that the seven auto makers selling 
the most cars in California must make 2% of their 1998 California cars free of 
all air emissions -- almost certainly electric cars -- with that increasing to 
10% by the year 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 Though U.S. Electricar would guarantee the electric components, the car would 
be sold under the Ford brand name, potentially expanding its market. Consumers 
would be more comfortable with the Ford brand name, while current federal and 
state rules prevent government fleets from buying cars not certified by such 
original manufacturers, Morgan noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's electric-vehicle program has so far focused on the Ecostar, an 
adaptation of a small European delivery vehicle that has been plagued with 
development problems. Ford maintains that Ecostar development will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 But one auto industry executive said that rather than invest further in the 
near term in another ground-up car, Ford's proposed plan could make financial 
sense at this point. "For Ford, it might be the way to lose the least money 
initially," said the official, who declined to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry is searching around for the cheapest way to meet the mandate in 
the first few years, and the way to do it is to not build ground-up vehicles," 
said Daniel Sperling, director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at 
the University of California, Davis.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Sperling now expects that the only ground-up electric car offering the 
high performance of some current prototypes will be the GM Impact, a sporty 
two-seat car now being tested in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 GM has not yet committed itself to meeting the mandate by selling the Impact, 
however, and a spokesman said Tuesday that the company is still "looking at 
every option." 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler Corp. does not plan to sell the engineless frames -- called gliders 
in the industry -- but expects to market an electric variation of its 
best-selling minivan.

JAMES FLANIGAN ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: A BULLISH VOTE FOR THE FUTURE; EL TORO 
AIRPORT-CONVERSION PLAN IS KEY FOR ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a narrow vote and many misgivings, a future industrial power asserted 
itself last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County voters approved a ballot proposal to turn El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station into a major commercial airport when the Defense Department hands 
over the military facility in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents -- especially in Lake Forest, Laguna Hills and other south 
county communities adjacent to El Toro -- were dismayed. With traffic already 
congested in the once semi-rural area of open fields and rolling canyons, they 
saw a future airport making Orange County more like its raucous neighbor to the 
north. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, when "we're not L.A" was a guiding principle of Orange County 
life, the airport initiative would have been defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 But it passed last week because Orange County is now a diverse, high-tech 
manufacturing economy with growing trade connections to Asia and Latin America. 
The words we're not L.A. have a different meaning. "We need the airport to 
support our economic structure, in which job growth is more dependent on 
exports than is the case in Los Angeles" says James Doti, president of Chapman 
University in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Los Angeles County gets 22% of its $244 billion economic 
output from exports, compared to Orange County's 12.5% of its $66-billion gross 
county product. But Los Angeles' big economy is more diverse while Orange 
County at this stage is more like a Silicon Canyon, with business concentrated 
in computers and machinery, microchips and software and medical and scientific 
instruments -- all of them benefiting from foreign markets and foreign 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 So the voters decided to back the airport. And on Tuesday, Orange County's 
Board of Supervisors voted to disband the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, 
which the supervisors had set up to consider alternative uses for the military 
base. A new panel will be formed, not to consider alternatives but to plan for 
an airport on the 2,000 acres of Defense Department land that has served as a 
Marine airfield for 51 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Suburb no more. The decision marks a dividing line in Orange County's history, 
comparable to the 1988 defeat of a slow-growth initiative. No longer a bedroom 
suburb of Los Angeles, Orange County -- population 2.6 million -- must be 
recognized once and for all as a decentralized industrial-residential 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a new kind of city, comparable to Fairfax County, Va., outside Washington 
or Gwinnett County, Ga., near Atlanta. These are fast-growing centers of 
knowledge industry, adjacent to large cities but independent of them. Orange 
County, in fact, has been a model of the breed as it has developed multiple 
centers, from the older Anaheim and Santa Ana to Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza 
complex to the Irvine Spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county has expanding industry and trade, a research university and good 
living accommodations. All it lacks is an international airport," says Dennis 
Aigner, dean of UC Irvine's graduate school of management. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to build a major airport in addition to John Wayne Airport, which 
operates near capacity now and cannot be expanded, will shape the future of 
Southern California. For one thing, Orange County now sends 6 million 
passengers a year, plus considerable cargo, through Los Angeles International 
and another million passengers and cargo through Ontario and Long Beach 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
 One consequence of building a major airport at El Toro, near the Sand Canyon 
Road exit off Interstate 5, will be to discourage plans for a giant 
international airport in Palmdale. Southern California will not go the way of 
Denver, attempting to funnel long-distance passengers through a mega-airport 
far from city centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the Southland will be served by a number of airports, led by LAX -- 
which can handle 55 million passengers -- and including the converted George 
Air Force Base near Victorville, Norton Air Base in San Bernardino and March 
Field near Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, this siting of airports near residential communities will push 
development of noise abatement and lower-emission engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Business in the region will continue to be decentralized; Orange County will 
compete for jobs and investment as the promise of El Toro nears reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll show we're not just a gas station on the way from San Diego to L.A.," 
says Supervisor Harriett Wieder. Indeed, some business people speculate that 
with high-speed rail links, El Toro could handle airline passengers for San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes well, El Toro could be used for commercial cargo in 1999, with 
passenger facilities to follow by 2005. But that's a big if. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from inevitable wrangles about noise restrictions, new roads and 
infrastructure, El Toro -- like all military bases -- is an environmental 
nightmare with decades of fuel and toxic chemicals in the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department is responsible for cleanup, which environmental experts 
say will cost more than $1 billion. But the Pentagon only has to bring the 
property up to standards "for similar use." The air base can become an airport, 
in other words, but the costs of converting the property to commercial office 
space -- not to mention residential developments -- would have been 
prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport itself will be financed by bond issues, but an Orange County 
builder, who opposed the ballot measure, wants to make sure "that the airport 
builders pay for all the roads and sewage and other public facilities 
surrounding the airport. Don't leave that bill to other developers or 
taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Growth and prosperity are not trouble-free, in short. But we should not forget 
that Orange County's new problems and many of those throughout Southern 
California -- Los Angeles' exports are projected to grow 16% to $63 billion 
next year -- are side effects of opportunity. Orange County voters understood 
that last week. Perhaps they always have.

 "Mom, can you squirt me a twenty?" 
</P>
<P>
 So asks the young hero of a lavish cops-and-robbers video that Microsoft 
Chairman Bill Gates used in his keynote speech at the annual Comdex computer 
trade show to demonstrate his vision of our electronic future, circa 2005. By 
then, he predicts, we'll all be paying for caffe lattes and concert tickets 
with wallet PCs that stock digital hoards of cash, serve as instant ID cards 
and even store hundreds of pictures of our children. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers and other mobile workers will have sleek dashboard screens 
that can display video of the boss back at the office and call up maps and 
directions to any place the driver wants to go. Video conferences will be 
possible from any public phone booth. Paramedics can collaborate with 
hospital-bound doctors and nurses from moving ambulances. How will all this 
come to pass, given the relatively low penetration of computing devices into 
U.S. households and the nation's continued level of technological skills, as 
evidenced by the blinking 12:00s on VCRs across the land? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the good news is that most of the technology is already here. The bad 
news is that much of it is too expensive for most people -- and it's difficult 
even for professionals to tell which of the many divergent technologies on 
display at Comdex will ultimately be important. Vision, as Gates himself once 
said, is the easy part.  
</P>

 IBM, Apple Computer and Motorola know a thing or two about the distance 
between concept and reality. The three companies agreed three years ago to work 
together on a new computer chip, but only last month did they agree on a common 
design for personal computers using that chip. 
</P>
<P>
 At Comdex, the three companies showcased applications of more than 30 software 
developers in their massive white tent in the Las Vegas Convention Center 
parking lot, but they said little about the conflicts over operating-system 
software that still hobble the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironies abound when it comes to the PowerPC. Some industry observers are 
prematurely counting Apple out of the PC race. But numbers released at Comdex 
by Dataquest Inc., a San Jose research firm, show that Apple emerged as the 
leading U.S. computer vendor for the third quarter. Apple says it is on target 
to ship 1 million Power Macintosh units during the machine's first year on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 And Microsoft, in many ways a dreaded Apple foe, actually has at least part of 
a foot planted in Apple's camp. Mark Lewin, whose Microsoft business card 
identifies him as the Technical Evangelist of the systems developer relations 
group, has been spending most of his energies coordinating the development of 
Windows NT applications for the PowerPC. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewin insisted Microsoft is "fully committed to both platforms." Indeed, 
Microsoft has long been a leading developer of Macintosh applications software, 
but some grumble that the company has been suspiciously slow rewriting its 
programs for the Power Mac.

 Kai (rhymes with sky) Krause is considered something of a wizard in the 
computer graphics field, known for his mastery of Adobe Photoshop and for 
developing so-called plug-in software that can enhance Photoshop. 
</P>
<P>
 His company, HSC Software, is gradually severing its ties with Adobe 
Photoshop, releasing stand-alone imaging software programs that, thanks to 
amazingly complex mathematical computations, can spin, twist, expand, 
reconfigure and color images in the wink of an eye. 
</P>
<P>
 A long-haired math genius with a walrus mustache who grew up in Essen, 
Germany, Krause first made a name for himself by disseminating a 10-page tip 
sheet on how to do "algorithmic painting" over America Online years ago. Since 
then, the tips have been downloaded more than 200,000 times. Two years ago, HSC 
came out with Kai's Power Tools to help graphic designers quickly create 
splashy images and 3-D renderings on Macintoshes, Windows machines or Silicon 
Graphics workstations. The company's latest product is KPT Bryce. It can create 
mind-boggling natural and supernatural landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 HSC, which has expanded to 80 employees from eight, recently outgrew its Santa 
Monica offices and moved to Carpinteria, near Santa Barbara. And Krause and his 
family will soon move to Montecito, having sold the Malibu house that narrowly 
escaped last year's fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Krause, executive vice president, figures that by the time his two children 
(another is on the way, or "in beta," as he put it) are old enough to 
comprehend what he's doing, new graphics offerings will make his work look like 
the digital equivalent of a Model T. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids will laugh at us," he said. Maybe so, but for now Krause appears to 
have all the right stuff.

 IBM, Seagate Settle Disk-Drive Technology Suit: International Business 
Machines Corp. and Seagate Technology Inc. said the terms of the settlement 
were confidential. The two companies also said they have entered into a 
cross-licensing agreement, but gave no further details.The litigation involved 
a former IBM employee who left in 1991 to go to work for Seagate. IBM filed 
suit against Seagate and the former employee in October, 1991, to "prevent the 
unlawful transfer of trade secrets," an IBM spokesman said. The case had been 
scheduled to go to trial early next year in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis. 
Scotts Valley, Calif.-based Seagate, which is the largest independent disk 
drive maker, makes and sells several products that use magneto-resistive head 
technology.

 Third-Quarter Rates Reduce Housing Affordability: The National Assn. of 
Realtors said its affordability index registered 127.8 for the 
July-to-September period, down from 131.3 in the second quarter and 135.9 
during the third quarter of 1993. The index peaked at 141.9 during the final 
three months of 1993 and began falling as the Federal Reserve Board began 
boosting short-term rates last February.When the index is at 100, a family 
earning the median U.S. household income has just enough purchasing power to 
buy a median-priced resale home using conventional financing and a 20% down 
payment. The latest figures show that half the nation's families had at least 
127.8% of the income needed to qualify for a house priced at $111,000, the 
median price.

 Whirlpool to Shrink Payroll, Shut 2 Plants: Whirlpool Corp. will eliminate 
about 3,200 jobs in North America and Europe as it carries out a major 
restructuring. The plan will save the appliance maker $150 million a year but 
will reduce fourth-quarter profit by $250 million, officials said.A plastic 
parts plant in Columbia, S.C., and a clothes dryer factory in Cambridge, 
Ontario, will be closed in 1995 and about 900 jobs will be eliminated. Also in 
the next year, 300 manufacturing and management jobs will be cut from eight 
plants in the South and Midwest that together employ about 18,000 people. The 
Benton Harbor, Mich.-based company expects to cut 2,000 of 13,000 jobs in 
Europe as part of a reorganization of the appliance operations it acquired from 
Philips in 1989.

 Goldman, Sachs Co. Says Top Bond Expert Retiring: The nation's biggest and 
richest investment banking partnership said partner and chief economist Robert 
M. Giordano will leave Nov. 25 at the age of 46.He was responsible for 
forecasts on interest rates, the economy and Federal Reserve Board policy and 
was the chief spokesman on the economy and the bond markets. He will be the 
seventh senior bond partner to leave the New York-based firm in the last two 
years. No successor was named. Goldman this year has lost the partners 
responsible for most of the firm's record $2.3-billion profit for fiscal 1993. 
Among them was Chairman Stephen Friedman. Giordano was one of many financial 
experts who underestimated how much interest rates would rise in 1994. 
Goldman's profit this year is expected to slump 70%, to about $600 million, as 
rising rates depress bond prices.RETIREMEN

 Tele-Communications Inc. May Announce a Spinoff: At a board meeting today, 
directors of the major cable television concern may announce a spinoff of one 
of four operating units, sources said. The most likely candidate would be TCI's 
new Technology Ventures unit, according to the trade publication Multichannel 
News. A spinoff has been contemplated since Denver-based TCI reorganized its 
holdings in August, after it repurchased Liberty Media Corp. The four units are 
domestic cable systems, domestic programming, international operations and 
technology-oriented venture capital.

LETTER FUELS RUMORS OF BUYER INTEREST IN BLUE CROSS ASSETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A confidential letter from a state official to Blue Cross of California 
directors has fueled speculation that there may be a buyer interested in 
acquiring more than $2 billion in assets that Blue Cross has proposed turning 
over to a new charitable foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue surfaced Tuesday when the San Francisco office of Consumers Union, a 
watchdog organization critical of the Blue Cross plan, released an Oct. 7 
letter from Department of Corporations Commissioner Gary Mendoza to Blue Cross 
officials. Mendoza wrote in the letter that investment bankers had advised the 
agency that "it is entirely possible that there could be a strategic buyer who 
would be interested in acquiring all of (Blue Cross') assets." 
</P>
<P>
 Disclosure of the letter could further complicate a Blue Cross reorganization 
begun two years ago by calling attention to the company's valuable health care 
assets and perhaps encouraging another firm to come forward with an offer to 
buy those assets. The release of the letter also signals Consumers Union's 
willingness to badger Mendoza to ensure the Blue Cross plan does not 
shortchange the state and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza's letter does not specify if a buyer has already come forward with an 
offer for the Blue Cross assets, nor does it identify any buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza declined to clarify those issues in an interview. "It was never our 
intention that the letter be released to the media," he said, "and it is not 
appropriate for us to comment on any matter that is subject to ongoing review." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of Woodland Hills-based Blue Cross declined to comment. A Consumers 
Union spokeswoman said the letter was "leaked" to the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 One health care executive speculated that potential buyers for Blue Cross 
assets could include large HMOs, such as Minneapolis-based United Healthcare; 
U.S. Healthcare of Blue Bell, Pa., or a large traditional insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most attractive things about the Blue Cross assets is the intrinsic value 
of the Blue Cross name and the significant market presence by the company in 
California," the executive said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross, a nonprofit health care organization, has been stung by criticism 
that it failed to adequately compensate the state when it spun off most of its 
health care operations in 1992 into a publicly held, for-profit subsidiary, 
WellPoint Health Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that transaction, Blue Cross retained an 80% stake in WellPoint, a 
managed-care company. Blue Cross' 80 million shares have a market value of 
nearly $2.2 billion. WellPoint stock closed Tuesday at $27.25, up 12.5 cents, 
in New York Stock Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corporations has said that Blue Cross is obligated to comply 
with a law that requires nonprofits that convert to for-profit status to 
compensate the state by an amount equal to the company's value at the time of 
the conversion. Blue Cross has proposed that it fulfill that obligation by 
turning over nearly all of its assets to a new health care charity in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers Union and some state legislators have questioned whether Blue Cross' 
plan puts the highest possible value on the Blue Cross assets. They have 
suggested that Blue Cross might get more for those assets by putting them up 
for sale on the open market.

3 RETAILERS SEE JUMP IN 3RD-QUARTER EARNINGS; PROFITS: DAYTON HUDSON CLIMBS 
NEARLY 56%, WHILE HOME DEPOT GAINS 36% AND J.C. PENNEY SEES AN INCREASE OF 24%.

<P>
 Three big retailers said Tuesday that they had big earnings increases in the 
third quarter as consumer loyalty rested with stores offering them value. 
</P>
<P>
 Profit jumped 24% for J.C. Penney Co., while Dayton Hudson Corp. said its 
earnings rose nearly 56%, due largely to sales gains at its top-performing 
division, Target discount stores.Home Depot Inc. said its net income rose 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 Penney posted profits for the quarter ended Oct. 29 of $274 million, or $1.04 
per share, on sales of $5.15 billion, compared to $185 million, or 69 cents a 
share, on sales of $4.74 billion for the same period a year ago. The year-ago 
results include a $36-million extraordinary charge on debt redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Penney has fared better than many other apparel retailers by satisfying 
customer demand for lower prices. The company said its retail stores and 
catalogue operations did well during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayton Hudson said it earned $67 million, or 86 cents per share, in the 
quarter ended Oct. 29, compared to $43 million, or 54 cents per share, in the 
same quarter of 1993. Revenue increased 9%, to $5.05 billion from $4.63 billion 
last year. Same-store sales, or sales from stores open at least a year, rose 
3%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our third quarter was essentially as expected, with Target continuing its 
strong performance, Mervyn's continuing to improve off last year's low base and 
the department store division slightly below expectations," said Bob Ulrich, 
chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Depot Inc. said it earned $140.8 million, or 31 cents a share, in the 
quarter ended Oct. 30, compared to $103.4 million, or 23 cents a share, in the 
same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales totaled $3.24 billion, up 40% from $2.32 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 On a same-store basis, sales were up 7%.

 Transamerica Life Moving 230 Jobs to North Carolina: Transamerica Life Cos., 
citing tax disadvantages in California, said it will change the domicile of its 
seven companies -- Transamerica Life Insurance & Annuity Co.-- to North 
Carolina. As a result, two of the company's business units, with 230 employees, 
will be relocated by the end of 1996, Los Angeles-based Transamerica Life said. 
Because California taxes certain annuity and pension products that other states 
do not, the company incurs "retaliatory" taxes that can be avoided by changing 
its domicile to North Carolina, Transamerica Life said. About 1,700 
Transamerica Life employees will remain in Los Angeles.

OCTOBER RETAIL SALES UP AN UNEXPECTED 1.1%; INDICATORS: FACTORY PRODUCTION ALSO 
SURGES -- MORE EVIDENCE THAT THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO BEAT EXPECTATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The economy continued to thrive in October as factories ran at their busiest 
rate in more than 14 years, and consumers spent freely in the shopping malls 
and auto dealerships, the government said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The data adds to growing evidence that the economy is again outpacing 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said sales at retail stores jumped an unexpected 1.1% 
last month, following a revised 0.5% rise in September, with total sales 
hitting a record $191.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding autos, sales rose 0.6%, following a 0.5% increase in September. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Federal Reserve Board reported that production by the 
nation's factories increased strongly in October, moving closer to their outer 
limits as both consumers and industry sought additional products. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial output gained 0.7% last month after a 0.1% dip in September. 
Factory use rates climbed to 84.9% -- the highest in about 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the new information shows that the economy in the current quarter is 
probably stronger than some on Wall Street might have been expecting," Allan 
Leslie of Discount Corp. said.  
</P>
<P>
 The economy grew 3.4% in the third quarter. It had been expected to slow 
during the current three months, in part because the Fed had put on the brakes 
to curb inflation. But evidence is mounting that this slowdown might be less 
than many had thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given jobs and given income, consumers continue to show a willingness to 
spend," said Robert Dederick of Northern Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Fed and the Clinton Administration believe that the long-term health 
of the economy would be enhanced if annual growth could be slowed to about 
2.5%, the level at which inflation begins to stir. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there has been little evidence that even at stronger levels the 
economy has triggered dangerous inflationary pressures, though the Fed might 
have been successful in keeping the expansion from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed, faced with new evidence of the economy's strength, increased interest 
rates for the sixth time this year Tuesday in an effort to slow growth enough 
to keep inflation at bay. It was the biggest increase since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 After a closed-door meeting of its key policy-setting Federal Open Market 
Committee, the central bank issued a statement indicating it was pushing up two 
key rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The benchmark federal funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was increased to 5.50% from 4.75%. The Fed announced it was also raising 
its discount rate, the interest it charges to make direct loans to banks, by 
0.75 percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy has apparently shaken off the previous five Fed rate hikes, as 
auto sales and even housing have continued to show strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street economists had forecast a 0.6% increase in overall retail sales 
and a 0.4% gain with autos excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 New car dealers said business continued to thrive in October, rising 2.9% 
after moving up 0.6% in September. 
</P>
<P>
 New cars account for about a fifth of all retail spending, so swings in demand 
strongly affect overall monthly figures. Retail Sales

DOLLAR-BASED TRADE SURPLUS IS AT A TURNING POINT, JAPAN OFFICIALS SAY; 
COMMERCE: AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN EIGHT MONTHS, THE NATION'S SURPLUS WITH THE 
UNITED STATES FALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan declared Tuesday that its dollar-based trade surplus is at a turning 
point and headed for a decrease after shrinking for the third month in a row in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials and economists said they do not expect future falls to be 
faster than in the August-October quarter because Japan's exports may grow 
steadily on strong overseas demand, outstripping the growth in imports. 
</P>
<P>
 October also marked the first time in eight months that Japan's dollar trade 
surplus with the United States fell. 
</P>
<P>
 The politically sensitive surplus with Washington fell 6.8% to an unadjusted 
$4.79 billion from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall customs-cleared trade surplus fell to an unadjusted $9.28 billion 
in October from $10.93 billion a year earlier. That was within private 
economists' forecasts, which had ranged from $9.2 billion to $10.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade surplus "is at a turning point. It has fallen year-on-year for three 
straight months, or one quarter," a Ministry of Finance official said after the 
release of the October data. 
</P>
<P>
 But the official added that it is not clear whether the surplus will fall 
without exception in future months, or whether its downward trend will be 
uneven. 
</P>
<P>
 After adjusting for seasonal factors, the October surplus widened to $8.65 
billion from $8.46 billion a month earlier, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The official said the year-on-year decrease in October owed much to growing 
imports from the United States, the European Union and Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The official said it was still unclear how much of a role currency 
fluctuations and oil prices played, but said imports were boosted mainly by 
purchases of automobiles, aircraft, clothing and semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
 In volume terms, automobile imports doubled from a year earlier in October 
while vehicle exports grew 3.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Imports of semiconductors and related parts grew 44% year-on-year in dollar 
terms. Imports of crude oil grew 13.1% year-on-year. The trend of replacing 
domestic products with imports is likely to continue, depending on the pace of 
a recovery in the domestic economy, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, exports totaled $34.62 billion; imports were $25.34 billion.

U.S. REJECTS GM PLEA TO AX TRUCK HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rejecting a request from General Motors Corp., the Transportation Department 
said Tuesday that it will go ahead with a public hearing on whether millions of 
GM pickup trucks should be recalled as fire-prone. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which has vowed to fight a recall, had asked that the hearing be 
canceled so it could take the issue straight to court. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dec. 6 hearing promises to be a public relations disaster for GM, with 
appearances by families of victims and survivors of fiery crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter Tuesday to GM, the Transportation Department's general counsel 
said such hearings are important to find out the additional information the 
government needs before deciding on a recall. 
</P>
<P>
 GM responded in a statement that the hearing would be a waste of time and an 
"orchestrated talk show" in which plaintiffs' lawyers and industry critics 
would vie for the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Secretary Federico Pena scheduled the session last month and 
declared that 1973-87 GM pickups present an "unreasonable risk" of fire or 
explosion in side collisions because their gas tanks are mounted outside the 
frame. He blamed the sidesaddle design for 150 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 GM insists the trucks are safer than most vehicles on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena has acknowledged that the trucks met federal safety standards, but he 
said the law requires that they be safe in "real-world conditions" as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been investigating the 
trucks since 1992, when consumer groups petitioned for a recall. The agency 
last year asked GM to recall the trucks voluntarily, but the auto maker 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9 million of the trucks were built. GM changed the gas-tank design 
beginning with 1988 models. The company believes about 6 million of the 1973-87 
pickups are still in use.

POSTCARD FROM CYBERSPACE / DANIEL AKST: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / 
TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; NEED INFO? LET YOUR PC DO THE WALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL AKST

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cyberspace is a great place to kill time. You can spend hours arguing about 
arcana with a 14-year-old in Fresno, or flaming poor spellers and newbies in 
your favorite discussion forum. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, cyberspace is also a great place for saving time -- 
especially if you use on-line services for something they're very, very good 
at, which is finding things out. 
</P>
<P>
 On-line services are just about the best way to look up published material of 
almost any kind, especially if your time is valuable enough that you can't 
afford to waste it, but not so valuable that you have a staff to do your 
research. Cyberspace can thus become indispensable to anyone whose livelihood 
depends upon information -- and more and more of us are in that category these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several ways to find things out using a PC and a modem. The first 
and most time-honored method is to simply ask. That is, find a forum or 
bulletin board system where people knowledgeable about, say, photography, tend 
to congregate. Then scan the postings to see if anyone has already addressed 
your question, and if not, go ahead and post it yourself. Chances are you'll 
find out what you need to know. 
</P>
<P>
 For anybody with more serious information needs, I suggest a subscription to 
CompuServe. The granddaddy of the big on-line services is simply unsurpassed in 
its research offerings, and indispensable to anyone -- a lawyer practicing 
alone, a writer, a more-than-casual investor -- with an ongoing need for 
specific research. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CompuServe's "basic" service costs $8.95 a month, which includes some very 
handy research tools: an encyclopedia, a fine mutual fund database, the ability 
to look up stock prices and ticker symbols, Consumer Reports, and an excellent 
health and medical database called HealthNet. 
</P>
<P>
 For slightly more per month, you can enroll in CompuServe's Executive News 
Service, which, among other things, functions as an automated clipping service. 
Let's say you're interested in trade with Senegal; you can tell ENS to comb its 
various news sources -- including the Washington Post newspaper -- for "trade" 
and "Senegal," and it will pull any article mentioning both terms. There are 
hourly charges for reading the material, though. 
</P>
<P>
 CompuServe also offers several ways of locating individuals or businesses 
nationwide, including PhoneFile and Computrace; at 25 cents a minute, they can 
be cheaper than directory assistance, especially if you don't know the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Where CompuServe really shines is as a gateway to major databases of all 
kinds, which you can search for a fee. For investors and others interested in 
business, there are a host of resources, from reports on individual companies 
to demographic data. Of perhaps more interest to lay users are the roughly 
3,300 publications CompuServe offers through a variety of commercial databases. 
Although some of the databases are frighteningly expensive, some of them are 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, how expensive is a $10 or $20 database search? When I visit any of 
the UCLA libraries, for example, it means an hour round-trip in the car, to say 
nothing of hunting down hard copies or microfiches of the articles I need. And 
don't forget the dollar's worth of gas and $5 that UCLA charges for parking. 
Using my computer, I can get what I need in minutes, without leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The array of CompuServe's extra-charge offerings is truly gigantic. Just 
browsing those beginning with the letter F, you'll find FCC Report, the Federal 
Register, Fertility and Sterility, Fiber Optics News, Financial Analysts' 
Journal, the Financial Times, Finnish Trade Review, Fish Farming International, 
Floor Covering Business, Flame Retardancy News, Forbes, Fortune, the 
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the Fresno Bee, Frozen Food Age and many 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Let there be no mistake: You can spend a pretty penny searching through back 
issues of Progressive Grocer on CompuServe. In some databases, in fact, you can 
run up charges of hundreds of dollars awfully fast. But there are ways to save. 
My two favorites on CompuServe are Knowledge Index (GO KI) and Magazine 
Database Plus (GO MAGDB). 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledge Index is the first place to check for most things, because at 40 
cents a minute it is much cheaper than the other databases. "A 15-minute search 
on KI, costing $6, could cost 10 times as much using other CompuServe sources," 
wrote Glenn and Ruth Orenstein, authors and publishers of a very useful book 
called "CompuServe Companion: Finding Newspapers and Magazines Online" ($29.95, 
(617) 444-1154). 
</P>
<P>
 KI has something like 700 periodicals available on-line, including many major 
(and not so major) newspapers. It's also easy to use. The catch is that you can 
only use it nights and weekends; during business hours there is sufficient 
demand for the Dialog information retrieval service, of which KI is the 
after-hours offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Magazine Database Plus, according to CompuServe, "contains the full text of 
articles from more than 140 general-interest publications, including U.S. News 
& World Report, Entertainment Weekly, Forbes and Motor Trend." It's also easy. 
Searching is free, and each full-text article you view, print or download is 
$1.50. For $4.50, I recently located and downloaded three articles I needed, 
including a long one from Scientific American. Overall, says Ruth Orenstein, 
CompuServe carries 3,300 titles, with only a few glaring gaps.

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; REDUCING RISK IN ORGAN TRANSPLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN WIEGNER

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the biggest risks an organ transplant patient faces is that the body's 
immune system will treat the new organ as an intruder. If the immune system 
musters an army of proteins to attack the perceived invader, the transplant 
could be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of drugs are used to block such reactions. They suppress the immune 
system's function, but this approach can lead to infections, and the drugs are 
not always successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Hunt, a professor of pharmacy and pharmaceutical chemistry at UC San 
Francisco, believes he has found a better way to deal with the problem: a drug 
designed to keep cells from making the undesirable proteins. 
</P>
<P>
 In a donated organ, the proteins most likely to be attacked are called major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins. The new drug, known as a 
"gene-regulating decoy," would keep the transplanted organ from displaying 
these telltale proteins on its cell surfaces and thus allow the "invader" to 
slip in under the body's defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bathing the donor organ with the new drug before it is implanted would 
eliminate all but a few of the proteins that would alert the immune system and 
trigger attack. So far, the decoy strategy has worked well in preventing MHC 
proteins from being made in cells grown in laboratory culture dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 An Auditory User 
</P>
<P>
 Interface: Renaissance geographer Gerardus Mercator gave the world the 
Mercator map projection and a way for seamen to navigate. Now a 20th-Century 
"Mercator" is helping the blind and visually impaired navigate the icons and 
graphics of computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercator is the name of an auditory interface system for Unix workstations, 
developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology with support from NASA's 
Marshall Space Flight Center and Sun Microsystems. 
</P>
<P>
 For the sighted, graphics-based user interfaces are much easier to use than 
the old text-based, command-driven interfaces. Not so for those with impaired 
vision. To follow what the computer is doing, most of them currently rely on 
"screen reader" speech synthesizers that read them the command field.  
</P>
<P>
 In graphics user interfaces, this information flow includes a lot of image 
data that tells the screen how to display graphics -- and it can't be 
understood by the screen reader. The Georgia Tech researchers have found a way 
to intercept data so that, as the user navigates the screen, certain sounds 
tell him what is going on.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; TRW TELLS OF PLANS FOR 
SATELLITE PHONE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TRW Inc. on Thursday announced plans to build and operate a $2-billion 
satellite telephone system in partnership with Teleglobe Inc. of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to begin operation in 1999, the 12-satellite system, known as 
Odyssey, will provide voice, fax and paging services and will enable a person 
using a pocket telephone to call anywhere in the world from anywhere in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two companies face a host of technical, legal and competitive 
obstacles in building the Odyssey system. Several other well-funded satellite 
telephone systems are already in the works, including Iridium, led by Motorola 
Inc.; Globalstar, headed up by Loral Corp., and Teledisic, a $9-billion, 
840-satellite system backed by entrepreneurs Bill Gates and Craig McCaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies said the venture will be established as a limited partnership, 
with TRW and Teleglobe serving as founding general partners and jointly 
managing the project. The two companies will put up 15% of the funding for the 
venture, with the balance to come from additional partners, equipment vendors, 
and loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Odyssey backers say their project should be less costly and less complex than 
its rivals, substantially reducing calling charges for users. TRW has applied 
to the Federal Communications Commission for a license to operate the Odyssey 
system. FCC licenses are expected to be awarded in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland-based TRW is a leading satellite maker and also sells a range of 
automotive and defense equipment as well as credit services. Teleglobe is 
Canada's international communications carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 The various satellite telephone proposals each use different technology, but 
all of them aim to tap a potentially huge market among people in the developing 
world who have little access to traditional phones, and among mobile 
professionals in industrialized countries who need flexible wireless services.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; RUSSIANS VISIT THE MECCA 
OF REAL ESTATE FOR REFORM TIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A delegation from the Russian Federation is touring the Southland this week, 
viewing high-tech demonstrations of land record systems in hopes of picking up 
tips on how to handle that odd form of ownership known as private property. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosting the group is a welcoming committee of equal size from Infotec 
Development Inc., a Santa Ana firm that stands to make a tidy bundle off the 
planned transfer of an eighth of the world's land from public to private hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Infotec heads a team of U.S. companies bidding to supply Russia with a massive 
mapping and land-management information system that aims to propel the 
federation simultaneously toward capitalism and the cutting edge of computer 
automation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, it would give the nation's new property owners a 
guaranteed legal title to their land and enable the state to collect taxes. It 
is also expected to spur investment, as international firms are given more 
assurances that what they're buying or leasing is actually theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years ago, there were no property owners in Russia," said Nikolai 
Vasilyevich Komov, chairman of the Russian Center for Scientific Support of 
Land Reform. "Now there are 60 million. You can only imagine the volume of work 
that needs to be done . . . " Until now, transactions ranging from granting a 
family a title to a small apartment to surveying the boundaries of a large farm 
have been done via pen and paper -- similar to the systems still in place in 
most of America's 50 states (many developed before that other revolution, the 
one in 1776). 
</P>
<P>
 But not for 1990s Russia, this analog approach: "So much is developing with 
the information superhighway," said Arkady S. Golubkov, the government's chief 
technologist. "It's very important to us to have the most advanced technology." 
 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The World Bank has pledged $80 million toward the project, which, just to get 
off the ground, will involve the purchase of 50,000 personal computers, 
assorted scanning equipment, printers, global positioning systems to photograph 
and mark property boundaries and intensive technical training programs for 
government employees. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Southern California Assn. of Governments on Tuesday morning, the 
Russians saw a demonstration of geographic information systems, a rapidly 
growing computer technology that combines mapping with non-geographic 
information (such as employment statistics) to predict patterns such as 
residential development and traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 GIS will be a key piece of the Russian system. But as association officials 
explained how 184 cities in Southern California use it to coordinate 
development plans, their Russian visitors interrupted with more practical 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is the owner of this system and where did you get the funds to set it 
up?" one asked. And another: "Can I ask a more simple question: How much did it 
cost?" 
</P>
<P>
 Komov's committee, known as the Roscomzem, has been working for two years to 
figure out the best way to install the cornerstone of capitalism into its 
economic and legal systems. Unlike many nations in a more advanced stage of 
capitalism, Russia intends to have a centralized system. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways they have an advantage because they're starting basically from 
scratch," said Richard Mader of SCAG. 
</P>
<P>
 Since property taxes are a well-known revenue generator under capitalism, 
there is considerable pressure on the Russians to implement a land management 
system quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take me, for example. I now have a country house, and I want to know it is 
really mine, my legal status, my title," said Dmitri Jouravlev, a member of the 
Roscomzem. "It's a rare historical occasion that the interests of the state are 
the same as mine."

BUSINESS COMPUTING / RICHARD O'REILLY: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY 
/ INNOVATION; MULTIPURPOSE MACHINE COMBINES PRINTER, COPIER, FAX IN A COMPACT 
SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For small businesses suffering from two common maladies -- too small an office 
and too small a budget -- electronics manufacturers are now offering an 
appealing solution: a multipurpose machine that combines a computer printer, a 
plain-paper fax machine and a copier. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like a concept that can't miss: The combination units are priced as 
low as $650, far below the cost of buying the machines individually, and they 
save desk space, electric outlet space and file drawer space (where the 
instruction manuals and other documents from the separate machines might have 
been). 
</P>
<P>
 Even large companies might find the devices attractive for specific purposes, 
such as providing private fax and copying facilities for the boss. And for many 
home offices -- not to mention individuals determined to be fully wired -- 
they're an excellent choice.  
</P>
<P>
 As you might expect, these machines have their share of problems. The printing 
tends to be slow, especially for anyone who is accustomed to a laser printer. 
As copiers, they're limited. Businesses that can afford it will generally be 
better off with separate, stand-alone devices. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those who fit the profile, their are some interesting products 
available, including the Brother Fax2400ML (about $1,000), the Canon Faxphone 
B160 (less than $800 with factory rebate), the Hewlett-Packard OfficeJet (less 
than $800), the Panasonic KX-SP100 (less than $800) and the Ricoh Fax800 (as 
low as $650). 
</P>
<P>
 The Brother Fax2400ML is basically a fax machine with a laser printer built 
in, and it requires a $99 kit -- combining serial cable and software printer 
driver diskette -- to enable it to act as a computer printer and scanner and to 
send and receive faxes directly from the PC. But its printer and scanning 
resolution of 200-by-200 dots-per-inch is too low for high-quality business 
printing and for many scanning tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Canon's B160 looks like a fax machine, complete with telephone handset on the 
left side. Inside, there's a 360-by-360 dot-per-inch BubbleJet ink-jet printer 
mechanism, a fully featured fax system and temporary storage memory for 
incoming faxes when the machine is busy printing or copying. 
</P>
<P>
 The HP OfficeJet, introduced last month, is also an ink-jet printer with 
600-by-300 dot-per-inch resolution. It looks like a larger version of the 
company's DeskJet printers, from which it evolved, and it has the best graphics 
printing ability of the bunch, with a 256-level gray scale. The fax features 
are complete, and the memory takes care of conflicts when faxes are received. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Panasonic KX-SP100, also recently introduced, incorporates a 300-by-300 
dot-per-inch laser-quality printer, which produces the snappiest 
business-quality printing of the group. It sits upright, like Panasonic's 
plain-paper fax machines from which it evolved, with paper trays that tip out 
to the side. With the trays snapped shut, the machine is about the size of a 
mini-tower personal computer.  
</P>
<P>
 The Ricoh Fax800 is a plain-paper fax using ink-jet technology, and prints at 
360-by-360 dots per inch with an optional $150 parallel printer interface kit. 
It offers a typical range of fax features. In copier function tests among 
several of these machines on display in an office supply store, the Ricoh was a 
little slower than the others, but it was also a lot cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 According to market research firm BIS Strategic Decisions, only about 28,000 
printer-fax-copier machines were sold last year, but a boom is imminent: Sales 
are expected to reach half a million units -- worth about $3.5 billion -- by 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
 And BIS has a favorite. The company expects Hewlett-Packard's OfficeJet to get 
a big piece of the sales, given H-P's position "as the leading vendor of 
electronic printers and scanners and the second-leading vendor of plain-paper 
fax machines," according to Barry Tepper, senior industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 For this report, I compared the OfficeJet to a stand-alone Panasonic KX-F280 
thermal fax and a Canon PC-2 personal copier. I also had copies of computer 
printing from the Panasonic and copier function reproductions from the Brother, 
Canon and Ricoh machines, and I played with several of the machines in stores. 
In all, the exercise revealed that choosing what to buy is more complicated 
than it appears. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the good news: The fax capability of all of these machines is good, and 
they have a variety of auto-dialing functions that make it easier to manage 
frequently called numbers. They have three resolution choices for faxing, to 
handle pages with graphics. All have fax input bins able to hold at least 10 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The copier function is more of a compromise, mainly because you can only copy 
individual sheets, not pages from a book or a magazine. On the other hand, 
these machines have multipage input and paper trays that the lowest-priced 
personal copiers lack, so you can copy multipage documents in one step, or make 
multiple copies of a single page. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest issue for many potential customers, though, is the printing. Most 
of the machines are ink-jet printers, which are not as crisp as laser printers, 
and the ink cartridges cost a little more per page than laser toner cartridges. 
The Panasonic unit offers the best laser-quality printing, using a 
light-emitting diode (LED) imaging technology instead of a laser. 
</P>
<P>
 An equally important problem is speed. Some of these machines print only a 
page or two a minute, but the OfficeJet prints three pages a minute, the 
Panasonic four pages a minute. The Brother is capable of six pages a minute, 
but at draft-quality resolution. A good office-quality printer, by contrast, is 
capable of eight pages a minute or more of top-notch printing. 
</P>
<P>
 The speed questions applies on the fax capabilities too. The OfficeJet was 
noticeably slower receiving a high-resolution fax than the thermal Panasonic 
fax-only machine we have at home.  
</P>
<P>
 One page I faxed to the two machines was a map on a legal-size page, mixed in 
with several letter-size pages. The OfficeJet dutifully reduced the map to fit 
on letter-size plain paper, thereby making the finer detail of the map harder 
to read. Our thermal fax printed the legal page full-size, preserving all the 
detail. Of course, if you know something like that is coming in, you can load 
legal-size paper in all of them and the auto reduction feature won't be 
invoked. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you already have an office-quality printer and a separate fax machine, you 
should forget about these devices and buy a copier -- even if your fax is a 
thermal unit with roll paper instead of a plain-paper model. 
</P>
<P>
 And unless your office really is just a home office for part-time business or 
personal use, I think you ought to buy separate stand-alone machines for 
printing, faxing and copying. Your business printing needs to look as sharp as 
your competitors'. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you don't have the money or don't have the space or don't need the 
machine for hard-core business purposes, then the combination machines can be a 
good buy. Is an All-in-One Device for You? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider buying a multi-function printer-fax-copier if: 
</P>
<P>
 * You don't already own a printer, fax or copier. 
</P>
<P>
 * You have no money or no space for three machines. 
</P>
<P>
 * You are an executive in need of occasional secure faxing, copying and 
printing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Your printing volume is light. 
</P>
<P>
 * You don't need to copy pages from books and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't consider a multi-function machine if: 
</P>
<P>
 * You already have a good printer and a good fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
 * You do a lot of computer printing. 
</P>
<P>
 * You need highest-quality printing. 
</P>
<P>
 * You do a lot of copying, and some of it is pages from books and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 * You demand no-compromise, state-of-the-art equipment.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: PACIFIC MUTUAL, CONNECTICUT FIRM MERGE, RAISE $83 
MILLION IN SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move creating the nation's fourth-largest publicly traded money 
management company, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. and four of its 
subsidiaries on Tuesday finalized a previously announced merger with Thomson 
Advisory Group L.P. of Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the newly formed company, Pimco Advisors L.P., raised more than 
$83 million Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange by selling a minority stake 
of the new company to the public, which now owns 18% of Pimco Advisors.The 
Newport Beach mutual fund operator has $71 billion in customer assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Deteriorating market conditions Tuesday forced underwriters to downscale the 
planned offering to 4.6 million units -- about half of the 9.3 million units 
planned when the sale was announced last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers of Pimco Advisors reduced the size of the offering because the sale 
price was too low, according to William S. Thompson, a managing director at 
Pimco. The price of Pimco Advisors fell 11% to $18.125 per unit Tuesday from 
$20.375 when the sale was announced in October. The transaction involved the 
sale of partnership units instead of shares of common stock.

TACO BELL REPORTEDLY WILL LICENSE HAMBURGER CHAIN; FAST FOOD: IN POLICY 
TURNAROUND, 'A SELECT GROUP' WILL GET HOT 'N NOW FRANCHISES, A TRADE 
PUBLICATION SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reversing its field, Taco Bell has decided to license some of its Hot 'n Now 
burger restaurants to franchisees, according to a national restaurant industry 
trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Nation's Restaurant News reported this week that Hot 'n Now, an Irvine-based 
subsidiary of Taco Bell, will license an unspecified number of restaurants to 
"a select group" of Hot 'n Now and Taco Bell franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell on Tuesday would not comment on the report or the status of Hot 'n 
Now, a chain of double-drive-through restaurants. In the past, Taco Bell has 
said that growth in its mainstay Taco Bell system would be achieved by adding 
company-owned stores, rather than selling franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Nation's Restaurant News, a weekly trade publication based in New York, quoted 
Taco Bell Chairman John Martin as saying that he didn't "feel comfortable 
having franchisees invest a lot of money in Hot 'n Now until we had it right." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Taco Bell said there were more than 100 Hot 'n Now restaurants 
operating "as a test concept." The company described Hot 'n Now as a no-frills 
restaurant with a "limited value menu" that included 49-cent, 69-cent and 
99-cent burgers, french fries and soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant companies have historically used franchising to expand the size of 
their chains. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can grow faster through franchising and limit the corporate expense," 
said Janet Lowder, a consultant with Restaurant Management Services in Rancho 
Palos Verdes. "If you open restaurants through franchising, you have lots of 
other people opening them for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepsico Inc., Taco Bell's parent company, acquired Hot n' Now in 1990. The 
burger chain was founded in Kalamazoo, Mich., in 1984.

 Charges against ex-officer -- The nature of two misdemeanor counts to which 
retired Los Angeles policeman Stephen Polak pleaded guilty in a settlement with 
federal prosecutors was misstated in a Times article Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Polak pleaded guilty last month to two misdemeanor federal civil rights 
violations for using unreasonable force.According to both the U.S. attorney's 
office and Polak, the former officer admitted in open court that he used a 
flashlight to strike two suspects after they had been handcuffed and placed in 
a patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 All charges accusing Polak of skimming drug money seized in raids by an elite 
anti-narcotics unit and of failing to report such thefts on tax returns were 
dropped as part of the plea agreement. This ended all prosecution of Polak in
