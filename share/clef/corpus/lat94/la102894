MOVIE REVIEW; HIGH-COLONIC HIJINKS ON 'THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE'; A SOLID 
PRODUCTION AND STRONG PERFORMANCES CAN'T GIVE THIS FAR-FETCHED ALAN PARKER 
FARCE A PEG TO HANG ITS LOGIC ON. 
</P>

<P>
 Has America been waiting for a broad farce about bodily functions? Is there a 
burgeoning market for jokes about colonics and stool samples, a hoard of 
viewers poised to laugh at belching, excrement tossing, spitting up, throwing 
up, flatulence and quick cuts from enemas to dark beer flowing from a tap? "The 
Road to Wellville" thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapted and directed by Alan Parker from T. Coraghessan Boyle's novel, 
"Wellville" plays like a foreign-language film without benefit of subtitles. 
Actors stride purposefully around a beautifully constructed environment, but 
the view from the seats is perplexing and disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, the real-life centerpiece of book and film, was a 
classic American eccentric, a health fanatic and corn flake inventor whose 
belief in what's been called "muscular vegetarianism" would fit right into 
today's California. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Kellogg turned the Michigan town of Battle Creek into a 
turn-of-the-century health mecca dominated by his sanitarium, an early version 
of the Canyon Ranch where celebrities like President Taft and J.C. Penney as 
well as ordinary folks subjected themselves to the man's vigorous regimen, 
which included a not inconsiderable number of daily enemas. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kellogg believed that "universal constipation" was "the most destructive 
blockade that has ever opposed human progress." He declared himself an enemy of 
"the civilized colon," and, according to James C. Wharton's fascinating 
"Crusaders for Fitness," "personally inquired of the directors of the London 
and Bronx zoos how often their primates moved their bowels." 
</P>
<P>
 Kellogg (played by Anthony Hopkins with the kind of misguided energy that 
marks the entire enterprise) was also a relentless enemy of sexuality. And 
"Wellville's" opening scene shows the good doctor insisting to journalists from 
a Rube Goldberg exercise contraption that "sex is the sewer drain of a healthy 
body" and poetically denouncing masturbation as "the silent killer of the 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 Given how bizarre the real Kellogg was, it's unfortunate but not unexpected 
that writer-director Parker, never a noticeably subtle filmmaker ("Midnight 
Express," "Mississippi Burning"), has chosen to overemphasize the 
grotesqueness, wasting no opportunity to feature close-ups of unusual-looking 
people doing strange and terrible things. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's script has also given the entire story an overlay of stylized verbal 
artificiality that hamstrings stars Bridget Fonda and Matthew Broderick, both 
fine natural actors who are neither comfortable nor convincing in 
quasi-satirical roles. 
</P>
<P>
 She is Eleanor Lightbody, a self-described "Battle freak" headed for her third 
trip to "the San" with husband Will (Broderick), a weakened former substance 
abuser who can't digest anything stronger than tea and toast, in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since Kellogg preaches that sexual stimulation could be fatal, the couple is 
separated after they check in. Will fantasizes over Nurse Graves (Traci Lind) 
and consoles the seriously ill Ida Muntz (Lara Flynn Boyle) while Eleanor hooks 
up with the free-spirited Virginia Cranehill (Camryn Manheim) and gets involved 
in some daring sexual experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wellville" has even more plot strands than these, including Kellogg's 
strained relationship with his degenerate adopted son George (Dana Carvey) and 
the attempt by businessman Charles Ossining (John Cusack) and con man Goodloe 
Bender (Michael Lerner) to cash in on the rage for breakfast cereal by starting 
a new brand called Per-Fo. 
</P>
<P>
 No flimsy production, the Peter Biziou-shot "Wellville" is vibrant and 
authentic on a physical level, helped by Penny Rose's detailed costumes and a 
convincing series of locales put together by production designer Brian Morris 
and art directors John Willett and Richard Earl. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact that this part of "Wellville" seems to know what it's doing only 
adds to the overall confusion. Ham-fisted as satire, unfunny as slapstick farce 
and unconvincing as drama, this is one of those films that makes you wonder 
what the filmmakers thought they were doing. Or who they thought would enjoy 
whatever it was they did.

 'Killers' Under Fire: Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers" has been banned in 
Ireland and risks a similar fate in Britain. Irish film censor Sheamus Smith 
did not explain his reasons for the outright ban Wednesday, but the Irish media 
have emphasized alleged links between the film and 10 recent killings. The 
British Board of Film Classification on Thursday ordered a delay in release of 
the film, which had been expected to open Nov. 18. The board has the option of 
permitting the film to be shown as made, requiring cuts or restricting the age 
of the audience. It may also ban the film's release on video. The film, which 
stars Woody Harrelson as a psychopath on a killing spree with his girlfriend, 
has been described by Stone as a satire on the media's glorification of 
killers. TELEVISION

 No Laughing Matter: "ER" is the best new drama on TV, according to Viewers for 
Quality Television, a Virginia-based nonprofit organization that polled its

for second place with "Under Suspicion." But as for best new comedy, the 
organization drew a blank and quoted one member as saying: "I haven't found one

With an estimated $20 million to $30 million gross in 1993, they have net 
liquid assets of $633,607, the accountant found. But they do have 26 cars, 
including a '91 Bentley Turbo and a '93 Lincloln Continental limo, real estate

on display in Budapest, Hungary. Lennon drew the "Bag One" series as a wedding 
gift to Yoko Ono in 1969. The erotic drawings were first shown at the London

were eventually dismissed after a lengthy trial. "No one has so much as

MOVIE REVIEW; 'SILENT FALL' DOESN'T RISE BEYOND SO-SO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Silent Fall," the only apparent eyewitness to a double homicide is the 
wealthy victims' 9-year-old autistic son, Tim (Ben Faulkner). The boy is 
traumatized twice over -- his closed-off condition prevents him from even 
expressing his grief. 
</P>
<P>
 What lifts the movie above its standard murder mystery trappings is the way it 
attempts to get inside the boy's misery anyway. Psychiatrist Jake Rainer 
(Richard Dreyfuss), a specialist in autism, takes Tim on as a patient in an 
attempt to ward off a more severe drug therapy administered at the behest of 
the Baltimore police force. He's gentle with the boy, but he also knows he's on 
a deadline: If he can't force out the identity of the killer, then Tim may as 
well be dead too. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a so-so thriller with a first-rate atmosphere. Director Bruce Beresford 
is working from a by-the-book script by Akiva Goldsman that piles up the 
preposterousness. As a murder mystery it's schematic and too easy to figure out 
-- the pool of potential murderers is too small and the clues are as heavy as 
anvils. As a psychological study it's uneven: Jake feels he was once 
responsible for the death of an autistic boy in his practice and so his 
relationship with Tim is supposed to be mutually healing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a touchy-feely premise that only works because of Dreyfuss' performance, 
and even Dreyfuss can't do much with the scenes between Jake and his scowling, 
suffering wife (Linda Hamilton), who gets to show her displeasure by gutting 
chickens for dinner. She urges him so many times to "push" his emotions that we 
begin to wonder: Could Jake be pregnant? Is this some sort of new Lamaze 
procedure for uncommunicative hubbies? 
</P>
<P>
 Tim's older sister, Sylvie (Liv Tyler), claims to have witnessed the aftermath 
of the murder, though not the killer's face, and her reasoned calm with Tim 
rings true. She has the practiced ease of someone who is prepared for all the 
boy's fearful contingencies. (That's what links her with Jake.) When she's with 
Tim, his fear subsides, and yet there's something creepy in the way they shield 
each other from abuse. When they fall asleep together on the floor of the 
murder site, it's a horrific frieze -- babes in arms in hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Beresford overrides the script's overemphatic clunkiness by drawing out the 
story's more ambiguous meanings. Tim doesn't speak in his own voice, when he 
speaks at all. Instead, he mimics exactly the voices of TV pitchmen, family -- 
anybody. Jake tries to get him to re-create the voices during the murder, and 
the scenes in which the boy calmly and emphatically spews out the victims' 
cries is genuinely upsetting. Beresford avoids turning Tim into a demon seed; 
little Ben Faulkner has a plangent, innocent quality that makes his agonies 
palpable (even though the boy has blocked his own pain). Tim isn't Rainboy -- 
he's never perceived as any kind of savant. 
</P>
<P>
 It's rare for a thriller to be as evocative as "Silent Fall" without 
delivering the goods. Perhaps the reason the film is more of a letdown than the 
average misfired mystery is because, in places, the psychological details in 
the scenes between Jake and Tim are so good. Dreyfuss shows us the little boy 
Jake still has tucked inside himself. But he doesn't go elfin on us. He's a man 
grappling with inchoate feelings. Beresford would have done better to jettison 
the thriller stuff and hunker down with the doctor-child relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's unevenness suggests Beresford probably felt the same way. 
</P>

includes a boy spouting obscenities and several murderous moments.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'SQUANTO' AN EXCEPTIONAL FAMILY FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Squanto: A Warrior's Tale" is a stirring epic of survival and self-discovery 
that culminates in the very first Thanksgiving. It is an exceptionally 
intelligent family film, mythology painted in broad, action-filled strokes to 
enthrall youngsters yet boasting a hero plunged into a dilemma with the kind of 
complexity appreciated by adults. It is a splendid American debut for Swiss 
filmmaker Xavier Koller, whose memorable "Journey of Hope" won the 1991 best 
foreign film Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 Legend has it that there actually was a young 17th-Century Massachusetts 
Indian named Squanto who was captured by English slave traders and taken to 
England but who somehow made it back to America. In a felicitous blend of 
research and imagination, writer Darlene Craviotto has Squanto's tribe 
extending a friendly welcome to a ship bearing English explorers and traders, 
only to have Squanto (Adam Beach) and his friend Epenow (Eric Schweig) wind up 
in irons, bound for Britain, where the proprietor of Plymouth's shipping 
company (Michael Gambon) plans to put them on profitable display as subhuman 
"savages." 
</P>
<P>
 That's just the beginning of Squanto's adventures in England, in which he 
learns both how good and how evil the white man can be; how he sorts out 
understandably conflicting emotions proves crucial upon his return home. No 
Native American was ever so noble (or handsome) as Beach's Squanto, no villain 
more gleefully nasty than Gambon, yet Koller and Craviotto create a sense of 
psychological validity in the unfolding of Squanto's ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Koller brings to the film the storytelling gifts, the sense of an odyssey 
unfolding and cultures clashing that characterized "Journey of Hope." 
</P>
<P>
 "Squanto: A Warrior's Tale" is a big, handsome, energetic picture, with 
glorious camera work, meticulous period production design and an appropriately 
stirring score. A Native American with an ingratiating personality, Beach 
carries the film with ease. Besides Gambon and Schweig, he gets great support 
from Mandy Patinkin and Donal Donnelly as wise Jesuit priests. We come away 
from the film with the feeling that Squanto has learned what it means to be a 
member of a minority, caught up in the unending process of having to take the 
measure of those who have greater power than you do. 
</P>
<P>

and brutal for the very young but otherwise fine for children.

MOVIE REVIEW; CONFUSING 'DROP SQUAD' RAISES SERIOUS ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "DROP Squad" turns upon a reprehensible, indefensible dramatic device: an 
illegal deprogramming team dedicated to kidnaping and brainwashing 
self-centered upwardly mobile blacks to reconnect them with their roots. 
</P>
<P>
 But the presence of this Deprogramming and Restoration of Pride Squad 
detonates a provocative, emotion-charged melodrama that deals with complex and 
contradictory intra-racial issues as few films have. This is one of those 
unwieldy and improbable pictures that ends up touching upon more crucial bases 
than if had it been a more realistic, better structured film. 
</P>
<P>
 In the film's best-written role, "ER"s Eriq LaSalle really shines. He's 
Bruford Jamison Jr., a handsome young ad executive so ambitious that he 
supports and helps create the most demeaning campaigns imaginable aimed at 
African American consumers. It's hard to believe that in today's corporate 
America he'd actually have to be so totally an Uncle Tom. But the film 
nevertheless powerfully conveys the isolation and repressed anger experienced 
by so many blacks who succeed in overwhelmingly white-dominated American 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, Bruford believes he has to overlook so much that he loathes 
in order to survive and get ahead and, on the other, feels resentful toward 
what his family insists are his obligations and responsibilities. The flash 
point is his sweet-natured, uneducated and impoverished cousin (Afemo Omilami), 
who was his best friend in childhood. The cousin wants his help in landing an 
entry-level job at the ad agency, but Bruford feels that he will be an 
embarrassment to him if he's hired in any capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bruford's sister (Nicole Powell), this is the last straw, and she directs 
the DROP Squad to kidnap her brother to straighten him out. (That this is the 
reason is not immediately clear, so poorly is the film structured.) Alas, its 
leader, Rocky (Vondie Curtis-Hall), and his key aide, Garvey (Ving Rhames), are 
in a philosophical conflict: Rocky wants to stick to his nonviolent principles 
while Garvey insists that nowadays physical force is in order. The 
deprogramming sequences are convincing only as displays of protracted, 
dangerous and degrading brutality, and both Rocky and Garvey are made to seem 
nothing more than misguided, none-too-bright thugs steeped in presumptuous, 
half-baked ideology. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of morality and realism, the squad is a bum device, for any number of 
normal occurrences in his life could force Bruford to reappraise his values. 
Yet this film is so charged with ambivalence in almost all its aspects -- 
that's its fascination, as is the case with most Oscar Micheaux films -- that 
you have the feeling that first-time director David Johnson and his co-writers 
have a lingering wish that a humane form of the DROP Squad actually existed. In 
any event, the film evokes the dilemma that any member of a minority 
experiences to varying degrees: Where does your responsibility to yourself and 
your family and your community begin and end? 
</P>
<P>
 It falls to LaSalle, of TV's "E.R." series, to carry the picture through its 
bumpy course, and he does so with aplomb; his Bruford in fact could be more 
sympathetic than the filmmakers intended. With his talent, LaSalle is likely to 
go on to better films, but "DROP Squad" will surely remain among his most 
challenging assignments.

 In 1987, Latino Theatre Lab presented "La Victima," an agitprop epic about a 
family's migrations across the U.S.-Mexican border over 60 years, at Los 
Angeles Theatre Center. Now director Jose Luis Valenzuela and the Lab are doing 
"La Victima" at their new home, Plaza de la Raza, as a fund-raiser against 
Proposition 187, the ballot measure that takes aim at illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The play puts some of the issues raised by Proposition 187 into a historical 
context. It argues that U.S. attitudes toward immigration are largely 
determined by the health of the U.S. economy. The play's Villa family is 
tolerated in good times, for its contribution to the cheap labor pool, and 
deported in bad times, when jobs are scarce. Cast members deliver brief 
commentaries along these lines directly to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 However, "La Victima" is not a dry historical document. It focuses on the 
human drama -- or melodrama -- of a mother and her children. 
</P>
<P>
 Amparo (Lupe Ontiveros) is born in Mexico, just before her own mother flees 
the revolution. She grows up in California. During the Depression, Amparo and 
her jobless husband return to Mexico, but she's separated from her young son 
Samuel (Enrique Castillo) at the train station. He remains in the United 
States, adopted by a Mexican American family, and grows up to become an 
immigration agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Amparo's other children (Angela Moya and Sal Lopez) return to the 
States as adults to help pay the bills. After her husband dies, Amparo joins 
them, smuggled in under a car seat. When she visits her children on a picket 
line, guess who is the immigration officer who busts the strikers and 
interrogates the old woman before deporting her. No, it isn't Harold Ezell. 
</P>
<P>
 The play's final confrontation is eloquently played by Ontiveros and Castillo. 
Its didacticism is leavened with mild humor, well played by Lopez and Ontiveros 
but overdone by Evelina Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the play doesn't deal with some of the issues it raises. For example, 
how and why does Moya's character become a U.S. citizen while her brother, who 
emigrates at the same time, remains illegal? 
</P>
<P>
 This production is bare-bones compared to the one that played LATC. That one 
involved a clever use of suitcases and screens. A few of the actors speak too 
softly at times, and not everyone had learned the lyrics to all the songs. But 
the musical accompaniment, directed by Quetzal Flores and Jesus Perez, is 
solid. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps befitting its new home, this staging uses more Spanish than the one at 
LATC. A screen provides English translations for most of the songs and Spanish 
translations for some of the speeches that are spoken in English. The Latino 
Theatre Lab has changed its name to the Latino Theatre Company, but the old 
name is still used in the spoken introduction.

MOVIE REVIEW; SUBLIME 'MADAME DE . . .' RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Madame de . . . " is back in town. Maybe for only a week and with only one 
theater (the Nuart in West Los Angeles starting today) to her name. But no 
visitor could be more welcome, no matter what the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 An elegant, visually opulent piece of work, "The Earrings of Madame de . . ." 
(to give it its English-language title) is one of the high points of French 
romantic cinema as well as a sublime piece of filmmaking. Directed by Max 
Ophuls in 1953, "Madame de . . ." may not have a horde of American suitors, but 
those who know it admire it unreservedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Though its turn-of-the-century Paris story of the peregrinations of a pair of 
diamond earrings is little more than a trifle, Ophuls and his superb cast -- 
Danielle Darrieux, Charles Boyer, Vittorio de Sica -- turn it into a 
near-perfect jewel that rewards any number of viewings. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Madame de . . . (a countess whose last name we never learn) who is seen 
first, languidly searching through her luxurious closets for something to sell. 
A beautiful and pampered woman with the wit to describe herself as 
"incorrigible, frivolous, a liar," Madame de . . . (Darrieux) has fallen into 
debt she can no longer ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally the choice is made: a pair of earrings her husband (Boyer), a 
prominent general in the French army, bought her as a wedding present. She 
takes them to a jeweler who promises absolute secrecy. "We only sell to men 
because of women," he tells her. "Discretion is part of our profession." 
</P>
<P>
 But circumstances force the jeweler to confide in the general, and soon the 
earrings begin their romantic journey, headed first to Constantinople, then 
back to Paris, where every change in their ownership symbolizes the ebb and 
flow of love from one character to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing the jewels back from Constantinople is an Italian diplomat, Baron 
Fabrizio Donati (De Sica), a friend of the general's who is introduced to the 
notoriously fickle countess with the full expectation that the two will engage 
in a round of superficial flirtation. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the countess and the baron find themselves in danger of committing 
the ultimate sin in their heartless, deeply cynical world: genuinely caring for 
each other and allowing true emotion to air out their luxurious, suffocating 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Ophuls (who co-wrote the script based on a novel by Louise De Vilmorin) has 
the ideal temperament for this melancholy love story. He understands perfectly 
its world-weary milieu, a beautifully dressed and immaculately groomed universe 
where elaborate codes of honor mask a disdain for both caring and passion. 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, Ophuls as a director was as great a visual stylist as film has 
ever seen. His use of the camera (here with director of photography Christian 
Matras) is the stuff of legend, and seeing "Madame de . . ." underlines why 
critic Andrew Sarris (one of the film's greatest admirers) has said that Ophuls 
"gave camera movement its finest hours in the history of cinema." 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, with Steadicams and all kinds of gizmos available, no director has 
been able to match the sensual, caressing nature of Ophuls' almost continual 
camera movements, or the unself-conscious ease with which they are executed. 
"Madame de's . . ." visual centerpiece, a montage of a series of gliding, 
gilded balls in which the countess and the baron begin to realize they are 
falling in love, has to be one of the most visually sublime sequences ever put 
on film. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these splendors, "Madame de's . . ." actors manage not to be 
overshadowed. Darrieux is both stunning and subdued as the countess, Boyer 
properly imperious as the general, and De Sica, himself a formidable director, 
a wonderfully sincere suitor. Together, in the best 35mm print that's been 
available in some time, they constitute an event no lover of romantic cinema 
will want to miss.

MOVIE REVIEW; DAVIDSON OUT OF THIS WORLD IN 'STARGATE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 According to "Stargate," the great ancient Egyptian civilization that gave us 
the pyramids actually began on another planet -- the planet Abydos, millions of 
light-years from Earth. The film mainlines our fascination with that ancient 
culture by making its achievements -- quite literally -- otherworldly. 
</P>
<P>
 Now if only the rest of the film weren't so earthbound. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is a brainy, controversial Egyptologist 
hired for a top-secret military project translating the hieroglyphics on a 
giant, mysterious stone uncovered in 1928 in Giza, Egypt. This he does 
lickety-split. His conclusion: The stone is a giant ring -- a portal -- into 
another dimension. So, of course, when a time-traveling team headed up by the 
ramrod, disconsolate Col. Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) decides to pass through 
that portal, Daniel is on board. 
</P>
<P>
 The planet Abydos, with its desert-scapes and pachydermlike creatures and 
fur-cloaked denizens, seems to have been colonized by aliens from -- Hollywood. 
There's a lot of "Star Wars" on this orb, as well as portals to everything from 
"Lawrence of Arabia" to "The Man Who Would be King." (Of course, "Star Wars" 
wasn't exactly created from whole loincloth either.) Pretty soon we're mired in 
the usual science versus military squabbles, with Daniel doing his decoding 
thing in order to get the militia returned to Earth before the malevolent, 
godlike Ra, played by Jaye Davidson, incinerates them all. 
</P>
<P>
 All this nonsense is made intermittently enjoyable because of the 
Saturday-afternoon serial quality of the storytelling (which is full of holes). 
Director Roland Emmerich, who also co-wrote the script with Dean Devlin, 
doesn't take the mumbo-jumbo terribly seriously, although he doesn't pull the 
film through the portals of camp either. He respects the pop junkiness of the 
project. Even the tackiness of the sets and effects -- despite a budget upward 
of $60 million -- seems partly intentional. It's "Flash Gordon" with 
computerized whammies. 
</P>
<P>
 Spader is surprisingly funny and resilient as the Egyptologist who feels more 
at home on Abydos than he ever did on Earth. He fits into the planet's 
slave-like culture and becomes its crusader. He finds himself by losing himself 
in the solar system -- not a bad way to go these days. O'Neil, who is 
recovering from the accidental death of his son, has a buzz-cut and a cold 
stare; Russell is such a muscle-man tough-guy that he practically effaces 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The real hoot here is Jaye Davidson's Ra, with his hermaphrodite airs and 
flouncy Space-Age get-ups. Davidson's voice was apparently electronically 
altered to sound lower and boomier: He's like a fey Darth Vader, and he seems 
entranced by the Garbo-esque rapture of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Davidson "Stargate" might seem clunky and routine, but he gives it a 
weirdo charge. It may be a lousy movie, but it's a more enjoyably lousy movie 
than most.

JAZZ NOTES: 'JAZZ WEST COAST' OFFERS PANELS, SCREENINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The allure of hearing such jazz greats as Gerry Mulligan, Dave Brubeck, Harold 
Land, Bud Shank and Teddy Edwards is undoubtedly the main attraction of "Jazz 
West Coast," the four-day, KLON-FM-sponsored symposium that began Thursday at 
the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza Hotel in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the event is also composed of numerous panel discussions and three 
film screenings, says producer Ken Poston. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll add historical perspective," Poston says. "We wanted the event to 
cover several different aspects." 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 panels look at everything from the musically rich Central Avenue era in 
the mid-'40s to early '50s, to the hard bop scene that thrived in the Southland 
in the late '50s. Poston says the discussions, moving naturally from one 
chronological era to another, will spotlight almost all of the 100 musicians 
performing at "Jazz West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, some past greats who no longer perform -- such as drummer Stan 
Levey, who played with Charlie Parker, Stan Kenton and the Lighthouse All-Stars 
-- will take part, as well as arrangers, record executives and disc jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's panels -- held in various venues at the Crowne Plaza -- begin at 9 
a.m. with "The Lighthouse," a discussion of the famed Hermosa Beach room where 
bassist Howard Rumsey fronted the Lighthouse All-Stars from 1949 until the 
early '60s. On the panel will be Rumsey, trumpeter Conte Candoli, trombonist 
Milt Bernhart, Shank, Levey and others who will reminisce about the room, which 
was perhaps the central meeting point for jazz musicians in Southern California 
during that time period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The All-Stars was the gig that got me to leave Stan Kenton and come to 
California," Candoli, an Indiana native, said of his decision to join Rumsey in 
1954. "It was a great job. We got to play jazz every night, and we got $120 a 
week, which was a lot of money then." 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan, clarinet-tenorist Jimmy Giuffre and trumpeter Shorty Rogers are 
scheduled for an untitled panel today at 3:30 p.m., chaired by Poston. "These 
men were the key figures in the West Coast movement," says Poston, "and they'll 
talk about how it got ushered in, say by Gerry coming out here from New York to 
start the quartet with Chet Baker." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Record Companies," held Saturday at 9 a.m., will discuss how the West 
Coast scene was recorded; and Sunday at 9 a.m., the discussion will focus on 
late '50s changes in jazz in Los Angeles. During that era, avant-garde altoist 
Ornette Coleman first received notice -- playing with a quartet that included 
drummer Billy Higgins and bassist Charlie Haden -- and several other players, 
trumpeter Jack Sheldon and saxophonist Land among them, emphasized the ardently 
swinging style of hard bop. 
</P>
<P>
 Haden recalled hearing Coleman for the first time, when he sat in with 
Mulligan's quartet in 1957 at the Haig, a club in the mid-Wilshire area. "This 
alto player gets up on stage, and he had a white plastic alto," says Haden. 
"Boy, I mean as soon as he started playing, you could hear a pin drop. Then the 
musicians asked him to stop, and he stopped. And I thought, 'I've got to meet 
this guy.' " Haden did, joined Coleman and still plays with him to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 The rush and feeling of the West Coast scene will also be brought to life by 
screenings of films from the archives of collector/historian Mark Cantor. At 11 
a.m. today, Cantor will offer clips that show some pre-West Coast performers, 
including a rarely seen short with Lester Young and others playing "Pennies 
From Heaven" from the late 1940s. Then he'll show footage of the era, including 
a 1958 TV piece featuring the Lighthouse All-Stars and a 1961 film that 
spotlights the wondrous Gerry Mulligan-Ben Webster quintet -- with Jimmy 
Rowles, Leroy Vinnegar and Mel Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantor's final screening, on Saturday at 10:15 a.m., "picks up the pieces," he 
says, "where I'll show clips of important people that we haven't covered thus 
far." 
</P>
<P>
 Panels and screenings, offered at $8 each, may be purchased separately. For 
information or tickets, call (310) 985-5566, or 985-7000. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Vibes and Vocals: Remarkable vibist Gary Burton, justifiably acclaimed for his 
splendid four-mallet work, and jazz singer Rebecca Parris appear Saturday at 8 
p.m. at the Wadsworth Theater in Brentwood. Altoist Christopher Hollyday is the 
opening act. Information: (310) 825-2101, (213) 365-3500.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; THE MAD, DISORIENTING PITCH OF MIRANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Note to organizers of "Interview with the Vampire" premiere parties: Here's 
the rock band for you. Miranda Sex Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Troubadour on Tuesday, the English group's lead singer Katherine Blake 
wore a lacy nightgown, and the expression on her wide-eyed, doll-like face 
alternated between creepy grin and enigmatic smile.She looked all set for a 
stroll through the crypt. 
</P>
<P>
 The soundtrack that Blake, co-frontwoman Donna McKevitt and their four 
musicians provided was a sort of Gothic punk cabaret. The group started a few 
years ago as a madrigal-singing female trio, but now it's a full band whose 
latest album was produced by a member of the German sonic assault team 
Einsturzende Neubauten. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a good musical match for MSG's sense of mystery and dread. Many of the 
new songs evoke a dreamlike sense of dissolution, of self fading into 
nothingness, and the clamor the players unleashed on stage instilled an urgency 
into that sensibility without compromising its ethereal qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake's singing ranged from piercingly pure to Courtney Love rant, and 
violinist McKevitt occasionally stepped out to contribute stratospheric, 
wordless vocals straight out of contemporary avant-garde music. The music 
repeatedly wound up to a mad, disorienting pitch, and while it was sometimes 
sloppy, it was rarely less than effectively phantasmagoric. RICHARD CROMELIN

THEATER REVIEW; 'OLDER WOMAN': MORE REVUE THAN PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last place you'd look for a fierce, male-bashing feminist message is a 
raunchy play. But peel back the layers of lewd humor in "Young Man, Older 
Woman," which opened Tuesday at the Wiltern Theatre, and you get a harangue 
against self-absorbed men. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, calling this production, starring R&B singer-comic Millie Jackson, a 
play is a stretch. It's more of a rambling revue, with songs and X-rated skits 
roughly related to the theme of a woman's struggle for self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 With the tacky sets and the tinny-sounding band in the pit just under the 
stage, this musical comedy has the rough feel of old-time burlesque. Some of 
the jokes are just as dated, but they're delivered with such gusto that you 
don't really notice. 
</P>
<P>
 The loose thread of a plot, written and directed by Doug and Helen Smith, 
concerns a wife, played by Jackson, whose husband is turned off by her weight 
gain. Hoping to hang on to him, she trims down, but that doesn't work. She has 
a breakdown and spends the rest of the play in therapy, where she winds up 
having more impact on her young doctor than he has on her. 
</P>
<P>
 At more than 2 1/2 hours, the show needs tightening. Paring the weak songs by 
Jackson's daughter, Keisha, and the so-so aerobic dance number by Kenny 
Montague would help. 
</P>
<P>
 As the disgruntled husband, comedian Reynaldo Rey steals the first part of the 
show with his glib delivery and a hilarious rap parody. Douglas Knyght, as the 
doctor, has amusing moments, but he is overshadowed by Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, one of R&B's most dynamic performers, has been making her living as a 
singer who dabbles in comedy. What she should be, though, is a comedian who 
dabbles in singing. She's peerless in the crude, street-humor genre -- at times 
as dagger-sharp as Richard Pryor was at his '70s best. 
</P>

MUSIC REVIEW; TENOR DE LA MORA DELIVERS VOCAL GOODS IN L.A. DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Already a veteran of La Scala, the Vienna Staatsoper and the Deutsche Oper 
Berlin, Mexican tenor Fernando De La Mora finally got around to making his Los 
Angeles debut Wednesday at Ambassador Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-styled protege of Placido Domingo aimed to please with his slate of 
popular songs and arias in Spanish, French and Italian, and on that score he 
certainly delivered the goods.Some listeners would have welcomed a greater 
range of repertory than the sentimental fare chosen for this occasion, however. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, De La Mora's recital became a kind of one-note samba, that note 
being the high note seemingly at the center of every song and his musical 
universe -- generally delivered with a big step forward and arms spread wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake, De La Mora has a voice, and he has mastered the oratory of 
this music and its presentation. He floated elegantly, with the help of the 
limpid accompaniment of pianist Thomas Muraco, through opening songs by Mompou, 
Obradors and Grever. He offered a suave "Le reve" from "Manon" and then opened 
up big -- weepy catch and all -- for Cilea's "Lamento di Federico." Neapolitan 
songs by Tosti, Cardillo and De Curtis ("Torna a Surriento") were sung with all 
the polish, fluidity and fervency one could ask for. As the concert progressed 
his voice took on an added luster (there had been some slight hoarseness, 
earlier), and his top notes resounded impressively. TIMOTHY MANGAN

 For everyone who hankers for the deli's superb smoked fish, the opening of 
Barney Greengrass here is terrific news. Not only are they flying in the smoked 
sturgeon and sable, the New York bagels and the Brooklyn-baked bialys also take 
the red-eye along with the pickled herring and the deli's special caramelized 
onions. They've even got New York water -- well, sort of. Using a process the 
restaurant calls "reverse osmosis," our local bog-water is filtered to match 
New York's H2O. 
</P>
<P>
 I stepped off the elevator, took one look at the display of smoked fish and 
immediately called a friend who I knew would go crazy over it. He wasn't there, 
so I left a message to meet us at Barney Greengrass. While waiting for him, we 
devoured an order of pickled herring in cream sauce. We happily spread ivory 
cream cheese on toasted bialys and polished off an entire platter of smoked 
sturgeon and Nova Scotia salmon. He never showed. 
</P>
<P>
 When we got home, there was a plaintive message on our answering machine: 
"Where the hell are you guys? In New York?"

WONDERFUL TINKERING BY ROSEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kay Rosen is a tinkerer, playing with words and letters as if they were 
discarded radio parts, odd bolts and stray pieces of wire. In her small text 
paintings at Richard Telles Fine Art, strange and wonderful things happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions are distilled so that they are transformed into their own answers. 
Words are layered so they become their opposites. Letters are switched so that 
the words they compose seem to reveal themselves for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 It's tempting to call Rosen a slacker semiologist. Her work is rather smart 
and quite dumb. 
</P>
<P>
 One canvas reads, "Elvis livEs." The phrase is rendered in gold, pseudo-Gothic 
letters, a pat reference to both the excess and the ersatz of the King's late 
years. What's amusing is that the two words are distorted reflections of one 
another, precisely like the sentence they spell out: at once a cliche and a 
declaration of faith. 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious question is why transform palindromes, puns and linguistic jokes 
into images anyway? It's a gratuitous move. But it's also logical, because art 
is a rule-based language. Like all Postmodern hipsters, Rosen knows that it is 
only in the cracks and slips that art's workings are revealed. She spells out 
those moments of rupture, and demonstrates that interesting work can be done 
there. 
</P>

THEATER BEAT: HARD TO COMMIT TO WHITEFIRE'S 'LOVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boy meets girl, boy gets girl pregnant, boy keeps girl at arm's length -- that 
pretty much summarizes the plot of "Careless Love," John Olive's spare, 
strangely unaffecting drama at the Whitefire Theatre in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 First performed in 1984, the play tackles a touchy, heavily politicized 
subject -- pregnancy outside marriage -- but thankfully never devolves into 
propaganda for either free love or family values. The playwright uses pregnancy 
mostly as a device to highlight two young people's inability to commit to one 
another. As it explores emotional numbness, though, "Careless Love" itself 
grows numbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Tanzillo turns in a creditable performance as Jack, an aspiring Chicago 
actor who verges on a parody of unenlightened machismo . He's the kind of 
bachelor who keeps curdled milk in his refrigerator and enters his apartment by 
bowing to a portrait of Jackie Gleason. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Martha (a promisingly unaffected Leonora Scelfo), a pretty dance student 
who becomes pregnant during a fling with Jack. The two wrangle over a panoply 
of family issues -- adoption, abortion, career, cohabitation, marriage -- yet 
the text feels thin and repetitive, as if Olive were biding time for a dramatic 
payoff at the final curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Richard D. Scelfo hasn't found a way to make this love seem anything 
more than aimless. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Careless Love," Whitefire Theatre, 13500 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends Nov. 28. $12. (818) 992-6040. 
Running time: 2 hours, 20 minutes. Herman Strengthens 'Paradise' at Angels 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford Odets' plays are deceptively difficult to perform well. His 
characters wear their hearts on their sleeves, but if played that way their 
harangues against capitalist injustice can sound stilted and phony. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the case in "Paradise Lost," Odets' tale of the decline and fall of a 
middle-class family during the Depression, which is getting a shaky revival 
from the Company of Angels in Silverlake. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 characters travel in and out of the impossibly busy Gordon 
household, presided over by obtuse yet benevolent patriarch Leo (Ed Trotta). 
Odets sketches these personalities with his usual sensitivity to people's 
dreams and illusions, but director Kenneth R. Klimak and cast are too often not 
up to the challenge of presenting flawed, complicated characters. 
</P>
<P>
 The sole noteworthy performance comes from Harry Herman, who turns 
flibbertigibbet in-law Gus Michaels into a tragic figure trapped in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Paradise Lost," the Angels Theater, 2106 Hyperion Ave., Silverlake. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends Nov. 19. $12.50-$15. (213)

THEATER BEAT: 'MRS. CAGE' RETURNS WITH HAUNTING FORCE AT STAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darkness. A confusion of sounds reconstruct a random act of violence, bereft 
of context or meaning. A robbery. A shooting. Someone has died. 
</P>
<P>
 Spotlight upon a solitary stool, where the perfectly composed title character 
of "Mrs. Cage" (Barbara Bain) begins her deadpan eyewitness statement to the 
enigmatic police lieutenant (Lionel Mark Smith) assigned to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a remarkable narrative, and an extraordinary pair of performances in this 
Stages Theatre Center revival of Nancy Barr's 1987 drama. The seemingly 
disconnected fragments of Mrs. Cage's life as an alienated housewife -- ironing 
her lawyer/husband's shirts, grocery shopping, the theme from "Rawhide," and 
the search for a parking space -- prove inseparable from the horrifying 
occurrence that killed the young supermarket bag boy who used to flirt with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaving these disparate threads into her circuitous account, Bain evokes a 
chilling vision of a woman who lost everything she cared about in a single day, 
leaving behind a hollow shell beyond redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 As he listens, Smith reveals a sympathetic bond grounded in his character's 
own agonies, yet draws a crisp line at the limits of human compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Verdier's stark staging heightens the mounting tension through eerie 
monotone delivery punctured by emotional eruptions. Tight spotlights on the 
characters echo their narrow corridors of self-definition. 
</P>
<P>
 This intense inquiry into the potential for violence underlying the most 
commonplace encounters will certainly make you think twice before braving an 
express checkout lane with more than the allowed number of items. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Mrs. Cage," Stages Theatre Center, 1540 N. McCadden Place, Hollywood. 
Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends Dec. 4. $18. (213) 
466-1767. Running time: 1 hour, 20 minutes. 'Two Faced' Touches at Theatre 1761 
</P>
<P>
 "Two Faced" at Theatre 1761 is about betrayal, but not in the usual sense. 
This solo performance piece by Lynne Adams is a funny, insightful and touching 
portrait of a woman's discovery that she's been living out other people's 
expectations while ignoring her own authentic identity. Gazing in a mirror, she 
says, "I couldn't recognize the middle-aged fat woman staring back at me." 
</P>
<P>
 The initial sight of Adams' unnamed divorcee scrambling into a wig and makeup 
to help land a new job is sure to strike a resonant chord in the midst of a 
society obsessed with youthful appearance. In the series of short scenes that 
comprise the play, we trace this woman's rocky path through career re-entry, 
depression, new-found romance, inevitable disillusionment and, ultimately, the 
calm acceptance of someone who's finally found her center and recognized the 
boundaries of her life. She's earned the generosity and hope she achieves. 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Brooke Adams' direction is brisk, focused and attentive to shifts in 
tone, although some territory is covered more than once. Trimming 10 minutes 
and playing the piece straight through without a break would make for a tighter 
presentation.  
</P>
<P>
 The play's issues may be familiar, to be sure, but the clarity and honesty in 
Adams' performance makes "Two Faced" an affecting -- and noteworthy -- personal 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Two Faced," Theatre 1761, 1761 N. Vermont Ave., Los Angeles. Thursdays, 
Fridays, Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7:30 p.m. Runs indefinitely. $15. (213) 
660-TKTS. Running time: 1 hour, 50 minutes. Noise Within's Fresh 'School for 
Scandal' 
</P>
<P>
 Re-envisioning "The School for Scandal," Richard Brinsley Sheridan's 1777 
comedy of manners, as a 1950s-style sitcom is something of a departure from the 
scrupulously literal stagings usually associated with A Noise Within classical 
repertory company, but Art Manke's energetic staging injects a refreshing 
sparkle into a familiar warhorse. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not an inappropriate resetting, either -- the spectacle of a rakish 
egoist (Eric David Johnson) secreting his guardian (Mitchell Edmonds) in a 
closet while simultaneously concealing the guardian's wayward wife (Jill Hill) 
plays with the frenetic appeal of an "I Love Lucy" episode. 
</P>
<P>
 The large ensemble handily sustains the momentum, highlighted by deft 
performances from Dierk Torseck, Emily Heebner and Preston Maybank. Only the 
characterization of Lady Sneerwell (Gail Shapiro) as a cocaine-tooting vamp may 
seem confusingly present-day, although drug abuse is hardly unique to our time. 
Director Manke took one liberty in transforming the unstageably anti-Semitic 
figure of the moneylender Moses into a generic loan shark named Racket (Robert 
Prescovitz). 
</P>
<P>
 For all its updated satirical jabs at the aristocracy, the production remains 
faithful to the humanistic core of Sheridan's comedy -- its innate warm-toned 
affection for people, despite their foibles, that never goes out of style. 
</P>
<P>

THEATER REVIEWS; 'ROMANCING THE ORANGE' REBUFFS ANY ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, way back in the prehistory of 1992, it seemed the Orange 
County Crazies might become a home-grown troupe with an underground 
sensibility. They had done a handful of slightly subversive shows that 
cultivated a naughty attitude toward suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crazies didn't just knock South Coast Plaza and Disneyland or lampoon 
Irvine liberals, Laguna Beach gays and Newport Beach yuppies, they sent up 
lonely-heart singles, women addicted to shoulder pads, Latino machismo, Jewish 
guilt, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, county supervisors, Garden Grove 
preachers. 
</P>
<P>
 If this politically incorrect troupe was vulgar and thin on talent (except for 
a few performers mainly from Los Angeles), it was at least intermittently 
funny. With "Romancing the Orange" -- their 18th and latest show -- the Crazies 
are still vulgar and politically incorrect. But they are less imaginative, 
thinner on talent and not funny at all. On opening night I counted the laughs 
on one hand and still had three fingers left. 
</P>
<P>
 In a truly underwhelming presentation, the revue offers a dozen or so fleeting 
yet time-consuming skits that don't even rise to the level of mediocre 
sketches. The writing never makes good on the promise of the skit titles -- 
"Hookers on Phonics," "Miss Little Saigon," "Eine Kleine Cucaracha," among 
others -- and the performances sink below awful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The show's overall title, a dated reference to the 10-year-old movie 
"Romancing the Stone," holds still less promise as the idea for a motif: a 
running gag between skits about two horny lovers who are trailed to various 
malls by a gumshoe. Stampeding shoppers keep wrecking the lovers' assignations 
and leave the woman increasingly battered, so that she eventually looks like a 
bandaged crash victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The production also appears to be seriously under-rehearsed, not that more 
rehearsal could save it. What it could do, though, is speed things up. You 
could knit sweaters in the setup time between skits. In fact, opening night 
might have been called "Concert in the Dark." Keyboard player Tom Zink's jazzy 
music, meant to cover the scene changes, actually came to dominate the show. 
Lucky for us Zink had a professional touch. Too bad it was the only one. 
</P>
<P>
 Side note:"Romancing the Orange" inaugurates a new performance space for the 
Crazies in the basement of the same downtown building where they've operated 
for years. Roughly 35 people attended the opening. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Romancing the Orange," Orange County Crazies Theatre, 115 E. Santa Ana 
Blvd., Santa Ana. 8 p.m. Saturdays. Ends Dec. 10. $12. (714) 550-9900. Running

THEATER REVIEWS; 'BABY WITH BATHWATER' BITES WITH BITTER HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Community rooms at public parks are designed to bring people together. 
Christopher Durang comedies insist there's no real hope in bringing people 
together. So seeing a Christopher Durang comedy in a community room is a pretty 
curious experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The room at Turtle Rock Community Park is the ill-fitting home of the Irvine 
Community Theatre, where it is staging Durang's "Baby With the Bathwater" with 
all the muscle director Todd Kulczyk's company can exercise. There isn't a 
moment in this play that isn't cruelly bitter, and also hardly a moment without 
a laugh that sometimes catches in the throat like a chicken bone. The Irvine 
folks make you chuckle and choke, just as Durang intends. 
</P>
<P>
 Right off, there's the visual dissonance of rotund Helen (Sofia Moraes) 
married to tall John (Karl Person), both of them so oblivious to their new baby 
that they think he's a she named Daisy. Maybe the Nanny (La Donna de Barrios) 
will do a better nurturing job, but Daisy keeps running, perhaps suicidally, 
toward moving buses or hiding in piles of laundry. This baby is really made of 
stuffing. But for once in a comedy, the prop is more than just a joke: It's how 
Helen and John view their child. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain of Durang's conceit only sets in when Daisy grows up -- into a very 
confused young man (Timothy Titus) who spends much of his time in dresses and 
at the shrink's office. To add to the post-modern confusion, John has become a 
lush and a Christian Scientist at the same time, and Helen is still struggling 
with the real "baby" in her life, her novel-not-so-in-progress. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Durang suggests that the Young Man may grow into the adult his parents never 
became, but that's doubtful. In Durang's world, evil usually wins, the innocent 
are abused and the good are irrelevant or invisible, and in this community 
room, that message is therefore all the tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 Kulczyk turns the extreme disadvantage of the room's absurdly shallow stage 
into a strength. The comedy, without the traditional shadings and 
characterizations, is all flat and in primary colors, which matches nicely with 
this flat space. 
</P>
<P>
 He nudges good deadpan performances out of just about everyone, from Person's 
blank confusion to Moraes' fretful myopia to biting cameos by Beth Titus and 
Jan Briggs. Barrios could be much more frightening as the nanny from hell, but 
she's physically imposing enough to scare any baby. Timothy Titus carries the 
tragic weight well, though he needs to squeeze more acid humor out of his 
lines. 
</P>
<P>

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; MEMORIES OF BURT LANCASTER, RAUL JULIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burt Lancaster, who died last week, has a huge body of work on video -- one of 
the largest of any movie star. Sixty-one of his 70 movies are on tape and many 
will be on prominent display in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Julia, who died Monday, is well represented on video too, with 31 of his 
movies on tape. Many feature him in supporting roles because he didn't really 
become a movie star until his acclaimed performance in 1985's "Kiss of the 
Spider Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to Lancaster, you'll be faced with a big selection. You can't go 
wrong with the following movies: All are dramas featuring outstanding 
performances: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sorry, Wrong Number" (Paramount, 1948). Barbara Stanwyck's movie all the way. 
Her performance in this thriller, as a dominating, bedridden wife who thinks 
her wimpy husband (Lancaster) is plotting to kill her, earned her an Oscar 
nomination. Though never that good at playing weak characters, he's very 
effective in this one. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Here to Eternity" (Columbia TriStar, 1953). In one of the most 
entertaining films of the 1950s, Lancaster plays tough Sgt. Milt Warden in a 
drama about soldiers on an Army base in Hawaii just before the bombing of Pearl 
Harbor. The story of a rebellious private (Montgomery Clift) is woven into the 
tale of the sergeant's affair with an officer's wife (Deborah Kerr). The 
lovers' kiss on the beach in the crashing waves is one of the most famous 
romantic scenes in film history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rose Tattoo" (Paramount, 1955). A Southern widow (Anna Magnani) clings to 
her husband's memories until she starts romancing a macho truck driver 
(Lancaster). Impact of this intense drama is largely due to Magnani's 
Oscar-winning performance. Lancaster is fine, but largely a foil for her great 
portrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rainmaker" (Paramount, 1956). In a sort of tuneup for "Elmer Gantry," 
Lancaster plays a con man who promises rain to a drought-ridden small town and 
gets involved with a spinster (Katharine Hepburn).  
</P>
<P>
 "Sweet Smell of Success" (1957, MGM/UA). Overlooked in many of the media 
remembrances of Lancaster, his performance in this compelling drama as J.J. 
Hunsecker, the evil gossip columnist, is arguably the best of his career. This 
character, who's trying to discredit his sister's boyfriend, was a complete 
turnaround for Lancaster, who normally played the good guy. "Separate Tables" 
(MGM/UA, 1958). Assorted unhappy people in a "Grand Hotel"-style drama set at a 
small British seaside resort. Lancaster is paired with Rita Hayworth as a 
divorced couple trying to reconcile. Great acting by an all-star cast, 
particularly David Niven (best actor Oscar) and Wendy Hiller (supporting 
actress Oscar). 
</P>
<P>
 "Elmer Gantry" (MGM/UA, 1960). Lancaster's portrayal of an unscrupulous, small 
town evangelist won him an Oscar. Among his top three performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judgment at Nuremberg" (MGM/UA. 1961). An examination of the Holocaust and 
its consequences at the trial of German war criminals in 1948. Lancaster's 
performance as a German accused of war crimes is fine but he pales next to 
Spencer Tracy and Maximillian Schell (best actor Oscar), among others. Strong 
drama, still effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Birdman of Alcatraz" (MGM/UA, 1962). Lancaster plays Robert Stroud, a 
convicted murderer who becomes a world-renowned authority on birds. 
Appreciating the nuances of Lancaster's subtle performance keeps you interested 
in this very slow, claustrophobic movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seven Days in May" (Paramount, 1964). An American general (Lancaster) angered 
by the pacifist President plots a military takeover, which another officer 
(Kirk Douglas) uncovers. Spine-tingling political thriller builds to terrific 
climax.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Train" (MGM, 1965). Gripping World War II thriller about a train 
inspector (Lancaster) helping the French Resistance stop a train filled with 
priceless art that a German officer (Paul Scofield) is shipping from Paris to 
Germany. Top-notch suspense drama. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Professionals" (Columbia TriStar, 1966). Any Western fan will tell you 
that this is one of the genre's all-time greats. Lancaster is part of a band of 
mercenaries on a mission to retrieve a cattle baron's wife from a gang of 
Mexican outlaws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ulzana's Raid" (MCA/Universal, 1972). This violent Western hardly ever gets a 
mention when Lancaster's best movies are listed -- but it deserves one. He 
plays a scout helping the calvary track Ulzana, the marauding Apache. Absorbing 
and well-written. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go Tell the Spartans" (Warner, 1978). Set in 1964 in Vietnam, Lancaster plays 
a major in a garrison under Viet Cong attack. Until "Platoon" in 1986, this was 
the best American movie about the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 "Atlantic City" (Paramount, 1981). One of 1981's most acclaimed dramas, it's 
the richly metaphorical tale of an aging hood (Lancaster) who falls for a 
waitress (Susan Sarandon) and also falls into a small fortune. Directed by 
Louis Malle, it has the slow, deliberate pace of a European art film. His best 
post mid-'60s performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The following are all good entertainment but notches below his best works: 
"The Flame and The Arrow" (1950), "Come Back, Little Sheba" (1952), "Jim Thorpe 
-- All American" (1951), "Vera Cruz" (1953), "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" 
(1957), "Run Silent, Run Deep" (1958), "The Unforgiven" (1960), "Scorpio" 
(1973), "1900" (1976), "Local Hero" (1983) and "Tough Guys" (1986). 
</P>
<P>
 Best movies not on video: his first film, the terrific crime drama "The 
Killers" (1946); director Jules Dassin's "Brute Force" (1947) -- one of the 
better prison films ever made -- and director Luchino Visconti's Italian-French 
"The Leopard" (1963). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 RAUL JULIA: Most film fans know Julia's three biggest hits -- as the 
imprisoned political activist in "Kiss of the Spider Woman" (Nelson 
Entertainment, 1985), and as ghoulish Gomez Addams in "The Addams Family" 
(Paramount, 1991) and "Addams Family Values" (Paramount, 1993).  
</P>
<P>
 But he also was noted for giving strong supporting performances, often 
outshining the stars in some so-so big-budget movies -- such as "Tequila 
Sunrise" (Warner, 1988) with Mel Gibson and Kurt Russell; "Havana" 
(MCA/Universal, 1990), which stars Robert Redford; "The Rookie" (Warner, 1990), 
featuring Clint Eastwood and Charlie Sheen, and "The Morning After" (Warner, 
1986), with Jane Fonda and Jeff Bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 To savor his finest supporting work in a quality movie, see "Presumed 
Innocent" (Paramount, 1990). He plays an attorney for the assistant district 
attorney (Harrison Ford) accused of murder in a riveting courtroom drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Unheralded Julia movies worth a look: 
</P>
<P>
 "Romero" (Vidmark, 1989). Julia gives one of the best performances of his 
career in this little-known movie, a biography of the heroic archbishop of El 
Salvador who was assassinated in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tango Bar" (Warner, 1988). During its theatrical run, this movie was dubbed a 
political musical. In a celebration of the tango against a backdrop of 
Argentina's tangled politics, Julia plays a married dancer who gets involved 
with his former partner after a 10-year separation. If you like the tango, 
you'll like this movie. In Spanish, with subtitles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Penitent" (LIVE, 1988). An interesting, oddball tale about a romantic 
triangle in a village where re-enacting Christ's Crucifixion is an annual 
event. Armand Assante plays a rogue who seduces the wife of his pal (Julia).  
</P>
<P>
 Julia movies to skip: "Compromising Positions" (1985), "Moon Over Parador" 
(1988), "Onassis" (1988), "Mack the Knife" (1989), "The Plague" (1992) and "A 
Life of Sin" (1992).

FROST'S HOT PUTTER CUTS THE FOG; GOLF: HE SHOOTS 66 TO SHARE FIRST-ROUND LEAD 
OF TOUR CHAMPIONSHIP WITH THREE OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It just had to be. The fog was so dense Thursday at the Olympic Club that the 
only player named after a weather condition is tied for the lead after the 
first round of the Tour Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 David Frost shot a five-under-par 66, a score matched by Bill Glasson, Mark 
McCumber and Steve Lowery, whose round included a hole in one, as the year's 
wealthiest players on the PGA Tour teed off in the year's richest tour event. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery used a nine-iron to ace the 130-yard eighth hole for his first hole in 
one on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it was a good time to do it," he said. "It flew close and spun by and 
hopped right in." 
</P>
<P>
 On the first day of the $3-million tournament, there were a lot of balls 
hopping right in. Thirteen of the 30 players in the field had scores in the 
60s, scores made possible by the damp weather, which softened greens on the 
Lake Course into friendly catcher's mitts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fog kept the greens soft," Lowery said. "I know they can really play firm 
and fast, but they were a little more receptive today." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, Frost is a big fan of fog. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the sun stays away, the greens are going to stay soft," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost took advantage of the greens with a consistent putter. He needed only 24 
putts, 11 of them on the front nine, after an early-morning revelation in his 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost grabbed the putter out of his bag, moved his right hand down the grip 
and knew he was onto something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose it helps, you know, fiddling with the grip sometimes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also helps if you can see the flagsticks. Because of the fog, Frost 
couldn't see the flag on the first hole or the 11th hole -- before his second 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 McCumber's problems were even more acute. Listed at 5 feet 8, his line of 
sight was already restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 "My round today started in a fog," he said. "My golf game seemed to match the 
weather. You can't see your targets clearly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of nice trees here -- if you can see them." 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to look very far to find the rest of the golfers who had a good 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Fehr, who is alone at 67, put off hernia surgery this week to play for 
the $540,000 winner's share. 
</P>
<P>
 At 68 are Ernie Els and Phil Mickelson. Greg Norman, Corey Pavin, Mark Brooks, 
Bruce Lietzke and Jay Haas shot 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Glasson has had his best year on the tour, winning $557,110, which was 22nd on 
the money list. He won at Phoenix and had six top-10 finishes in 20 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about his driving, Glasson wasn't sure how he was going to play. He 
missed four fairways and four greens but made up for it with his putting. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed a four-foot birdie putt on No. 17 and a five-footer on No. 15, but 
Glasson was satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost, playing with Glasson, had four birdies on the front nine and the lowest 
score at the turn, a 31. He began with a birdie on the 533-yard first hole when 
he hit a sand wedge to 10 feet and made the putt. 
</P>
<P>
 He made a 10-footer at No. 5 for another birdie and added birdies on Nos. 8 
and 9. On No. 8, where Lowery made his ace, Frost hit an eight-iron 15 feet 
behind the hole and made the putt. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost's only birdie on the back nine was at the 522-yard 17th, where he sank a 
six-footer. 
</P>
<P>
 McCumber made his move after the turn. He had five birdies on the back side, 
including three in four holes from No. 10 through No. 13 on putts of 15, seven 
and 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished with a two-foot birdie putt on No. 16, a five-foot birdie putt on 
No. 17 and a 10-foot par putt on 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, McCumber said he would like to do it all over again, fog or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can promise me 66, I'll be foggy for the front nine every day," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With 13 players under 70 after the first round, there's no telling who is 
going to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost was asked to pick a winner. He couldn't do it. He hadn't the foggiest.

<P>
 Bill Cowher, Pittsburgh Steeler coach, is not in the malaprop league yet with 
Ralph Kiner or Jerry Coleman, but he's trying. A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On a 14-10 victory Oct. 16 over the winless Cincinnati Bengals: "It wasn't 
a Mozart." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "We're not attempting to circumcise the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "He takes a licking and keeps on ticking, like that Eveready bunny." 
</P>

 Trivia time: What NCAA Division I-A school has the record for the longest 
football winning streak? 
</P>
<P>
 Natural born ham: David Casstevens of the Arizona Republic reports that 
Charles Barkley of the Phoenix Suns will appear in Billy Crystal's new movie, 
"Forget Paris," along with some of his teammates and Coach Paul Westphal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a cross between Yul Brynner and Denzel Washington," Casstevens quoted 
Barkley as saying, adding that Barkley "loves the camera second only to 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmail?Mike Ditka, trying to downplay -- but not quite -- his longtime feud 
with Buddy Ryan: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what he does, how he does it, when he does it or where he does 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to figure out what kind of pictures he had of that guy in 
Arizona (owner Bill Bidwill) to get that job." 
</P>
<P>
 Boo hoo: Robert Horry of the Houston Rockets on the team's lack of identity: 
"I don't think anybody outside the Houston city limits realizes we won the 
(NBA) championship. We didn't get the hype we deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I traveled to other cities and they don't even know who the Rockets are." 
</P>
<P>
 Omen for the season?Missing airplane flights isn't unusual for athletes, or 
anybody else for that matter, but give Alton Lister of the Milwaukee Bucks 
credit for an original excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 After missing a team flight to San Antonio for an exhibition game, he said he 
got lost in the fog on the way to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Truly Dizzy: In the 1934 World Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and 
Detroit Tigers, Cardinal pitcher Dizzy Dean, performing as a pinch-runner, was 
hit on the head by a ball thrown by Tiger shortstop Billy Rogell, prompting a 
classic headline:  
</P>
<P>
 "X-RAYS OF DEAN'S HEAD SHOW NOTHING." 
</P>
<P>
 Prime-time flops: Bill Benner of the Indianapolis Star writes that Purdue 
continues to be "Toob Boobs" after losing to Ohio State last Saturday, 48-14. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Purdue's 26th national or regional television appearance since 1985 -- 
and it lost for the 25th time. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1973, Gail Goodrich scored 49 points and Elmore 
Smith set an NBA record with 17 blocked shots as the Lakers defeated the 
Portland Trail Blazers, 111-98.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: DISH IS SELLING LIKE 18-INCH HOT CAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First, there was the compact disc. Now comes the compact dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the affordable 18-inch satellite dish so many have been waiting for 
is here. 
</P>
<P>
 RCA is producing the dishes and accessory equipment -- a digital receiver box 
and a remote control -- with DirecTV of El Segundo, a division of GM Hughes 
Electronics, supplying the signal. 
</P>
<P>
 GM Hughes, with a total investment of $1 billion, has put two new 
communication satellites 22,300 miles above the earth, each with a signal 
strong enough to reach a smaller dish. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-inch dish system, which went on the market in Los Angeles about three 
weeks ago, provides 150 channels. A system retails for $699. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial L.A. shipment of systems -- about 10,000 to 250 retail outlets -- 
sold out in two weeks, prompting retailers to begin restocking. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddy Hartenstein, the president of DirecTV, said expectations are to have this 
system in 10 million homes nationwide by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The compact dish could have a bigger impact on sports viewing than anything 
since the VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the channel capacity, sports fans will be able to get every sports 
network imaginable, including seven regional sports networks outside 
California, depending on how much they want to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of the compact dish is well timed, since the NFL this season 
launched its Sunday Ticket package for satellite dish owners. 
</P>
<P>
 DirecTV has made an agreement with the NFL that will allow it to offer the 
final five weeks of the season, beginning Nov. 27, to customers for $49.95. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL Sunday Ticket and the ESPN/ABC college football pay-per-view packages 
have been big hits with those who can get them. 
</P>
<P>
 But to get the NFL Sunday Ticket, it takes an expensive and cumbersome 
satellite dish. 
</P>
<P>
 And most cable companies don't have the channel capacity to offer all the 
college pay-per-view games that are available. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-inch dish solves those problems. 
</P>
<P>
 If a consumer is interested, should he or she wait for the price to come down? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's already reasonably priced, and if there is a reduction it won't be until 
at least the middle of next year," Hartenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday Ticket package, which offers up to 12 NFL games each Sunday, seems 
to be popular with most sports-bar owners, who generally pay between $399 and 
$2,700 for it, depending on seating capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 But some have avoided paying the fees and are showing games illegally, 
arousing the wrath of the NFL. Last week, the league filed lawsuits against 20 
Southland sports bars that were showing games without authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL also announced two hot line numbers, (800) 553-4NFL or (800) 313-4NFL, 
for reporting unauthorized showings. The NFL figures sports-bar owners who have 
paid will report competitors who have not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bad part about the NFL Sunday Ticket package is that the sports bars are 
not allowed to show blacked-out Raider and Ram games, something they did before 
this business became legitimate -- and controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 John Morris, co-owner of the Legends chain in Long Beach, Santa Monica, Costa 
Mesa, Redondo Beach and a new one in West Covina, believes he has a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could get Al Davis and Georgia Frontiere to lift the blackouts, I'd be 
willing to charge $5 a person at the door and turn all the money over to them," 
he said. "That adds up to about $5,000 a Sunday from just our places. 
</P>
<P>
 "Figure in all the sports bars in Southern California, and I believe the Rams 
or Raiders could pull in around $300,000 every Sunday one of them have a 
blacked-out game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the NFL Sunday Ticket package has been a plus for sports bars, the 
baseball strike and the hockey lockout have been killers. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris figures his business is off 25% at the four Legends bars that existed a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he will make about $250,000 less this October than he did last 
October, simply because there are no baseball playoffs or World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just figuring the lack of baseball, but the lack of hockey hurts us too," 
Morris said. "The really bad part is all the little people that get hurt -- the 
bartenders and waitresses, food and goods distributors, people like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Cirivello, who with his brothers, Dominic and Angelo, owns a sports bar in 
Long Beach, protested the work stoppages Tuesday night with a Halloween 
lynching of baseball and hockey on the street in front of the bar. The hangings 
were complete with gallows, a hangman, a hearse, a drum roll and a trumpeter 
playing taps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New concept: Are you ready for this? Sports might be finding a new outlet -- 
home shopping networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchandise Entertainment Television (MET), a new 24-hour home-shopping 
network in Solana Beach, Calif., will televise six of the California Cup races 
-- the third through the eighth -- Saturday from the Oak Tree meeting at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 In between the races, they will hawk merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 MET this month also announced a three-year agreement with the Continental 
Basketball Assn. The network will carry two games a week when the season starts 
Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the NBA and other sports leagues be far behind? TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox crew working the Ram-New Orleans game last Sunday generally did a good 
job on a wild game, but the announcers could have done a better job of 
explaining why the Rams' Robert Bailey could pick up a punt in the end zone and 
return it 103 yards for a touchdown. Many viewers were probably confused, 
thinking once the ball landed in the end zone it was a touchback. It appeared 
the Saints thought that. What announcers Joe Buck and Tim Green failed to point 
out was that the ball has to be downed if it doesn't bounce out of the end 
zone. Most punts that go into the end zone end up bouncing out for an automatic 
touchback. Also, when Ram offensive line coach Jim Erkenbeck was accidentally 
knocked out by a Saint player on the sidelines, the announcers said it was 
special teams coach Wayne Sevier, no doubt causing his wife and family some 
concern. At least the mistake was corrected after a commercial break. 
</P>
<P>
 Up and comer: Harvey Hyde, former Nevada Las Vegas and Pasadena City College 
coach who does a weeknight sports-talk show for Las Vegas' KDWN, has been doing 
college football commentary for Radio Sports Creation national broadcasts on 
the American Sports Radio Network (ASRN) this season. He did last Saturday's 
UCLA-Arizona game and is scheduled to work the Notre Dame-USC game Nov. 26. 
Said Hyde's boss, Richard Grishar, ASRN president: "Harvey is tremendous, a 
combination of John Madden and Hank Stram. He's sees things nobody else does. 
The problem is that he is so good we probably won't be able to hold onto him." 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended viewing: "Sports Greats: One on One With David Hartman" makes its 
debut on ESPN Tuesday at 4:30 p.m., with profiles on Ken Griffey Jr., Troy 
Aikman and Hakeem Olajuwon. The series was created by Angela Wilder, wife of 
James Worthy, who is also an executive producer. Other executive producers of 
the show are Jim Spence, former No. 2 man at ABC Sports behind Roone Arledge, 
and Frank Wheaton, a Century City sports and entertainment agent. The show is 
produced and directed by Frederick Smith Jr. . . . Recommended listening: ESPN 
Enterprises and Tommy Boy Music are marketing a compact disc and cassette 
entitled "Jock Rock" that consists of songs, chants and cheers heard at 
ballparks and arenas. . . . Recommended for kids: An NFL Films series, "Grunt & 
Punt," the first live-action/animated football show for kids, makes its debut 
on the Fox Kids Network Sunday at 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball, anyone? Well, not quite. ESPN will televise a softball game Nov. 15 
at 6 p.m. involving some of baseball's biggest names -- Mike Piazza, Barry 
Bonds, Bobby Bonilla, Jose Canseco, Bret Saberhagen, Ozzie Smith, Frank Thomas, 
and Matt Williams, to name a few. The game, already sold out, will be played 
Nov. 6 at UCLA Jackie Robinson Field. It is a prelude to an evening gala at the 
Beverly Hilton to benefit the Michael Bolton and Bonds foundations. . . . For 
the record: It was noted here last week that NBC did not show Raider 
quarterback Jeff Hostetler yelling at offensive lineman Bruce Wilkerson, but 
the incident was shown. . . . It was nice to hear commentator Bob Chandler, who 
is undergoing treatment for cancer at the USC Norris Center, back on the Raider 
broadcast Sunday.

 Forward Chris Mullin of the Golden State Warriors will sit out the first six 
to eight weeks of the NBA season while he recovers from a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-7 five-time All-Star suffered a chip fracture and sprained ligament 
in his left knee and also strained his left hamstring in the third quarter of 
the Warriors' 95-90 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night 
in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the third consecutive season in which Mullin, 31, has been felled by a 
significant injury. He sat out the final 36 games of the 1992-1993 season 
because of a thumb injury and the first 20 games last season because of a 
finger injury.

 He proposed that if the auditors verify the league's calculations, the union

 On second thought, Coach John Robinson said he'll take this weekend's bye 
after all.  
</P>
<P>
 After USC's 61-0 rout of California on Saturday at the Coliseum, he sounded as 
if he wanted to see Washington State, the Trojans' Nov. 5 opponent, coming down 
the Coliseum tunnel that night, as the Bears were leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's team has won three in a row and was on top of its game Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 However, he said this week: "Fatigue is a problem late in the season for 
everyone, no matter how well you're playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fresher you are, the better. In that sense, a bye helps us. But I am a 
little concerned about that potential to get out of rhythm. . . . We need to 
make sure we hang on to it in practice." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Washington State has 50 California players, USC has two from Washington. . . . 
Head coaches Mike Price of Washington State, Keith Gilbertson of Cal, Jim 
Lambright of Washington and Miami's Dennis Erickson all grew up in Snohomish 
County, Wash.

<P>
 Washington's Napoleon Kaufman is about to become the fourth Pacific 10 back to 
rush for 4,000 yards. He has 3,821, and Washington plays Oregon State on 
Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 Charles White, who coaches USC's running backs, is the most prolific Pac-10 
running back. The 1979 Heisman Trophy winner has 6,245 yards. The conference 
runner-up is another Heisman winner, USC's Marcus Allen, at 4,810. Stanford's 
Darrin Nelson is third at 4,169. 
</P>
<P>
 White is also far ahead in all-purpose running with 7,226. Kaufman is sixth at 
5,408. EARL GUSTKEY

 UCLA held a 40-minute meeting after practice, with Coach Terry Donahue saying 
the intent was to keep his players concentrating on the mission at hand: 
beating Stanford on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tuesday and Wednesday practices were good, but I wasn't happy about today," 
he said."If you're winning, there's no problem with concentration, but we have 
to make sure that we're not dragging a lot of baggage from losing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins have lost six in a row in a 2-6 season. 
</P>
<P>
 They will get a boost of sorts on Saturday with J.J. Stokes starting at split 
end for only the third time this season. Stokes, who has been dealing with a 
knee injury, was pronounced 100% by Donahue.

 Right tackle Chad Overhauser is doubtful because of an ankle injury, which 
would give Sean Gully his first college start. Gully has practiced at every 
position but center in the offensive line. . . . Out are wide receiver Bryan 
Adams (shoulder) and fullback Greg Ford (back), who underwent an MRI 
examination on Tuesday that showed bulges in disk area. JIM HODGES

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; JENKINS SHARP AT NEW POSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Robert Jenkins was told that he would be replacing injured Gerald Perry 
at left tackle last week, he had to think hard about the last time he had 
played the position. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the former UCLA lineman had spent most of his seven seasons with 
the Rams at right tackle before signing as a free agent with the Raiders in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trying to figure out how many times I played (left tackle) is difficult," 
said Jenkins, who was formerly known as Robert Cox at UCLA. "I think the last 
time I played there was 1991." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being inactive for the first six games of the season, Jenkins stepped 
in against Atlanta and played as if he had played the position all his life. 
Against the blitzing Falcons, Jenkins -- along with Greg Skrepenak, who made 
his first start at right tackle -- helped lead the Raiders to a 30-17 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that I played well, but I should be better after getting more reps in 
practice this week," Jenkins said. "I never realized this before, but a certain 
nature comes with playing the position." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry is expected to sit out at least the next three games because of a broken 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Safety Eddie Anderson has not practiced this week and is listed as 
questionable because of a groin pull for Sunday against Houston. Coach Art 
Shell said that if Anderson is unable to play, Patrick Bates will start at free 
safety with Derrick Hoskins at strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Oilers' three-wide receiver offense, the Raiders will also have to 
count on Dan Land to play more in their nickel coverages if Anderson is out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After gaining a career-best 107 yards against Atlanta, running back Harvey 
Williams is expecting more of the same against the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a running back, you have to get in the flow of the game, and I was able to 
do that," said Williams, who leads the team in rushing and is second in 
receiving. "I think it was a little overdue for me. I think I could have done 
the same at Kansas City if they had let me. The key thing for me is that I'm 
doing it here now." LONNIE WHITE

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; CONCUSSION STILL BOTHERS MILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams returned to work after a few days off, but quarterback Chris Miller 
had to leave early because of problems related to the concussion he suffered 
against New Orleans on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said Miller went through all the film preparation for the 
Nov. 6 game against Denver but was allowed to leave before practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had an MRI and everything was fine, but there were still some lingering 
effects," Knox said. "He just didn't feel right, so the trainers checked him 
and he talked to the doctor. I wouldn't think he would do any practicing until 
Wednesday. We'll lean toward being conservative with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tackle Jackie Slater (triceps), defensive tackle Sean Gilbert (shoulder) and 
running back David Lang (hamstring) rejoined the team for practice and are 
expected to be ready for the Broncos. Cornerbacks Darryl Henley (groin) and 
Wymon Henderson (groin) worked sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who have a bye this week, will practice today, take the weekend off 
and return Monday. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Rams claimed tackle Ronald Edwards off waivers from Cincinnati and dropped 
Brad Fichtel to the practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards was the Rams' sixth-round draft pick this year. The team released him 
before the start of the season and intended to sign him to the practice squad, 
but the Bengals picked him up. T.J. SIMERS

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; BURNHAM'S GONE, BUT DEVOTION TO SPORT WAS 
SECOND TO NONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the National Turf Writers Assn. gave Joe Burnham the Joe Palmer Award in 
1991, I was president of the group and called Burnham to ask about his coming 
to Churchill Downs during Kentucky Derby week to accept a plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 "Need some film for the dinner?" Burnham asked. 
</P>
<P>
 It struck me that here was a guy who was getting an award, yet he acted as 
though he was going to have to work his way past the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I don't know," I said. "Whirlaway won the Derby and the Triple Crown 50 
years ago. Got anything on him?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Want maybe five minutes on Whirlaway?" Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we got Carry Back, who won the Derby 30 years ago," I said. "Jack Price 
(Carry Back's owner-trainer) is always there. Maybe it'd be good to do 
something on him." 
</P>
<P>
 "I could give you five minutes on Carry Back if you want," Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty years ago, the Derby had Canonero II," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Got him too," Burnham said. "I could put together something on all three -- 
Whirlaway, Carry Back and Canonero." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Burnham, who was 73 when he suffered a stroke last week, died Monday in a 
hospital near Santa Anita. He was usually putting something together, from a 
racing-film library that he almost completely shot personally over the last 50 
years. Many of his friends wouldn't have recognized Burnham without his tripod. 
</P>
<P>
 His fees, when he charged them, might have been lower than Mathew Brady's for 
the Civil War. A Hollywood mogul called Burnham to his sprawling office once to 
discuss a project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to do a film about our horse," the mogul said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we don't have a budget," the mogul said. That was Hollywood talk that 
meant he wanted a freebie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw some of Burnham's personal correspondence once, and letter after letter 
reflected how little he asked for and how much he gave: 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks much for returning the check," read a note from the national turf 
writers' secretary-treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't forget the billing for your fee," said a letter from a television 
producer in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not be coincidental that the annual Eclipse Awards dinner started 
showing red ink just about the time Burnham stopped producing the film show. He 
did 17 of those shows, starting in the 1970s, and the Eclipse people put a 
blushing Burnham on the other side of the camera once, giving him an award of 
his own for film achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Working out of some of the best hotels in the country -- the Fairmont in San 
Francisco, the Century Plaza in Los Angeles, the Waldorf in New York and the 
Fontainebleau in Miami Beach -- a producer might have expected the best 
possible conditions for those Eclipse shows, but Burnham found that this wasn't 
necessarily a given. 
</P>
<P>
 One night at the Waldorf, high above a double-decked audience of about 1,500, 
Burnham looked like a circus juggler standing on one leg, but he kept all the 
plates spinning until the long evening ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave me some equipment that was right out of Rube Goldberg," Burnham 
said later. 
</P>
<P>
 His favorite horse to shoot was Determine, the colt from California who won 
the Kentucky Derby in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really loved that horse," Burnham said. "He was my all-time favorite, and 
not because he was so photogenic. Actually, he was just the opposite. I never 
could get a good conformation shot of him. But he will always remain my 
favorite, probably because he was small, wiry and such a fighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Burnham's most photogenic horse was Silky Sullivan, the late-running colt who 
left his finishing kick in California when he finished 12th in the 1958 Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was all ham, a true showboat," Burnham said. "Point a camera at Silky and 
his ears would go up and he would strike a pose for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming from the pre-videotape era, Burnham was in awe of the technological 
improvements that helped racing cinematographers as they honed their craft. In 
the late 1950s, Burnham made his own contribution, working from a 
strange-looking two-camera rig that had a small lens for race starts in front 
of the stands and action through the stretch, and a long lens that covered the 
backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
 He especially liked what high-tech equipment did to sort out the controversial 
running of the Santa Anita Handicap in 1982, when Perrault was disqualified by 
the stewards for interference and the victory was given to John Henry. 
</P>
<P>
 "That race was a photographer's dream," Burnham said. "The photo-finish lens 
showed Perrault first at the wire, but the video-patrol tape decided the 
winner. The head-on view clearly showed that Perrault made contact with John 
Henry, forcing him out and impeding his progress. John Henry's victory comes 
with an asterisk, but the videotape is lasting proof." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, in semi-retirement, Burnham concentrated on cashing a few $2 
bets at Santa Anita, and waited for the cribbage games to start at Del Mar, 
where the track president, Joe Harper, is remembered as an aide who used to 
help Burnham carry his cameras around. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a stricter policy for film crews at Churchill Downs, Burnham soured 
on the Kentucky Derby and covered few of the recent runnings. It frosted 
Burnham that Churchill required him to promise that he wouldn't use any of his 
footage for commercial or promotional purposes. That was an affront to a guy 
who promoted racing first and Joe Burnham a distant second. 
</P>
<P>
 California racetrack directors should be rushing to their board rooms today, 
to name a stakes race after him. Make it one that will have a photo finish, 
every year. Horse Racing Notes

 Kingdom Found, drawing the outside post in a field of eight, is the 6-5 
morning-line favorite in Saturday's $250,000 Wells Fargo California Cup Classic 
at Santa Anita. The 1 1/8-mile race is the richest of the nine on the annual 
Cal Cup card, which is worth $1 million overall. Others running in the Classic 
are Warning Label, Flying Sensation, Hill Pass, Bossanova, Goldigger's Dream, 
College Town and Corslew. . . . Argolid, who had been expected to run in the 
Classic, will compete in the $100,000 Sprint, which drew 13 starters. One of 
them is Uncaged Fury, who was unable to get an invitation to the Breeders' Cup 
Sprint at Churchill Downs on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalism, who has a third and a seventh in previous tries, will be heavily 
favored against nine rivals in the $150,000 Cal Cup Mile on grass. . . . Desert 
Mirage, second to Supremo in the Norfolk Stakes and second behind Timber 
Country in the Balboa at Del Mar, broke his right foreleg in training and 
underwent surgery Thursday. . . . Kenny Noe, fired as racing secretary by the 
New York Racing Assn. in 1979, has been named president of that organization, 
which runs Aqueduct, Belmont Park and Saratoga. Noe, who had been associated 
with Calder Race Course for 15 years, replaces Jerry McKeon, who resigned 
recently. . . . Joe Burnham's family has suggested that contributions in his 
name can be made to the Winners Foundation at Santa Anita.

 A candidate who cried wolf once too often?Forget about the undocumented worker 
controversy. Disc jockey Wolfman Jack has sued Mike Huffington in federal court 
in Los Angeles, claiming that the U.S. Senate candidate's commercials 
"deliberately imitated (Wolfman's) distinctive voice and 'wolf calls' " without 
WJ's permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfman, also known for his movie role in "American Graffiti," howled that the 
ads made it appear that he endorsed the Republican Huffington over Dianne 
Feinstein, when he would have "refused" permission for them to be broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 We think the fact that the commercial spots were narrated by a Huffington 
backer identified as "Jackman Wolf" is simply more evidence that the Republican 
Party is trying to embrace diverse elements.

 The Corvette angle: Jeff Yip sent along a page from the December, 1994, issue 
of the publication Corvette Fever, which ran this letter from a Buffalo 
resident: 
</P>
<P>
 "I recently purchased a 1968 Corvette convertible. . . . I was told this car 
was purchased by O.J. Simpson, the former Buffalo Bills star running back. Is 
there any way of finding out if there's any truth to this?" 
</P>

RACIAL DIVIDE OVER TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was angered by Leslie D. Harris' article "How Race Can Make a Difference 
in Teaching African American Studies" (Campus Correspondence, Oct. 16). Harris 
correctly asserts that African American history is frequently posited as 
unimportant and peripheral. Too often, the history and issues of Africans in 
America are reduced to one lecture in a semester-long class. It is for this 
reason that we must do everything possible to encourage the establishment of 
African American studies as a legitimate discipline. It must be accepted as a 
vital and relevant academic subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' characterization of African American studies as exciting and useful 
only to black students is arrogant and ignorant at best. According to Harris, 
qualifications and training alone cannot adequately prepare a person to teach 
African American studies. The assertion that "(i)t takes a special gift that 
not everyone possesses" -- i.e., being born with black skin -- is a destructive 
and racist idea. Any attempt to deny the rampant discrimination plaguing people 
of color today would be naive, but encouraging divisiveness and separatism is 
not a constructive solution to this problem.

 * Howard University student Leslie Harris mounts a spirited defense of Cal 
State Northridge Pan-African studies students' protest against the hiring of a 
white female professor of English for their department. It is fascinating to 
see an upper-division student at a major university turning the fundamental 
tenets of the civil rights movement upside down to argue for special privileges 
in the area of racial exclusivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't I remember that an integrated educational setting is more effective? 
Doesn't a white female professor help create cherished diversity? Don't we 
judge people on the content of their character rather than on the color of 
their skin? Isn't the concern Harris expresses about white teachers of black 
students an example of the stereotyping she deplores? 
</P>
<P>
 It is ironic that this misguided essay appeared on the same page as an 
interview with Deval Patrick, assistant attorney general for civil rights, 
whose responsibilities include fighting job discrimination. In an ideal world 
we would not need an entire subdivision of the Justice Department devoted to 
civil rights, and everyone has a role to play in striving toward this ideal. 
Students in black studies programs can contribute by placing a higher value on 
the basic principles of civil rights than on the racial purity of the faculty.

with Deval Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his many other attributes exhibited in the interview, his clear-eyed 
distinction between affirmative action and quotas is a model both of logic and 
of evenhanded justice. And his explanation of the Piscataway case makes clear 
that Patrick is no mere doctrinaire dispenser of "justice," rather an upright 
man whose attitude and thinking should be noted and listened to with care by 
the ranters and ravers on both sides of the aisle. America would enormously 
profit.

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Had the readers of your Oct. 14 editorial "Joe Camel Goes to Grade School" 
known that Weekly Reader previously reported on the Joe Camel controversy, they 
may have reached a different answer to the question you posed about the 
publication's position on smoking.  
</P>
<P>
 For the record, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco learned of the recent Weekly Reader 
story through news coverage. Permission was not sought to show the Camel image, 
nor would it have been given. That's because we do agree that young people 
should not be exposed to cigarette brand messages in school. Previous exposure 
to the Joe Camel allegations by Weekly Reader, Scholastic News, in-school 
contests by STAT (Stop Teenage Addiction to Tobacco) and former Surgeon General 
Antonia Novello placed awareness of the Camel brand and its advertising in 
schools. Whether parents were made aware of those exposures by student-oriented 
publications, government officials and anti-smoking industry representatives 
has not been reported. To date, we're not aware that any of those sources have 
acknowledged to the general public that the Federal Trade Commission found no 
basis in those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 As a parent and school volunteer, your editorial raised a greater concern for 
me. Did it not occur to you that given the climate surrounding cigarettes 
today, students would most likely reject the issues posed by Weekly Reader? 
Research conducted last year by Dr. Cornelia Pechmann of UC Irvine Graduate 
School of Management indicates that young people have so embraced the 
anti-smoking message that their impressions of smokers now verge on a whole new 
class of bigotry and intolerance.  
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds Tobacco's position is firm: Youth should not smoke. The good news is 
that the 1993 Teenage Attitudes and Practices survey recently reported by the 
Centers for Disease Control indicates that smoking among 12-to-17-year-olds has 
dropped 17% since the 1989 survey. Those are the facts that the public needs to 
know.

LIMBAUGH'S ACCURACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Jeff Cohen and Norman Solomon of Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting, "Empty 
Bottles Make the Most Noise" (Column Left, Oct. 16), believe that 43 alleged 
"errors" by Rush Limbaugh are somehow a big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Not counting previous radio stints or his TV show, Limbaugh's current radio 
program alone represents about 5,000 hours of air time so far.Even if he made 
only one definitive statement per hour (the actual number is much higher), and 
if only 43 of those were wrong, then at least 4,957 or 99.14% were correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh often jokingly brags that his accuracy rate is about 99%. How ironic 
that FAIR has unwittingly proven Limbaugh's claim of near-perfect accuracy!

FEINSTEIN FOR THE U.S. SENATE: COMPETENCE OVER A QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the frustration with government that fuels the current anti-government and 
anti-incumbent rage among voters, it is still necessary to distinguish between 
good incumbents and bad. For government is no simple monolith of evil or virtue 
but rather a complex collection of disparate individuals. The efforts of the 
good do help to neutralize the bad and keep government functioning as it should 
-- to serve the people. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the calculus that must inform voter choice. With that in mind, we turn 
to the choice that voters must make in the contest for U.S. Senate between 
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein and her challenger, Rep. Mike Huffington 
(R-Santa Barbara). Feinstein is an industrious, capable legislator: After two 
productive years in the Senate, this former San Francisco mayor deserves voter 
approbation on Nov. 8 for a full six-year term. The Times has not endorsed in a 
U.S. Senate race since 1976, but in a year of rampant voter disillusionment and 
alienation, an affirmation of participatory democracy is in order. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a race that should not be as close as the polls suggest it is -- not 
because multimillionaire Huffington, a first-term congressman with the thinnest 
of records, is some right-wing extremist; he isn't. Nor because Feinstein's 
record is so incontrovertibly perfect that it is above criticism; it isn't. The 
argument in support of Feinstein is simple and compelling: Voters should 
approve her bid for a full term because she has done a good job for California 
-- and she has done absolutely nothing to warrant her displacement by a 
relative political unknown. So why run the risk of making a change? 
</P>
<P>
 After barely two years in the Senate, filling out the term originally won by 
now-Gov. Pete Wilson, Feinstein has a record highlighted by leading roles in 
winning approval of the praiseworthy California Desert Protection Act and of 
the seminal federal ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Her leverage as a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee has 
also helped to enhance the state's clout. She has worked diligently to protect 
the state's economic interests at a time when the struggling California economy 
has needed every bit of help it can get. The Feinstein voice certainly was 
valuable when Southern California labored to recover from the Northridge quake. 
And she has opposed Proposition 187, the Draconian measure that would deny 
social services to illegal immigrants, on the grounds that it's poorly written 
and unenforceable. That took courage. 
</P>
<P>
 What's also notable about her tenure is the extent to which her tenacious, 
non-showboating style has won her influence and respect not only among fellow 
Democrats but Republicans too. She is someone people can deal with -- savvy, 
reasonable, focused. She understands the problems of other legislators from 
either party. In fact she is one Democrat on the Nov. 8 ballot whom many 
prominent California Republicans have felt comfortable endorsing. Dianne 
Feinstein commands high regard from many quarters because she works hard, she 
works smart and she delivers. You need not agree with her on every vote -- and 
we don't -- but it's difficult to deny that she has a balanced, impressive 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, on the other hand, has failed to demonstrate any reason that 
Californians should choose him over Feinstein. And, in contradiction to his 
stated support of Proposition 187, he had to admit this week that he had 
employed an illegal immigrant in his own home for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 We do not question the seriousness of Huffington's ambition. Certainly anyone 
who has put so much of his own money into pursuing political office (he has 
said he plans to spend "around $20 million" by Election Day) is not to be taken 
lightly. Moreover, the congressman's view that the government that does less in 
effect does more can be a useful, if vaguely iconoclastic, view. Much of what 
government does needs to be reviewed critically from time to time, especially 
when big-government solutions like President Clinton's original health care 
reform plan are on the table (even Feinstein had second thoughts on that one). 
</P>
<P>
 Nor should Huffington's lackluster record as a freshman congressman be seen as 
wholly predictive. Few in the House of Representatives accomplish much in their 
first term. And Huffington's wife, Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington, who has 
ties to an unusual religious organization, should not automatically compel a 
negative judgment on his candidacy; she is scarcely the first controversial 
spouse of an elected official. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the issue in this campaign is simple. Is Feinstein's record such as to 
require her replacement? The answer, resoundingly, is no. Put another way, has 
her performance these last two years been such as to warrant the full term she 
requests? The answer is absolutely yes. This is one U.S. senator who has done a 
solid job, who is persuasive and effective on Capitol Hill and who deserves to 
be reelected. The Times enthusiastically endorses her.

HUFFINGTON CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your Platform of "independent" voices attacking Senate candidate Mike 
Huffington's wife, Arianna, "Should a Political Spouse's Beliefs Be Considered 
When Voting?" (Voices, Oct. 17) was filled with falsehoods and what appears to 
be some Feinstein campaign scripting. 
</P>
<P>
 One of your respondents said that Mrs. Huffington is too involved in her 
husband's campaign.For evidence, she says Mrs. Huffington "debated Robert 
Dornan in her husband's earlier campaign for Congress, but her husband has 
not." (It was former Rep. William Dannemeyer who ran against Huffington in the 
Republican Senate primary earlier this year.) 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington and Dornan live in entirely different districts and have never run 
against each other.  
</P>
<P>
 In the current Senate race, Mike Huffington appeared at six candidate forums 
with his primary opponent between January and June. Arianna Huffington served 
as a surrogate speaker at other candidate forums -- primarily when Mike was in 
Washington for votes -- a common practice in campaigns. Huffington also 
recently debated Dianne Feinstein on "Larry King Live."  
</P>
<P>
 Another "independent" voice laments that Huffington's wife "appears involved 
in political decisions," but "I'm not sure that Dianne Feinstein's husband is 
involved in politics at all." Yet Richard Blum, Feinstein's husband, according 
to public accounts, has been actively involved, both as a consultant and a 
fund-raiser, in his wife's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of curiosity, were any of the "independent" voices represented Republican?

L.A. NEEDS TO MERGE ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY; POLICE: LAPD NEEDS TO COME 
OF AGE TECHNOLOGICALLY. THE DEPARTMENT IS WOEFULLY UNDER-COMPUTERIZED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIE WILLIAMS and LAURA CHICK, Willie Williams is chief of the Los Angeles 
Police Department. Laura Chick represents the West Valley on the City Council 
and is a member of the council's Public Safety Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Los Angeles Police Department hopes to regain its 40-year reputation as 
a cutting-edge law-enforcement agency, it must tackle some tough challenges. 
First and foremost, the department must increase the number of officers on the 
street, and it must implement a citywide community-policing model. But an 
equally crucial challenge, and one that directly impacts the long-term success 
of the community-policing effort, is the department's ability to tap into the 
technological advances of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, the LAPD is sorely handicapped by its lack of modern technology. 
While Hollywood portrays the LAPD as a technology-sophisticated agency in such 
movies as "Speed," the department's crime-combatting tools more accurately 
resemble those used by Sgt. Joe Friday in the 1960s "Dragnet" series. 
</P>
<P>
 It's deplorable that the nation's third-largest police department, with about 
7,900 officers and 2,600 administration personnel, has only 721 computers. 
That's enough for only 7% of the staff. In addition to computers, the 
department desperately needs fingerprinting-identification equipment and other 
communications devices. 
</P>
<P>
 The effects of this technology gap are far-reaching. Residents calling 
emergency numbers receive busy signals. Officers spend up to 40% of their time 
completing paperwork -- time that could be spent on the street solving crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Modernizing our police department would liberate police officers from hours of 
tedious paperwork and put them back in our neighborhoods. The technology to 
improve law enforcement already exists. Other police departments across the 
nation have already installed integrated-computer systems that provide on-line, 
up-to-the-minute information about suspects, stolen property, outstanding 
warrants and crime patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in California, Newport Beach, Seal Beach and San Diego (among others) are 
on-line and have already outpaced Los Angeles in implementing these tools and 
realizing their effectiveness. The LAPD must get on-line too.  
</P>
<P>
 To address this urgent need, the City Council's public-safety committee has 
scheduled a hearing for Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 There have been some isolated attempts to bring technology into the 
department; officers have brought their own personal computers into the office 
and devised programs. Some divisions and communities have organized campaigns 
asking corporations to donate used equipment. In the West Valley, officers have 
decreased desk hours and increased street time by 40% by using computers to 
write their reports. And the number of prosecution filings by the city 
attorney's and district attorney's offices increased 17% principally because of 
their improved clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 These individual efforts are important, but we need a departmentwide solution. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that help is under way to put the LAPD on the communications 
superhighway. Mayor Richard Riordan has galvanized a coalition of leading 
business executives under the banner of "The Mayor's Alliance for a Safer L.A." 
The alliance has pledged to raise an unprecedented $15 million in six months 
from businesses and residents. The funds will be used to purchase the main 
computer system that will provide the LAPD with voice mail, data processing and 
networking capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the first year on-line, the alliance estimates computers could save the 
LAPD about 640,000 hours annually. That's the equivalent of 368 additional 
officers on the street. And this computerization would result in a $52-million 
savings for recruiting, training and benefits costs. 
</P>
<P>
 While the alliance's efforts are an invaluable first step to computerize the 
LAPD, the city must do its part. We cannot rely solely on the charity of our 
residents to fund woefully needed upgrades in crime-fighting tools. 
</P>
<P>
 To be fully successful in adopting the community-policing model, the LAPD 
needs to re-engineer the basic processes under which it operates. Through 
organization and the intelligent application of appropriate technology, 
dramatic improvements can be made in productivity and in the effectiveness of 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor and City Council have a plan to create a police force of 10,000 
officers, but Los Angeles will only have done half its job if it does not also 
integrate new and high technology within that force to combat crime and enhance 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 As resources and funding have dwindled over the past 10 years, the LAPD has 
been forced to choose between salaries, training and equipment. Hiring 
additional officers and paying them competitive wages have been the 
understandable top priorities. Now we must expand our focus. The city must 
identify the improvements needed, find the funds and equip the LAPD with the 
technology it desperately needs if we are to realize our goals for a safer Los 
Angeles.

 Political patronage has assumed many disguises since Jean-Jacques Rousseau 
wrote about the princess who proposed for breadless peasants, "Let them eat 
cake." Efforts to aid the poor -- more sizzle than substance during the Reagan 
and Bush eras -- acquired a certain cachet as volunteerism and are now a 
California campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Rep. Mike Huffington has recast 
volunteerism as the answer to the welfare state. He's spending millions on TV 
ads to sell the thesis: End government's role as a welfare provider and let 
private philanthropy assume the total burden for charity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican congressman from Santa Barbara lacks a serious record as an 
anti-welfare crusader, but, no problem. His author-wife, Arianna, has 
repackaged volunteerism in a recent book as a New Age mega-virtue. Government, 
goes her mantra, cheats people out of the spiritual rewards of giving to the 
needy. 
</P>
<P>
 One Huffington TV spot shows efforts by conservative eggheads trying to prove 
how ideals like virtue, community and empowerment can end welfare. It ignores 
how homelessness, which has increased in Los Angeles about 15% each year for 
the past decade, challenges the notion that people left to their own devices 
won't exactly stampede to pick up the check. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Tom Wolfe, describing 1960s radical chic, freeze-framed the 
volunteerism of the day by dissecting the motives of parvenu New Yorkers 
"paying dues 'to the poor,' via charity, as a way of claiming the nobility 
inherent in noblesse oblige." East Side soirees found Black Panthers mingling 
with patronizing social and cultural elites. One party became an epochal event 
not because the host was fashionable but because his guests, Cesar Chavez's 
farm-union workers, were. 
</P>
<P>
 Philanthropic chic, Huffington's post-radical-chic embrace of noblesse oblige, 
is already falling apart. One of George Bush's ill-fated "thousand points of 
light" -- a nighttime youth basketball program envisioned as a volunteer effort 
without cost to taxpayers, is now enshrined, with Huffington's vote, as a 
bipartisan example of social spending in President Clinton's anti-crime bill.  
</P>
<P>
 Even on the corporate level, philanthropic chic has faltered. As charitable 
requests of businesses mount, the level of giving is threatened by the bottom 
line, mergers and downsizing. The stunning decision by Arco, a national 
pacesetter in corporate philanthropy, to virtually eliminate its Los 
Angeles-based foundation, suggests volunteerism has limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the Los Angeles Amateur Athletic Foundation, with assets of $106.8 
million. It rejected a request by Los Angeles County officials to give $250,000 
to help keep county swimming pools free. Giving $1 per child to replace 
government programs, a board member said, would be "throwing it down a rat 
hole." Just where is evidence of the huge altruistic revival the Huffingtons 
see sweeping America that they expect will yield greater charitable giving by 
spiritually inclined citizens? 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Murray, a key welfare-state critic, maintains that translating 
compassion into action assumes the existence of "strongly bound communities . . 
. not creations of the state." Yet, except for a few religious groups, little 
sense of strong community exists in a society that UC Berkeley sociologist and 
best-selling author Robert Bellah notes is awash in excessive individualism. 
</P>
<P>
 Real volunteerism will replace welfare only if a deep sense of community 
generates solidarity with the poor. This union presupposes a massive conversion 
of heart from hoarding to sharing. That's why spending millions for ads 
promising quick-fix welfare solutions is an affront to the soul.

PERSPECTIVES ON PROPOSTION 187; DON'T VOTE FOR A FIX THAT WON'T WORK; WORK AND 
FAMILY, NOT PUBLIC SERVICES, DRAW MEXICANS HERE ILLEGALLY, AND THE SAME TIES 
WILL KEEP THEM HERE. 
</P>

<P>
 Even if they are not persuaded by the many legal, fiscal, moral and 
civil-libertarian arguments that have been marshaled against it, Californians 
should vote no on Proposition 187 for one simple, pragmatic reason: It won't 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it can't work because it is based on totally unrealistic, wrong-headed 
assumptions about why people behave as they do, and what can be done to change 
the behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 It would do nothing to alter the behavior of the vast majority of would-be 
illegal entrants, nor of illegals (and their legal-resident relatives) who are 
already living in California, nor that of the citizens who employ immigrants 
irrespective of their legal status or because they can accept false documents 
from job applicants with negligible risk of prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Proposition 187 is based on a fundamentally mistaken notion of why 
people migrate to California from Mexico and other Third World countries, and 
why they stay here. 
</P>
<P>
 The proponents of Proposition 187 would have us believe that the availability 
of health services, free public education and other social services is a 
powerful magnet for prospective illegal border crossers -- perhaps not as 
powerful as jobs, but still a significant incentive. 
</P>
<P>
 Having spent the past 20 years studying Mexican migrants to California, most 
of whom entered illegally, I have yet to encounter a single one for whom 
getting access to some tax-supported service was the principal reason for 
coming here. 
</P>
<P>
 In my own studies, as well as those of dozens of other researchers, only 2% to 
5% of would-be migrants or those interviewed on U.S. soil mentioned social 
services as even a secondary or contributing factor in their decisions to 
migrate. In all extant studies, the availability of higher-paying jobs and 
family ties with immigrants already living in this country were the 
overwhelming incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 It is always possible for an enterprising reporter to find anecdotal evidence 
that illegal aliens are using public services, including some to which they are 
not entitled by law. There are enough disgruntled bureaucrats trying to balance 
their budgets, frustrated anti-fraud investigators and others eager to supply 
the horror stories that make such compelling reading. And it is always possible 
to shine the investigative spotlight on the big publicly supported hospital in 
a city like Los Angeles or San Diego whose obstetrical service is overburdened 
by births to illegal immigrant mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the anecdotes fly in the face of a huge body of scientifically reliable 
evidence indicating that the social services magnet is vastly overrated. 
</P>
<P>
 The inferential leaps required to justify Proposition 187 in this way are 
truly breathtaking. Are we to assume, for example, that Mexican mothers giving 
birth in a Los Angeles hospital are doing so there, rather than in their place 
of origin, because they were attracted to California by high-quality, free 
obstetrical care, and/or because they want their babies to have U.S. 
citizenship? 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans who give birth in California do see U.S. citizenship as a plus. But 
the main reason why they give birth on this side of the border is that they 
and, often, their closest relatives and friends -- their support system at such 
times -- live and work here on a year-round basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of Proposition 187 also argue that if denial of certain public 
services does not deter illegal immigrants from coming here, it will make life 
so miserable for those already here that they will go home. This "immiseration" 
hypothesis is equally nonsensical. 
</P>
<P>
 It is inconceivable that an immigrant family, in many cases containing at 
least some members who are here legally, a family that is already permanently 
settled in California, with at least one member of the household regularly 
employed, would pack up and return to a place where they have no viable 
economic options and no possibility of attaining anything remotely resembling 
even a modest U.S. standard of living.  
</P>
<P>
 Migrants who have children often say that seeing them through school here is a 
disincentive to go back. The majority of those children are U.S. citizens, born 
here. Proposition 187 doesn't apply to them. And it takes cynicism of the most 
repugnant sort to think that such children will report their parents' illegal 
status to school authorities, as envisioned by the initiative.  
</P>
<P>
 If serious research is any guide, the vast majority of undocumented immigrants 
and their children who have been living continuously in California for five 
years or more will stay here, whether or not Proposition 187 is approved. 
Restricting their access to education and health care will only generate higher 
long-term costs for the California economy and society -- not just for the 
immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 Californians may feel compelled to vote for Proposition 187 to "send a 
message" to Washington about the need to clamp down harder on illegal 
immigration. But if they believe that cutting off access to basic human 
services to illegals will hasten a solution, they will be sorely disappointed 
with the results. 
</P>
<P>
 We are dealing here with a knee-jerk, don't-bother-me-with-the-facts, 
inordinately costly and ultimately ineffectual approach to immigration control. 
If nothing else, common sense dictates that Proposition 187 should be rejected.

LOS ALAMITOS SCORES LATE, ESPERANZA FALLS; SUNSET LEAGUE: FETERIK KEYS 
TOUCHDOWN WITH 1:15 LEFT, THEN GRIFFINS RECOVER FUMBLE TO SEAL 35-32 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Just call him Comeback Kevin. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior quarterback Kevin Feterik and his Los Alamitos teammates stared at a 
deficit in the final minutes for the second consecutive week, but the Griffins 
moved 83 yards in 48 seconds to score the decisive touchdown and post a 35-32 
victory over Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik, who completed 21 of 32 passes for 369 yards and three touchdowns, 
completed a 30-yard scoring pass to Stan Guyness with 1 minute 15 seconds 
remaining to give Los Alamitos the decisive score in a Sunset League football 
game Thursday at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Feterik tossed the winning touchdown pass for the Griffins (8-0, 
3-0 in league), ranked No. 1 in Orange County, with 12 seconds remaining in a 
15-12 victory over Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we scored, I thought we had too much time left," Los Alamitos Coach John 
Barnes said. "It was like whoever had the ball last would win." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Esperanza (5-3, 2-1), ranked third in the county, had rolled up 
more than 400 yards of total offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza running back Dahrin Footman had ripped through the Griffins for 156 
yards in 29 carries, scoring two touchdowns, and quarterback Chris Stretch had 
completed 19 of 28 passes for 268 yards and two touchdowns. Plus, Ryan Wilkins, 
who had 10 receptions for 151 yards and a touchdown, returned the game's final 
kickoff to the Esperanza 41 with 1:09 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the next play, Los Alamitos sophomore Dax Houston sacked Stretch, and 
the ball popped loose. Ryan Wanigasekera recovered the fumble for Los Alamitos 
near the Esperanza 30 and the celebration began. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos fans mobbed the field at the game's conclusion, rejoicing as the 
Griffins extended their unbeaten streak to 43 games. Temple City (1969-'73) and 
Canyon Country Canyon (1983-'86) hold the Southern Section record of 46. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrating was the furthest thing from their minds when the Griffins got the 
ball back after a punt with 2:03 remaining, trailing 32-28. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think about losing," said Los Alamitos wide receiver Brad Melsby, 
who had seven catches for 130 yards. "On the last drive, we knew if we 
executed, we'd score." 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik improvised on the Griffins' first play from their 17, scrambling out 
of the pocket and scampering up field and out of bounds for a 32-yard gain to 
the Los Alamitos 49. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know where I was, so I just took off," Feterik said. "I threw an 
interception on my last pass before that drive and I wasn't going to let that 
happen again . . . so I just ran." 
</P>
<P>
 After a Feterik pass to Guyness in the right flat lost two yards, Feterik 
lofted a pass up the left sideline that Russ Benefield bobbled before catching 
at the Esperanza 30. Feterik passed to Guyness for the game-winner on the next 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the guys we've got, it's never over," Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffin rally wiped out a valiant effort by Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza trailed, 28-19, heading into the fourth quarter, but Stretch 
completed an 11-yard scoring pass to Brian Forth to cut the lead to 28-26 with 
10:54 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs took the lead with 6:48 remaining after Stretch and Footman helped 
Esperanza move 56 yards in seven plays. Stretch capped the drive with a 
nine-yard touchdown pass to Wilkins with 6:48 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Esperanza's Kareem Clark, who had two interceptions, ended one Los 
Alamitos drive with 5:13 remaining, the Aztecs couldn't score again or run out 
the clock, giving Los Alamitos one more chance. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's all Feterik and the Griffins needed. 
</P>
<P>
 * JUST CATCH IT

SUNSET LEAGUE; GUYNESS' MOTTO: JUST CATCH IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Never let it be said Stan Guyness can't follow directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Guyness, Los Alamitos' thrill-seeking wide receiver, was told it twice. 
Quarterback Kevin Feterik said it plain and simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin looked at me and said, 'Just catch the ball,' " Guyness said. 
</P>
<P>
 Is that all Kev? Nothing fancy. No broken tackles, leaping catches or 
eye-popping moves.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin said, 'Just catch the ball,' " Guyness said. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Guyness' last big play was his least spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 All he did was grab Feterik's floater for a 30-yard touchdown with 1 minute 15 
seconds left for a 35-32 victory over Esperanza on Thursday. All he did was 
help extend the Griffins' unbeaten streak to 43 games and their winning streak 
to 22. All he did was catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stan was the only guy open," Feterik said. "I had to throw to him. But I knew 
he'd catch it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Feterik had left specific instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, throwing to Guyness wasn't exactly a high-risk proposition. 
Thursday was just another scrapbook event for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Guyness, a 6-foot-2, 170-pound junior, scored three touchdowns and wandered 
around Long Beach Veterans Stadium like he was the groundskeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 He has scored six touchdowns in the last three games. He also threw a 
touchdown pass off a reverse against Marina two weeks ago. So he's accounted 
for seven of the Griffins' last 12 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 But just try to draw attention to yourself when you're playing third-fiddle to 
fellow receivers Brad Melsby and Tony Hartley, two Division I prospects. 
Guyness came into Thursday's game third on the team with 17 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I like it that way," Guyness said. "People are double-teaming Brad 
and worrying about Tony. It makes it easy for me to get open." 
</P>
<P>
 He certainly made it look easy Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Guyness had seven receptions for 102 yards. He ran the ball three times for 50 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter, Guyness caught a 26-yard pass that broke a 6-6 tie. He 
beat Jason Ledonne to the right corner of the end zone, where he found 
Feterik's pass waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, Guyness took a handoff, spotted an opening on the right 
and accelerated. It went for 29 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stan's a slippery guy," Hartley said. "If there's an opening out there, he's 
going to find it." 
</P>
<P>
 Guyness had to create one on the last play. He blew past Aztec defensive back 
Dahrin Footman, then waited for Feterik's pass to arrive. The ball was a little 
under-thrown and Footman was scrambling to recover. But it was a done deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't thrown it too well, but it was close to Stan," Feterik said. "If 
it's close, Stan's going to catch it."

SOUTH COAST LEAGUE; TRABUCO HILLS SHUTS OUT MISSION VIEJO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FORREST LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense and special teams sparked Trabuco Hills in its 28-0 South Coast League 
victory over host Mission Viejo Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 De Sha Runnels had two of the Mustangs' three interceptions and scored two 
touchdowns as Trabuco Hills coasted to a 21-0 halftime lead.Though Trabuco 
Hills committed three turnovers in the second half, Mission Viejo was unable to 
cash in any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said this is the best defense in the school's history," Trabuco Hills 
Coach Jim Barnett said. "They've done it each week. Our offense struggled 
somewhat in the second half for whatever reason. We went up, 21-0, and then had 
trouble hanging on to the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills (6-2, 2-1 in league) limited the Diablos to 160 yards in 
offense. Sophomore quarterback Austin Moherman managed 14 completions in 31 
attempts for 113 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Things went downhill for Mission Viejo (3-5, 2-1) from the start. Bobby 
Johnson returned the opening kickoff 52 yards for Trabuco Hills, setting up a 
two-yard touchdown run by Runnels only 3 minutes 23 seconds into the game for a 
7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson scored on a three-yard run late in the first quarter before Runnels 
added a one-yard touchdown run with 4:29 remaining in the second quarter for a 
21-0 lead. Running back Laquent Fobbs caught a 34-yard touchdown pass from 
quarterback Chad Collins late in the fourth quarter to cap the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills, which started most of its drives near midfield, wasn't 
spectacular on offense, but it had enough, finishing with 253 yards overall, 
167 rushing.

CENTURY LEAGUE; VILLA PARK SHUTS DOWN ORANGE, 14-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Villa Park got a strong effort from its defense when it mattered most and 
sophomore Franklin Haynes rushed for 198 yards as the Spartans beat Orange, 
14-0, in a Century League football game Thursday at El Modena High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park's offense, which struggled to move the ball consistently, relied on 
big runs by Haynes to set up both first-half touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 He put Villa Park ahead, 14-0, with a 70-yard run with 5 minutes 45 seconds 
left in the first half. Haynes, who has 638 yards this season, appeared trapped 
in the backfield after taking the handoff but broke two tackles. He then cut to 
the right and outran the Orange defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes appeared to get past the 200-yard mark with a four-yard run with less 
than two minutes to go but the play was nullified by a motion penalty. Haynes 
also lost a 62-yard reception to a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 He had set up Villa Park's first touchdown with runs of 41 and 17 yards. The 
second run gave Villa Park (7-1, 2-1) a first down at the one. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullback Tony D'Amato then took the ball in the end zone for a 7-0 lead with 
9:32 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange also got a strong performance from a running back: Junior Markus Garza 
gained 174 yards in 24 carries. He had 125 yards in 15 carries in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a courageous game, but we just couldn't get it in the end zone," 
Orange Coach Dick Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason the Panthers (4-4, 1-2) failed to reach the end zone was Villa 
Park's defense. The unit had seven sacks for minus-41 yards and got 
interceptions by Bo Barnes and Sam Stremick. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange was stopped six times inside the Spartans' 35, including three times 
inside the 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd prefer they didn't bend that much," Villa Park Coach Pat Mahoney said. 
"But the defense played a great game." 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato, a linebacker, led the defense. He had a sack, shared another and also 
tipped away a fourth-down pass when Orange had an open receiver well past the 
first-down marker. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange reached the Villa Park one but Garza was stopped for no gain on fourth 
down with 4:15 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers got to the Villa Park five with seven seconds left but Orange 
quarterback Andy Lauridsen was sacked by linebacker Bryan Choate and lineman 
Dan DeClark to end the game.

EMPIRE LEAGUE FOOTBALL; WALLACE LEADS CENTURY PAST CYPRESS, 24-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Century Coach Bill Brown readily admits his team was falling apart earlier 
this season. Thursday night, Century put it all together with a 24-0 victory 
over Cypress at Western High, and remained in the Empire League race. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior running back Beau Wallace rushed for 120 yards to pace Century (4-4, 
2-1).Cypress opened the scoring on a one-yard run by Stanley Villanueva late in 
the first quarter, then added to the lead on Robert Villegas' 11-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Century defense held Cypress (2-6, 0-3) to three first downs in the first 
half and only 71 net yards, most of those coming on Greg Cleave's 49-yard run 
on the last play of the half.  
</P>
<P>
 "Two weeks ago, we were in shambles," Brown said. "But we're not making the 
same mistakes now. Our coaching staff rebuilt our defense and fixed some areas 
where we had holes. They did an outstanding job. We shut them down tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Century, playing Cypress for the first time in the school's history, stayed on 
the ground and controlled the line of scrimmage behind Wallace and Villegas, 
who gained 75 yards in eight carries. 
</P>

 Villanueva, the Century quarterback, engineered the only touchdown of the 
second half, a 16-yard touchdown pass to Jorge Rodriguez midway through the 
third quarter. Ignacio Vega accounted for Century's other score, a 25-yard 
field goal.

GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE FOOTBALL; TUATO'S PASSES LET LOS AMIGOS SAIL PAST SANTIAGO, 
49-16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Roger Takahashi and Ape Tuato went into Thursday's Garden Grove League 
game against Santiago with a plan: Throw the ball -- which Tuato did, much to 
Takahashi's delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuato led Los Amigos to a 49-16 victory over Santiago, and the 500 in 
attendance at Garden Grove saw the Lobos do something that is of paramount 
importance to their playoff hopes: Show some balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuato, who threw only five touchdown passes all season, threw four in the 
first half. He threw deep and he threw short, and he came up a big winner. 
Though he completed only seven of 17 passes and had one intercepted, they were 
for 176 yards -- that's 25 yards per completion -- including one pass for no 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gained a lot of confidence tonight," Tuato said. "That was the goal, to get 
me some confidence going into the playoffs and provide some balance to the 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Amigos is 7-1, 3-1; Santiago fell to 3-4, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuato threw scoring strikes to LaRue Carr (42 yards), Niu Satele (14 yards), 
Warren Roberge (54 yards) and again to Satele (19 yards). Los Amigos has run 
the ball successfully most of the season, so there has been little need to 
pass. Greg Fausto, who needed 117 yards to reach 1,000, carried only 10 times 
for 79 yards, including a 34-yard score that made it 36-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Calvillo's two-yard run made it 43-0, and Carr followed Santiago's first 
touchdown with a 92-yard kickoff return in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes down to it, you can't be one-dimensional," Takahashi said. 
"We've been rushing real well and haven't had to pass it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we would like to be able to pass the ball with some confidence in a big 
game."

ORANGE LEAGUE FOOTBALL; SECODA TAKES CHARGE, VALENCIA SHUTS OUT MAGNOLIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Valencia's Joe Secoda passed for 257 yards and two touchdowns to lead the 
Tigers to a 21-0 Orange League victory over Magnolia Thursday night at Glover 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Secoda, who completed 13 of 20 passes, accounted for almost all of the Tigers' 
offense.Jermaine Gray caught seven passes for 165 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers (2-5-1, 1-1-1) jumped ahead in the first quarter, when Secoda 
connected on a 31-yard pass to Gray on Valencia's second possession. The play 
was set up by a face mask penalty, which helped move the ball from the Tigers' 
47 to Magnolia's 31-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels (1-7, 0-3) struggled on offense most of the first half, but hung 
with the Tigers. Magnolia was helped by 87 yards in Valencia penalties in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia struck again on its opening drive of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Secoda's 30-yard scoring pass to Rhett Shepard capped an eight-play, 65-yard 
drive. Secoda's extra-point kick put the Tigers up, 14-0, with 8 minutes 35 
seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers put the game out of reach early in the fourth quarter, when running 
back Aaron Carbajal scored on a two-yard run. The play capped an 11-play, 
56-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Robert Nicols then drove Magnolia down the field, with help from 
25 yards in Valencia penalties. The 17-play drive stalled with two minutes left 
in the game, however, and Valencia's Jess Najera broke up a pass in the end 
zone on fourth down to preserve the shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicols was six of 22 for 52 yards with one interception. Sean Roy ran for a 
game-high 48 yards in 16 carries for the Sentinels. JON CLIFFORD

LUCY TOBERMAN; FOUNDED PHILANTHROPIC CLUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lucy Toberman, the volunteer's volunteer who by her own count founded 26 
philanthropic and social organizations and served on the Los Angeles Social 
Service Committee and the Planning Commission, has died. She was 84. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Toberman, who was honored as the California Mother of the Year in 1973 
and Times Woman of the Year in 1976, died Tuesday at her home in Hancock Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Lucy Montague Guild arrived in Los Angeles with her widowed mother 
and brother when she was 8 years old. She started volunteering immediately -- 
ringing doorbells for United Way -- and spent more than half a century finding 
money to aid the underprivileged. 
</P>
<P>
 She earned a bachelor's degree at UCLA and a master's degree at Duke 
University, where she founded a new chapter of her sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma. 
Mrs. Toberman received the UCLA Alumni Assn. Community Service Award in 1971 
and was chosen as one of four outstanding Kappas in the country in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 After working toward a doctorate in French at Stanford, she married real 
estate magnate Homer Toberman and raised their five children. 
</P>
<P>
 She taught journalism at Los Angeles City College and wrote social columns for 
several years for The Times and the Larchmont Chronicle. However, Mrs. Toberman 
reserved most of her unflagging energy and enthusiasm for her fund-raising 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans," she told The Times in 1976, "are so generous and so gregarious 
and so sympathetic, and that's why I think they want to be in groups. When 
you're in college you belong to a fraternal organization. But when you're out 
of college you have no focal point. You need a gathering spot." 
</P>
<P>
 She provided several. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the groups she co-founded were the Sunday Night Supper Club, which 
raised money for the Lung Foundation; the Colleagues of the Big Sister League, 
which built a child-care center, and Las Floristas, which raised funds for 
handicapped children with an innovative ball featuring models with elaborate 
floral headdresses. 
</P>
<P>
 For 17 years, Mrs. Toberman served as president of the Municipal Arts Patrons. 
Some of the groups she created were purely social -- such as the Carriage Club, 
whose members traveled by bus to football games or concerts at the Hollywood 
Bowl. She had organized the Hollywood Bowl Patroness Committee as a bowl 
support group. 
</P>
<P>
 She also organized a group of women called the Presidents. Included were all 
the women who became presidents of other organizations, whether willingly or by 
draft. The Presidents also raised money to aid abused children through the 
Children's Bureau. As a board member of the bureau, Mrs. Toberman also formed 
two other fund-raising auxiliaries -- the Pony Tails and the ABCs. 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by two daughters, Lucy Ann McBain and Patricia Heiden; three 
sons, George, Erik and John Toberman, and 22 grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Sunday at the Hollywood 
Presbyterian Church, 1760 Gower St. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to Toberman 
Settlement House, 131 N. Grand Ave., San Pedro, Calif. 90731.

PASADENA ADDS A 28-9 INSULT TO CRESCENTA VALLEY INJURIES 
</P>

<P>
 Chris McAlister didn't score a touchdown in Pasadena High's Pacific League 
football game against Crescenta Valley, but he clearly established himself as 
the most-dominating player on the field Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 McAlister, a senior back for the Bulldogs (5-3, 3-0), passed for a 26-yard 
touchdown, rushed for 80 yards in seven carries, intercepted a pass and 
recovered a fumble in Pasadena's 28-9 victory over Crescenta Valley at Glendale 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 McAlister also had a 77-yard punt return called back due to a clipping 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley (5-3, 0-3) lost its third consecutive game and possibly its 
playoff chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Several injuries added to Crescenta Valley's woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Condie, a senior running back, left the field on a stretcher and was taken 
by ambulance to Verdugo Hills Hospital with a possible broken left elbow and 
possible broken ribs. Chris Roberts also wound up in the hospital with a hip 
pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Griffiths suffered a pinched nerve in his shoulder and Steve Kelley, a 
sophomore playing in his first varsity game, suffered a wrist injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Hedricks, who rushed for 90 yards in 14 carries for Crescenta Valley, 
missed a couple of series with an injured right foot.

SIDELINES; FORMER SOFTBALL STARS POP UP ON NORTHRIDGE BASKETBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge women's basketball team has added a couple of heavy 
hitters to its lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Jones and Beth Calcante, former softball All-Americans for the 
Matadors, have made the basketball team as fifth-year senior walk-ons. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither has participated in organized basketball since their high school days, 
but Coach Kim Chandler expects both to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shannon is further along than Beth, but Beth is such a competitor she comes 
right at you," Chandler said. "She's hard to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, Chandler hopes some of the success Jones and Calcante 
experienced as softball players rubs off. The Northridge softball team, which 
last season had a record of 52-10 and advanced to the NCAA title game, is 
reigning two-time Western Athletic Conference champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The basketball team last season had a record of 3-22. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we bring a positive spirit to these guys," Jones said. "This is a 
whole new year. It doesn't matter what happened last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion news: Where have you gone, Johnny Unitas? 
</P>
<P>
 Seems not long ago that the crew-cut was the cutting edge of football fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Not at Harvard-Westlake High. No less than six Wolverine football players have 
long hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Derek Lemkin, defensive back Merlin DeMartinis and receiver Charu 
Turner are among those with long locks. Lemkin and DeMartinis play with 
ponytails protruding from their helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-groomed or not, Harvard-Westlake is dressed for success. The Wolverines 
take a record of 5-1-1, 2-0 in Camino Real League play, into tonight's game 
against St. Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recommend to all the guys that they get the best haircut they can for 
fitting their heads inside a helmet," Coach Dave Bennett said. "But some of 
these guys do their own thing. Charu . . . I can't tell which way his hair is 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 DeMartinis said the players "do it to get on the coaches' nerves." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said he doesn't mind -- just as long as they don't wear earrings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake-up call: Waking has been catching people snoozing. 
</P>
<P>
 Waking Bailey, free safety on the Kennedy High football team, made seven 
interceptions in his first five varsity games. The 5-foot-8, 165-pound 
sophomore transferred last spring from Faith Baptist, a private school in 
Canoga Park that perennially fields strong eight-man teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, whose first name is pronounced Wah-KEEN, wanted to play 11-man 
football, so he decided to join his cousin, Kennedy running back Antwane Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured I could come in and contribute a little bit," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 He's done more than that. Bailey leads the region in interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting game: Still waiting for the college football debut of Zack Hernandez? 
</P>
<P>
 It might be a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who last season passed for 3,634 yards in leading L.A. Baptist High 
to an undefeated season and Southern Section Division X football title, has not 
played for Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsmen Coach Joe Harper says he is trying to avoid playing Hernandez so he 
can redshirt him. Stats 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the Harvard-Westlake High water polo team participated in a 
tournament in which the Wolverines faced four teams that were ranked first in 
their respective divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 That was nothing compared to what Harvard-Westlake faces beginning today. 
Seven of the 16 teams in the California State Invitational at Stanford are 
reigning champions in sections throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rush: Tailback Terrence Thomas needs 259 yards in Cal Lutheran's final 
three games to break the school single-season rushing record of 1,024 yards set 
by Hank Bauer in 1975. Thomas has 766 yards in 145 carries.  
</P>
<P>
 Struggling: Tight end Travis Hall is suffering a decline in productivity that 
mirrors that of the Cal State Northridge football team's entire offense. Hall, 
the team leader in receptions through four games, has caught only five passes 
for 25 yards in the past three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot leg: Village Christian High's Ignacio Brache has converted 11 of 18 
field-goal attempts, including seven from 40 yards and beyond. Six of his seven 
misses have been from 56 yards or longer, including a 62-yard attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Goal-oriented: With 117 goals, Pedro de Lima, two-meter man on the Ventura

HUFFINGTON ADMITS FAULT IN HIRING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER and GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an emotional confession of wrongdoing, Republican Senate candidate Mike 
Huffington and his wife, Arianna, told reporters at a news conference Thursday 
that they violated federal law by employing an illegal immigrant at their home 
for more than four years and did not pay the required taxes on her salary for 
about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said that against his own advice, the couple retained the woman as 
a nanny for their children because their children had grown so close to her. 
They said they tried to obtain federal approval for the woman to work in the 
country legally, but she remained undocumented throughout her employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said the woman's job ended in the summer of 1993, more than six 
months after Huffington was sworn in as a freshman congressman and shortly 
before Huffington announced his challenge to Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP candidate blamed his wife for hiring the woman and said he had not 
been involved in the decision, but added that he took full responsibility for 
the action. Although he said he would pay a fine for the violation if he is 
cited by authorities, he downplayed the seriousness of the infractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made a mistake, there is no question about it," he said. "(But) who 
among us has not broken the law? Who among us has not rolled through a stop 
sign? Who among us has not gone past 55 miles an hour? . . . We are all human . 
. . and if we make a mistake . . . we should own up to it. Which I have done 
and Arianna has done." 
</P>
<P>
 The Immigration and Naturalization Service said Thursday that based on the 
news reports, investigators will begin an inquiry to determine whether laws 
were broken. Officials declined to elaborate on what the scope or focus of the 
probe would be. It is a violation of federal law to hire an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only information we have at this point is what we've seen attributed to 
Mr. Huffington in the news media," said Virginia Kice, spokeswoman for the INS 
western regional headquarters in Laguna Niguel. "Based on that, we are going to 
look into the matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Political experts said the revelation comes at a crucial time in the Senate 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign, locked in a close race with Feinstein less than two 
weeks before Election Day, scrambled Thursday to assess the political damage 
after the report in Thursday's editions of The Times, which was picked up 
widely on radio and television. The candidate canceled a morning event in Los 
Angeles, and staff members huddled at the Orange County campaign headquarters 
without making statements to the media. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2 p.m., the campaign alerted the media to a news conference in Santa 
Barbara to "set the record straight." The location and timing limited media 
access from Los Angeles and San Francisco because of travel time and avoided 
network news broadcasts on the East Coast. Still, a bank of reporters and 
cameras faced the confident-looking candidate and his tentative wife seated at 
a table. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple was peppered with questions about the employee, whom Arianna 
Huffington identified by the name Marisela. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate also was asked to reconcile his tough stand against illegal 
immigration -- including support for Proposition 187, which would deny 
education and non-emergency health care to illegal immigrants -- and how he 
could employ an illegal immigrant when he wanted others to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Huffington seemed to soften his tough talk on Proposition 187 and 
other immigration questions. Instead of seeking the ouster of illegal 
immigrants in the country, Huffington said, his support of the measure was 
primarily aimed at easing a financial burden on the state. At one point he 
seemed to say that he thought there was nothing wrong with employing illegal 
immigrants, as long as state tax money is not involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are illegal immigrants here who are using taxpayer-paid services . . 
. that is not appropriate," he said, adding that he also supported more guards 
to enforce the border. "Neither of those things had to do with our employment 
of this individual. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never said that we should go from house to house . . . and find 
household help that has come into the country illegally and send them back to 
their country," he added. "I have said, though, anyone using state services 
such as welfare or education or health care, if they are being paid for by the 
state, not by private citizens, but by the state, that's an inappropriate use 
of funds. And that is one reason I said I would vote for 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other disclosures during the 30-minute briefing were: 
</P>
<P>
 * Huffington said his wife did not know the citizenship status of the employee 
when she was hired. But since 1986, federal law has required that employers ask 
for proof of citizenship and record the evidence in a document known as an I-9 
form. The form is required to be kept and offered for inspection if requested 
by immigration officials. Failure to maintain the form is a violation of 
federal law. Huffington said he did not know what an I-9 form was. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arianna Huffington said the employee was hired in May, 1989, about the time 
of the birth of the couple's first daughter. She said she did not begin paying 
taxes on the woman's salary until June, 1990. "I have not paid the taxes from 
'89 to 1990," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Asked why she waited more than a year before seeking federal documents to 
allow the woman in the country legally, Arianna Huffington said she was waiting 
for the outcome of an immigration bill in Congress that might have granted the 
woman amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "During that time, the immigration bill was going through the House of 
Representatives," she said. "We did not quite know what would happen, whether 
she was somebody who might be given amnesty in November, 1990. After the bill 
was signed, I started the process of labor certification." 
</P>
<P>
 But several experts questioned by The Times said there was no amnesty law 
considered in 1990. "There was absolutely no new amnesty, and if that's her 
excuse, she better rethink it quickly," said Peter A. Schey, who heads the Los 
Angeles-based Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law. 
</P>
<P>
 * To acquire a labor certificate for a foreign resident, federal law requires 
that the employer prove that no U.S. citizen is capable of doing the job. The 
Huffingtons said they paid the worker $35,000 a year, and they were asked why 
they could not find a U.S. employee at that wage. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Huffington asked the reporter if he had any children. Then he 
described the interview of a nanny as one of the most important of a lifetime. 
Huffington, however, did not mention that he was living in Texas and working at 
his family's company while his wife did the interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arianna Huffington said the woman worked at the household full time until 
the summer of 1993. Sources told The Times, however, that the employment 
continued until at least November. One source also told The Times that the 
woman worked in the home for a period this past spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said the woman still visits the children, and they call her 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Huffington and his wife said their decision was driven by a strong 
emotional bond between the woman and their daughters. They said their oldest 
daughter, now 5, is secretly wishing that her father would lose the Senate race 
so she could move from Washington back to Santa Barbara, where her former nanny 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never found anybody who could replace Marisela," Arianna Huffington 
said. "Yes, we could have afforded any child-care provider, but you cannot buy 
love for your children, and Marisela loves them to this day. If you go to her 
home, it is full of pictures of my children. The only phone number that my 
5-year-old knows by heart is Marisela's number. She calls her regularly. She 
still cannot, to this day, understand why Marisela is not with us." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate said he knew of his children's attachment, but he made a mistake 
in not forcing her to leave the household anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Arianna's "instinct was kind and it was generous, but according to the law, it 
was wrong," he said. "While I was not personally involved in the hiring 
process, I must take full responsibility. As the head of my household, the buck 
stops with me. I should have put my foot down, ignored the pleas of my wife and 
my daughter, and demanded that my wife terminate the woman's employment. But I 
didn't. That was my decision, and it was my responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, federal law has made it a crime for employers to hire illegal 
immigrants. President Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act on 
Nov. 6, 1986, requiring that employers verify a worker's citizenship status 
when they are hired by requesting personal documents such as a U.S. passport, 
Social Security card or driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 The act provides civil penalties of up to $10,000 for each illegal immigrant 
hired. Repeat violators may also be prosecuted criminally and face jail terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign confirmed Wednesday evening that the household had hired 
an illegal immigrant to care for the children after The Times called for a 
response to a pending story about the issue.

 SMALL AND BIG: The Valley is a prime place for small companies to do big 
business. According to Forbes Magazine, four of the 200 best small companies in 
America are headquartered here -- Xircom (27) and On Assignment (36) in 
Calabasas, Authentic Fitness Corp. (184) in Van Nuys and Leslie's Poolmart 
(188) in Chatsworth. . . . Sales over the last year must be between $5 million 
and $350 million to make the list.

 SANFORD WHO?: Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg grabbed most of the 
headlines at Disney this summer, but it was Sanford Litvack who emerged as one 
of the company's most powerful executives. Litvack (D1) took over many of the 
duties of Disney President Frank Wells, who died in a helicopter crash in 
April. . . . But Litvack, 58, isn't seen as a likely heir to Eisner's throne.

 HALLOWEEN: Costume parties, carnivals and ghost stories -- this should be a 
pretty terrifying weekend in the Valley, and you're all invited. . . . Among 
the options: a Dead Authors party in Van Nuys and a haunted house in 
Northridge. The most complete list anywhere is in Valley Life! (Page 12). 
</P>
<P>
 MORE HALLOWEEN: Haunted houses are no hoax, according to author Richard L. 
Senate. Senate, who wrote "The Haunted Southland," speaks tonight at 7 at 
Pierce College. . . . In his book, Senate identifies several Valley sites and 
offers tips for amateur ghost hunters. "Be wary of drops in temperature," he 
writes. "The air feels cooler just before the materialization of a spirit."

 SOUR LEMONS: Stuck with a $2.1-million lemon orchard, Oxnard school officials 
should think about starting a student agricultural program, county planning 
commissioners suggested. Problem is, the school district already has a farming 
program at Camarillo High. . . . And school officials were hoping to sell off 
the 27-acre grove to recoup some of the money spent for the new Oxnard High 
School site (B8). Too bad, commission members said, turning down their request. 
</P>
<P>
 HANG TEN: It sounds like the perfect setup for a joke: A priest and a rabbi 
were surfing at Malibu. . . . Actually, it's an upcoming segment on TV's "Good 
Morning America." Father Dennis Mongrain of Simi Valley's St. Peter Claver 
Church joined a Los Angeles rabbi to prove that men of God really can ride the 
waves. "My last wave was a great wave," Mongrain recalled. The priest is due to 
appear on a special Sunday show.

 FUTURE SHOCK: It could go down as one of the biggest blunders in modern 
technology: Western Electric, failing to see the potential of the tiny 
transistor, sold it to Sony for $25,000 in 1952. That, economist Michael 
Rothschild said, demonstrates the power of information to drive the nation's 
economy. . . . Rothschild, speaking at the Passport to Tomorrow conference, 
urged American businesses to move into the "fourth age of information" (B18).

 HAUNTED HOUSE: Dinner will be a smorgasbord of scorpions and bugs -- that is, 
if someone can get the bloody hand out of the garbage disposal. Coffins double 
for beds, and Count Dracula is expected to make an appearance in the 
living-dead room. . . . While most kids are suiting up for trick-or-treating, 
members of the Ventura Boys & Girls clubs will be hosting their own haunted 
mansion at Ventura Harbor. Visitors are expected to pay $2 for the attraction 
tonight through Sunday. "Our whole purpose is to get the kids off the street, 
because there's so many people doing weird stuff with candy," Valinda Gallea 
said.

CALIFORNIA DATELINE / PATT MORRISON: SNAPSHOTS OF LIFE IN THE GOLDEN STATE. ; 
COULD THIS BE THE MOTHER OF ALL MISTAKEN IDENTITIES?

 Figuring large in Sacramento this election is . . . Saddam Hussein. Republican 
insurance commissioner candidate Chuck Quackenbush accused his opponent, 
Democrat Art Torres, of being a fan of Hussein's by virtue of a trip to Iraq in 
the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' rejoinder: The trip had the blessing of the Ronald Reagan 
Administration, and then-Secretary of State George Shultz thanked everyone for 
going. Bonus point: Shultz is now honorary chairman of Quackenbush's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Torres is just a fan of . . . Jerry Haleva's. 
</P>
<P>
 The lobbyist (pharmaceuticals, Pepperdine, California Manufacturers Assn.) has 
had Saddam roles in both "Hot Shots" terrorist-spoof films, and though his 
mother frets about this, Haleva soothes her thusly: "My chances of being shot 
because I'm a lobbyist are even higher than for looking like Saddam." 
</P>
<P>
 Haleva is on the board of the Sacramento Jewish Federation, making it 
"particularly ironic that a nice Jewish boy can make some money impersonating 
an Arab dictator." 
</P>
<P>
 He's still hoping for more work: "I would have thought someone would hire me 
to endorse their opponents."

 Music of the right: The economy, foreign policy, the environment, music--is 
there anything Rep. Dan Hamburg (D-Ukiah) and ex-Rep. Frank Riggs, the GOP 
challenger he beat in 1992, can agree on? 
</P>
<P>
 Riggs, a former police officer, calls it unfair that Jackson Browne and Bonnie 
Raitt can waive their concert fees for Hamburg fund-raisers. Hamburg says it's 
just as fair as it is for Charlton Heston to fund-raise and stump for Riggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal election law limits personal in-kind contributions to $1,000. A ruling 
has held that performers may waive their fees without violating the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Riggs is a Raitt fan but he's keeping his distance now that she's in the enemy 
camp, politically. But it hurts: "I love her music. It's terrible not to be 
able to listen to it or buy any of her CDs."

 Flyboys: Within hours of the news that Navy Lt. Kara Hultgreen had crashed her 
F-14 fighter and been lost at sea, male pilots called at least three news

become the first woman qualified to fly an F-14.

 Capt. Mark Grissom, commander of the Pacific fleet's fighter squadrons, says 
that is untrue. Hultgreen had failed in her first try but succeeded in her 
second attempt, meeting the same standards as the men.

 And it is not uncommon for would-be F-14 pilots to fail the first time:

2 CHILDREN STABBED TO DEATH IN HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A distraught mother led police Thursday morning to the bodies of her two young 
children, who were stabbed to death in her apartment in an apparent double 
murder that sent a wave of grief through this semirural Riverside County 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jacinto police identified the victims as Susana Buenrostro, 9, and her 
brother, Vincent, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were questioning the mother, Dora Buenrostro, and her 
estranged husband, Alejandro, who was found later at his job in Los Angeles and 
was detained by the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors in the well-kept apartment complex told reporters that despite thin 
walls and close quarters, they heard nothing early Thursday until the police 
arrived. A Police Department spokesman said no witnesses had been located. 
</P>
<P>
 Several blocks away, psychologists and mental health counselors spent a 
wrenching day at the elementary school, helping classmates and teachers cope 
with the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're about as emotionally spent as adults can be after a day like this," 
said Supt. Bill Marshall of the San Jacinto Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students arrived on campus, already whispering the rumor that the two 
children had been slain. Counselors gingerly broke the news to others, and then 
spent the balance of the day counseling students and staff on how to cope with 
their grief and confusion, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy unfolded about 6:30 a.m., San Jacinto Police Sgt. Barry Backlund 
said, when Dora Buenrostro drove to the local Police Department and pleaded for 
officers to return to her home. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said her estranged husband, Alejandro, had shown up and she feared 
for her children's safety, Backlund said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the two-bedroom apartment, police found the bodies of the two children, 
apparently killed from knife wounds, Backlund said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police then issued an all-points-bulletin for the father and the couple's 
youngest child, 3-year-old Diedra Buenrostro, whose whereabouts were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a tip from KCOP-TV, Los Angeles police detained the father without 
incident at his job in Los Angeles -- about 80 miles from the slayings -- and 
held him for questioning by San Jacinto homicide investigators, LAPD Officer 
Rigo Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alejandro Buenrostro, 37, is a salesman at Colortone Lacquer Co. in the Silver 
Lake district. His supervisor, who declined to identify himself, said 
Buenrostro was already at work when other employees showed up at 7:40 a.m. 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not doing any surmising, but Alex is well-liked and everybody here 
knows him as a devoted father," the employer said. "This whole thing is weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Velia Cabanila, who shares a common wall in the four-unit garden apartment 
with the Buenrostro family, said she heard nothing Thursday morning, although 
she had heard arguments on many occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother was not very friendly and I could usually hear a lot of arguing 
going on, screaming at the kids," Cabanila said. 
</P>
<P>
 On various occasions, she said, she allowed the children to use her bathroom 
because their mother was gone and the apartment was locked.  
</P>
<P>
 But another neighbor, Adela Bond, said the mother was a friendly figure in the 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond said she believed that the mother frequently took the children to Los 
Angeles to spend weekends with their father.

INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; QUACKENBUSH ADS STRESS CRIME, IGNORE ISSUES HE WOULD 
REGULATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican candidate Charles W. Quackenbush has opened a projected $1-million 
advertising campaign in the insurance commissioner race by making crime the 
only issue, rather than the insurance matters he would confront as 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates in the Republican camp who are running for statewide office 
are using similar tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Assemblyman Quackenbush's ads reaches back 16 years to an obscure bill 
that never won final legislative approval to claim that his Democratic rival, 
state Sen. Art Torres, "voted to allow sex offenders to teach in our public 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
 A review of the bill shows that the proposed legislation contained only 
technical changes to existing law, which could have made it slightly easier for 
authorities to deny teaching credentials to sex and drug offenders who had been 
formally declared rehabilitated or had charges dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 56-12 vote by which the bill cleared the Assembly on June 8, 1978, when 
Torres was still an Assemblyman, it also won aye votes from such stalwart and 
conservative Republicans as Mike Antonovich, William Dannemeyer, Frank 
Lanterman and then-minority leader Carol Hallett. 
</P>
<P>
 Reminded that such lawmakers as Antonovich voted on the measure with Torres, 
Quackenbush spokeswoman Lynne Andersen said: "We're not running against Mike 
Antonovich. If Torres really wanted to be sure that no sex offenders were 
teaching in our public schools, he would have voted against this bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush has also joined with three other candidates in joint ads 
portraying them as crime fighters and ignoring the usual functions of the 
elective jobs they seek. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Republican legislators Bill Jones and Cathie Wright, running for 
secretary of state and lieutenant governor, respectively, and Maureen DiMarco, 
a Democrat who is part of the Wilson Administration and who is running for the 
nonpartisan office of state superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Each said the ads were justified.  
</P>
<P>
 John Theiss, a spokesman for the Wright campaign, said that the election of 
four more Republicans to the state Senate would deadlock the body at 20 
Republicans and 20 Democrats, and Wright, as lieutenant governor, would then 
have "an almost daily opportunity" to cast tie-breaking votes to extend the 
death penalty and put additional curbs on criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Lapsley, campaign manager for Jones, said his candidate was author of the 
"three strikes" legislation and knows the electorate will appreciate it if he 
mentions it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Smith, campaign manager for DiMarco, said his candidate didn't have enough 
money for ads of her own and thereby had to join with the others. "We would 
love to be doing our own spot, but it's a question of economics," he said. 
"Besides, we find that in our case the voters are most concerned about school 
safety." 
</P>
<P>
 For Quackenbush, Andersen said, "I certainly think that Art Torres denying his 
voting record to such an extreme indicates that he feels that crime is an 
important issue to California voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres campaign manager Darrio Frommer responded that there are at least three 
"Quackenbush lies" in the crime ads, to which Torres is obliged to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has refused all joint appearances with Art," Frommer noted of Quackenbush. 
"He doesn't talk to consumer groups. He only talks to insurance people." 
</P>
<P>
 The outgoing insurance commissioner, John Garamendi, observed that 
Quackenbush's ads refer to "20-year-old bills," not only about sex and drug 
offenders, but also workers' comp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck Quackenbush has sold out to the insurance industry, so he cannot talk 
about insurance issues," Garamendi said. "They have paid the piper in massive 
campaign contributions to him, and he'll play their tune. So his crime ads are 
a smoke screen." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen, of the Quackenbush campaign, responded: "I think that Art Torres and 
John Garamendi are seeing that their liberal pasts are catching up to them and 
are afraid for the voters to know the truth. They're actively trying to distort 
the degree of the offense in this legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 But the bill's original author, Richard Alatorre, now a Los Angeles city 
councilman, said his measure was "an innocuous bill" and the Quackenbush 
campaign's attempt to make something out of it was "at best, dishonest and 
deceiving." 
</P>
<P>
 "Right at the end of a campaign, you are going to distort the truth," he 
added. "This is very typical, and obviously I guess Quackenbush knows he's 
behind."

RESALE OF 'LEMONS' AS NEW CARS CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New cars that normally would be classified as "lemons" are being resold to 
unsuspecting buyers, and the head of the Assembly's Consumer Protection 
Committee wants the practice stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "In brief, the manufacturers are packaging their lemons as peaches," said 
Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame), the committee's chairwoman. "Only 
the fruit, in many cases, is rotten." 
</P>
<P>
 Speier and other committee members heard Thursday from disgruntled car buyers 
who complained about buying nearly new cars from dealers only to find out 
later, after a run of constant troubles ranging from squeaky doors to bad 
brakes, that the vehicles had a history of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California has a so-called lemon law, Speier said there is a 
loophole. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, a new car is declared a lemon if it cannot be fixed after 
several attempts. The buyer is given a replacement. The car labeled a lemon can 
be resold by the manufacturer, but only after it has been repaired and its 
title changed so that future buyers know it was a lemon. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem, the committee was told, is that some manufacturers are buying 
back the faulty autos before they are officially listed as lemons and reselling 
them without telling buyers about their history. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman told the committee that she bought a 1989 Chevrolet Suburban from a 
Santa Rosa dealer and that its brakes failed while pulling a 6,000-pound 
trailer down a mountainous Lake Tahoe road. Gayle Pena told the committee that 
she was led to believe that she was buying a like-new vehicle that had been 
driven by an executive. 
</P>
<P>
 She later found out that the vehicle had been repurchased from the original 
owner by the dealer after it had been in the shop at least 20 times for brake 
problems that could not be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dealer was willing to kill us for $22,000 . . . put us in a casket for 
the sake of a sale," said Pena, who now lives out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena said the Department of Motor Vehicles penalty for the dealer who sold her 
the truck was "a slap on the wrist" consisting of a small fine and having to 
close for two days, which has not been done yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of General Motors, Ford Motor Co. and Nissan North America 
Inc. were at the hearing and indicated that they would support full disclosure. 
They also urged passage of a uniform federal law to help iron out differences 
among lemon laws in various states. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe in full and effective disclosure," said Ken Tough of General 
Motors. "We want the customer to make an informed decision." 
</P>
<P>
 A committee report recommended legislation to require the DMV to regulate the 
buyback procedures. The legislation, which Speier said she will introduce, 
would require the repair of all vehicles described as lemons before their 
resale and would require that records of the repairs be given to prospective 
buyers.

<P>
 The United States will end or reduce military operations at an additional 27 
facilities overseas, mostly in Germany, as a part of continuing post-Cold War 
defense cuts, the Pentagon said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts are at 24 sites in Germany, two at Lajes Field in the Azores and one 
at a radar site in Iceland, the Pentagon said. Thursday's announcement of 21 
closings and six reductions brought to 871 the number of U.S. installations in 
Europe where operations are being ended, reduced or placed on standby.

FILES CAST DOUBTS ON BUSH SON'S OIL STOCK SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Securities and Exchange Commission documents cast some doubt over George W. 
Bush's explanation about his sale of stock in an oil company several weeks 
before it reported a $23-million loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush denies wrongdoing, and the SEC declined to act against him last year 
after an insider-trading investigation. Nevertheless, the case has emerged as 
an issue in the Texas governor's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, the eldest son of the former President, contends he "sold into good 
news" on June 22, 1990, when he unloaded $840,000 in stock -- nearly two-thirds 
of his holdings -- in Harken Energy Corp. Bush served as director and as a paid 
consultant to the Dallas-based oil company but left the company's board in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC files offer a decidedly mixed picture about Harken's financial 
prospects at the time of the stock sale. Harken could deservedly boast about a 
major oil-drilling agreement with the government of Bahrain in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 Harken analyst Charlie Andrews of 13D Research Inc. of Brewster, N.Y., urged 
investors in March, 1990, to buy Harken's stock because "the potential inherent 
in the Bahrain oil exploration deal is so great." 
</P>
<P>
 But Harken's bankers had clamped down on the company after it violated terms 
of a $115-million loan package, according to SEC documents obtained through the 
Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The renegotiated loan agreement, reached May 21, 1990, featured strict terms, 
including a high interest rate, less credit for acquisitions, a $750,000 fee 
and requirements by some major stockholders to guarantee $22.5 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Harken announced plans to raise $40 million, $15 million of 
which would repay bank debt. The balance would infuse cash into two of its 
companies and fund acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush's attorney, Robert Jordan, defended Bush's "selling into good news" 
statement, saying the loan restructuring "was extremely good news to the 
company because it showed the supreme confidence of these two major 
shareholders in the future of the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan said two shareholders agreed to guarantee loans as part of the credit 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC investigated Bush for possible insider trading, the allegation of 
selling the stock with an insider's knowledge of non-public, market-moving 
news, such as a poor earnings report. The agency, which polices the securities 
markets, finished its investigation of the Bush trades on Oct. 18, 1993, and 
said it wouldn't bring enforcement action against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan correctly noted that details of the Harken loan restructuring had been 
publicly disclosed at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sale of Harken stock was entirely legal and proper," Bush said this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sold into good news, not bad news," he told the Austin American-Statesman 
newspaper in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, who was traveling Wednesday and Thursday, wasn't available to discuss 
the loan restructuring, his campaign office said.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: THE MAYOR MAKES SURE EVERYONE'S ON BOARD FOR SUBWAY VOTE 
</P>

 SUBWAY SHUFFLE: Following his announcement Tuesday that he would support a 
Valley subway system, Mayor Richard Riordan had his work cut out for him: 
making sure that his three appointees to the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority board would stay in step. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge real estate agent Mel Wilson, appointed by Riordan to the 13-member 
MTA board last year, posed no problem: He also backed the subway option. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles attorney Stan Sanders said he would adopt the mayor's position. 
But Sanders was out of the country Wednesday, and his alternate on the board, 
City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, was also unavailable for the afternoon 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 To cover that base, Riordan exercised his privilege as mayor to replace 
Galanter as Sanders' alternate with his own proxy, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
Yaroslavsky has been a staunch supporter of the subway proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about Riordan's third appointee, City Councilman Richard Alatorre? 
Alatorre in the past has advocated the rival proposal for an elevated line down 
the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's aides said Tuesday that Alatorre and the mayor had reached "an 
understanding." At the MTA meeting Wednesday, observers understood that 
Alatorre was out sick -- for oral surgery -- which enabled his alternate, 
fellow Councilman Nate Holden, to cast a vote for the subway. 
</P>
<P>
 The final tally was 8 to 5 in favor of the subway route; half of the votes 
were from Riordan's camp.

 WHERE THERE'S SMOKE: Here's something for children's advocates to crow about: 
Among its other achievements, the 1994 Legislature passed a bill to prohibit 
smoking in licensed child day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies showed that secondhand smoke endangered kids and only 55% of 
California's licensed centers and private residences operating as child-care 
facilities were completely smoke-free. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those looking for a rusty underside to the silver lining, consider 
this. Fourteen Assembly members and 10 Senate members voted against the bill, 
which Gov. Pete Wilson signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando, Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys, state Sens. Don 
Rogers (R-Tehachapi) and Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) turned thumbs down on 
the measure. Assembly members Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) and William J. (Pete) 
Knight (R-Palmdale) also cast votes against the day-care smoking ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Those voting in favor of it, according to the watchdog lobbyist group called 
Voters' Alliance for Children, were: state Sens. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), 
David Roberti (D-Van Nuys) and Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles); and Assembly 
members Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), Barbara 
Friedman (D-North Hollywood), Terry Friedman (D-Brentwood) and Paula Boland 
(R-Granada Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, though, the smoking-in-day-care bill is just one of several 
pieces of legislation the Voter's Alliance for Children tracked in an effort to 
measure how supportive lawmakers are on children's issues. 
</P>
<P>
 According to spokesman Ted Weinstein, "An appalling number of state 
legislators are voting against vital legislation that would improve children's 
health, safety and well-being." 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance compiled a list of the 10 lawmakers who earned a perfect score of 
voting against bills the group identified as helpful to youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one member of the Valley-area delegation made the so-called Terrible Ten 
list -- state Sen. Don Rogers.

 PARTY ON: OK, political party animals, here's the scoop. 
</P>
<P>
 The tony Rive Gauche Cafe in Sherman Oaks is to be the site of a 
$1,000-per-head fund-raising breakfast this morning for GOP congressional 
candidate Richard Sybert. Sybert, who is giving U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills) fits, expects to pick up about $50,000 and change from this 
event, which will feature jet-setting U.S. Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kansas), the 
Senate minority leader, as guest speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 No one's asked yet why Republicans are gathering at a restaurant named Rive 
Gauche -- the name of Paris' artsy, politically progressive neighborhood on the 
Left Bank of the Seine.  
</P>
<P>
 But next Tuesday evening offers political hors d'oeuvre grazers their best 
chance yet to size up the Beilenson-Sybert clash, when both men will have 
fund-raisers at the Sagebrush Cantina in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sybert fund-raiser at $100 per person runs from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. and will 
feature actor and Republican pitchman Charlton Heston, while the Beilenson 
event -- with a more Democratic entrance-fee schedule (guests will be asked to 
pay anywhere from $25 to $100) -- is set to begin at 7 p.m. The theme of the 
Beilenson event is a belated celebration of the incumbent's birthday. On Oct. 
26, he turned 62. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have suffered through the debates between the two men, which 
have gotten predictable, one can only hope there'll be a food fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mistake, but they've both been good about it," said Sagebrush owner 
Bob McCord of the double-booking. One thing is for sure, however, McCord said. 
He says he's had an unbroken record of only hosting fund raisers for candidates 
who go on to win. "With both of them doing one here, that tradition is going to 
get broken." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 LAYING DOWN THE LAW: Beilenson and Sybert are both lawyers. Harvard lawyers. 
There is no getting around it. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a debate this week, neither man was playing up his legal education. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began when Sybert touted a new study by the California Center for 
Public Policy, which he heads, that calls for significant changes to the 
state's tort system -- including ways of discouraging lawyers from filing so 
many lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to jump on the bandwagon, Beilenson said he strongly supports tort 
reform himself and then took a jab at his opponent: "He's more of a lawyer than 
I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson explained that he only practiced law for a few years before being 
elected to the state Assembly in 1962. From there, he went to the state Senate 
and then, in 1976, the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, who has taught lawyers-to-be at Loyola Law School, struck back with 
the quickness of a trained litigator. 
</P>
<P>
 First he called Beilenson "my good friend, Tony." Then he noted that Beilenson 
left law for another profession that the public does not hold in extremely high 
regard -- a career politician.

LAKE VISITORS NOT WILD SNOW GEESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The item on Sept. 28 about the geese at Calabasas Lake was sadly in error. 
</P>
<P>
 From the excellent color photographs, it was obvious to most birders that 
these were not wild snow geese.Snow geese have a distinctive "grin patch," a 
dark line on the lower edge of the bill. The black wingtips are visible when 
the bird is on the ground as they extend beyond the white tail when the wing is 
folded. Neither the grin patch nor black wing tips could be seen when I visited 
the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue form of the snow goose indeed has an all-white head, but the bulky 
birds (seen by those quoted in the article) have much gray on the head. The 
birds behaved like city park ducks and geese, and I'm sure they have made 
threatening moves toward people and have nipped them. Wild birds would tend to 
be spooky and avoid people. 
</P>
<P>
 It was somewhat surprising that the animal shelter man (Bruce Richards, Agoura 
Animal Shelter director) seemed to accept these birds as snow geese. If they 
were really wild birds, they would be protected, and the California Fish and 
Game Department should have been called to settle the problem. Instead, homes 
were found for some of them.

BURBANK-CHANDLER ROUTE RESPONSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The way Pauline Tallent's letter "Rapid Transit Should Follow Freeway" 
(Sept. 4) was featured, including a photo of the Ventura Freeway, suggests The 
Times favors her position. She can't conceive of support for the 
Burbank-Chandler route, saying it doesn't serve commuters, is more expensive, 
and is half underground and subject to flooding with the exposed portion being 
an eyesore.Her empty arguments call for an informed response. 
</P>
<P>
 The under / above-ground aspect is due to state law that exists only to 
satisfy concerns about noise from a synagogue and school on Chandler 
(Boulevard) serving an Orthodox Jewish community of about 700. Bad laws can be 
repealed! Tallent's monorail along the freeway would require expensive new 
technology and would be another eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
 Trenched light rail on the Burbank-Chandler corridor will: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Be more central to the commuting population. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Apply existing Blue or Green Line technology. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Use a corridor we bought for the purpose that would be hard to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Sit well above the water table. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Be inconspicuous and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Those annoyed by the quiet "whoosh" of light rail could roof their portion of 
the trench.

GARAMENDI COULD SAVE 20TH CENTURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Garamendi and the California Department of Insurance are doing all they 
can to get rid of 20th Century Insurance Co. because the insurer has charged 
too little for its policies and made too much money. 
</P>
<P>
 With careful underwriting and low-cost distribution, 20th Century has been 
able to offer some of the lowest-priced automobile insurance in 
California.Because of its efficiency, 20th Century has been able to earn more 
profit for each dollar of automobile premium than many of its less-efficient 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 By requiring 20th Century to return $119 million to its policyholders, 
Garamendi is leveling a gun on a company that is already reeling from 
earthquake losses ("20th Century's Quake Tab Hits $815 Million," Sept. 9). 
</P>
<P>
 John Garamendi might be able to save one of our state's best auto insurers by 
reducing or waiving the rebates.

'NONPROFIT' PLAN A TAXPAYER BURDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * An interesting taxpayer problem is raised by your article (Sept. 1) about a 
"nonprofit" group that is in the process of purchasing a red-tagged apartment 
building, which it intends to convert into "the first low-income family housing 
project in the west San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Your article says this "nonprofit" housing corporation says that after buying 
the building (price not stated in your article), it will spend $2.25 million 
just to renovate the building to provide a mere 25 units. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence the renovation costs alone come close to $100,000 per apartment unit. 
Add to that whatever the actual purchase price is, and we can see there is no 
way in the world that the "low-income" families would be anywhere near able to 
pay reasonable market rent in such an expensive apartment building. Rent should 
come to an average of something like $2,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 I expect that these pretty expensive apartments will be provided to the 
"low-income" residents by dipping into the well-worn pockets of the 
overburdened taxpayers at a time when we say we have no money to provide us 
with adequate police protection or education. 
</P>
<P>
 I've got a simple solution. Put some of these families in my apartment 
building at a cost of $575 to $700 a month rent. I provide my tenants with a 
well-maintained swimming pool, carpets, window blinds, lawns, trees and flower 
beds, parking, stoves, tiled showers, and tubs and a good neighborhood in the 
West Valley. The taxpayers and tenants will all come out ahead. The monies thus 
saved the taxpayers will provide us with the police and school needs. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, I'm not a "nonprofit" operation . . . except when I'm forced to 
compete with taxpayer-financed giveaway programs.

BRAUDE PROUD OF VAN NUYS PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your Aug. 26 letters to the editor column contained a letter questioning my 
representation of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The portion of Van Nuys to which the letter referred has been part of the 11th 
Council District for only about three years. Many of the problems that exist 
there I inherited from the council members who preceded me as Van Nuys City 
Council representative. 
</P>
<P>
 To solve them, my staff and I have been working closely with the Van Nuys 
business community, the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn. and its president, Don 
Shultz, and with the Van Nuys police. 
</P>
<P>
 One area where we have made real headway is dealing with motels on Sepulveda 
Boulevard where there was evidence that prostitution was occurring. I asked the 
Los Angeles Planning Department to review the operation of these motels to see 
if they were being run in violation of the law. After a careful review and 
public hearings, it was discovered that three of them were, and were 
responsible for conditions that contribute to crime and community 
deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the Los Angeles City Council approved tough and binding conditions 
on these motels, which will result in an end to the presence of prostitution 
and in their operation as businesses that contribute to the community rather 
than detract from it. 
</P>
<P>
 I am very proud of this innovative accomplishment, which resulted from close 
cooperation between my office, the homeowners, the planning department and the 
police. I believe it will serve as a model for use in other parts of the city 
where this problem might arise. 
</P>
<P>
 Another community problem to which I have responded directly is the 
proliferation of pawn shops in Van Nuys. Because of concerns by the Van Nuys 
Homeowners Assn. that pawn shops can be magnets for crime, I proposed 
legislation to limit the number and placement of pawn shops in Van Nuys, which 
has a high concentration of them. 
</P>
<P>
 A third Van Nuys achievement of which I am proud is the Delano Street 
Community Impact Team Project, which my office originated and coordinated. 
Because of gang, drug and other problems on Delano Street, just off Van Nuys 
Boulevard, we put together a unique team, made up of police, the city 
attorney's office, the building and safety department, apartment building 
owners, residents and public school representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Through mutual support and a series of no-nonsense meetings, we succeeded in 
reducing these serious problems, cleaning up the street and instilling a new 
community pride of ownership in the buildings' owners and among the street's 
residents. This program, too, has already been emulated by other City Council 
members for application in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
 I have also worked hard to stimulate citizen participation in local government 
in Van Nuys, and my office is always open to neighborhood residents who have 
complaints, inquiries or suggestions about how we can make Van Nuys a better 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The participation and involvement of community residents is crucial to the 
well-being of any community. Those who are willing to work with their elected 
officials to help solve a community's problems are in a much better position to 
comment on the quality of life in their community than are those who simply 
criticize.

RECOVERY MONEY NEEDED FOR TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Calahan Street School in Northridge needs earthquake recovery money -- not 
for repairing a building or replacing equipment and not for ordering supplies 
or even preparing for the next quake, although it has these material needs just 
like most of the other quake-affected schools in the L. A. Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 This elementary school, like several others in the area of the epicenter, 
needs recovery money for a pressing human emergency.It is about to lose several 
of its teachers because of the number of students forced out of the area by the 
devastation to their homes and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe buildings, freshly painted; new equipment replacing what is damaged or 
worn-out -- these things are important. But let's remember that a school is a 
community that primarily consists of the interaction between teacher and 
student. Education could take place in an open field, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 It sometimes seems that money in our district is spent on everything but the 
essential ingredient to a successful school -- the teacher. Let's take this 
opportunity presented by the needs of this school to say that we understand 
what is important to our communities' recovery and at the same time provide 
some stability, continuity and security by allowing Calahan Street School to 
keep the teachers the students know and love. 
</P>
<P>
 Our dishes can be replaced, our homes and buildings repaired, but the bond of 
trust between a teacher and student is irreplaceable.

CHILDREN USED AS POLITICAL PAWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding the Pacoima anti-Proposition 187 demonstration, even more galling 
than the church involvement in a state issue is the exploitation of small 
children to further their cause. Parents, legal or not, certainly have the 
right to drag their kids along on a rally, but I am astounded that Pacoima 
School would participate by bringing its drum corps to the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to know how the principal of a taxpayer-funded public school can 
justify the "learning lesson" that it's OK to break existing immigration laws, 
not to mention the blurring of the church and state issue. How did the teachers 
at Pacoima explain this "school activity" to their students? More importantly, 
does this rally indicate that grammar school classrooms are being used to drum 
up anti-187 sentiment? 
</P>
<P>
 These are questions that I certainly intend to ask the Los Angeles school 
board, and I would hope that many other parents will put pressure on the 
schools to nip in the bud this practice of using children as pawns in a 
political issue.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW GAINS 26.92; BOND YIELDS RETREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Snapping a five-session string of losses, blue-chip stocks closed higher 
Thursday, as the market found relief from lower long-term bond interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.92 points to 3,875.15, after falling 
nearly 88 points over the previous five sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Treasury bond market, yields retreated to 8.04%, pushing its price up 
3/16 point as traders jockeyed for position ahead of today's release of 
third-quarter gross domestic product data. The long bond ended at 8.05% on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the easing of pressure from the bond market allowed investors to 
focus on strong third-quarter earnings from companies such as Dow Chemical Co. 
and Delta Air Lines Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 4 to 3 
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 327.78 million shares, up 
slightly from 322.57 million on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-based stock indexes also gained. The NYSE's composite index rose 1.66 
points to 255.57. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.23 points to 
465.85. The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.23 points to 767.47. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks also got a boost from the dollar, which gained against the German mark 
and the Japanese yen. The U.S. currency closed in New York at 96.98 yen and 
1.499 marks, up from 96.85 and 1.491, respectively, on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The market is "holding its breath until" today, said John Shaughnessy, 
research director at Advest Inc. in Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-quarter GDP growth is estimated at 2.8%. Anything higher than that would 
indicate a robust growth in the economy that is likely to further encourage the 
Federal Reserve Board to increase short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities, said a tightening is 
virtually assured, unless the GDP numbers come in much weaker than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dow Chemical rose 1/2 to 73 5/8 after the company beat Wall Street 
expectations with its third-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Delta Air Lines and UAL (parent of United Airlines) reported unexpectedly 
strong quarterly results. Delta gained 2 1/2 to 49 1/4 and UAL rose 3 3/4 to 
89. 
</P>
<P>
 Both airline stocks helped pushed the Dow Jones transportation average up 
24.45 points, or 1.66%, to 1,495.32. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fisher Scientific International tumbled 6 3/8 to 27 3/8 on disappointing 
quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Texas Instruments jumped 2 3/8 to 73 3/4, boosted by a Merrill Lynch 
upgrade. Cisco Systems rose 1 to 30 and Microsoft was up 5/8 to 61 5/8. Micron 
Technology rose 1 to 39 3/8 and Intel rose 1/2 to 60 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Xerox fell 6 3/8 to 102. A Smith Barney analyst said the company's revenue 
growth for the third quarter was less than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * California Micro Devices gave back 1 1/8 to 5 7/8 after saying its chairman 
resigned and it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mobil rose 1 1/8 to 85 and Amoco rose 3/4 to 61 5/8, after Dean Witter 
Reynolds upgraded the stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stock markets were mostly higher. In Europe, London's Financial Times 
100 average closed up 29.7 points at the day's high of 3,029.6, while 
Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average lost 7.30 points to end at 2,013.20. Tokyo's 
225-share Nikkei average finished at 19,796.36, up 50.01 points, and Mexico's 
Bolsa index was 12.29 points higher at 2,592.29.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: THIS PROTEGE IS A LEADER IN ITS CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mazda's 1995 Protege brings the subcompact gene pool to its saturation point. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we have stylish cab-forward designs in pint size (Chrysler's Neon), smug 
little cars with dual air bags (Ford Aspire), shrunken sedans delivering 
motorcycle mileage of 56 m.p.g. (Honda Civic), four-door toys with anti-lock 
brakes (Toyota Corolla), spunky wheels modified for weekend club racing (Neon 
again), and a full flea circus of tykes with sun roofs and CDs, leather 
upholstery and alloy wheels, and all the power and remote controls of grown-up 
autos. 
</P>
<P>
 There aren't many duds in the litter. Kia's Sephia -- with mechanical seat 
belts and the look of a 1988 rerun -- might be a questionable place to spend 
hard-earned money. So would the door mouse-powered Hyundai Excel -- recently, 
and thankfully, replaced by the Accent. (The Excel, you may recall, hit 115 
m.p.h. only when Rodney King was at the wheel -- or so said the CHP.) 
</P>
<P>
 Mazda's Protege, thanks to a combination of refined engineering, quality 
equipment and superb balance when country roads become gymnastic, falls far 
from this latter lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite subcompact sizing, Protege's interior offers more shoving and 
snuggling room than even mid-size cars from BMW and Mercedes. Credit here goes 
to something called OptiSpace Design. Mazda likes to rattle on about interior 
packaging and functionality of space, but it all boils down to rethinking every 
aspect of design -- from engine compartment to body styling -- to optimize the 
process of scooping out a cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 Example: Inside panels on doors are usually flat with cranks, buttons and 
elbow rests poking into the interior of the car. Protege panels are concave, 
which buries all those handles and adds width to the passenger compartment. 
Eureka! OptiSpace Design. 
</P>
<P>
 The base engine has been puffed up from 82 to 92 horsepower from a new 
1.5-liter, 16-valve four banger. It will be standard equipment on the Protege 
DX primer and the somewhat ritzier LX model. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this increase in oomph, Protege's fuel efficiency has improved by 
almost 10% -- from 29 m.p.g in town and 36 m.p.g. on the highway, to an 
impressive 31 and 39 m.p.g. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Mazda's general downsizing and rearranging to staunch finances that 
have become a blood bath, there will be only one optional engine in the lineup. 
Fortunately for those who like a little peppermint in their motoring, that 
means a Protege ES equipped with Mazda Miata's 1.8-liter engine. This proven 
four from a highly successful two-seater produces 122 horsepower and more 
adolescent fun than might be healthy for sober adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The Protege's body has been stiffened considerably by supercomputer analysis 
and reinforced cross members for the suspension -- all of which removes much of 
the roll from hard cornering and most of the pitch from serious braking. This 
new muscle tone also produces a small car devoid of skittishness, in fact a 
subcompact of exquisite manners and a high measure of balance and security. 
Even among drivers prone to pretty impolite dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices, unfortunately, are up. Way up. 
</P>
<P>
 Base model of the 1994 Protege with a five-speed manual cost $9,500. The new 
primer is a better equipped DX stickered at $12,000. And a Protege ES with the 
Miata engine transplant costs $16,145. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the really sad comparison: For $1,000 more you could drive home in a 
small stick of dynamite known as the Ford Mustang GT with a 5.0 liter V-8. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where the car falls on its nose, however, is in exterior styling. Not only is 
Protege cautious and mainstream -- obviously aimed at cautious and mainstream 
buyers -- it is a miniaturized Millenia, with front and rear sculpture 
recognizable knockoffs from Mazda's new $26,000 luxury sedan. 
</P>
<P>
 The oddity here is that Millenia styling works for Millenia. But then Millenia 
is a larger, rather dramatic vehicle. When its lines are adapted for a sedan of 
reduced dimensions, most of the styling subtleties get lost in the 
transmogrifier. 
</P>
<P>
 So, with name and logos taped over, one could examine Protege, walk around it, 
sit in it, poke it, sneak up on it when it's sleeping -- and there would be no 
clues to its maker. Mazda? Nissan? Honda? Montgomery Ward? 
</P>
<P>
 The interior is much more enjoyable. All dials are clearly visible from a 
dashboard also concave to enhance the illusion and actuality of roomier 
insides. Cruise control, turn signals, gearshift and windshield wiper stalk 
fall easily to hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But the radio controls need relocating. They are low on the center console, 
which makes tuning a long reach, even for those wearing 36-inch sleeves. 
Despite a passenger-side fascia stuffed with an air bag, there's also a glove 
box; but only a cube of a cubby between the seats, and door trays that are 
little more than a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Puttering around town, the Protege ES is well enough insulated to keep road 
noise and sound pollution at non-irritating levels. The five-speed manual 
doesn't have the silkiness of, say, a Honda Accord, but its resistance is just 
enough to keep one thinking about the job at hand, without ever opposing the 
physical effort of shifting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The car's element seems to be a rapid canter to those realms that give John 
Law reasonable cause for lurking on medians. The steering is pure Mazda: quick 
in response, true in tracking and creating laser-true cornering. 
</P>
<P>
 At speed and never below 4,000 r.p.m, slipping from fifth to fourth, to third 
and back to fourth, produces slowing, acceleration and stability in all the 
right quantities. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not blinding power and whiplash acceleration. It is agile, peppy 
performance that elevates stitching through traffic to the edge of 
exhilarating. In this, Protege stands among the leaders of the subcompact pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some critics have slapped the car for lacking spirit and soul. They say 
that Mazda -- with a reputation for building for niches, the company that gave 
us the rotary-engined RX-7 and the Mazda Miata -- should have given Protege 
something really novel to push it ahead of intense competition. 
</P>
<P>
 A suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not stuff the car with all manner of computer systems? 
</P>
<P>
 It might have a sterling future as the Mazda Prodigy. 1994 Mazda Protege ES 
</P>
<P>
 Base Price: $16,145. 
</P>
<P>
 The Good: Finely engineered for superior handling. Subcompact with mid-size 
roominess. Economical but peppy Mazda Miata engine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bad: Safe styling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ugly: Hiked prices. 1994 Mazda Protege ES

TECHNOWATCH: THE GOODS; THE MOUSE YOU'LL WANT IN THE HOUSE

<P>
 So, you're knee-deep in remote-control units and can't find the one you want 
this minute? 
</P>
<P>
 Check out Sony's innovative VisionTouch, which will allow you to operate 
everything -- TV, VCR, CD/laser disc players, tape deck and radio -- through 
your television via one "air mouse." 
</P>
<P>
 Just hitting the stores, the VisionTouch system is simple, even for the most 
technophobic. The push of a button on the air mouse will get you on-screen 
icons, much like a menu on a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 You select the component you want to operate by pointing the wireless mouse 
and hitting the button again. 
</P>
<P>
 You can control most functions via the air mouse, including volume, replay, 
even selecting a radio station. 
</P>
<P>
 The compact VisionTouch unit, about the size of a VCR, operates with any brand 
of home-entertainment systems that have remote-control capability, not 
exclusively Sony's. 
</P>
<P>
 The VisionTouch receiver ($1,700) is available at Circuit City in Pasadena, 
Anaheim, Orange and Laguna Hills, Adray in Encino and Ken Crane in West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Or call Sony at (800) 342-5721. You're Never Too Young to Play on the Highway 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who would like to give their toddlers a head start on the information 
superhighway can consider ComfyKeyboard and Comfyland software, the first 
designed for children as young as 2. The kid-friendly keyboard hooks into a 
regular PC terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 ComfyKeyboard features large, colorful button displays and shapes, colors and 
visuals children would find hard not to touch. The ComfyLand Animated 
Interactive Movie software that comes with it enables children to interact with 
five animated characters: Comfy, the kind child; Jumpy, the mischievous dog; 
Buddy, the curious bear; Snaily, the diligent snail, and Feely, the 
absent-minded elephant. 
</P>
<P>
 A child can place or receive phone calls to these friends on the screen, and 
play educational computer games. Representatives of the Israeli company that 
developed the keyboard and software say the movie runs for 45 minutes and may 
be extended to 1 1/2 hours if the child uses the interactive feature. 
</P>
<P>
 ComfyKeyboard, with the introductory animated movie ($99) is available 
nationally in the United States at toy and computer stores. Recently introduced 
are two additional software titles: "ComfyLand, the Great Concert" ($34.95) and 
"A Christmas Present," a special software edition for the holidays ($19.99) to 
be introduced Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The keyboard and new software are available nationwide at Comp-USA, FAO 
Schwarz, the Learning Smith, Computer City and Imaginarium. (800) 99-COMFY. Not 
Just Some Puny Tissue Paper 
</P>
<P>
 Quilted Northern isn't going to tell you exactly how they did it: developed a 
bathroom tissue that doesn't fall apart when wet. The new Quilted Northern Wet 
or Dry toilet paper "contains a unique temporary strengthening agent," company 
representatives say. 
</P>
<P>
 The new tissue is soft and, with a company recommended test, you can see for 
yourself how strong it is. Have someone hold a sheet of tissue and spray it 
well with water. Then see how many quarters you can drop on it one by one. It 
will hold at least 15 quarters and up to 25 before it breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The multifunctional toilet paper can be used to remove makeup or nail polish, 
substitute as a baby wipe, clean jewelry and wipe around the sink or tub. 
</P>
<P>
 Company representatives say the tissue's added strength doesn't impede 
flushability. The National Sanitation Foundation, which certifies products 
affecting health and the environment, gave the tissue its "Safe for Septic" 
seal, meaning the paper can be used in homes with septic tanks, which normally 
require a lighter toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Quilted Northern Wet or Dry tissue, available in white ($1.69-$1.99 suggested 
retail for a six-roll package), can be purchased nationwide in grocery, 
discount, drug and club stores.

 Twenty-four men and women who have made measurable strides toward saving the 
Earth are meeting this weekend at Berkeley to compare notes. They are among the 
30 winners to date of the international Goldman Environmental Prize, which 
recognizes individual grass-roots achievement. Founded five years ago by 
California philanthropists Richard and Rhoda Goldman, the prize of $60,000 and 
a bronze trophy is given annually to an activist from each of the world's six 
inhabited continental regions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grass-roots activists demonstrate better than anybody that ordinary people 
are capable of doing extraordinary things," Richard Goldman says. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize holders, who are nominated by an international network of 
environmental groups, lead movements to protect rivers and rain forests, 
restore watersheds, fight toxic-waste dumping, encourage sustainable 
development and protect endangered species. Winners from the United States 
include Samuel LaBudde of San Francisco, whose surreptitious videos of dolphin 
slaughter on tuna boats led to "dolphin-safe" tuna; Lois Gibbs of Falls Church, 
Va., whose battle against waste dumps at Love Canal grew into a national 
movement, and JoAnn Tall of Pine Ridge, S.D., who fought nuclear testing on 
Lakota lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the prize recipients will be saluted during the first Goldman 
reunion, they will not rest on their laurels. The working program includes 
panels and seminars on ways to best address such environmental problems as 
rapid population growth, unprecedented deforestation and mass species 
extinction as well as funding strategies. Calendar 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu's Earth Trust Foundation has set Nov. 11-13 for its conference on 
"eco-psychology," a new field exploring the human relationship to the natural 
world. (For instance, how does a polluted environment affect psychological 
health?) Nine psychologists, ecologists and other experts will lead the 
sessions, which include an opening presentation in Santa Monica and a two-day 
session in Malibu. Information: 310-456-3534. . . .

 The City of Los Angeles' Hazmobile continues touring the city for pickup of 
hazardous household wastes such as paint, motor oil and pesticides. Currently 
parked in Granada Hills, the Hazmobile will visit Elysian Park on Nov. 3-5 and 
Nov. 10-12; it will be in Reseda on Nov. 17-19 and Dec. 1-3. Call the hot line 
at (800) 988-6942 to make an appointment for the drive-through collection.

 The world's most illustrious humidor designer can really bring in a crowd, 
even though he's not a cigar man. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are all of the customers for his designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sold one to someone who wanted it for keeping the remote control of the TV 
in," said the designer, Viscount David Linley. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Robert Bloomingdale and his wife, Justine, with Alfred Dunhill 
President David Salz, hosted a party for David and Serena Linley on Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 It was filled with the kind of young, worldly people whose business cards are 
engraved in both English and Japanese.  
</P>
<P>
 "I love them -- they're the cutest, nicest people," Robert Bloomingdale said 
of David, better known as a designer of classical hand-crafted furniture, and 
Serena, a painter. "I don't know a lot of royalty or that family, but they're 
really fun and easy." 
</P>
<P>
 As any royal watcher knows, "that family" includes David's aunt, Britain's 
Queen Elizabeth, and his mother, Princess Margaret. His father is Lord Snowdon. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Rest assured, the party guests would hear no comments on the tribulations of 
cousin Charles. "We have hundreds of people asking about it every day," said 
Ruth Kennedy, managing director of David Linley Furniture Ltd. "We're a 
business. We make furniture."  
</P>
<P>
 The event began at the Rodeo Drive Dunhill store for cocktails and hors 
d'oeuvres, followed by dinner around the corner at the Grill, where the 
all-American menu included Caesar salad, grilled New York steak and fudge 
brownie sundaes. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner, it was back to Dunhill for cigars and cognac. As for the humidor 
boxes, which are handcrafted of English oak, English walnut and English 
sycamore and retail for $1,950 and $14,000, Salz said they're hot items. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the English twosome who were the focus of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "David actually works extremely hard," said Lord Bruce Dundas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just his position that gets him through life. He needs to work like 
we all need to work -- he just happens to come from a famous family." 
</P>
<P>
 "Can I tell you something? They are the most phenomenal people," Salz said of 
the Linleys. "You are not necessarily conscious that you're dealing with 
royalty."  
</P>
<P>
 "For a start, I'm not royal," David said. "My mother is, but I'm not. I'm 
basically a businessman. That's all I talk about."

INK: NEW MAGAZINE DARES TO BE OLD-FASHIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; He is a columnist for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A major magazine has been launched without Kathie Lee, Oprah or any other 
media darling on the cover. Thomas Jefferson, the slave-owning architect of the 
Declaration of Independence, appears on the front of the first issue, which 
examines at absorbing length the contradictions in the life of this "American 
Sphinx." 
</P>
<P>
 Behold Civilization, the Magazine of the Library of Congress, whose 
November/December premiere goes on sale next week. The glossy bimonthly offers 
an assortment of pieces designed to reach no particular demographic except 
those with an intellectual curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dare to be old-fashioned," says Stephen G. Smith, 45, who became founding 
editor of Civilization after holding top jobs at Time, Newsweek and 
Knight-Ridder Newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see what the newsmagazines are covering these days, and when you see 
Robert Redford on the cover of the Village Voice, you realize that everyone 
else seems to be chasing after the same stories," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For Civilization, Smith adds, "There were no reader surveys, no focus groups, 
no surveys of advertisers to figure out what audiences they wanted to reach. 
This was an effort to come up with a magazine that would appeal to curious, 
engaged grown-ups who get a thrill out of finding out things." 
</P>
<P>
 A Library of Congress display of books that belonged to Adolf Hitler, 
including a volume of photos warmly inscribed to the Nazi leader by Leni 
Riefenstahl, spurred a piece on recent efforts to overlook the propagandist's 
complicity with the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
 A shelf of newly published memoirs and studies provides the grist for an essay 
on the black middle class. An 1886 map of Tombstone fortifies an argument for 
"what never really happened" in the famous shootout at the O.K. Corral. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the contributors are Stefan Kanfer and Lance Morrow, two veterans of 
Time, as well as Diana Trilling, George Plimpton and Anne Beattie. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Smith, Civilization will not necessarily celebrate the treasures 
and curiosities of the Library of Congress, but will try to cover the 
institution as if it were City Hall and "make the journalistic connection" 
between the collections and the world of today. 
</P>
<P>
 Civilization's business staff is based in Manhattan, and the editorial offices 
are in Washington. Unlike Smithsonian magazine, which is part of the 
Smithsonian Institution, Civilization is published under a long-term licensing 
agreement with the Library of Congress by an autonomous partnership controlled 
by L.O.C. Management Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The money behind L.O.C. is the corporation's president, H. Fred Krimendahl, a 
managing partner in the New York investment firm of Petrus Partners Ltd. The 
word is that L.O.C. latched on to Civilization after the Washington Post Co., 
which owns Newsweek, had passed on the idea of publishing the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial circulation guaranteed to advertisers (which include upscale names 
such as Courvoisier and Cadillac) is 150,000. The expectation is to double that 
by March and to approach 800,000 within five years. Charter subscribers were 
identified by a mailing sent to a cross-section of magazine readers, especially 
those known to be well-educated.

 Popular Pontiff: One mid-town Manhattan store's window displays Pope John Paul 
II's new book of spiritual reflections between Burt Reynolds' autobiography and 
that hot purported tell-all about Nicole Brown Simpson. An awkward grouping to 
be sure, but one that makes commercial sense because the pontiff has been able 
to generate an enormous response without prime-time attention and despite the 
cancellation of his American tour this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crossing the Threshold of Hope" sold an estimated 13,000 copies at 
Waldenbooks during its first three days to finish last week as the second 
biggest hardcover seller in the bookstore chain. It was behind Waldenbooks' No. 
1 hardcover, Faye D. Resnick's "Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a 
Life Interrupted." 
</P>
<P>
 "Crossing" was also No. 2 at Barnes & Noble Inc.'s stores. 
</P>
<P>
 These initial reports from the two major chains come even before the 
publisher, Alfred A. Knopf Inc., begins to advertise or promote the book in 
Catholic media. The Oct. 20 issue of Catholic New York, the weekly newspaper of 
the Roman Catholic archdiocese of New York, contains no mention of the book. 
</P>
<P>
 The response also has gone a long way to quell industry carping (at least for 
now) that Knopf paid an overly confident amount for the U.S. and Canadian 
rights -- more than $6 million -- and would never recoup its outlay. The size 
of the advance, which the Pope reportedly plans to donate to charity, puts him 
in a league with Colin Powell and best-selling novelists such as Mary Higgins 
Clark and Barbara Taylor Bradford. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 1.25 million copies of the $20 title went on sale Oct. 20. A 
Spanish edition, Knopf's first major experience in Spanish publishing 
domestically, has gone back to press for an additional 15,000 copies, bringing 
that total to 60,000. Large-type and audio editions also are said to be selling 
briskly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a nervous moment or two," Sonny Mehta, president and editor in 
chief of Knopf, said Tuesday. "But, finally, the cancellation of the visit 
somehow focused more attention on the book itself than if His Holiness were 
sitting at the United Nations and preempting the book in some way." 
</P>

 STARR GAZERS: Unprepared for the response to the first public tours of the 
4,000 Starr Ranch Sanctuary, Audubon Society officials have had to close off 
reservations for Saturday's open house. . . . Says Audubon spokesman Ken 
Fortune: "We got response from every ZIP code in Orange County and as far away 
as Long Beach and Vista." The wilderness preserve has been closed to all but 
members and select researchers since it was donated to the society in 1973. A 
second tour may be added later.

 YOUR HONOR? The Steve Woods murder trial is the subject of a piece in the 
latest issue of The Nation magazine, and its author, Mike Davis, isn't backward 
about which side he's on. He refers to Superior Court Judge Everett W. Dickey, 
who convicted two Latino youths in the murder of the San Clemente youth in a 
non-jury trial, as "Draconian" by reputation. . . . Davis calls the case "a 
legal lynching." Dickey's fellow judges hardly agree. The popular jurist a few 
years ago was elected a turn as presiding judge.

 RESCUE RANGERS: If you aren't familiar with the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, 
they are the TV hit among the post-Barney age group. That's why Saddleback 
Memorial Medical Center in Laguna Hills snared them for Saturday's free annual 
school kids safety classes. . . . The hospital is averaging 500-plus youngsters 
each event. They learn first aid, some CPR, bicycle and water safety. Says 
spokesman David Johnson: "We've already seen kids responding to emergencies 
after learning safety awareness here."

 CENTURY CITY: The city of San Juan Capistrano threw a party for its train 
depot Thursday, to celebrate its 100th birthday. But the red brick building 
wasn't the original. Before 1894, a Nordic-style wooden structure stood there, 
but residents wanted more of a mission-revival flavor. Parts of the original 
depot were used for a fence and downtown building. "Back then, they recycled 
everything," says Pamela Hallan-Gibson, local historian.

 The trial in a lawsuit filed against Los Angeles City Council members because 
of the votes they cast in a police brutality case began Tuesday in Federal 
Court. The result could make council members financially liable for their 
votes, as well as force them to pay damages assessed against city police 
officers out of their own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a 1990 incident in which LAPD officers outside a McDonald's 
restaurant in Sunland shot and killed three men suspected in a string of 
robberies. It was later revealed that the guns the men were carrying were 
pellet guns which were not loaded. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit was filed against former Police Chief Daryl Gates and nine of the 
officers on behalf of the slain men's families. Jurors found in favor of the 
relatives, agreeing that the police acted without provocation and that Gates 
was responsible for the way the department was run. The Los Angeles City 
Council voted to pay out of city funds the more than $44,000 in punitive 
damages assessed against Gates and the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But a new lawsuit was filed on behalf of the daughter of one of the slain men 
contending that when the council members voted to use city funds to pay the 
damages, they approved of the officers' conduct and should share in the blame 
financially. Both a U.S. District Court judge and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals have agreed that the new lawsuit is a valid one. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the public be allowed to sue City Council members because of the votes 
they cast? 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Bender, past lieutenant governor, Pacific Southwest District, Mid-San 
Fernando Valley Optimist International: 
</P>
<P>
 "It borders on the ridiculous. Where will it end? If this is the state we're 
in, people should be afraid to be jurors or cast a vote on anything, because 
the system would turn against them. The police officers didn't know whether or 
not real guns were being pointed at them and the City Council was acting well 
within their jurisdiction In today's climate, everyone is forced to be so 
afraid of taking a stand." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Yagman, attorney for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit: 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S District Court in L.A. and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San 
Francisco have ruled that the Los Angeles City Council members, in voting to 
cover damages for police officers in a brutality case as part of their 
administrative function, can be sued for having done that. It really makes no 
difference at all what anybody, including me, thinks about it because that's 
the law." 
</P>
<P>
 James Pearson, chief assistant city attorney for Los Angeles: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are going to be held responsible for damages of this nature, there has 
to be an articulated case authority already on the books stating that, if you 
conduct a certain act, you've got a problem. Such a case is not on the books. 
In fact, (state law) allows government entities to pay for punitive damages 
assessed upon an employee if they find that the employee was acting within the 
course and scope of his employment, acted without malicious intent or fraud and 
that payment of the damages is in the best interest of that public entity. The 
City Council has the right to take the perspective that, given the nature of 
the case, damages should be paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Schwartz, UCLA law professor: 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, the victims would be happy to have the city cover damages because 
they would be more assured of receiving their money. I guess the lawsuit wanted 
to punish the officers and, therefore, they received less punishment when the 
city voted to reimburse. State law holds, however, that an agency has the 
authority to cover damages (assessed against a public employee) if they believe 
that employee was acting in good faith."

188: A FRAUD, PERIOD; CYNICAL PROPOSITION DESERVES A SHOUTED 'NO!' AT THE POLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's only one thing voters have to know about Proposition 188: It's a 
complete fraud. Keep that simple truth in mind and this initiative will be 
buried on Nov. 8 under the landslide of righteous rejection that its cynical 
intentions so richly merit. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco companies have spent millions of dollars to get Proposition 188 on the 
ballot and then to try to persuade voters that it would be good for them, 
helpful to California business, even -- God help us all -- beneficial to public 
health. It is, their propaganda blares, "the reasonable solution." As about 
three seconds of common-sense reflection should make clear, the tobacco 
companies aren't spending a fortune promoting Proposition 188 for selfless 
reasons. They expect to reap a handsome return on their investment. How? By 
expanding opportunities for people to smoke and so to encourage more smoking 
and, of course, bigger cigarette sales profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188 would weaken, not strengthen, virtually every effective 
anti-smoking law, local and state, now on the books in California. Whatever 
this measure claims it would do to keep cigarettes out of the hands of minors 
or to protect nonsmokers from deadly exposure to secondhand smoke, existing 
laws already do better. Proposition 188 talks about being "tough" when it comes 
to selling cigarettes to the young. It "doubles current fines for selling 
tobacco to minors, up to $2,000 for a third offense," say its ads. What they 
don't say, but what the text of Proposition 188 does, is that the fine could be 
waived if a "person, firm or corporation" had acted in "good faith" when 
selling cigarettes to minors. As used here, good faith requires nothing more 
than posting small signs saying cigarette sales to minors are illegal and 
having employees sign statements saying they're aware of that. Wow, talk about 
tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its advertised virtues is that Proposition 188 "preserves freedom of 
choice" by giving "individual restaurant and business owners the flexibility" 
either to prohibit smoking or permit it in designated areas. But where's the 
"freedom of choice" for the 80% of the public that doesn't smoke and that 
doesn't want to be exposed to secondhand smoke? Proposition 188 has a lot of 
verbiage about ventilation systems that are supposed to whisk away smoke from 
the 25% of a restaurant where smoking would be permitted, implying that 
nonsmokers would be spared from exposure to tobacco pollutants. But independent 
experts strongly question the efficacy of such systems. The preferable approach 
is just to leave in place existing laws that ban smoking in restaurants and 
most other enclosed workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188 would not impose tough statewide smoking restrictions. It 
would supplant existing tough measures with rules that favor smokers and profit 
the tobacco industry. It would not get tougher with those who sell cigarettes 
to minors but would instead override a strong new measure by Sen. Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica) that is to take effect Jan. 1. Finally, Proposition 188 does 
nothing -- we repeat, nothing -- to protect nonsmokers. It only slashes the 
protections existing anti-smoking laws have provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The backers of Proposition 188 believe that California's voters are fools who 
can be duped by a glitzy, enormously expensive and manipulatively dishonest 
advertising campaign into voting against their own health interests. That 
conclusion must be repudiated. We urge an emphatic rejection of Proposition 
188, and the duplicitous campaign behind it.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: SCHOOL BOARD JOB DESCRIPTION IS A CHALLENGING ONE INDEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERRY LOOFBOURROW, Sherry Loofbourrow is a member of the Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District Board of Education and the 1994 president of the 
California School Boards Assn. She has served on her board for 13 years and is 
not running for reelection. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Nov. 8, voters throughout California will be electing thousands of school 
board members to lead their communities' most important enterprise -- their 
neighborhood school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 As multimillion-dollar corporations, school districts are often the largest 
employer in a community, with the largest transportation and food service 
operations, and the greatest number of facilities to maintain. These 
corporations are headed by boards of directors -- local school board members. 
</P>
<P>
 In California there are over 5,000 school board members governing more than 
1,000 local school districts in which 5.3 million children are educated. This 
is the largest and most diverse public school system in the nation -- and 40% 
of California's state budget goes to support it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's vitally important for voters to pay close attention to the citizens they 
select to oversee their schools -- the lay governing board members to whom they 
entrust their children and their tax dollars. In fact, voters hold their 
schools accountable through the board members they elect. But first they have a 
responsibility to elect the best possible people to serve on their local 
governing boards. 
</P>
<P>
 What does a board member do? 
</P>
<P>
 There are certain core decision-making functions so fundamental to a school 
system's accountability to the public that, in our system of democracy, they 
can be performed only by an elected governing body. Therefore, locally elected 
board members are responsible for: 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishing a long-term vision for their school system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishing and maintaining a basic organizational structure for their 
school system, including hiring a superintendent, adopting an annual budget and 
governance policies, and creating a climate that promotes excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establishing systems and processes to ensure accountability to the 
community, including fiscal accountability, accountability for programs and 
student performance, staff accountability and collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advocacy in behalf of children and public education at the community, state 
and national levels. 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of person do you need to fill such a position? 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, you need board members who represent the community, possess a 
variety of styles and backgrounds and have a diversity of views. There is no 
perfect school board member model, but there are a number of basic 
characteristics that effective board members have in common: 
</P>
<P>
 * Effective board members have a clear understanding of their leadership 
duties and of their central, powerful role in providing quality education. They 
are also aware that power flows from the community, through them, to the school 
system and that they are accountable to the community and to society at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * They understand the importance of teamwork. They know they need to work with 
their board colleagues and staff. They know schools don't operate in a vacuum, 
so they need to collaborate with other public agencies and form partnerships 
with business to make sure we have created communities healthy for children and 
schools that elicit the best from all students. 
</P>
<P>
 * They have a positive attitude and are able to engender an atmosphere of 
creative, high-energy productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 * They are respectful -- able to listen well to colleagues and constituents 
and to mobilize the best efforts of their staff. 
</P>
<P>
 * They have integrity and are worthy of the community's trust. 
</P>
<P>
 * They communicate openly and honestly. 
</P>
<P>
 * They behave with a high level of professionalism, setting a tone for the 
entire district that communicates the importance and seriousness of the 
endeavor for which they are responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 * They operate with fairness, firmness, stability, sustained effort and 
consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, board members must dedicate the necessary time to perform their 
duties well. An effective board member can easily spend up to 20 hours a week 
in meetings, taking phone calls, talking with students, parents, teachers, 
school personnel and constituents, visiting schools, and reading or attending 
workshops and seminars to continually expand their capacity to understand and 
support education reform issues. Being a board member is a major commitment and 
sacrifice of family, career and leisure time to public service. The candidate 
you vote for should not be making that commitment lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members must be resilient. They must be able to maintain their focus on 
making a positive difference even under fire. In a democracy, you cannot please 
everyone, but you make sure the greater good for the most people is served. 
Even if you receive criticism from some, while acknowledging their right to 
feel as they do, you must have the fortitude to lead systems forward in 
response to the wishes of the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Effective board members are future-focused change agents who have patience. 
They know change is an ongoing process, and to move school systems forward more 
rapidly than ever before means taking the time to engender public 
understanding, support and participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, the board members you elect must have a passionate commitment to 
public schools and to educating all children. 
</P>
<P>
 They must have a passion for democracy, with a true understanding that their 
role is to implement the will of the majority, not to impose their own will on 
other people's children. 
</P>
<P>
 Every single voter has the ability to move the schools of their communities 
and this state forward. The first step? Vote wisely on Nov. 8.

 The record now stands at 42-0-1 -- weaving, wobbling, but, yes, still standing 
-- and if you want to know the secret behind this undefeated streak at Los 
Alamitos High, John Barnes, the school's head football coach, will tell you 
this much: 
</P>
<P>
 The first 41 are the easy ones. 
</P>
<P>
 At 42, the weekly routine tends to get tougher, sort of like life itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the streak was down to its final 12 seconds before Los Alamitos' 
junior quarterback, Kevin Feterik, found Tony Hartley open in the Edison end 
zone, thereby trashing one whale of a bedtime story for the future children of 
those Edison football players. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night, the streak hadn't quite bit the dust, but it was certainly on 
its belly, ready for a taste test. 
</P>
<P>
 Archrival Esperanza had thrown everything it had at the streak -- threw away 
its old coffee-grinder offense and replaced it with a four-wideout set that was 
the mirror image of Los Al's -- and, for a few precious moments, had the 
Griffins beaten at their own game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Esperanza 32, Los Al 28 with 1:57 to play and 83 yards of chewed turf 
staring the Griffins in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Los Al sideline, Barnes squinted into the Veterans Stadium floodlights, 
watched 10,000 teen-agers and parents bob up and down with excitement and began 
to reflect on the streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-two games without a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 On the wall calendar, that's three years, almost to the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Some good times, Barnes said to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 And you know what? 
</P>
<P>
 This right here might be the best one yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking to myself, 'What a great, great high school football game this 
is,' " Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was I worried? No, I was really caught up in the game, enjoying it the whole 
way. This might have been the greatest game for the fans, either way, whoever 
wins, that I've ever seen. It was one of those games where you feel sorry 
somebody lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Just then, a loud burst of laughter ambushed Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I'm not saying I'm sorry they lost," Barnes giggled, wrapping an arm 
around a bystander, using him for support. "I won't go quite that far." 
</P>
<P>
 No, this one was sweet, all the way down to Feterik's game-winning touchdown 
pass to Stan Guyness with 1:15 left and Dax Houston's game-icing sack of 
Esperanza quarterback Chris Stretch with 52 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 That's another thing Barnes has learned about undefeated streaks. Even after 
43 in a row, the taste never tires. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked to be undefeated," Barnes said after this one, a 35-32 triumph, 
was in the books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought the streak would last this far. With Kennedy, Carson, Muir, 
Edison and Esperanza on our schedule, I thought we'd have been beaten by now." 
</P>
<P>
 But with 1:57 to play in a four-point game? 
</P>
<P>
 On first down, 83 yards to go? 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes insisted there was never a doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "You kidding?" he said. "With the guys we've got, it's never over. In fact, I 
thought we might have gone down there and scored too quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 With Feterik and a four-deep fleet of wide receivers that turn opposing 
defensive coordinators gray before their time, Los Alamitos is capable of 
traveling huge distances in one sweep of the minute hand. 
</P>
<P>
 On this occasion, Feterik needed 42 seconds to go 83 yards. He got the first 
31 by himself, on an improvisational scramble that prompted gasps of "Uh-oh" on 
the Aztec sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 One completion later and the ball was on the Esperanza 30, 1:21 on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik drops back again and it's bombs over Edison all over again. His lob 
pass to Guyness in the right side of the end zone is perfectly placed, just 
over the head of defensive back Dahrin Footman -- the cruelest of climaxes, 
considering how far Footman had taken the Aztecs with 156 rushing yards and two 
touchdowns on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody ever said it was going to be easy," Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody ever said this job was easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ecstatic, Barnes bounced from point to point, topic to topic. He mentioned his 
mother, Theora, whom he had visited in the hospital earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's her birthday," Barnes beamed. "She had her radio plugged in and I know 
she listened to this one all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we didn't give her a heart attack," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was probably the one who had the heart attack." 
</P>
<P>
 How much more can a coach, and a 43-game unbeaten streak, take? 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows?" Barnes said. "I'm surprised to be this far. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the kids believe. I believe, too."

THEY ARE VOICES OF EXPERIENCE; NBA TEAMS TURN BACK THE CLOCK BY HIRING DICK 
MOTTA (63), BILL FITCH (60) AND DEL HARRIS (57) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Del Harris was sitting by his hotel swimming pool at the Lakers' training camp 
in Hawaii when a woman walked over. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're Del Harris, aren't you?" she asked. "Coach of the Lakers?"  
</P>
<P>
 Harris nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may not remember, but you coached against my grandfather," she 
</P>
<P>
 said. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, he had. It was when Harris coached at Earlham College in Richmond, 
Ind., in the mid-'60s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Fitch has been around so long, he is recycling families. 
</P>
<P>
 When he coached at Bowling Green in 1967 and 1968, one of his players was Walt 
Piatkowski. Fitch is coaching Eric Piatkowski, Walt's son, with the Clippers 
this season, his 22nd in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Motta, now in his second tour as coach of the Dallas Mavericks, can 
remember being a part-time reporter at road games when he coached the expansion 
Chicago Bulls in their first season in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no beat writers on the road traveling with the team," Motta said. 
"It was nice. I would call in results to the newspapers when we won. If we 
didn't, I wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes in the NBA, where coaching experience obviously counts, and 
never more than this season with the return to coaching of Harris, Fitch and 
Motta. 
</P>
<P>
 They have coached a combined 52 years in the NBA, 22 by Motta, who left Weber 
State for the wilds of the NBA when Lyndon Johnson was president. 
</P>
<P>
 Motta said he's coaching again for one reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great, it's really great," he said. "But on the serious side, I was 
really concerned about some of the coaching assignments." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, they're back again, which represents either a coaching trend or a 
turn-back-the-clock promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris is 57, Motta is 63 and Fitch is 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's coming back next? Red Holzman? 
</P>
<P>
 "Red might," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, there is a quartet of Reds who coached in the NBA -- Holzman, 
Auerbach, Kerr, Rocha. Heck, bring 'em all back. We could call it the new good 
old days. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Harris' opinion that his presence on the sideline, and that of Motta and 
Fitch, represents a new philosophy in hiring coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not surprising to me that owners look at $200-million operations and 
they think maybe they should have an experienced person in there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a novice and you wouldn't put him at the head of a company, like a 
construction company. The owner wouldn't say, 'Hey, you look good, how about 
taking over my $200-million company?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Harris quickly pointed out that some of the finest coaches in the game are 
former players, such as Don Nelson, Pat Riley, Lenny Wilkens, Rudy Tomjanovich, 
Phil Jackson, George Karl, Paul Westphal and Dan Issel. 
</P>
<P>
 Motta is the only active NBA coach who has coached in four decades. He has 
worked with the Bulls, Washington Bullets, Mavericks, Sacramento Kings and now 
the Mavericks again. 
</P>
<P>
 That means he has lasted long enough to note that whatever coaching trend we 
have now probably is going to change. Here's the cycle: from hiring former 
players to hiring college coaches to hiring former players to hiring -- how 
shall we say it? -- previously employed coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess which particular philosophy Motta dislikes most? 
</P>
<P>
 "To see the NBA, the so-called elite basketball league, it's interesting to 
see we had a period of hiring quite a few coaches who had no experience of ever 
calling a timeout," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch has called zillions of timeouts, many of them during the dark ages of 
the expansion franchise in Cleveland when it was the only way to halt the 
onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch has coached at Cleveland, Boston, Houston and New Jersey, all of which 
had major losers before his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 This is great preparation for coaching the Clippers, an experience that isn't 
likely to chill his blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been 200 games under .500 before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Odds are this won't happen in one season at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch has his own reason for coaching again. After all, he could be back on 
his spread in Conroe, Tex., and playing golf every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do it because I like it," he said. "I did it 20 years ago because I needed 
it to make a living. I don't worry about the first and the 15th anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen which of them -- Harris, Fitch or Motta -- ages the 
quickest. Chances are it will be Fitch, because his team needs the most work, 
but Harris has a head start because his hair already is totally white. 
</P>
<P>
 Motta said he thinks most fans believe Harris to be older than either he or 
Fitch because of the white hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's OK with me," Motta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, a barber's son from Indiana, has had white hair most of his adult life 
so it makes him look older. Sometimes it confuses people who know him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't look like he's 57," James Worthy said. "He doesn't look a day 
over, oh, 45." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fitch: "Del was born with that hair." 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly working in tandem with the white hair, Harris has interesting things 
to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he opens his mouth, you'd think he invented the game with Dr. Naismith," 
Worthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris hasn't been around that long, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a very young 57," he said. "I don't want my 4-year-old son to feel like 
he's operating under a hardship." 
</P>
<P>
 You want hardship, you talk money. Harris' coaching career began at a junior 
high school in Johnson City, Tenn., in 1959. He made $2,750 a year, which is 
roughly the same amount that current players get for walking across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Harris, Fitch and Motta are here again, proving that there is 
indeed life after coaching in the NBA. It's coaching in the NBA.

HE ALREADY HAD NIGHT OF HORROR; RAIDERS: MCCALLUM HOPES TO PLAY AGAIN AFTER 
SEASON-ENDING KNEE INJURY. HE RETURNED TO COLISEUM ON SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 This television picture needed no replays. Anybody who saw it will never 
forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 What began as a televised football game turned into a horror movie. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Raiders, San Francisco 49ers, Candlestick Park. "Monday Night Football" 
season opener. Big game. Big show. Big national audience. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler handed off to Napoleon 
McCallum, who ran up the middle for a yard before he was stopped by linebacker 
Ken Norton Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Routine play. McCallum had done it hundreds of times in a football career that 
stretched back to the early 1980s at the Naval Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 But when McCallum failed to get up, and Hostetler rushed over to help, and 
Norton remained underneath the Raider back to prevent further movement, it 
quickly became evident that this was anything but routine. 
</P>
<P>
 The replays showed McCallum planting his left leg, then getting pulled down in 
one direction with his leg pointing in another, stretched and strained and 
misshapen as if it were made of rubber. McCallum wasn't in pain; he couldn't 
feel the leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought of it like a broken leg," he recalled. "Something was wrong 
down there. I didn't look." 
</P>
<P>
 But he heard Hostetler say, "Don't move. Don't move. Are you all right, Nap? 
Are you all right?" 
</P>
<P>
 And he heard others in the background saying things like, "Oh my gosh! Don't 
move, Ken, don't move." 
</P>
<P>
 On TV, the announcers were warning the public before showing the 
stomach-turning replays. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he wasn't in any pain, McCallum couldn't understand all the commotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, is it that bad?" he asked himself. "What is going on here?" 
</P>
<P>
 What was going on was the worst football injury Clarence Shields, McCallum's 
physician, had seen in 22 years of medical practice. Shields said it was the 
kind of injury one might see in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or on a pedestrian hit by a car," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 McCallum had ruptured an artery in the leg, stretched a nerve, dislocated his 
kneecap, damaged a calf muscle and his hamstring, torn parts of three of four 
ligaments and developed a blood clot. 
</P>
<P>
 He was taken into surgery so fast that, when the anesthesia wore off, he found 
grass from Candlestick Park still on his back. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't even give me a bath before they did the surgery," McCallum said. 
</P>
<P>
 And for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could have lost the leg if he had not had medical treatment for four or 
five hours," Shields said. "He had no circulation in the leg." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, McCallum had surgery twice. In the first operation, a bypass was 
done, the injured artery was replaced with a vein from the opposite leg and the 
blood clot was cleared up. Ten days later, McCallum had reconstructive surgery 
on the ligaments and repairs to the calf muscle and the hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't done yet. There will be a third operation, probably in January, at 
which time tendons, including one from a cadaver, will be used to finish 
repairing the ligaments. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgery was difficult, but two of the most traumatic stages of McCallum's 
recovery have been his viewing of the replay and his return to the Coliseum to 
watch the Raiders play. 
</P>
<P>
 McCallum first saw the replay while he was still in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then, I could handle it a lot better than I can now," he said. "I've 
seen it four times. The still pictures are the worst. . . . It's something I 
just wanted to see. I can't see how anyone could get hurt like that and not see 
it at least one time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never concerned about knee injuries. This was wild. It wasn't even a 
vicious tackle. It's the (pile-ups). When I went to the game (last Sunday), 
every time I saw a pile, I just cringed." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight weeks have passed since that frightful night, eight weeks of agony, of 
pain, of rehabilitation and determination. McCallum is a regular visitor to the 
Raiders' El Segundo training headquarters, where he does part of his rehab 
work. He walks with a limp and still has no feeling on the top of his left 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
 But McCallum, a deeply religious man, has positive feelings about the tragic 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm real thankful," he said. "It could have been a worse injury, even though 
a lot of people cringed. That spinal injury, where you snap your neck and are 
paralyzed, thank God it wasn't something like that. This injury, I'm working 
out every day. I can ride the bike. It just gets better every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering where McCallum started, lying helpless on the Candlestick grass, 
his progress has been surprising, even to Shields. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an amazing athlete," the doctor said. "He's tremendously motivated with 
a great work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
 But McCallum doesn't want merely to walk normally again. He wants to run -- on 
a football field. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning, I was just recuperating," McCallum said. "I'm still 
recuperating, but every once in a while, people throw out that (playing again). 
Now, I'm listening to it a little more than I did before. Even though they say 
it's crazy, I don't want to go out with an injury. If I play again, it'll only 
be for one year to get back on that horse and ride around." 
</P>
<P>
 Is it a realistic possibility for McCallum to think about playing again, or is 
it merely a mind game to motivate him in rehab? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a possibility. It's definitely a possibility," said Shields, who 
believes the key is the return of full feeling in the damaged nerve. "The 
amount of damage is the most anyone could sustain in one knee. But if anybody 
can (come back), he can."

HE LOVES L.A.; DIVAC HAS GONE HOLLYWOOD, BUT HE HASN'T FORGOTTEN HIS ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember when he arrived? 
</P>
<P>
 He was more curiosity than anything in that fall of 1989, although big-time 
disappointment didn't rank far behind among his teammates. They were envious of 
other clubs that were fortunate enough to get one of the tough-minded Eastern 
European imports, such as Sarunas Marciulionis or Drazen Petrovic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers started with modest goals, something along the lines of "Come to 
training camp in shape," and even that proved too much for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 An inability to speak English was the least of his problems. Avoiding the 
wrath of Magic Johnson -- now there was a concern! Meanwhile, he went steady 
with cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 He lived the American Dream and world tragedy as one. He went from making the 
equivalent of $12,000 one season, and facing an army hitch, to training in 
Hawaii the next, living in Marina del Rey and working his way toward a contract 
that in 1993-94 paid him more than $12,000 a quarter. He had a tutor named 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and a teammate named Magic . . . and he would go home at 
night after a game, turn on the TV, see countrymen dying in the streets and 
hope he didn't recognize any faces. 
</P>
<P>
 All that when he was 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could say now it was nothing," Vlade Divac said of his path. "But it 
wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course it was something. It was more than most people could realize, this 
transition that has included the birth of two sons in the United States and the 
death of his country and a close friend, this change from a Yugoslav hero so 
beloved that his wedding was televised nationally, to Western capitalist pig. 
Few athletes in any sport have prospered and endured as much at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 He has had five seasons as a Laker center with a sixth, as a power forward, 
starting a week from today. Vlade has gone Hollywood -- "All the way," teammate 
James Worthy said, grinning -- and he is far from the stranger in a strange 
land anymore, but the transformation does run out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 America, its culture so different from the Yugoslavia he grew up in, hasn't 
changed Vlade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he has stayed the same as before," his father said. "He didn't change 
that much." 
</P>
<P>
 Milenko Divac pauses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He treats people the same as before," he concludes. "He likes people. It 
doesn't matter which position these people are or which position Vlade is." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Marc Fleisher, who met Divac in early 1989 and has been his agent 
practically ever since: "I don't think he has changed dramatically, other than 
he is obviously able to take advantage of some of the perks that money affords 
him. When I first met him, he had one pair of pants, one pair of shoes and no 
sneakers. I don't even believe he had workout shorts with him when he came 
over. I lent him a tie and a shirt to wear at the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "He obviously lives a very comfortable lifestyle now. But I think he is still 
the same person. His values are the same. He is a father now, and that has 
changed him a little bit, but that would have happened to anyone, not just 
someone from another country." 
</P>
<P>
 The changes in Divac, those who know him best say, have been outward. He still 
has the same boyish, infectious personality that Forum fans first took as 
innocence, that got him several roles in fast-food and razor commercials and TV 
sitcoms -- Vlade, meet Al Bundy -- despite a struggle with the language. It's 
just that he now also has a six-year, $22.8-million contract that will pay 
$3.33 million this season, among the highest salaries in the league, a 
beautiful house in a gated community of Pacific Palisades, a BMW and a Toyota 
Land Cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been one other change since he and wife Ana came to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He has found a new hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Yugoslavian who loves America -- my kids are Americans, you know," 
Divac said boastfully. "They're always going to be half and half because they 
were born here and, I hope, live here, but they will always have a background 
of Yugoslavian. I'm still a Serbian, but with an American lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "U.S. is closer to me than any country in Europe, except Serbia. After six 
years, I feel U.S. is like my second country. L.A. is like my real town. I have 
a city where I was born (Prijepolje). . . . Besides that city and the city 
where I was playing when I grew up and had a big apartment (Kraljevo), I feel 
that my home is here. When I go to Europe, I am homesick, but I am homesick for 
L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Divac and his family return every summer to Prijepolje to see his parents, who 
still live in the house where he grew up. Now, however, it is about 30 miles 
from the front lines of the 30-month-old civil war in what has become the 
independent country of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ana's parents are about 250 miles 
from the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 This is also what has changed about Vlade: the people around him. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Petrovic. He and Divac were very close, teammates since their teen years 
on the Yugoslavian junior national team and talking almost every day when they 
first came to the United States, one with the Lakers and the other with the 
Portland Trail Blazers. It didn't matter then that the big man was Serbian and 
the shooting guard Croatian. Then the war came, and a fence went up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never called me back," Divac said. "When I asked him, he told me it was 
because I am Serb." 
</P>
<P>
 Divac tried to talk when they saw each other, even if only to say hello, but 
Petrovic turned his head. It was one-sided because Divac has remained 
apolitical about the conflict, but friends had become enemies on the other 
side. It hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "They spent, like, 10 years together, staying in the same room all the time," 
Ana Divac said. "They were, like, calling each other on the phone when they 
would have a good game in America. They were friends. Of course it hurt him." 
</P>
<P>
 Divac thought he could get his friend back eventually. Then Petrovic, who had 
been traded to the New Jersey Nets, was killed in a car crash in Germany in the 
summer of 1993. Vlade got the news while watching television on vacation in 
Hawaii and cried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought when the war was over, we would have a chance to sit down and talk 
about it," he says now. "Now, I no have the chance to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The climate with Dino Radja of the Boston Celtics and Toni Kukoc of the 
Chicago Bulls is better. Both are Croats, but don't adhere to the hard-line 
stance Petrovic took. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are friends," said Radja, the closer of the two with Divac. "There is no 
reason I shouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
 Kukoc, meanwhile, says his relationship with Divac is "not bad. It's not the 
same like it was before, and I don't know really the reason why it is like 
that. Maybe because of the situation in our country. But that's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what gets Divac, how difficult it is to remain neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to a church-organized fund-raiser last season in Milwaukee, which has 
one of the largest Serbian communities in the United States, because the money 
was earmarked for children of all ethnic backgrounds in his homeland. His 
appearance helped pull in about $7,000 in 2 1/2 hours, but some people later 
complained that he shouldn't have helped either side. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the occasional letters, sent via the Forum, telling him what a 
bad person he is for being a Serb.  
</P>
<P>
 He says he handles those outside pressures well, and his play supports such a 
claim. Last season was his best yet. He led the Lakers in scoring (14.2) and 
rebounding (10.8) and, of all things, evolved into a team leader. Even Johnson, 
his "big brother" and part-time taskmaster, was proud. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's more comfortable with the country, he's more comfortable with L.A. as a 
city, and he's more comfortable with himself as an NBA player," Johnson said. 
"Guys have more respect for him now. Before, you could hit him and be over him 
and to the basket. That's what guys would do. They would hit him with a sharp 
elbow and Vlade would go away. Now, you hit him with a sharp elbow and he 
probably will even hit you back. Either that or he'd take it out on you on the 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 Which, at last, makes Vlade Divac, the person everyone always liked, the 
basketball player everyone wanted him to be. Now there's a change. Years later, 
he has arrived all over again.

NBA ENSURES A FULL SEASON; PRO BASKETBALL: NO-STRIKE / NO-LOCKOUT AGREEMENT 
AVOIDS WORK STOPPAGE AS CONTRACT TALKS CONTINUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying their hand at the new national pastime -- hardball -- NBA owners 
offered their players a no-lockout pledge, demanded a no-strike pledge and got 
it. That ensured, after a strike in baseball and a lockout in hockey, that the 
NBA season will open a week from today and play through June. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 1994-95 season through and including our finals will be played in their 
entirety," NBA Commissioner David Stern said Thursday at a joint news 
conference in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to announce the season will go on," said Charles Grantham, head of 
the players' association. "Our players are very concerned about the integrity 
of the game and a full and complete championship season." 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA has never had a work stoppage, but its last collective bargaining 
agreement expired in June and there have been no formal negotiating sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The union put forth a list of proposals to overturn the present system, 
seeking to abolish the salary cap and the draft but, before negotiating, tried 
to pursue its case through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their union's tough stance, however, players recently began taking a 
softer line, emboldening owners to demand an assurance they wouldn't go out. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports surfaced that several young stars, including Shaquille O'Neal and 
Alonzo Mourning, had passed word they didn't want to go on strike. Leonard 
Armato, the agent for O'Neal and Hakeem Olajuwon, said he didn't see the need 
for a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Bulls didn't even have a union player representative. Several 
Indiana Pacer veterans came out against a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'd go on strike," Pacer center LaSalle Thompson said. "I'd run 
through that picket line. Sam Mitchell and I were joking, that if the owners 
locked us out, we'd sue them to let us come back to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley went on TV to advocate a rookie salary cap -- a give-back the 
owners had asked for. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA and the union have now agreed not to disrupt play this season. 
Negotiations for the new contract will begin soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA has asked for a hard cap -- one with an absolute ceiling -- instead of 
the current one that allows teams to sign their own free agents to contracts of 
any size, such as the Lakers' $14-million balloon payment to Magic Johnson for 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has offered a rookie cap but wants to do away with the old cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear we have a long way to go, a long, hard negotiation ahead of us," 
Grantham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Union President Buck Williams of the Portland Trail Blazers said he liked the 
idea of a no-strike, no-lockout deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope and pray there is no work stoppage," Williams said. "There would be no 
winner. It would be foolish at this point to have a work stoppage." 
</P>
<P>
 The union lost its antitrust suit challenging the salary cap, the college 
draft and restricted free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York is expected to hand down a 
verdict on the appeal soon. 
</P>
<P>
 No formal talks have been held in months, although the sides -- led by Stern 
and Grantham -- have met in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been reports Wednesday that NBA owners were threatening to lock the 
players out. The lockout was to have been voted on at a meeting of the Board of 
Governors next Monday in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern is believed to have persuaded the owners to start the season under the 
terms of the old contract, in return for the players' promise not to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Board of Governors has been told it can go trick-or-treating on Monday," 
Stern said. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUT OF ACTION 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Mullin of the Golden State Warriors will be sidelined six to eight weeks 
while he recovers from a knee injury. C4 
</P>

BAGWELL BAGS ALL THE MVP VOTES; BASEBALL: ASTRO FIRST BASEMAN WINS AWARD 
DESPITE SUFFERING A BROKEN HAND TWO DAYS BEFORE STRIKE BEGAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Bagwell, who appeared in only 110 games but produced statistics befitting 
a full season, was named unanimous winner of the National League's 
most-valuable-player award Thursday. Only Orlando Cepeda in 1967 and Mike 
Schmidt in 1980 had previously been elected unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston Astro first baseman received all 28 first-place votes and 392 
points from a committee of the Baseball Writers Assn. of America. Matt 
Williams, the San Francisco Giants' third baseman who led the major leagues in 
home runs with 43, received 201 points and finished second. Montreal Expo 
outfielder Moises Alou was third with 183. 
</P>
<P>
 In his fourth major league season, Bagwell, 26, dominated league statistics. 
He led in runs batted in with 116 (tops in the majors) and was second in 
batting average at .368, in home runs with 39, hits with 147, and on-base 
percentage. He was first in runs, total bases, extra-base hits and slugging 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of what I did and a little worried about doing it again," Bagwell 
said in a conference call. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always said I was a guy who might hit 25 to 30 home runs. I hit 39. 
That's a little scary to me. I had 116 RBIs by Aug. 10. I feel I played as well 
as I can, which makes next year a real test for me. We're going to find out how 
good I really am." 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell's season ended on Aug. 10 when a pitch thrown by Andy Benes of the San 
Diego Padres broke his left hand. The players went on strike two days later. It 
was suggested to Bagwell on Thursday that he might have the strike, partially, 
at least, to thank for the award, considering that Williams or Alou might 
eventually have surpassed the sidelined Bagwell statistically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see that point," Bagwell said. "On the other hand, I think I would have 
been well enough to play the last month and would have had the opportunity to 
improve upon my numbers and help the Astros win the division. Either way, I 
think I'd have come out a winner. People may say that the award doesn't mean as 
much because of the shorter season, but I'm not going to say that. I'm honored 
and grateful to win it." 
</P>
<P>
 The award netted Bagwell $100,000 in bonuses, but he is caught in the winter 
of uncertainty, unsure of what rules apply or how his $2.4-million salary of 
1994 will multiply. Bagwell said he is interested only in getting back on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get back out there and see if I can do this again," he said.

<P>
 Senior forward Tremayne Anchrum might have to sit out the USC basketball 
season after suffering a knee injury in practice Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchrum, who has started 33 games, will have reconstructive surgery today at 
USC University Hospital after injuring his right knee in a collision with 
teammate Kirk Homenick. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate for Tremayne, especially since he is a senior who was 
looking toward having a great season," said USC assistant Charlie Parker, who 
along with Jack Fertig is coaching the Trojans while Coach George Raveling 
recovers from injuries suffered in a traffic accident last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchrum, who averaged 6.3 points and 5.4 rebounds last season, has a redshirt 
year of eligibility to use. LONNIE WHITE

U.S. COULD PROFIT FROM FIFA'S $100 MILLION; SOCCER: STAGGERING WORLD CUP NET 
EARNINGS COULD BRING ANOTHER TOURNAMENT AS EARLY AS THE YEAR 2010. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The United States' chances of staging another World Cup, perhaps as early as 
2010, were enhanced considerably Thursday when FIFA released its financial 
figures for last summer's tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, the general secretary of international soccer's 
governing body, said FIFA made a net profit of almost $100 million from World 
Cup USA '94. This is over and above the $60-million profit already announced by 
the U.S. organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the FIFA financial report, the tournament produced revenue to 
FIFA of $84,304,500 from ticket sales, $90,601,644 from television rights and 
$60,217,500 from merchandising, for a total of $235,123,644. 
</P>
<P>
 Expenses involved in organizing and staging the event totaled $135,434,480, 
leaving what FIFA termed "surplus receipts" of $99,689,164. 
</P>
<P>
 The profit is split, with 30% going to the local organizing committee and 70% 
to the national soccer federations. The 24 World Cup '94 teams will each 
receive more than $650,000 per team for each game played. In the case of the 
U.S. Soccer Federation, this figure is $2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For FIFA, the 1994 tournament was one of the most profitable, and several 
organization executives said the World Cup very easily could return to the 
United States within two decades. A USSF official said 2010 is most likely the 
earliest the United States will try to stage the event again. 
</P>
<P>
 The presentation of the financial statement was one of several noteworthy 
developments on the final day of FIFA's three-day meeting here. In other 
decisions made by the Executive Committee: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Africa gained ground at the expense of Europe in the allocation of 
additional berths in the 1998 World Cup in France, and the United States' hopes 
of qualifying got a solid boost. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be eight more teams in 1998, an increase from 24 to 32. The 
committee allocated two of them to Europe, which had wanted three; two to 
Africa, one to South America, one to Asia, one to CONCACAF and one to be split 
between Asia and Oceania. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, the extra place for CONCACAF should virtually assure that Mexico and 
the United States qualify for the next tournament, since they are the strongest 
teams in the North and Central American and Caribbean region. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joao Havelange, FIFA's Brazilian president, announced that he would not 
seek another term in office when his current one ends in 1998. By then, he will 
have led FIFA for 28 years. He suggested that an interim president be chosen 
from the Executive Committee to serve a two-year term from 1998-2000, thereby 
assuring that the election of future presidents will not coincide with World 
Cup tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Japan and South Korea remain the only candidates to stage the World Cup in 
2002, which FIFA said will take place in Asia, but the list of hopefuls for 
2006 grew to include Germany, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Major League Soccer is virtually certain to postpone its inaugural season 
until 1996, Blatter said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Los Angeles Salsa of the American Professional Soccer League was given 
provisional permission by FIFA to play for one season in the Mexican second 
division. However, CONCACAF is expected to veto the move. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In keeping with the lifting of United Nations' sanctions against 
Yugoslavia, FIFA lifted its ban on Yugoslav clubs and the national team for a 
100-day trial period. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Former Argentine star Diego Maradona, banned from "all soccer activity" for 
15 months after failing a drug test in World Cup '94, will be allowed to 
continue coaching Argentine first-division team Deportivo Mandiyu. Maradona 
does not have a coaching license, but Argentine federation President Julio 
Grondona said that will be remedied. 
</P>
<P>
 -- From now on, tied games in the later rounds of all FIFA tournaments will go 
to sudden death, including next year's Women's World Championship in Sweden, 
the under-20 World Youth Cup in Nigeria and the under-17 World Championship in 
Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will call it the 'golden goal,' not sudden death," Blatter said. Games 
that remain tied after 30 minutes of extra time will be decided by penalty 
kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- All leagues and all levels of soccer worldwide will have to award three 
points for a victory starting next season. Some countries, notably England and 
Italy, already are doing so. Tied games still will be worth one point to each 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Plans are under way to establish a soccer resource center in Neuchatal, 
Switzerland, where archival material, game films, and other reference material 
can be obtained. Havelange also said courses were to be offered in all aspects 
of soccer through the University of Neuchatal, with graduates able to earn a 
diploma in the sport.

PERKINS STANDS OUT IN THE BACK ROW; VOLLEYBALL: FORMER CORONA DEL MAR 
STANDOUT'S TOUGH DEFENSE HELPS LONG BEACH STATE MAINTAIN ITS CHAMPIONSHIP FORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just how much opponents know about the Long Beach State women's volleyball 
team is usually revealed on their opening serve. That's because if the ball 
goes to Prentice Perkins, well, somebody hasn't done enough homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Informed players know their chances are greatest against the 49ers the less 
Perkins gets involved. Perkins' play often swings things in the 49ers' favor, 
but some servers, to their coaches' frustration, still opt to learn the hard 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Coaches) just don't want the ball going over there," Long Beach Coach Brian 
Gimmillaro said. "The other teams won't serve Prentice for a very good reason: 
because she is so good." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior defensive specialist, Perkins' presence in the 49ers' back row is a 
key to success for the defending NCAA Division I champions. Intensity and 
confidence, with an admitted touch of cockiness, have powered Perkins to the 
top of her sport and, moreover, to accomplishments within an arena in which she 
formerly felt less at home: the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 She will display some of her skills tonight when No. 9 Long Beach plays No. 10 
UC Santa Barbara in a Big West Conference match at The Gold Mine. Play begins 
at 7:30, and Perkins couldn't be more ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been intimidated (on the volleyball court)," said Perkins, 22. "I 
know cocky sounds like a bad word, but there's nothing wrong with being a 
little bit cocky because it shows other people that they can't put you down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've excelled, so I don't think I have anything to be ashamed of. I know I'm 
a good athlete, and I know I'm a good volleyball player." 
</P>
<P>
 True enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins (5 feet 4) is a two-year starter. She is charged with helping to keep 
the ball in play for Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Her digging and passing sets up all those impressive spikes for the 49ers' 
hitters. She also has a high-arching serve that enabled her to lead the team in 
aces last season with 51, which ranked second in the conference at .46 aces per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 To the casual observer, however, Perkins' role might not seem all that 
exciting or important because she isn't making things happen at the net. 
Exciting? No. Important? Extremely, Gimmillaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people see a match, they don't understand that the person controlling 
the ball is the one that's winning the match," he said. "What they see is the 
explosiveness at the net and not the work to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the public's perception, her position is a thankless position. To the 
coaches, it's the premier position because she enables other players to be in 
the headlines with her digging and passing." 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins, too, is aware of public perception. However, she said her 
contributions are clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can dig and pass and that's my job," Perkins said. "But as a defensive 
specialist, it's not only that you're supposed to dig balls. You're also 
supposed to come in and pump teams up, and that's what I try to do." 
</P>
<P>
 And successful she is, her coach said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prentice is the type of player we've always wanted at Long Beach, the type of 
player who has always been greatly successful here," Gimmillaro said. "She's 
always been good, but she still wants to prove she's better than anybody 
thought she could be." 
</P>
<P>
 And not only on volleyball courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins has dyslexia. The learning disorder was difficult for her to cope with 
as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, there were a few kids who ragged on me about it, and some teachers 
even treated me like I was stupid," she said. "I wasn't stupid, I just learned 
differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins, then a setter, led Corona del Mar to the 1990 State Division I and 
Southern Section 5-A titles. The Times selected her all-county in volleyball 
her senior year. But she was only an average student and believed she could do 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 A history major, Perkins has proved herself right by maintaining a 3.0 
grade-point average at Long Beach. She is on track to graduate in four years. 
Her dedication to academics paid off last season when she received Long Beach's 
1993 female Big West Scholar Athlete award. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is one of the truly great success stories," said Charlie Brande, one of 
Perkins' former coaches at Corona del Mar and in the Orange County Volleyball 
club. "She was always a tremendous athlete in everything she did, but she 
wasn't the greatest student. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's such a great role model. I'm so proud of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Dedication to the books hasn't slowed Perkins on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins started contributing to the 49ers' good fortune as a freshman in 1991. 
Since she has been wearing black and gold, Long Beach is 113-10 (.918). 
Included in that record are three consecutive Big West titles, three 
consecutive trips to the Final Four and last season's national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perkins can't flaunt her volleyball national championship at home because 
she isn't even the first in the family to win one. That distinction goes to her 
brother, Jason, who played middle blocker on USC's 1990 national title team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really lucky because we both went to great schools with great programs 
and great tradition," Jason said. "It was never a question to me that Prentice 
would have this kind of success because she's very hard-driven. Nothing stops 
her when she decides she wants to do something."

DIFFICULT ROAD LEADS TO UCLA; COLLEGE SOCCER: FORMER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT JULIO 
UMANA PROVIDES SPARK OFF BENCH FOR BRUINS.

 Julio Umana picked his way hesitantly across the dark mountain, his older 
brother, Jose, at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys traveled alone but were helped on their journey by people stationed 
like silent sentries along the trail. They appeared out of the brush to protect 
the boys, to tell them when to hide from the flashlights of border patrol 
guards and when to run. 
</P>
<P>
 And as night gave way to dawn, the tired, cold and scared boys reached their 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States. 
</P>
<P>
 That was in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 It is late 1994 and Julio Umana is running still. On a recent Sunday, he was 
wearing a shiny white and blue UCLA soccer uniform, smiling as he jogged around 
UCLA's North Soccer Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-ranked Bruins (14-1) will play unranked Notre Dame (8-8-1) tonight 
at 8 on Spaulding Field in the UCLA tournament. Umana, who gets considerable 
playing time as a reserve, will be there to lend a foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Umana is pleased to be playing soccer for the Bruins. After leaving his 
hometown of Santa Ana in war-torn El Salvador, he lived in Southern California, 
illegally, until he was granted amnesty by the U.S. government under the 1986 
immigration reform act. That allowed more than 3 million formerly illegal 
immigrants to become documented and remain in the United States legally. 
</P>
<P>
 Umana attended North Hollywood High and was noticed quickly by UCLA Coach Sigi 
Schmid, who followed his progress through East L.A. College. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Umana's only season of eligibility at UCLA, but he has a great 
appreciation for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on the soccer field and looking up at the nearby buildings, he seems 
slightly in awe of his surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother used to talk about UCLA having a great basketball team," Umana 
said. "I never thought I would make it here, but I always wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
 Umana, a midfielder who began the season in the starting lineup, now provides 
a spark off the bench and accepts that role graciously. He has two goals and 
three assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably the first time in his life where he has not been a starter, 
and that sometimes is hard, but he never complains," Schmid said. "When I call 
his name on the bench, he jumps up and is ready to play. He has been a great 
example to the younger players in regard to his attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Schmid noticed Umana when he was playing for a club team as a sophomore at 
North Hollywood and wanted to recruit him. But Umana, who barely spoke English 
when he came to the United States and took English as a Second Language courses 
throughout high school, did not qualify academically for UCLA when he graduated 
from North Hollywood in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Umana worked odd jobs to help support his family for a while before he and his 
brother went back to school at East L.A. to continue their soccer careers. 
Julio scored 21 goals with 14 assists to lead East L.A. to the state 
championship in 1990. He was team captain in 1991. Jose is now playing semipro 
soccer.  
</P>
<P>
 Assistant coach Rick San Martin took an interest in Umana's career. San Martin 
also is the coach at Pasadena La Salle High and he asked Umana to become his 
assistant. San Martin encouraged Umana in his academics. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a great talent, both as a soccer player and as a leader of young men," 
San Martin said. "I just saw him losing confidence in his academics and I was 
just kind of there to say, 'Look, if you keep working at it, you're going to be 
able to be as good a student as you are a soccer player.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Umana studied at East L.A. for two more years before he was accepted at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Umana has advice for other Latinos who once thought continuing in school was 
too much to dream for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do not stop going to school because of not having the money," he said. "They 
should know that there's a lot of things they can do, like grants, financial 
aid." 
</P>
<P>
 Umana is one of few Latinos to have played soccer at UCLA. Schmid is pleased 
to have a representative of that community on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to show that there is a road that can lead to a place like UCLA, 
and not just to UCLA, it can also lead to Cal State Fullerton and to Stanford," 
Schmid said. "Even if you didn't take care of (academics) in high school, the 
junior college route . . . is a way to turn it around. It's not over." 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA tournament begins when unranked Fullerton (9-6-1) plays top-ranked 
Indiana (16-1) at 6, followed by UCLA against Notre Dame. On Sunday on the 
North Soccer Field, Fullerton will play Notre Dame at 11 a.m. followed by the 
tournament's feature game, UCLA against Indiana at 1.

HEADING INTO THE FINAL LAP; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: COY GIBBS WILL JOIN HIS FATHER'S 
AUTO RACING BUSINESS AFTER FINISHING SEASON AS STANFORD LINEBACKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The finish line is in view, bringing with it happiness and sadness, remorse 
and relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Four more weeks of football for Coy Gibbs, but only four more weeks before it 
all becomes a memory and friends are left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Four more weeks of late-night plane trips for Joe Gibbs, but only four more 
weeks of sitting in the stands, yelling for his son, a Stanford linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Four more weeks of football, including Saturday's game at the Rose Bowl 
against UCLA. Then four weeks of classes, and Pat Gibbs gets her brood together 
in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited about that," Joe Gibbs said. "When the boys got separated from 
me and went off to college, that's when my life changed and that's when I 
decided to change my life and get back to something where I could get everybody 
back together." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs was a workaholic coach who lived at the office during the season. It 
paid off in three Super Bowl victories in 10 seasons with the Washington 
Redskins, but the price was being separated from Pat and sons Coy and J.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross-country plane trips to watch Stanford and leaving the Redskins to create 
a family auto racing business were intended to make up for those 10 seasons. 
Everybody benefits, but Joe and Pat the most. Coy and J.D. get jobs, and the 
Gibbses get their family back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people would say I missed my dad, but he was out there making a living 
for us," Coy said. "That's a lot more important, putting food on the table, 
than spending an hour or so with you. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it hurts the dads more than the kids. There's guilt or something. I 
think he has it, but I also think you're going to feel that way if you spend 10 
hours a day with your kid. You're going to think, 'I didn't spend enough time.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 He tried to watch J.D. and Coy play as often as possible, but it often wasn't 
possible, particularly when they went to college. J.D. Gibbs was a defensive 
back at William and Mary, 3 1/2 hours from Washington and close enough for Joe 
to see some games. 
</P>
<P>
 Coy Gibbs visited only Stanford and Wake Forest, and at first only Stanford 
offered a scholarship among Division I-A schools. He still bridles at the 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't even gotten a visit from (Virginia), where I really wanted to go. . 
. . I was pretty bummed." 
</P>
<P>
 He had prepared at Redskin training camps, watching the linebackers and, said 
Joe, learned a few things he shouldn't have. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coy would watch the linebackers, would watch Larry Peccatello do drills, and 
I'd laugh and tell the players, 'You gave my kids those bad habits they have.' 
I'm talking about language and everything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Coy had done everything he could to position himself for college, transferring 
to DeMatha High in Hyattsville, Md., from Madison High near his home in Vienna, 
Va. Perhaps more famous for its basketball alumni, DeMatha is also a football 
power that sent 15 players to Division I schools in his senior year. But it 
involved a 45-minute commute, a drive he tried to shorten. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best was about 80 or 85 m.p.h.," he said. "I knew where all the cops were, 
so I could slow down so nobody could catch me from behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's genetic. Joe Gibbs was a lead-foot teen-ager around the drive-ins 
of Downey, Norwalk and Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe it was practice for Coy Gibbs' future. He wants to drive race cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford wasn't sure what it was getting except it knew Gibbs was an 
undersized linebacker with a big-sized family name. He is a bit under six feet, 
212 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Gibbs tried to prepare his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being the football coach and supposedly the intelligent guy I am, I told him, 
'You're going to spend a year redshirting, and you'll probably spend another 
year or two playing special teams because you're going to a big college.' Then 
he goes out and starts as a true freshman. That shows you how smart I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's inside linebackers were battered in the 1991 season-opener, against 
Washington, and Coy Gibbs started Game 2. He has been there since, throwing his 
body about recklessly, picking up personal-foul penalties and, this season, 
leading the Cardinal in tackles with 60. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has seen the defense go from one of the nation's best in 1992, to one 
of the worst. Stanford (2-4-1) is last in scoring defense in the Pacific 10 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the defensive players from 1992 are playing in the NFL. Now much of 
this year's defense is made up of freshmen.  
</P>
<P>
 In four more weeks, there will be room for one more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had my fill of football," Coy said. "I'm not that big and my body has 
gotten crunched over the years. I'm just going to be happy if I get out of 
football and can go skiing in 10 years and not feel the pain. I've got some 
knees that are pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
 He will start with Joe Gibbs Racing. The business is expanding with a drag 
racing operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Coy Gibbs will be working in the front office, learning the business, much as 
his brother has with the NASCAR operation. He won't race dragsters -- "You 
couldn't pay me enough to get in one of those things" -- but he will spend time 
at North Carolina Charlotte, because he won't be finished with his Stanford 
degree.

<P>
 Sun Bowl officials have struck a deal guaranteeing that as of next year the 
game will feature a matchup between the Pac-10's third-place team and the Big 
Ten's fifth-place team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the Big Ten does a lot for us. You can't think of a bad team in the 
Big Ten. Certainly the same goes for the Pac-10," Tom Starr, the Sun Bowl 
Assn.'s executive director, said in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement with both conferences goes into effect next year and runs 
through 1997. The Sun Bowl pays $1.1 million to each team.

DRAG RACING; DUNN'S STILL BLAZING WITH NEW TUNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Bradley was a driver before he turned to tuning the engines of top-fuel 
dragsters. He won the first and last races of his top-fuel career at Pomona -- 
the 1976 and 1991 Winternationals. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, when owner Darrell Gwynn found that trying to be a chief mechanic 
from a wheelchair was too taxing, Bradley joined the La Victoria team as head 
tuner for Mike Dunn's car. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley made some changes in the fuel system and Dunn, a Southern Californian 
now living in Mount Joy, Pa., responded with his first 300-m.p.h. run at 
Reading, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the fourth driver to run 300 or better under Bradley's direction, Pat 
Austin, Del Worsham and Rachelle Splatt having preceded him. No other crew 
chief has more than one 300-m.p.h. performer. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, in the first round of qualifying for the season-ending Winston 
Select Finals at the Pomona Fairplex, Dunn was the quickest and fastest driver, 
with a run of 4.841 seconds elapsed time at 301.40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "The track was pretty good, but air wasn't so good," Dunn said. "When I left 
the line, it felt soft. I was surprised at the time, but it will really help 
us. It pretty much guarantees we'll be in the show (Sunday's eliminations), and 
now we can use the next three qualifying runs to experiment on combinations for 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Sunday, we'll have our race-day hats on. It's been a disappointment we 
haven't won this year, but we do have one more chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Clark, a former major league slugger who became a top-fuel driver this 
year, recorded the fastest run of his career, 5.123 seconds, good for 14th 
position in the first-round standings. 
</P>
<P>
 In six events, Clark has never qualified for the eliminations. 
</P>
<P>
 He will probably have to improve his time to make it at Pomona, as three 
giants of the class -- Kenny Bernstein, Cory McClenathan and Eddie Hill -- 
smoked their tires and shut off early. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be back today when the pro classes continue qualifying at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In funny cars, veteran Tom Hoover's Dodge Daytona edged champion John Force's 
Chevrolet Lumina, 5.191 to 5.195 seconds, and in pro stocks, teammates Darrell 
Alderman and Scott Geoffrion recorded identical times of 7.122 in their Wayne 
County Dodges.

JULIANO IS THE KEY TO LANCERS' SUCCESS; HIGH SCHOOLS: QUARTERBACK HAS LED 
ORANGE LUTHERAN TO 6-1 RECORD AND NO. 2 RANKING IN DIVISION X. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 22 years in operation, Orange Lutheran High has yet to create the football 
mystique of, say, Mater Dei, Servite or Esperanza. Even among other small 
schools -- the 603-member student body qualifies -- the Lancers have rarely 
caused a ripple of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 1994 season has shaped up as a keeper for Orange Lutheran. At 6-1, 2-0 
in the Olympic League (including last week's 21-17 victory over previously 
undefeated Ontario Christian), the Lancers are ranked second in the Southern 
Section Division X. 
</P>
<P>
 With a victory over Calvary Chapel Saturday, Orange Lutheran should be 
confident about winning the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several reasons for the surge. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jim Kunau, in his second season as the Lancers' head coach (and third as 
a coach anywhere), brought with him an any-play-that-works philosophy that has 
his team averaging 35.3 points. Also handy is running back Che Holloway, a 
transfer from Tustin High who averages nine yards a carry and has scored 12 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as important has been quarterback Joe Juliano, whose combination of 
smarts and skills has made the Lancers' offense as exemplary as it is 
explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 Juliano, a senior, is a double-edged sword. He has rushed for 493 yards and 
six touchdowns; he has passed for 855 yards and seven touchdowns with only two 
interceptions. And he has done that despite being pulled in the third and 
fourth quarters of games in which the Lancers were far ahead. The statistics 
are more impressive when you consider that Juliano, at 6 feet 3, 190 pounds, is 
one of the bigger players on a team that lists only one at more than 200 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Juliano doesn't get sacked in the classroom either. According to Kunau, 
Juliano's 3.7 grade-point average has made him attractive to almost 40 schools, 
among them UCLA and Arizona. But Juliano said his interest has narrowed to 
five: Penn State, Dartmouth, Princeton, Penn and Army. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Juliano visited Penn State and watched the incoming freshmen 
practice. He also met Coach Joe Paterno, who spoke to Juliano's group for 
nearly 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like the program," Juliano said. "Paterno's a good coach. I know his 
coaches are good. It's not like other teams I see, fighting and running their 
mouths. They're just sound, they go in and they beat teams. That's what our 
program is like. We don't do a lot of talking; we just show what we can do on 
the field. That's the way I've always played." 
</P>
<P>
 At least he has during his four years at Orange Lutheran, the extent of his 
tackle football experience. Growing up in Anaheim Hills, father Al and 
stepmother Rae did not push Juliano into Pop Warner programs because, Juliano 
said, they disagreed with the way kids were being taught to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Juliano admits the fear of failure "that I even had as a younger kid" also 
was a barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a perfectionist; I don't like to fail so sometimes my parents have to 
jump on me," Juliano said. "But it drives me crazy when I fail. When I was 
younger, my step mom made me try things, and I learned to deal with it. But I 
still have that perfectionist mentality." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the closest thing to a character flaw Kunau can find. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just that he's an outstanding quarterback," said Kunau. "He's an 
outstanding kid -- a gentleman, a scholar, an athlete. He's not perfect, but a 
great kid. He is a coach on the field. He makes outstanding decisions. And he 
has to be a running quarterback as well as a throwing quarterback. We ask him 
to run a variety of option plays, and we ask him to make a lot of reads in the 
passing game. He's the triggerman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played at Bakersfield High, which is a pretty good (football program), 
usually in the top 10 in the state. Joe is better than any quarterback I saw 
around there. There are only a handful of teams in Orange County he wouldn't 
start for." 
</P>
<P>
 Juliano knows he'll have to be good Saturday. Calvary Chapel -- a preseason 
favorite to win the league -- is in the midst of a 3-4 season trampled by 
injuries. Quarterback Waylan Kruse's sprained left ankle slowed him the last 
two weeks and his brother, Dallas, is expected to start although Waylan will 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles would love nothing better than to get their first league victory 
against the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Calvary has great athletes," Juliano said. "Their skill players are very 
experienced. And they have some big guys, too. They're bigger than us." 
</P>
<P>
 But Juliano plans to figure out a way to win. Thinking is just one of his 
talents.

POINT GUARD DEAL TO PLAY AT NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Deal, a guard from College of the Sequoias, said Thursday he has 
accepted a basketball scholarship from Cal State Northridge and will sign a 
letter of intent during the NCAA early signing period, starting Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 For Northridge that means one Sequoia guard down, another to go.The Matadors 
also are close to securing the services of former local scoring champion Joe 
Wyatt, who averaged 30.6 points as a Kennedy high senior in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyatt, who is 6-foot-3, last season led Sequoias with a 16.3 points-per-game 
average. He said he is "really leaning toward" accepting a scholarship offer 
from Northridge. "Basically, I want to go back home," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Deal averaged 14.6 points, six rebounds and 4.3 assists while earning 
All-Central Valley Conference honors as a freshman during the 1992-93 season at 
Sequoias. 
</P>
<P>
 A muscular 6-foot, 220 pounds, Deal was considered among the top junior 
college guards in the state until he suffered torn ligaments in his left knee 
in a collision with an opponent near the end of his first season. He redshirted 
last season while rehabilitating. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me at all anymore," Deal said of the injury. "I'm all the 
way back. I just need to lose about 10 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Deal and Wyatt must earn their Associate of Arts degrees from Sequoias by the 
end of next spring in order to be eligible next year at Northridge.  
</P>
<P>
 A point guard, Deal figures to share playing time with Robert Hill and Trenton 
Cross when he joins the Matadors. Wyatt is an off-guard who also can play the 
point.

INELIGIBLE PLAYER MAY COST CAL LUTHERAN A VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Cal Lutheran might be forced to forfeit a football victory because it used an 
ineligible player, the school announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials discovered last Friday that starting defensive lineman Erik 
Lundring is ineligible because his course load includes only six academic 
units, two short of the minimum required for full-time status and athletic 
eligibility.Lundring, 22, graduated from Cal Lutheran last spring and is 
pursuing a master's degree in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Lundring did not play in Cal Lutheran's victory over Azusa Pacific on 
Saturday. Because the Kingsmen lost four of five games in which Lundring 
played, only the season-opening victory over Claremont-Mudd is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran reported the infraction to the NCAA this week. Coach Joe Harper 
was unsure when a ruling would be made. 
</P>
<P>
 If Cal Lutheran forfeits its 37-34 Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference victory over the Stags, its record would drop to 1-5, 0-4 
in the SCIAC. 
</P>

 "It's unfortunate," Lundring said, "but it's my own fault because I didn't 
look it up. . . . If I knew I was supposed to have eight (units), I would have 
had eight. I'm used to taking 17, but it's too late now." 
</P>
<P>
 Lundring, a 1990 Westlake High graduate, first attended Pacific Lutheran 
University but did not play football. He transferred and played four seasons at 
Cal Lutheran and was a starter in 1993 and 1994. Although he graduated last 
spring, Lundring began the master's program at Cal Lutheran so he could play 
his fourth year of football, he said.

MAJOR LEAGUE EFFORT GIVES SOUTHLAND BASEBALL FANS A QUICK FIX; BENEFIT: HIGH 
SCHOOL AND COLLEGE PLAYERS JOIN BIG LEAGUERS FOR TWO EXHIBITIONS THIS WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Seventeen-year old Tim Baron of Thousand Oaks stood on a pitcher's mound on a 
sun-drenched diamond and threw batting practice to . . . major leaguers? 
</P>
<P>
 That's right. Baron, a senior at Thousand Oaks High, was one of a handful of 
high school players practicing with the big boys Thursday at Blair Field for an 
upcoming charity event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty sweet," Baron said. 
</P>
<P>
 They were preparing for a pair of exhibition games this weekend, with an 
interesting twist. The prep players -- including a handful of area standouts -- 
will team with an assortment of big leaguers against local college players to 
raise money for a Los Angeles charity, Children of Promise. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization sponsors a mentor program for fatherless boys. The event was 
originated by George Voita and Hal Sacks, who work out of a Calabasas office 
and came up with the idea for the games only two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They made hurried preparations and pulled together such major- league players 
as Dave Hansen of the Dodgers, Mike Fitzgerald of the Angels, Torey Lovullo of 
the Seattle Mariners and Brian Hunter of the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 They also invited a select group of high school players such as Baron, Darrell 
Dent of Montclair Prep, Brandon Hernandez of Saugus and Marc Lacson and John 
Wilson of L.A. Baptist. The players are not representing their high school 
teams in the contests and their eligibility is not affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Baron was the only local high school player on hand Thursday, a day when a 
World Series game might have been played if not for the strike. The atmosphere 
was free and easy as the pros mixed with younger players. Wearing different 
uniforms, they chatted in the outfield and shagged fly balls. 
</P>
<P>
 The games Saturday and Sunday promise more of the same friendly atmosphere and 
a chance for baseball-starved fans to see big-league players on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Also playing Sunday will be Ila Borders, the female pitcher from Southern 
California College who made national headlines by playing for the NAIA school. 
</P>
<P>
 Game times are 1:15 p.m. and will feature a different lineup each day. Batting 
practice begins at noon and will be followed by an autograph session and home 
run derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime area scout George Genovese will coach one team. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $5.50. Information: 818-782-6101.

HERNANDEZ STATES HIS CASE, TAKES ON BEST IN COUNTY; CROSS-COUNTRY: HE TRIES TO 
BECOME FIRST CAMARILLO RUNNER TO WIN VENTURA TITLE SINCE 1982. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Eleazar Hernandez of Camarillo High stamped himself as the premier 
cross-country runner in the state by winning the team sweepstakes race of the 
Mt. San Antonio College Invitational on Saturday, yet he has had little time to 
rest on those laurels. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Hernandez outran Thousand Oaks' Keith O'Doherty, Jeff Fischer and 
Kevin Marsden in a Marmonte League meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Today he must prove himself again in the Ventura County championships at Lake 
Casitas. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who finished second to Thousand Oaks senior Brandon Del Campo in 
last year's meet, is favored to become the first Scorpion since Eric Reynolds 
in 1982 to win an individual county title. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Doherty finished third at Mt. SAC and has been consistent for Thousand Oaks 
all season. Fischer and Marsden missed the Lancers' first two meets because of 
injuries, but are close to regaining the form that propelled them to top-five 
finishes in last year's State Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
 John Greene of Agoura is the defending Southern Section Division II champion, 
Javier Ramirez of Nordhoff lowered the three-mile course record to 15:08 in 
last month's Ojai Invitational, and Francisco Sandoval of Channel Islands could 
also be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, defending State Division I champion and ranked fifth in The 
Harrier magazine's national poll, is favored to win its third consecutive boys' 
team title. Camarillo, Agoura and defending State Division III champion 
Nordhoff should battle for second. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' race, Amy Skieresz of Agoura is tabbed to win her third 
consecutive title, but Thousand Oaks is favored to win its first team title 
since 1986 and snap Agoura's victory string at seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancer junior Kim Mortensen won the team sweepstakes race at Mt. SAC with a 
time 32 seconds faster than Skieresz's third-place effort in the individual 
sweepstakes, but Skieresz defeated Mortensen by 49 seconds in their only 
head-to-head meeting this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The meet will start at 1:30 p.m. with the freshman boys' race. The girls' and 
boys' varsity events are scheduled for 3 and 3:30.

MONTCLAIR PREP REMAINS AN OUTSIDER BECAUSE PROGRAM IS . . . ; PRECEDED BY ITS 
REPUTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Montclair Prep is no ordinary high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The college preparatory school with an enrollment of about 350 looks more like 
the apartment buildings and cheap motels that surround it on Sepulveda 
Boulevard than an academic institution. 
</P>
<P>
 But what Montclair Prep might lack in size and cosmetics it makes up for with 
its athletic reputation -- good or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has produced nearly two dozen Division I football players in the 
last decade, including San Francisco 49er Toi Cook. The school's last three 
running backs -- Derek Sparks (Washington State), Eliel Swinton (Stanford) and 
Wilbert Smith (Illinois) -- earned college scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 In baseball, Brad Fullmer, a 1993 graduate, received a $417,500 signing bonus 
and is considered a top prospect with the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 Football coaches and athletic directors from Ojai to San Diego are keenly 
aware of the little school that packs a powerful punch in the sporting world. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep has one of the most-controversial legacies in the Southern 
Section, one which few can forget -- or forgive. Although it has been four 
years since Montclair Prep was banned from the playoffs amid charges of 
recruiting violations, grade tampering and nonpayment of tuition by athletes, 
the stigma remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep is in its third year as a free-lance school since Alpha League 
members voted to oust the Mounties. And it might be another three years before 
the exile ends. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . You need a unanimous vote (to get into a league)," said Greg Reece, 
athletic director at Montclair Prep. "I think it's very doubtful. (But) I think 
(Southern Section Commissioner) Dean Crowley is doing everything he can." 
</P>
<P>
 Life without a league has created a scheduling nightmare for Montclair Prep, 
which won section titles in football in 1990 and '92. No football teams in the 
San Fernando Valley area, it seems, want to play the Mounties, who have 
traveled as far north as Lake Isabella and as far south as La Jolla for games 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilpatrick is Montclair Prep's only scheduled area opponent this season. And 
even that, perhaps, is a stretch -- Kilpatrick is an L.A. County-funded school 
for juvenile offenders in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 After two football teams canceled on Montclair Prep earlier this season, the 
Mounties were forced to pick up games with Sherman Indian and California School 
for the Deaf -- both of Riverside -- just to complete an eight-game schedule, 
which is mandatory to qualify for playoffs. When they play at Sherman Indian 
tonight, it will be the Mounties' first game since Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Has Montclair Prep suffered enough for its improprieties? Or should the 
Mounties be forever punished for something that had nothing to do with the 
current players on the team? 
</P>
<P>
 And although football is the reason for Montclair Prep's problems, it is not 
the only sport that suffers. 
</P>
<P>
 The basketball team finished 15-6 last season but earned no playoff bid. Why? 
Because the Mounties were not affiliated with a league and no playoff bids were 
allotted for free-lance teams in Division IV-A, regardless of record. Of the 20 
teams in the Division IV-A playoff bracket, five had losing records and three 
finished the regular season at .500. 
</P>
<P>
 Seem unfair? If anybody other than Montclair Prep students and coaches cares 
about the school's fate, the list is short. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep was overlooked last year when a releaguing committee finalized 
the section's 73 leagues. Teams are currently in the first year of a four-year 
releaguing cycle. For the Mounties to get into a league, they must be voted in 
by league affiliates. And that probably will not happen soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked to several leagues and there's some interest out there, but not 
much," said Crowley, the Southern Section commissioner. "I've promised to try 
to put them in a league. (But) I can't mandate it." 
</P>
<P>
 League representatives cite several reasons for rejecting Montclair Prep. The 
school cheated once, it will cheat again, some say. Others charge the Mounties 
with poor sportsmanship on the field -- accusing them of taunting and starting 
fights. 
</P>
<P>
 Even leagues with an odd number of teams -- a situation that creates 
scheduling headaches -- reject them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess our feeling is that when coaches allow their players to get out of 
control, it sends a message -- and it's not a good one. It's not what we want 
our kids to follow," said Nordhoff Principal Susana Arce, representative for 
the Frontier League, which has only five schools competing in football and 
includes teams with enrollments similar to Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst moment in Montclair Prep history centers on Derek Sparks, the former 
Mountie running back now at Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep was placed on three years' probation and banned from the 
playoffs in all sports for the 1991-92 school year after charges of recruiting 
violations and grade tampering emerged at an eligibility hearing for Derek and 
his cousin Leland Sparks following their transfer to Mater Dei. The Sparkses 
also said they never paid tuition at Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the section suspended John Hazelton, then an assistant at 
Montclair Prep, for one year for recruiting violations. Derek Sparks had 
transferred to Montclair Prep from Banning. The section later lifted Hazelton's 
suspension, saying it had no jurisdiction over individuals, only athletic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the scandal, Montclair Prep has worked to improve its image. Although 
progress has been slow -- five players were suspended this season following a 
hazing incident -- the Mounties say they are headed in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Southern Section) sent us a letter complimenting us just today, saying 
that we've really gotten our act together and complied with all the rules of 
the probation," Vernon Simpson, principal and founder of Montclair Prep, said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Crowley: "As far as being in good graces, Montclair Prep has done 
everything that they were asked to do in terms of their probation. They have 
been very, very cooperative. They want to play the game by the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said he thinks the progress will be much more swift now that Hazelton, 
Burbank's head coach, has left Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got rid of one coach that was kind of a loose cannon," Simpson said. "He 
was the reason for a lot of the problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazelton, however, disputes Simpson's accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind being the scapegoat for Montclair Prep if it helps Montclair 
Prep get back into a league, because I love the school, I love Doc Simpson," 
Hazelton said. "(But) I can assure you that every single thing I did at 
Montclair Prep was with the knowledge of Dr. Simpson and (Coach) George 
Giannini." 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter who is to blame, there still remains the fallout from the 
controversy. And it may take years for Montclair Prep to clean the slate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think that time would take care of that," said Jim Bashore, the 
Tri-Valley League representative and athletic director at Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Crowley: "Time heals wounds and that's important. They made a mistake and 
they've paid for that mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the Mounties are still paying.

ROYAL ASSISTANT QUINA SUES SIMI VALLEY DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stan Quina, a volunteer assistant football coach at Royal High, has filed suit 
against the Simi Valley Unified School District and Simi Valley High principal 
Kathryn Scroggin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, Quina claims he was promised a $1,600-a-year position on the 
Royal coaching staff and that he was damaged by slanderous comments Scroggin 
and district representatives made accusing him of misappropriating school funds 
while he was a coach at Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Quina alleges he was promised a position in December 1993, but the district 
"breached the oral agreement by refusing to hire (Quina) and by making 
unsubstantiated accusations against (Quina)," the suit reads. 
</P>
<P>
 Quina refused comment on the case Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin and Supt. Mary Beth Wolford referred inquiries to Leon Mattingley, 
assistant superintendent in charge of personnel for the district. Mattingley 
said Thursday that he has not received a copy of the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Quina's attorney, Louise Cowen, said she will notify the defendants of the 
suit within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, Quina requests $1,600 plus an unspecified amount for punitive 
damages. The case is to be heard by a jury within one year, according to the 
complaint.

DANA PARSONS: SANTA ANA POLICE DRUG TACTICS ARE NO TOUGH SELL TO HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She remembers her family telling the story of how her grandparents dropped 
coins into a toll box and crossed into the United States in 1900, when her 
mother was 9 years old, and settled in New Mexico, where there was work in the 
copper mines. Her parents headed West and in 1924, she became the first of the 
10 children in her family to be born in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody's got a life story and that's how Isabel's started. Now an amazingly 
young-looking 70 years old, she and her husband have lived for the past 26 
years in a comfortable neighborhood in the southeast corner of Santa Ana, a 
life made possible by his career as a cabinetmaker. Isabel stayed home all 
through the years and raised two children and now is a grandmother of three 
teen-agers. She acknowledges that she and her husband's lives are pretty much 
the American dream, if the dream is defined as not starting out with much 45 
years ago and ending up living fairly comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
 Their home is geographically removed from the city's roughest neighborhoods, 
but they once lived on the west side of town until a murder on their block 
convinced them it was time to move. But even now, in the relative safety of 
their east-side neighborhood, Isabel says she doesn't feel freed from the 
threat of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the subject of crime that I wanted to talk to her about; more 
specifically, her city's decision to have undercover police sell drugs made in 
the county's own laboratory. At first blush, it seems like both a bizarre and 
sad juncture for a society: that the police are making drugs to sell to people 
so that they can, in turn, arrest them. 
</P>
<P>
 The police rationale was rather straightforward. Simply put, they say there 
are some bad guys out there on the streets, and they want to send them to 
prison. And more to the point, they've decided not to sit around and wait for 
them to make a mistake. The cops want to help them. 
</P>
<P>
 But beneath that layer of what sounds like borderline entrapment is, perhaps, 
more the heart of the issue. And that issue is to make people like Isabel feel 
safe and give her some sense that the drug culture and its potentially violent 
spinoffs aren't running the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The question I put to Isabel this week was whether she approves of the police 
being in the drug-sales business. In the absence of a scientific poll, I was 
content to let her be my Silent Majority, based on her life story. What I was 
really interested in is how a citizen grapples with an issue like this -- or if 
they do grapple -- before deciding whether they like it or not. When we began 
talking, I had no idea what side of the issue she would be on. 
</P>
<P>
 For Isabel, the issue isn't all that complicated. "Like the saying goes, it 
takes a thief to catch a thief," she said. "It doesn't sound right for them to 
be making drugs, but if that's the only way, or if that's one way to do it . . 
. it's like those stings to catch other people, so I don't see too much 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked what she thought when she first heard the police were using 
county-manufactured drugs. "We laughed because we thought it was funny. But 
when I stopped to think about it, that's when I thought, that's a way to catch 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has no real misgivings about the policy. "I don't think they're 
going too far. I think they're trying a lot of ways to try and stop it, or at 
least cut it down." 
</P>
<P>
 She supports the police on most matters, she said, and is willing to give them 
the benefit of a doubt. "I put them up there with service fellows, they put 
their life on the line," she said. "I guess I trust police and expect them to 
be good. I grew up with the feeling of respect for them, kind of like with a 
priest. You trust them, and you depend on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Isabel has attended neighborhood meetings that focused on 
crime-related issues. I asked if she and her friends have given up on anyone 
controlling crime. "I haven't given up. I think they can put a dent in it. We 
all talk about it, but we don't do much about it. We're afraid, really." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're afraid." That's the message that gets back to the police, and it's the 
message that drives policies like cooking your own drugs to sell on the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 To some of us on the outside looking in, it sounds like an idea born of 
desperation and fraught with all kinds of risks. 
</P>
<P>
 To Santa Ana residents like Isabel, desperate times require desperate actions. 
And nothing strikes of more desperation than the feeling that you can't walk to 
the corner grocery at night or stroll through a city park. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana citizens want to be able to do that again. And in this lifetime. 
They're tired of a world turned upside down, and that's why Isabel and others 
like her who spent their lives playing by the rules are willing to put up with 
a topsy-turvy scenario where cops sell drugs.

RIVALS NEAR RECORD SPENDING IN RACE IN 2ND SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo and attorney Trudi Loh have spent 
nearly $200,000 on their campaigns for a county supervisor seat in what will be 
one of the most expensive local races in county history, according to finance 
statements filed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Simi Valley Councilwoman Judy Mikels and Moorpark Councilman Scott 
Montgomery are running nearly even in campaign spending, with combined 
expenditures of about $85,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh, who is locked in a tight race with Schillo, led all four candidates in 
spending, with $97,300, and Schillo $92,500. The cutoff date for filing finance 
statements with the county was Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh and Schillo said they will each spend well over $100,000 before the Nov. 8 
election to make their cases to voters in the 2nd Supervisorial District, which 
includes most of the Conejo Valley and Port Hueneme. Each has already dumped 
about $30,000 of his or her own money into the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I had to spend a certain amount of money because Mr. Schillo has a lot 
of name recognition, even though it's not all positive," Loh said. "It's a 
tightly contested race and there are a lot of differences between us." 
</P>
<P>
 Loh, a Thousand Oaks attorney who opposes a proposed landfill at Weldon Canyon 
near Ojai, received $8,710 in October from businesses and residents of Ojai who 
have lobbied against the dump. This brings to $11,210 the total donations she 
has received from the Ojai area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind taking support from people I agree with," she said, noting that 
she opposed the landfill long before she received any contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schillo criticized Loh for accepting the donations. He argued that if the 
county does not build a new west county landfill and instead ships its trash 
elsewhere, as Loh has proposed, then garbage rates for residents of the 2nd 
District will double. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a criminal act to take money to defend people from Ojai, and let 
people down in our community," Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh said she is against a proposed dump at Weldon Canyon out of concern that a 
private landfill operator would try to import trash from places such as Los 
Angeles, a move that could result in caravans of trash trucks rolling through 
the east county. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh also pointed out that Schillo's campaign consultant, Mark Thompson, was 
employed by Taconic Resources, a group of San Diego investors that wants to 
develop the Weldon Canyon dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to talk about outrageous," Loh said, "I think that's outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo's latest finance report shows that he received $2,250 from Thousand 
Oaks and Westlake auto dealers. He also received $250 from former supervisor 
candidate Carter Ward, and $500 from developers Henry and Lee Mansdorf of 
Beverly Hills, who have proposed building a new marina in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said, however, that he does not support the development of a marina. 
</P>
<P>
 In the county's 4th Supervisorial District, Mikels has spent $44,329 on her 
campaign, and Montgomery, $40,869. The two are competing for the seat being 
vacated by Vicky Howard, who represents Simi Valley, Moorpark and the Santa 
Rosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels said the recession and the county's campaign contribution laws, which 
restrict the amount individuals and political action committees can donate to 
political campaigns, have made it especially difficult to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, officials in the county district attorney's office said that 
Montgomery had collected $8,350 in contributions above the county's allowable 
limit on political donations. The case is being referred to the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Coleman, special assistant district attorney, said that Montgomery also 
apparently failed to inform state election officials of his intent to form a 
new campaign committee and to register a new committee number. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said he believes he has complied with the law in each instance. He 
said, however, that he would return campaign contributions if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for county auditor-controller, appointed incumbent Thomas O. Mahon 
has spent $46,758 on his campaign, including $13,200 of his own money.

PROSECUTORS AND DEFENDERS TO FORM UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County deputy prosecutors and public defenders announced Thursday that 
they will form a union, a step they say is necessary to bring their pay into 
line with other government attorneys across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to unionize approximately 110 lawyers comes less than two weeks 
after county officials announced that 30 attorneys were mistakenly given pay 
raises in July and must return the money. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kevin G. DeNoce, vice president of the Deputy District Attorneys Assn., 
said the pay raise is a relatively minor dispute with the county. The real 
issue, DeNoce said, is that prosecutors' pay and benefits have steadily 
decreased since they left the largest county employees' union six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors, once the fourth highest-paid deputy district 
attorneys in California, now are paid 15% to 20% less than prosecutors in 
comparable counties, DeNoce said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message from the county is clear: If you're not organized, your salary 
and benefits will erode," DeNoce said. "So the only recourse is for us to 
organize." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Daily, president of the Deputy Public Defenders Assn., said the 
attorneys need to organize for their own protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very vulnerable right now," Daily said. "Theoretically, (county 
officials) can change our contract tomorrow without any notice to us. That has 
really been borne out with this recent brouhaha." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 County Personnel Director Ronald W. Komers could not be reached for comment 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70 deputy district attorneys who belong to the prosecutors' association 
voted Wednesday to organize. DeNoce would not release the vote count, saying 
only that a majority wants to form a union. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily said "an overwhelming majority" of the 40 deputy public defenders chose 
to organize in a straw vote Wednesday. The vote will be formalized today, Daily 
said, paving the way for the formation of the Criminal Justice Attorneys Assn. 
to represent prosecutors and deputy public defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 DeNoce said a notice of the attorneys' intentions will be filed with the 
county by Tuesday. That will be followed in a couple of months by another vote 
for attorneys to decide whether they want to represent themselves or join an 
existing union. 
</P>
<P>
 Once that is decided, negotiations will begin for a new contract for the 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, all we're talking about is parity" with other counties, DeNoce said. 
"We're not asking to be treated like we're special." 
</P>
<P>
 The pay for deputy public defenders and deputy district attorneys is $32,000 
to $69,000, depending on years of experience. DeNoce said that is 15% to 20% 
below what attorneys in similar California counties earn, a claim he expects to 
be verified when an outside consultant completes a comparison study next month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, although not affected by his deputies' 
decision to organize, said he does not blame them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they have been treated shabbily by the (chief administrative) office 
and the personnel department regarding salaries," Bradbury said. "They have 
tried to resolve this informally without success, and if this is what it takes, 
they have my full support." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury and Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman said they do not expect their 
offices to be adversely affected by the deputies' action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their work is of the highest quality, and I know it will continue to be 
whether they are in a union or not," Clayman said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeNoce said that because attorneys willing to work for the government make 
more money elsewhere, it is difficult for Ventura County to attract and keep 
quality people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in the public interest and welfare to have competent prosecutors," he 
said. "If this county is serious about public safety, then it should be willing 
to pay to attract competent law enforcement officers, including prosecutors."

LOCAL ELECTIONS; 2 ACCUSED OF VOTER REGISTRATION FRAUD; CRIME: THE WORKERS 
HIRED BY A BROOKS FIRESTONE CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT ARE SUSPECTED OF COLLECTING THE 
NAMES OF PEOPLE OFF TOMBSTONES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Accused of submitting dead people's names as newly registered Republican 
voters, two workers hired by a Brooks Firestone Assembly campaign consultant 
were arrested Thursday and charged with election fraud, Ventura County's top 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two workers, paid by a Firestone consultant for each completed 
registration card, apparently collected names off tombstones and turned them in 
as legitimate, prosecutors and Firestone's campaign manager said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Firestone's campaign workers submitted the forms to county election 
officials, Firestone said neither he nor his campaign staff knew the 
registration cards were fakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no intention of engaging in fraudulent registration whatsoever," 
Firestone said. "It wouldn't do us any good, because dead people don't vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Robinson-Adams of Ventura and Lisa Marie Krueger of Oxnard turned in 20 
of the fraudulent cards, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 John Cuneo, a former Ventura Star Free-Press reporter, said he was in charge 
of hiring Robinson-Adams and Krueger along with about 50 others. Cuneo works 
for Michael Long, a Santa Barbara political consultant who is running the 
registration drive to sign up new Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Long said his administrative costs were shared by Firestone, Republican state 
Senate candidate Steve MacElvaine of San Luis Obispo, Republican congressional 
candidate Andrea Seastrand of San Luis Obispo and the Santa Barbara County 
Lincoln Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuneo said he instructed the employees to canvass Ventura County movie 
theaters, supermarkets and shopping malls to register Republican voters. He 
said he also warned all the workers against submitting registration cards with 
fictitious names. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson-Adams and Krueger worked for about two weeks and turned in between 
100 and 150 cards each, he said. The two were paid about $3 per card. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuneo said he reviewed all of the forms before handing them over to 
Firestone's campaign office, but said he had no way of telling the cards were 
fakes.  
</P>
<P>
 Firestone's campaign manager then submitted the registration cards to county 
officials and gave receipts to the California Republican Party so that 
employees could be paid. The state party offers the "bounty" for each newly 
registered Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Long said his firm has registered 5,200 new Republicans as part of this year's 
registration drive for GOP candidates.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that is commonly done as part of a campaign effort," Long 
said. "The more Republican voters you have out there, the more votes you're 
going to get." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said that paying to register voters is an invitation to 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're just asking for trouble," said Bruce Bradley, the county's elections 
chief. "It has always been my contention that any time you pay to register 
people you're going to have fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone said he did not want to use paid registration workers, but did so as 
a defensive move to match the registration efforts of the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Party officials said they favor the use of volunteers to register 
voters to avoid the potential for impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety-nine percent of our registration drives are done purely by 
volunteers," said Hank Starr, chairman of the Ventura County Democratic Central 
Committee. "The Republicans have money and we have people." 
</P>
<P>
 But Republican Party officials said that in recent years both parties have 
relied more heavily on paid employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like it was 25 years ago when I first got involved," said Peggy 
Sadler, secretary of the Republican Central Committee. "It's much more 
difficult to get the volunteers that you need to do a registration drive." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has it become difficult to find volunteers, Cuneo said, the paid 
workers have had a difficult time signing up new voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a hell of a lot of voter apathy out there," Cuneo said. "It was 
tough to get people to sign up." 
</P>
<P>
 Conviction on a charge of fraudulent registration of voters carries a maximum 
penalty of three years in prison.

SCHOOLS LOSE BID TO SELL ORCHARD SITE; OXNARD: COUNTY PLANNERS REJECT 
DISTRICT'S REQUEST IN HOPES OF PREVENTING DEVELOPMENT ON FARMLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to ward off development on a potentially vulnerable chunk of farmland, 
the Ventura County Planning Commission on Thursday rejected the Oxnard high 
school district's request to sell a 27-acre lemon orchard. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission voted 4 to 1 against the district's proposal to sell a citrus 
grove directly behind the new Oxnard High School site on Gonzales Road near 
Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Commissioner Johnie Carlisle Jr., who is from Oxnard, supported the 
district's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Union High School District officials said they will appeal immediately 
to the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have to act fast. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials bought the orchard as part of an 80-acre lot where they are 
building a school to replace the existing Oxnard High campus on 5th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district needed only 53 acres for the school, it got an agreement 
that the landowner would buy back the remaining 27 acres for its original 
$2.1-million selling price. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the agreement has two conditions: The district must get county approval 
for declaring the orchard as a separate lot, and it must sell the property back 
to developer Maland Enterprises by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 If school officials are unable to resell the grove, Supt. Bill Studt said, 
they will have to use school funds to repay loans used for buying the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only source of repayment for that $2.1 million would be from the general 
funds of the school district," Studt said. "And those general funds are what is 
used to support children's education." 
</P>
<P>
 County planning rules, however, forbid lots smaller than 40 acres in 
agricultural areas. Smaller lots tend not to be commercially viable for 
farming, said county planners, putting pressure on landowners to develop the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Laura Bartels criticized the district's agreement with developer 
Maland Enterprises as "a real sweetheart deal for the farmer." 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of longtime Oxnard residents, including a former Oxnard mayor and 
high school district trustee, blamed school officials for getting the district 
into a bind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 School officials were well aware of county planning rules when they bought the 
land, former Mayor Jane Tolmach said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To agree to provide the landowners with something not in their powers is 
gambling with our money," Tolmach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard resident Bradley Smith said, "They have made a bed of roses and thorns 
for themselves and I unfortunately feel they should lie in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents and planning commissioners urged the district to use the citrus 
grove to launch an agricultural-education program. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they think they have a lemon, try hard to make a lemonade," said Letha 
Marshall of the community group Oxnard Beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials said they have an agricultural program at Camarillo 
High, which is open to the district's students. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said they bought the 80-acre property because they could not 
find a 50-acre lot near the existing Oxnard High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Studt said, the district was under pressure to complete a land deal 
quickly so it could qualify for $28 million in state funding to build the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The district skirted county rules banning development on farmland through 
state laws that enable school districts to condemn land needed for new schools. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials agreed with the property's owners, Maland Enterprises and 
Somis developer Ag Land Services, to buy the property for $79,000 per acre, or 
a total of $6.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the district would recoup $2.1 million by reselling the 
orchard to Maland. And it could be refunded the remaining $4.2 million for the 
53-acre school site if surrounding farmland becomes the site of new houses. The 
developers agreed to pay the district on a pro rata basis according to the 
number of new houses built. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, school officials say, the county may be punishing them for building in an 
agricultural area. 
</P>
<P>
 But George Lauterbach, a consultant for the school district, urged the 
planning commission to forget the past and look to the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is "a fait accompli ," he said. "The question comes down to: In 
1995, who will own this 26 acres? Will it be the farmer who sold it the school 
district or will it be the school district?"

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OAK PARK; STUDENTS PLANT TREES TO REPLACE THOSE IN 
PATH OF DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jacqueline Zajdman was stooped over, her forehead crinkled in concentration, 
her fingers moving deftly as she busied herself at her task. 
</P>
<P>
 She was one of 55 sixth-graders from Medea Creek Middle School in Oak Park who 
planted oak trees Thursday at Ahmanson Ranch, part of a program to replace 
trees that would be cut down if a 3,000-home development is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing this for the community," Jacqueline said. "We want to keep it 
beautiful here." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to plant trees to give animals shelter, and also, to give us more 
moisture and rain out here," said Adam Bushmore, another student. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, who are studying plants, benefit from the hands-on experience, 
said teacher Nancy Kollander. "We've been studying plants all quarter, and this 
is an excellent tie-in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids gathered acorns at one end of the property and brought them back to a 
nursery behind the office of Ahmanson Ranch in the southeast corner of Ventura 
County. There, they planted the acorns in small containers where they will be 
kept until they mature. 
</P>
<P>
 In about a year, the young oaks will be transplanted into larger containers, 
where they will be kept for two more years, said Gil Nielsen, senior vice 
president of Ahmanson Land Co., the housing project's developer. The saplings 
from those containers will then be planted on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Boy Scouts planted about 2,000 acorns, according to Ahmanson Land 
officials. Those trees, which are still in containers, are now about five feet 
tall and ready to be transplanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land officials eventually want to plant a total of 4,000 trees, as 
part of a development agreement in which they must plant five trees for every 
tree they destroy to build the development, said Donald Brackenbush, president 
of Ahmanson Land. 
</P>
<P>
 The company wants to build 3,050 homes, two golf courses and 400,000 square 
feet of commercial space in a hilly area southeast of Simi Valley. Many area 
residents oppose the project and have filed lawsuits to block the development. 
</P>
<P>
 In an environmental review of the project, planners estimated that 1,300 oak 
trees would have to be cut down, Brackenbush said. The company has altered its 
project plans and reduced the number to 700, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planting trees to replace those destroyed by the project is a good idea, said 
Jacqueline, who added, "But they are going to cut down these hills, and it's 
not going to be beautiful here anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 But classmate Ryan Poyer said he is not sure if the planting was worth the 
effort. "It will take 100 years" for the acorns to get as big as the large, 
established oaks in the area, he said. FRANK MANNING

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BOARD CANDIDATES HOLD FINAL DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the final debate scheduled among the four candidates vying for two open 
seats on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, and some were expecting 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 What they got was more like a dud, said one official with the League of Women 
Voters of Ventura County, which sponsored Wednesday night's debate at the 
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Shedding no new light on the issues, the candidates simply restated their 
views on everything from a proposed landfill near Ojai to the county's 
guidelines for development in unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates Judy Mikels and Scott Montgomery agreed on the need to reduce crime 
and attract more jobs to the county. The two are competing for a seat 
representing Simi Valley, Moorpark and the Santa Rosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other race, candidate Trudi Loh, who is running on an environmental 
platform, restated her opposition to a proposal to develop a landfill at Weldon 
Canyon near Ojai. Loh said she favors other alternatives for disposing of 
county trash, including possibly shipping it elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Her opponent, Frank Schillo, agreed with Mikels and Montgomery on the need for 
a new west county landfill. They said they are concerned that the Simi Valley 
Landfill would become the county's sole dump if a new west county landfill is 
not developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo and Loh are running for a supervisorial post that covers most of the 
Conejo Valley and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 All the candidates said they would uphold the county's guidelines for orderly 
development, which call for development in unincorporated areas to be clustered 
near cities. CARLOS V. LOZANO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: WESTLAKE; MURDER TRIAL JURY SELECTION COMPLETED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jury selection concluded Thursday in the capital murder trial of Mark Scott 
Thornton, accused of kidnaping and killing a Westlake nurse who disappeared 
while running errands in the middle of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 If the six men and six women on the jury convict Thornton of the murder of 
Kelly O'Sullivan, they will then consider whether the death penalty is 
warranted.Four alternate jurors also have been selected to sit through the 
trial, which is expected to last four to six weeks, Deputy Public Defender 
Susan Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first witnesses in the high-profile trial will be called Tuesday, 
attorneys said. On Monday, the lawyers will argue over the admissibility of 
certain statements Thornton made to police, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys' opening statements Tuesday will be the public's first exposure 
to the evidence in the Ventura County case. Superior Court Judge Charles R. 
McGrath has kept under seal the transcript of the grand jury hearing that 
resulted in Thornton's indictment on the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton, 20, of Thousand Oaks, is accused of murdering O'Sullivan in 
September, 1993, during a carjacking. She disappeared one afternoon and her 
body was found almost two weeks later in some brush in the Santa Monica 
Mountains in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy disclosed she had been shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Before O'Sullivan's body was found, Thornton had been arrested in Reno, Nev., 
on suspicion of kidnaping his former girlfriend on the day O'Sullivan 
disappeared. He had the keys to O'Sullivan's Ford Explorer in his pocket, and 
the truck was found nearby. BARBARA MURPHY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: BAR ASSOCIATION RATES CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The East Ventura County Bar Assn. has rated all four candidates for the County 
Board of Supervisors -- ranking Simi Valley City Councilwoman Judy Mikels best 
in the field and Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo worst. 
</P>
<P>
 The association gave Mikels an "A" rating, Moorpark City Councilman Scott 
Montgomery and attorney Trudi Loh received "Bs," Bs, and Schillo got a "C." 
</P>
<P>
 The ranking was based partly on candidates' responses to questions about legal 
and government services in the east county. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels and Montgomery are running in the 4th Supervisorial District, 
representing Simi Valley and Moorpark. Loh and Schillo are running in the 2nd 
Supervisorial District, representing most of the Conejo Valley and Port 
Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the association's primary concerns addressed in a candidates' 
questionnaire was their commitment to bringing more judges and legal services 
to the East County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The courthouse in Simi Valley is staffed with two court commissioners, who 
hear mostly traffic, civil, small claims and minor criminal cases. Attorneys 
and clients involved in more substantive legal cases must drive to the county's 
main courthouse in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you consider the amount of time police officers are taken off the streets 
to drive to Ventura to testify in court, along with witnesses and others . . . 
the impact is tremendous," Tina Rasnow, association president, said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Richard F. Kunz, a member of the association's candidate evaluation 
committee, said the association was most impressed with Mikels for making 
funding for additional legal services in the east county a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunz said Mikels promised to set a timeline for assessing services needed at 
the East County Courthouse and to recommend how to pay for them. CARLOS V.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 12 POLICE WORKERS ENDORSE MILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once slammed in a negative telephone campaign by the Simi Valley police union, 
former Police Chief Lindsey Paul Miller has been endorsed for City Council by 
some of his former command staff in a letter distributed to Ventura County 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul Miller . . . is without question superbly qualified and well prepared to 
serve our community as a member of our City Council," the letter reads. "Those 
that have worked with him the closest during his tenure as chief of police . . 
. support his candidacy without reservation." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter goes on to tout Miller's handling of events such as the Northridge 
earthquake and the local impact of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 It concludes, "Paul Miller has the background, intellect and most of all, the 
strength of character to make those decisions."  
</P>
<P>
 The letter was signed by both captains who served under Miller before his 
retirement in February and by seven lieutenants and three support staff 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very pleased to see that," Miller said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's important to consider is that the people who signed that are the 
people I worked with day in and day out, and they had the most contact with me, 
as opposed to the people who were out in the field." 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Police Officers' Assn. did not endorse Miller, but rather 
endorsed incumbent Councilwoman Sandi Webb and insurance salesman Michael S. 
McCaffrey for council.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the union used an automatic telephone-dialer for several weeks to 
call Simi Valley voters and play a message urging them to vote for Webb and 
McCaffrey and not to vote for Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 The message charged that the department suffered from management problems and 
general turmoil during Miller's 13 years as chief. 
</P>
<P>
 The message was changed about two weeks ago to eliminate any mention of 
Miller, said Sgt. Gary Collins, the union president. MACK REED

MAN FACES TRIAL IN ARSON, CRUELTY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oak Park man accused of dousing himself with gasoline and setting his house 
afire in September has been ordered to stand trial on three felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Rose, 38, will be tried on one count of arson, one count of 
brandishing a knife and one count of animal cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
 Two family dogs died during the Sept. 29 incident, Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard 
E. Simon said. After arguing with his wife, Rose became suicidal and set fire 
to the garage and stairwell of his family's Pesto Way home, Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 When two neighbors tried to stop his tirade, Rose brandished a knife and threw 
gas on one of them, Simon said. After being trapped by fire in the upstairs 
portion of the home, Rose decided that he did not want to die and jumped out of 
a second-floor window, the prosecutor said. The dogs were also trapped on the 
second floor and succumbed to smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, whose preliminary hearing was Tuesday, is being held in the Ventura 
County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail. He will be arraigned Nov. 8 in Superior 
Court. DWAYNE BRAY

VANDALS PUNCTURE TIRES ON 15 VEHICLES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vandals punctured the tires on 15 cars in the Las Casitas neighborhood of 
Thousand Oaks early Thursday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine cars parked alongside the Las Casitas condominium complex and six more by 
the adjacent Mirabella Apartment complex had tires slashed, Ventura County 
sheriff's deputies said. Both complexes are on Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Casitas residents started a Neighborhood Watch group earlier this year and 
have worked with police for two years to curtail crime. Sheriff's officials 
said they hoped that witnesses to the vandalism would come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The department, through the Ventura County Crime Stoppers program, is offering 
up to $1,000 for information that leads to the arrest of the vandal or vandals.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; NO PROBLEMS CITED IN 2ND AERIAL SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Camarillo residents pulled plastic tarps off cars and hosed down patios 
Thursday, officials said the second aerial spraying to combat a Medfly 
infestation went off as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The spraying, which began at 9 p.m. Wednesday, covered 16 square miles and 
ended just after 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything went fine.There were no complications at all," said Aurelio 
Posadas, a program supervisor with the state Department of Food and 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary check showed that the trio of Bell helicopters spewing the 
mixture of malathion and bait stayed within the boundaries of the spray zone, 
Posadas said. 
</P>
<P>
 St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital officials said they received no patients 
who complained of ill effects from the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 And Dr. Gary Feldman, Ventura County's public health officer, said no one 
complained to the health department Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased we didn't have a flurry of concerns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said he would not know for several days if any pesticide-related 
illnesses were reported to state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The second aerial assault prompted only 226 calls to a hot line run by the 
Cooperative Medfly Project in the city of Bell. The first spraying Oct. 12 
spurred 1,100 calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup efforts at schools were aided Thursday by volunteers from four 
packinghouses and parents who arrived at campuses in the spray zone about 6:30 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The aerial spraying is aimed at eradicating a Mediterranean fruit fly 
infestation that was discovered Sept. 29 on the grounds of St. John's Seminary 
near Camarillo. The fruit fly destroys crops by laying eggs inside fruit. The 
developing larvae destroy the fruit by eating the pulp. 
</P>
<P>
 The series of sprayings is expected to continue through April. JULIE FIELDS

 Oxnard police are investigating the robbery of a south Oxnard branch of Bank 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a man entered the bank in the 2400 block of Saviers Road at 4:20 
p.m. Wednesday and gave the teller a note demanding money.The teller gave the 
robber an undisclosed amount of cash to the robber, who fled with it, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A bank employee who would not give her name said Thursday that the robber said 
he had a gun, but did not display a weapon. The employee also said the robber's 
picture was captured on a bank videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Police checked the area after the robbery but were unable to find the suspect, 
who they said was a Latino in his 20s with short hair, dark pants and a white 
shirt. IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; POLICE WARN OF CAR PRIZE SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It sounds like a good deal: a brand new car for $500. 
</P>
<P>
 But Oxnard police are warning consumers not to fall for what they say is an 
illegal scam. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Len Newcomb said three or four people have telephoned his office 
this week asking about calls they received informing them that they had just 
won a new car. The catch, he said, is that the residents were asked to pay half 
the sales tax and license fees, about $500, to ensure delivery of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomb said the offer was very tempting to some city residents, though he 
knew of no one who had sent in the money. According to the detective, one woman 
said, "I really want this car. This is a brand-new Mustang." 
</P>
<P>
 The calls seem to be confined to Oxnard, police said. The operators of the 
scheme have left phone numbers in Houston, but are probably using 
call-forwarding to cover their trail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said it is illegal to require anyone to pay for any part of a prize 
they have won. IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MURDER CHARGE AGAINST 2 DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A murder charge was dismissed Thursday against two Ventura men accused of 
killing a man during a $15 robbery because the judge said he is not certain how 
the victim received his fatal injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell said he is convinced that Thomas 
Shoop was kicked during the February robbery, but he is uncertain whether the 
assault or a bathroom fall several hours later caused Shoop's spleen to 
rupture, which caused Shoop to bleed to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's ruling leaves Everado Mondragon and Jose Sanchez facing only 
robbery charges in the attack on Shoop. Mondragon, 35, also faces unrelated 
drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not happy," Deputy Dist. Atty. Terence M. Kilbride said of the ruling. 
"I'm not surprised, but I'm not happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, who is hearing the trial without a jury, dismissed the murder charge 
after the prosecution had finished presenting its case. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoop died Feb. 21, one day after he was beaten and robbed by two men. He 
immediately reported the holdup to police and identified the defendants as the 
men who stole his $15. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoop declined medical treatment at that time, as well as during the early 
morning hours of Feb. 21, when he complained of pain. 
</P>
<P>
 His roommate, Richard Graham, testified that he heard a loud noise in the 
bathroom and later found a broken toilet seat in the bathroom and fecal matter 
smeared on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner who performed the autopsy on Shoop testified that his injuries 
were consistent with having been kicked, but he could not say definitely that 
that is how the fatal injury was received. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys argued that Shoop ruptured his spleen in the bathroom fall.

EAST COUNTY RACES; FUND-RAISING HEATS UP CAMPAIGN FOR THOUSAND OAKS CITY 
COUNCIL; POLITICS: SIX CANDIDATES EACH RAISE MORE THAN $10,000 IN CONTRIBUTIONS 
AND LOANS. FAR SMALLER WAR CHESTS ARE REPORTED IN SIMI VALLEY CONTEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six candidates for the Thousand Oaks City Council on Thursday reported raising 
more than $10,000 apiece in contributions and loans, fueling a heated campaign 
that has jammed cable television with dozens of commercials each day. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Simi Valley council candidates reported far smaller war chests. 
Former police chief Lindsey Paul Miller led the pack of seven candidates with 
his campaign fund of $5,026. Incumbent Sandi Webb reported raising $1,415. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their limited accounts, several Simi Valley candidates said they still 
plan to run television ads as they compete for two open seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest fund-raiser in Thousand Oaks was dentist Greg Cole, a Ventura 
County Community College trustee who describes himself as a family man 
dedicated to community service. Buoyed by a $17,000 personal loan, Cole 
reported a total cash pot of $32,436. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole received $2,250 from dealers in the Thousand Oaks Auto Mall. The car 
dealers also gave $3,250 to incumbent Judy Lazar, who racked up the 
second-highest campaign account, with $22,234. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole said he plans to spend a significant chunk of his contributions on 
television commercials, including one spot announcing an endorsement from 
former state senator and Los Angeles police chief Ed Davis. In the ad now 
airing on CNN and other cable stations, Davis tells viewers: "I can assure you 
that Greg Cole's commitment to your safety is as strong as my own." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Thousand Oaks candidates who have emphasized public safety, 
firefighter Andy Fox and police detective Mike Markey, are also airing 
television ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, whose crime-fighting commercial features alarming headlines about gangs 
and graffiti, reported raising $13,725. Running on the slogan, "Why not elect a 
public servant to serve the public?" Markey has received $8,224 in donations, 
including a $1,500 contribution from auto mall dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto mall dealers have emerged as the biggest donors in the Thousand Oaks 
campaign, with contributions to Cole, Fox, Lazar, Markey, retired businessman 
Marshall Dixon and financial services manager Michael Friedman. Local realtors' 
political action committees have also kicked in significant sums, donating $650 
apiece to Cole, Fox, Lazar and Markey. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seizing on such donations, opponents have tried to paint these candidates as 
beholden to special interests. All have denied the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Friday, Lazar said she has voted against the auto mall several times on 
issues such as landscaping and building colors -- and will continue to make up 
her own mind, regardless of pressure from campaign donors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've certainly clashed with me before," Lazar said. "I think they know I'm 
independent." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has a sizable campaign account, Lazar has decided not to run 
television commercials. She will focus instead on newspaper ads and mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks airwaves are already full of ads from Cole, Fox, Friedman, 
Markey and three candidates running as a slate: incumbent Elois Zeanah, city 
operations manager David Hare, and retired filmmaker M. Ali Issari. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah and Hare, who emphasize the need to return to family values and 
preserve neighborhoods from more development, each received $500 from a city 
employees' union. Endorsing the slate, Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski has donated 
$500 to Zeanah and $250 to Issari. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah reported total contributions of $11,292. Hare's coffers contain about 
$9,700. And Issari, who loaned his campaign $7,250, has amassed a total of 
$13,550. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, one of Miller's largest contributions of $250 came from Ron 
Meek, president of the Oakridge Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Kunicki, who serves on the city's planning commission, raised a total of 
$3,927, much of it from developers and property managers. First Street Car Wash 
donated $500, while Troop Real Estate gave $250 and developer Griffin 
Industries gave $249. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Chamber of Commerce President Michael S. McCaffrey raised $4,433, 
including a $2,725 loan he made to himself. He has spent most of that on cable 
TV ads and postage. Incumbent Sandi Webb raised just $1,415 but spent $3,200 on 
TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>

NOW YOU SEE IT, AT THE ALEX; 'IT'S MAGIC!' AT THE HISTORIC GLENDALE THEATER IS 
BRINGING ITS CAST OF PRESTIDIGITATORS BACK TO THE AREA AFTER A 10-YEAR ABSENCE.

 It was there in prehistory, when a drawing on a cave wall guaranteed a good 
hunt and rhythmic movement brought rain clouds. It has been a part of everyday 
life ever since. A visiting uncle amazes the kids with simple card tricks, and 
big brother pretends to swallow a coin, then miraculously pulls the same coin 
out of little brother's ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Magic!" 
</P>
<P>
 That's also the name of a familiar theatrical friend to fans of illusion in 
the area, and a steppingstone of sorts for the professional world of magic at 
large. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Magic!" which opened last night for a limited engagement at the newly 
refurbished Alex Theatre, first appeared in 1956 and returned annually for 31 
years, first at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre, then until 1984 at the Variety Arts 
Center in Downtown Los Angeles. This return engagement after 10 years, which 
features some of the top professional magicians in America, is like coming home 
for Milt Larsen, who has staged the show in all its editions, and is 
co-producing the revival with Terry Hill, whose Terry Hill Entertainment Group 
manages events at the Alex. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1950s, stage magic was going out of style. The period's famous 
magicians, such as Harry Blackstone Sr. and Thurston, were no longer touring. 
The postwar boom didn't invite escapism. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen, who also operates Hollywood's 32-year-old Magic Castle, recalls, 
"There was just no place to do magic very much. Magic itself was kind of down 
then. 'It's Magic!' helped bring it back."  
</P>
<P>
 The show gave impetus to the careers of such television celebrities as Ernie 
Kovacs and Art Baker, along with being the starting point for the careers of 
many well-known prestidigitators. 
</P>
<P>
 Vegas headliners Lance Burton and Joseph Gabriel were in their late teens when 
they first appeared in "It's Magic." In both cases scouts for "The Tonight 
Show" saw them and booked appearances on the show. (Johnny Carson, a magic fan, 
started out as a teen-age magician.) Following that exposure, Burton and 
Gabriel became Las Vegas stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen is thrilled that it's coming to life again. "I've been having a ball 
doing it," he says. "And we've gotten together a group of some of the most 
wonderful people. When we announced we were bringing it back, we started 
getting calls from acts saying, 'We want to be on it, we want to be on it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Two Las Vegas showrooms, where acts play seven days a week, have done what 
Larsen calls "the unthinkable." The Flamingo Hilton, where Gabriel is starring 
in the long-running "City Lites," and Harrah's, home to the "Spellbound" revue 
featuring Sherry Lukas, have allowed these acts time off to appear in the 
current edition of "It's Magic!" 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen, always very busy at the Magic Castle, had to be coaxed into guiding 
the revival. Hill, who was so young the first time he visited the Castle in 
1962 that his father drove him because he didn't have a driver's license, felt 
that the Alex's entertainment policy was perfect for what Larsen has always 
referred to as "an adult show for the entire family." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in the entertainment business most of my adult life. My father was 
an amateur magician. It was a hobby. I grew up around magic, and always enjoyed 
it." Hill's father, a charter member of the Castle, was there the week it 
opened. Hill uses magic acts in his business, which besides operating the Alex, 
books concert tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just decided," Hill says, "that 'Magic' hadn't been done for a few years, 
and it would be fun to bring it back in this beautifully restored theater. I 
kept twisting Milt's arm until he said yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some impressive magic can be seen at the Castle, Larsen says, 
"There's really no place in Southern California where you can actually see 
really big stage magic. You'd have to go to Vegas to see the acts in this show. 
It's really kind of a shame that there's no variety venue anymore. 'It's 
Magic!' at least brings part of that back." 
</P>
<P>
 He continues: "We took magic out of the doldrums and gave it a nice setting. 
We made a lady out of magic back in the '50s. In a sense we kind of started 
this ball rolling down the hill. In so doing it helped create the Copperfields 
and the Lance Burtons, and these young kids who are now major stars. All I take 
credit for is that I give the performers a platform, turn the light on and, 
hopefully, fill the space with people who appreciate the art."  
</P>
<P>
 Many young people are coming into the field of magic today, and there is 
plenty of work for them, from cruise ship shows to conventions, club dates and 
industrial shows, Larsen says. Even though you have to be 21 or over to join, 
the Magic Castle has a junior group of magicians from age 15 to 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be a very good junior magician to be in the group," Larsen says. 
"It's a small group, and it's very hard to get into." But they are a part of 
the next generation of artists dedicated to fooling us all. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's magicians, Larsen says, were young magicians starting out when the 
Castle opened, and their mentors were the magical headliners of the early 
editions of "It's Magic!" The roster of this new edition is headed by emcee 
Rudy Coby, recently featured at Manhattan's Radio City Music Hall and in his 
full evening of comedy and magic in London. 
</P>
<P>
 The show also spotlights dramatic magician James Brandon, James Dimmare (the 
"Fred Astaire of Magic"), the whirlwind displays of The Majestix (Michael Giles 
and Tracy Jones), and the magic and juggling of Michael Marlin. The production 
is directed by Michael McGiveney, who appeared in the 1976 edition of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the revival of "It's Magic!", Larsen is busy as a consultant 
for the $38-million Magic Empire theme park being created by Caesars Palace in 
Las Vegas, to open next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know," Larsen says with a laugh, "that the people who own the hotels 
in Vegas don't gamble. So when they take a $38-million gamble on the fact that 
magic is hot, you know that it's something they've given a lot of thought to."

IN GOOD COMPANY; DIRECTORS, ARTISTS IN COHESIVE NEW ENSEMBLE EMBARK ON A 
CHALLENGING PREMIERE PROGRAM. 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nancy Chris Evans sits in a booth of one of the little mom-and-pop eateries 
that dot Magnolia Boulevard -- not the kind of place to ponder life's big 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet here she is, sitting next to her fellow director William Korf, and 
thinking about what made her junk what little security she had as an actor and 
theater artist and form a new theater company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Artistically," she says, "I felt that I needed to go to the edge of the 
cliff." Rather than falling, what she found was a small group of actors, all 
members of the now-shuttered Actors Company, willing to join her in forming 
Outpost Theatre Ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 Willing also to embark on some serious theater work that immediately set it 
apart from any other San Fernando Valley group. After all, no one between 
Glendale and Thousand Oaks and Lancaster and Encino has tried, lately, to stage 
Harold Pinter's early one-act "The Dumb Waiter" and Jean Genet's second play, 
"The Maids" -- two of the great head-scratchers of postwar theater. 
</P>
<P>
 This premiere program at the Gene Bua Acting for Life Theatre (a very 
temporary rental home), is more than an excursion into classics of the Theatre 
of the Absurd. For Evans, 40, who is directing "The Dumb Waiter" (Korf, 38, 
directs "The Maids"), it holds almost talismanic importance. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinter's insidiously funny play about two hit men waiting to carry out their 
assignment was the first project Evans did with the then-young, struggling and 
unknown Steppenwolf Theatre Company, working out of the basement of Immaculate 
Conception Grade School in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park. Indeed, it was 
one of the first efforts by Steppenwolf, of which Evans was a founding member, 
along with other fellow Southern Illinois University graduates including John 
Malkovich and Gary Sinise. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans also helped found The Actors Company, and with members William 
Grueneberg, Helene McCardle and Ernesto Miyares, she "felt the same feeling I 
had in the early days of Steppenwolf, a wavelength we all seemed to be on, 
thinking the same way. And Bill (Grueneberg, who plays Pinter's bossy Gus) has 
a lot of John's energy, intensity and changeability. And like John, Bill is 
very alive on stage; you have to pay attention to him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "John, in fact, introduced me to Pinter at ISU, when he directed me in 'Old 
Times.' I didn't understand it at all! But he spent hours with me explaining it 
in his way, until I did. So I returned the favor and directed him." 
</P>
<P>
 The thinking behind leaving Actors Company and forming Outpost a year ago, 
Evans says, was "to establish high standards and expectations -- which I have 
for myself. We're doing the plays we want." 
</P>
<P>
 No hard feelings persist for the former Burbank group -- only the recognition 
that membership companies like it and many others in Los Angeles' sprawling 
theater world tend not to stimulate the needs of more ambitious actors. "In a 
membership situation," says Evans, "you might have dozens, even over a hundred 
actors to satisfy, and you never really do. Outpost is an example of actors 
taking control of their own work." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the case of Korf, directors, as well. A theater arts instructor at Rio 
Hondo College, Korf says he wanted to explore "a professional situation" when 
Grueneberg, his friend of 10 years, invited him to an early Outpost workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I first saw was a group of very nice people," he says, with a nod to 
Evans, "and I'm still not aware of any egos." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the nature of the group (small, with an equal number of men and women) 
demanded that he violate Genet's request that the female characters of "The 
Maids" -- two maidservants who take their play-acting to deadly extremes, and 
the lady they serve -- be played by men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure I would cast men even in the most ideal circumstances," he says. 
"Listening to his complex language, Janie (Gavin), Helene, Jennifer (Haymore) 
and I have worked very hard to find the meanings, Genet's themes of servitude 
and domination, and stay close to his stage directions. Since male casting adds 
a third layer of illusion, we've replaced that with a strong sense of actors 
acting. So we see them get into costume, waiting off-stage for their cue." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it is the Outpost company's cue to go public, and Evans says they are 
ready. "We've been hustling -- selling ads, raising money, looking for donors. 
The key is being assertive. Our goal is a home in Old Town Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
 And like a good house-hunter, Evans already has her ideal spot in mind: 
"perhaps a loft space that will provide a studio for film production as well. . 
. . We haven't found it yet. But we will." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: A one-act double bill of "The Dumb Waiter" and "The Maids."

PRIESTLY PLAY THAT'S NOT PREACHY; RICHARD HERD PORTRAYS A CLERIC IN DOUGLAS 
SCOTT DELANEY'S COMEDY-DRAMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Janice Arkatov writes regularly about 
theater for The Times.

<P>
 Richard Herd is definitely in a priestly mode these days. Beginning Nov. 8, he 
will play the fictional Cardinal O'Brien to Nicholas Turturro's young priest in 
the HBO production of "The First Commandment," directed by Warrington Hudlin. 
And beginning Wednesday, he will play Father Seamus Dunne to Javi Muiero's 
young priest in the world premiere of Douglas Scott Delaney's 12-character 
comedy-drama ". . . My Last Confession" at the Road Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dunne is a regular guy, a humanist, who happens to be a priest," explains 
Herd, who also plays Secretary Gen. Noyce on NBC's "seaQuest DSV." He's been a 
member of the Road company since he and his wife, actress Patricia Herd, 
appeared there in 1993's "The Walkers." 
</P>
<P>
 Although fictionalized as St. Martin's, Delaney has set his drama at a 
real-life Catholic church, St. Brigid's, in New York's seedy Alphabet City 
district. Ironically, Herd lived across the street as a young actor; his son 
was baptized in that church. 
</P>
<P>
 Not coincidentally, Herd is also responsible for bringing Delaney's drama to 
the Road -- a favor not lost on the playwright, who has been communicating with 
the company and director Taylor Gilbert by phone from his home near Lawrence, 
Kan. "Originally, the piece was written as a one-act when I was a technical 
director at Southwestern College in Kansas," notes Delaney, who will travel 
here for the premiere. "It was a mini-hit, so I expanded it to full-length. The 
version you'll see is probably the fourth or fifth major rewrite." 
</P>
<P>
 The play's genesis, says the writer, was his own childhood in New York. "They 
used to bus us to this church every Wednesday," he recalls, "and Father Lynch 
would try to teach us (religious) lessons using a ventriloquist's dummy. He was 
really, really bad." The church itself, Delaney adds, "was built for the people 
who lived there at the time, but then the neighborhoods all changed. Certain 
dinosaurs remain -- like this church. I think conventions like that need to 
change, need to adapt. When they don't, they die." 
</P>
<P>
 Delaney notes that his plays usually take their form from the characters' 
dialogue. "The way I write is kind of like Ping-Pong," says the writer, whose 
"American Airborne" played at the Attic Theatre in Hollywood and the Globe 
Playhouse in West Hollywood. "I put a few people out there and just let them 
start talking. . . . In this case, confessional is a wonderful (theatrical) 
device, because it gives you the excuse to keep bringing new people in." 
</P>
<P>
 At age 17, Delaney was recruited to play football at Southwestern; after 
graduate school in Louisiana, he returned to New York and toiled at the Working 
Stage for six years. "It was time," he says of his 1990 departure. "I promised 
myself as soon as I got myself a New York literary agent I would leave. New 
York is just too expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he says happily, "I've got some land, some dogs" -- plus a 30-member 
company, the Renegade Theatre, in Lawrence. "I do miss the city greatly. But I 
always knew I had to get out of New York. I'll go back on my own terms: When I 
get a big play up or publish one of my novels." 
</P>
<P>
 Delaney is equally relaxed about public perception of this play. "There is no 
message," he stresses. "I believe in painting a picture. People will get from 
it what they want. Nobody wants to be preached to." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: ". . . My Last Confession."

PLAYING TO EMOTIONS; KITARO BRINGS HIS NEW AGE BLEND OF ROCK, CLASSICAL AND 
FOLK TO UNIVERSAL AMPHITHEATRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Steve Appleford writes regularly

<TEXT>
<P>
 The road can be a challenging place for a musician. The blur of hotel rooms, 
bumpy roads, that long, endless bus trip. Which may explain why many New Age 
artists never step outside their studios. 
</P>
<P>
 For Kitaro, who is listed in the Encyclopaedia Britannica as "the 
quintessential musician of the New Age," staying home and indoors is 
unacceptable. "Most of the artists never perform live," Kitaro complains of his 
New Age colleagues. "That is a problem. It is the artist's responsibility to 
perform, to communicate with the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 So Kitaro travels. The Japanese-born composer and instrumentalist expects to 
be on the road with his nine-person band until May of next year, performing a 
two-hour-and-20-minute concert virtually every night. Kitaro and band, who 
perform tonight at Universal Amphitheatre, mix older selections with material 
from his new "Mandala" album. 
</P>
<P>
 But on this quiet afternoon in Los Angeles, Kitaro has the day off. He's 
sitting for lunch and an interview at his Century City hotel. "Today is nice, 
relaxed," he says with a smile. Or, maybe it would be, he says with a shrug, if 
not for his appointment with the dentist later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime I go to a new country, it's very important to me," Kitaro says. 
Before this trip is over, Kitaro will have traveled throughout the United 
States, Canada, Australia, Southeast Asia and Europe. He will also make his 
first tour of South America. "I find different experiences and inspirations." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is hardly new territory for Kitaro, who now lives outside 
Boulder, Colo. His first tour of the country was in 1987, when he decided to 
use the long bus ride to search for a place to live. He mulled over Seattle and 
parts of Massachusetts before choosing his new home at the base of a mountain, 
where he is building a private studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed mountains, a higher altitude," he says, noting that nature is an 
important element and inspiration for his work. "I needed four seasons, to 
watch the leaves changing colors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaro, born in 1953, says he ultimately had to leave Japan and what he 
described as the small, closed society of musicians there. He needed to expand 
beyond that small world and collaborate with other types of musicians. "If I 
stayed in Japan I could not go deeper with my creativity," he explains. "They 
try to keep in their own world. In the United States there are many more 
categories of music." 
</P>
<P>
 The category he seems least comfortable with is New Age, which remains a 
mystery to him. "Who came up with this name?" he asks. It seems to have little 
to do with the layers of rousing, emotional music he creates with elements of 
rock, classical and various international folk styles. His early dual 
inspirations were rock-soul singers such as Otis Redding and the modern 
synthesizer masters of Tangerine Dream. "My dream is a kind of rock symphony," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the pleasant opportunities Kitaro found in the United States was a job 
creating the musical score for Oliver Stone's 1993 film "Heaven and Earth." It 
was the composer's first work on a major Hollywood film, and it earned him a 
Golden Globe Award. "Heaven and Earth" was the final chapter in Stone's trilogy 
on the Vietnam War and focused on the experiences of Vietnamese War survivor Le 
Ly Hayslip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned many things from Mr. Stone about the Vietnam War," says Kitaro, who 
accompanied the director on a two-week trip to Vietnam before shooting. "He 
didn't like the typical Hollywood score. I thought that's why he chose me. He 
wanted an Asian spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Composing and recording that score took Kitaro more than a year of work with 
Stone. In search of the authentic cultural flavor, Kitaro brought three 
Vietnamese musical instruments into the studio, even though he didn't know how 
to play them. Kitaro taught himself, as he has for guitar, keyboards and other 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking for sounds is enjoyable, sometimes troubling," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The new "Mandala" album opens to the sound of water drops, blending into 
Kitaro's soaring electric guitar playing. Although keyboards are an important 
part of Kitaro's arsenal, he prefers the old synthesizers introduced in the 
1960s. He's unimpressed with the new keyboard technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "These keyboard technologies are destroying artists' creativity," he says. 
"People don't know the real sounds." Where and When

<P>
 Who: Kitaro.

THREADS OF TIME; A DISPLAY OF BRIGHTLY COLORED TEXTILES AT CSUN ART GALLERY 
OFFERS INSIGHT TO THE TRIBAL CULTURES OF THAILAND AND LAOS.

<P>
 Throughout time, textiles have told us stories about the people and the 
cultures that have produced them. 
</P>
<P>
 "By threads, we are connected to the major events of our lives," said Sheila 
Allen-Weiss, curator of the Cal State Northridge Art Gallery's exhibit, "The 
Connective Thread: Textiles of Thailand and Laos." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the West, we go from swaddling clothes to christening gown, confirmation 
dress, prom dress, wedding gown and eventually a funeral shroud," she said. "In 
the East, and more specifically, Southeast Asia, the textiles worn connect one 
to more than major events. A woven stripe, a change of color or variation of 
pattern can signify tribal affiliation or a change of allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
 "A style of woven turban or skirt cloth can define one's social status, 
subgroup links, wealth or importance and even age level. You can't be what 
you're not. You have to be what you are." 
</P>
<P>
 The show presents 50 intricate, often brightly colored textiles representing 
about 20 tribes that live in remote villages in the foothills and mountains of 
Northeast Thailand and Laos. All the pieces are 20th-Century. Most of them are 
completely handmade. They come primarily from the collection of Dr. Raymond 
Briggs of South Pasadena, with additional pieces on loan from other Southern 
California collections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I selected the best example of what I could get -- the oldest, the most 
complex, the most well-made," said Allen-Weiss, who studied textiles in China 
for six months and is working on a master's degree in Asian textiles at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
 Art gallery director Louise Lewis, who said she loves textiles, noted they 
"have long displayed issues of design, pattern, conceptualization and 
composition. All the issues that are at stake in modern painting have been 
addressed for centuries, if not millennia, in textiles." 
</P>
<P>
 She was particularly receptive to bringing this exhibit to the gallery to 
"draw from the surrounding community such a distinguished collection, and from 
the campus, our own distinguished researcher on the subject. We found her 
historical academic research background as well as her aesthetic sensibilities 
to be an ideal match for the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen-Weiss has divided the show into two sections: One displays objects from 
daily life such as hats, shoulder bags and shawls. The other contains the 
banners, meditation squares and burial clothes used in rituals and religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Methods of production have changed little since ancient times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Textile production is primarily in the hands of women," she said, adding that 
they also grow the raw materials. Girls begin to learn embroidery at about age 
6. "The width of the loom determines the width of the textiles. There are many 
different motifs -- floral, vegetal, animism, Buddhist. In early times, Buddha 
was represented as a geometric pattern -- the Buddhist eye -- rather than the 
figure. The elephant foot (signifies) great virtue and great fortune." 
</P>
<P>
 The meanings of some of the symbols in modern pieces have been lost, but 
contemporary weavers continue to use them in their work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Allen-Weiss described herself as "a weaver and spinner and generally a textile 
person. I've embroidered since I was a child." Her fascination with Southeast 
Asian textiles grew out of her being "intrigued as hell by Chinese Buddhist 
textiles. They are done for the purpose of going to the temple and gaining 
merit. . . . I have a great admiration for their complexity of weaving and 
embroidery. They give their very best work to the temple. It's a thorough 
integration of textile with religion." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen-Weiss sees "quite strong links" in the textiles of China and those of 
Southeast Asian tribes, she said. Several of the tribes established in 
Southeast Asia moved there after being forced out of China. 
</P>
<P>
 This exhibit is "a chance for people to see items they won't normally see," 
she said. "There's been little emphasis on hill tribes, and I think they 
deserve a major emphasis. Their traditions are being fast lost as they have 
more interaction with towns and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the towns, you see a disintegration of the culture and a loss of 
technique. Plastic buttons instead of shell. Aniline dyes are taking the place 
of indigo and vegetable dyes. Some of (the weavers) are getting sewing 
machines." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking over the fine, hand-made objects in the show, she said, "You won't see 
these things much longer." Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: "The Connective Thread: Textiles of Thailand and Laos." 
</P>

 Looking for safe and sane makeup tips for would-be Halloween ghoulies? KNB EFX 
Group, the Chats worth company that has created special makeup effects and 
animatronic devices for movies such as "Wes Craven's Nightmare," "Pulp Fiction" 
and the upcoming "Mouth of Madness," offers this short list: 
</P>
<P>
 * To make skin look old and wrinkled: Use liquid latex (usually available at 
magic or specialty makeup stores). Dab it on with a white latex sponge while 
the skin is stretched. Once dried, powder lightly with translucent powder. To 
remove, cover the area with a warm wet towel. The wetness and the heat will 
separate the latex from the skin, and the latex will peel off. Wash the area 
with soap and water. 
</P>
<P>
 * To give the mouth a decayed look: Mix red and blue food coloring in a cup, 
rinse your mouth for a few seconds and then spit it out. Don't swallow.  
</P>
<P>
 * To get a melted face look: Mix commercial gelatin (usually available at 
grocery stores) with warm water in a paper cup until thick and pasty. Allow it 
to cool, then apply to your face with a tongue depressor or spatula. For best 
results, let the gelatin drip on your face. To remove, cover with a warm wet 
towel. 
</P>
<P>
 The KNB EFX people also offer these makeup safety tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Test it first on a patch of skin (preferably the inner soft spot of the 
forearm) to make sure it will not irritate your skin or cause an allergic 
reaction.  
</P>
<P>
 * Always keep the makeup away from your mouth and eyes.  
</P>
<P>
 * Be wary of makeup removers. Cold creams and soap and water usually work 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 * Always remove makeup before going to bed.  
</P>
<P>
 * If wearing a mask and/or a full costume, drink plenty of liquids to avoid 
dehydration, and make sure the masks provide ventilation and unobstructed 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
 *

 HOT! HOT! HOT!: Due to popular demand, The Moonlight Tango Cafe has declared 
Wednesday "Mambo Night." 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing we've not had at the Moonlight Tango Cafe is salsa, and people are 
requesting it," said Lenetta Kidd, producer of Moonlight Tango's entertainment 
programs. "We have a lot of great dancers, and they want the hot Latin sounds." 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Mambo Night" will feature some top local Latin dance bands, including Johnny 
Crespo's Conjunto Costazul and Johnny Polanco and the Conjunto Amistad.  
</P>
<P>
 The Moonlight Tango Cafe will continue "Mambo Night," from 8 to midnight, 
through November and possibly beyond, Kidd says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mambo Night" at the Moonlight Tango Cafe, 13730 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks, 
has a $7 cover charge plus a $9.95 minimum. Call (818) 788-2000.  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 FAT CHANCE: Playhouse West Theater will add a new work to its rotating 
repertory in November, "Calorically Challenged and Proud of It." The piece, 
described as a "1 1/2-man show" by authors Eric Edwards and Scott Trost, will 
be performed by overweight actor and comedian Edwards (5-foot-6 and 280 
pounds). 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, (the play) answers the question: 'How does it feel to be a fat man 
in skinny America?' It plays upon Eric's size," Capellupo says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Calorically Challenged and Proud of It" opens at 7 p.m. Nov. 20 at Playhouse 
West Theater, 4250 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood, and will run 
indefinitely. Tickets are $7. For a complete performance schedule, call (818) 
441-8670.

COVER STORY; THE VALLEY'S TOP 20 RESTAURANTS; DESPITE A DAMAGING EARTHQUAKE AND 
A TOUGH ECONOMY, DINING CHOICES ARE MORE ECLECTIC THAN EVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Max Jacobson reviews restaurants every 
Friday in Valley Life!

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been a tough year for Valley restaurants and restaurant-goers, what with 
the earthquake, a down economy and a perceived dip in creativity and 
enthusiasm. Many of our favorite restaurants -- Il Mito, East India Grill 
(renamed Akbar Grill this week), Art's and Cafe Cordiale -- suffered severe 
damage. (Art's, a perennial member of this list, reopened just last week, and 
Cafe Cordiale has yet to reopen.) 
</P>
<P>
 There are bright spots. Posto and Pinot remain exemplars; they should become 
honorary members of this list. And a few more successful Westside restaurants 
-- Tribeca, Delmonico's and the Ca' Brea spinoff Ca' del Sole -- crossed 
Mulholland and joined the community. 
</P>
<P>
 For this, the third annual Top 20 Restaurants in the Valley, I've changed the 
list considerably from last year, partly because I've been disappointed in a 
few of the places included on the previous list, partly because a few new 
restaurants inched their way in. I'm delighted to say that the Valley has not 
one but two excellent Chinese restaurants now, both included here, and more 
eclecticism than ever. There's also more good Italian food than ever, as 
evidenced by the presence of La Pergola, and an absolutely top-notch sushi from 
the hand of a man named Nozawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows what 1995 will bring? 
</P>
<P>
 (Inexpensive is less than $10 per person, moderate is less than $22 a person 
and expensive is more than $23 a person.) 1. Posto  
</P>
<P>
 It's been a very tough year for Posto owner Piero Selvaggio. The man lost a 
house in the Malibu fire and a staggering amount of wines from his Valentino 
restaurant during the earthquake. This hasn't prevented Posto from making 
further strides. Luciano Pellegrini's rustic cooking is better than ever; he 
has added an incredible pasta menu to complement the wonderful, bargain-priced 
list of Italian wines. I'd come back any time for the addictive Parmesan chips 
called frico , even if Pellegrini didn't craft miracles out of wheat flour, 
olive oil and salt. See if you can talk him into making you his crab pancake. 
</P>
<P>
 14928 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. (818) 784-4400; reservation recommended. 
Expensive. 2. Pinot Bistro  
</P>
<P>
 At present, this is the Valley's only polished bistro. Chefs Octavio Becerra 
and Michael Otsuka were trained by the masterful Joachim Splichal, owner of 
Pinot, Patina and downtown's Patinette; their menu is a symphony of 
Mediterranean, California and creative elements. Come for items like spiced 
seafood cakes or brioche French toast at the exquisite Sunday brunch, original 
sandwiches or light spa cuisine at lunch. Dinner can be an epiphany: crispy 
whitefish, beef tongue with bone marrow or carmelized onion tart with marinated 
salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 12969 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. (818) 990-0500; reservations recommended. 
Expensive. 3. Ca' del Sole  
</P>
<P>
 Our brightest new entry, a modern bastion of Italian cooking, occupies the 
site that once housed the legendary Maison Gerard. You won't recognize the 
place now, with all soft yellow brick, Venetian carnival masks, richly hued 
woods. Chef Antonio Tommasi has proved himself on the other side of the hill at 
such restaurants as Locanda Veneta and Ca' Brea. Here, he's added Venetian 
rarities to his resume, baccala di San Pietro , fish hash with potato and 
capers; pomodori appassiti , baked San Marzano tomatoes; a cuff link-shaped 
pasta called gemelli , and a magnificent stewed duck. Beats paying a gondolier. 
</P>
<P>
 4100 Cahuenga Blvd., North Hollywood. (818) 985-4669; reservations 
recommended. Moderate to expensive. 4. Cinnabar  
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's best restaurant is a blend of Pacific Rim and California, filtered 
through '90s elegance. The bar's centerpiece is a Chinese antique that once 
graced L. A. Chinatown's Yee Mee Loo; the dining areas have pastel colors and 
lots of Asian art. Proprietor Alvin Simon is an old pro, head chef Hisashi 
Yoshiara an artist with a strong sense of the visual. Taste Yoshiara's sea 
scallops wrapped in shredded potato, free-range veal in a classically rich 
brown sauce, applewood-smoked salmon and wonderful vegetarian creations. 
</P>
<P>
 933 S. Brand Blvd., Glendale. (818) 551-1155; reservations recommended. 
Expensive. 5. Cha Cha Cha  
</P>
<P>
 The quake never slowed the pace at Encino's lively Cha Cha Cha. Two days after 
the Jan. 17 temblor, many locals were acting like party animals on the Titanic, 
downing tropical drinks, platters of Jamaican jerk pork and black bean tamales 
as if nothing had ever happened. Mambo gumbo is a great soup of okra, shredded 
chicken and spices; camarones negroes are jumbo shrimp in a dark, spicy sauce. 
Desserts alone are worth a visit -- the best banana cream pie in the Valley, 
and an ice cream flying saucer made from a coconut macadamia nut cookie and 
rich vanilla bean ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 17499 Ventura Blvd., Encino. (818) 789-3600; reservations recommended. 
Expensive. 6. Sushi Nozawa  
</P>
<P>
 The legendary impatience of sushi master Kazunori Nozawa, of Studio City's 
Sushi Nozawa, is one reason to position yourself at one of the restaurant's 
glass-topped tables, instead of directly under his scrutiny at the bar. (Nozawa 
once bounced a friend of mine because she wasn't eating fast enough.) Still, no 
one can deny that the man's a terrific talent, or that the fresh, clean-tasting 
sushi -- the killer yellowtail, finely marbled fatty tuna belly, for instance 
-- he serves is the equal of any in town, save perhaps the phenomenally 
expensive Ginza Sushi-Ko in Beverly Hills. Nozawa's gracious wife performs the 
table service. 
</P>
<P>
 11288 Ventura Blvd., Unit C, Studio City. (818) 508-7017. Moderate. 7. Dos 
Arbolitos  
</P>
<P>
 Chef Yayo is a master of the stewpot and the corn tortilla. At Dos Arbolitos, 
a food stand / patio in a quiet North Hills neighborhood, he puts out the 
Valley's best and most authentic Mexican dishes. Nothing here is more than $5 
-- a grainy, murky turkey mole; costillitas , baby pork riblets in three-alarm 
red sauce, and wonderful po z ole , a hearty soup thick with pieces of hominy 
and lightly fried pork. Great rice, wonderful beans a la olla , out-sized 
tortas drooling avocado, turkey and complex salsas. 
</P>
<P>
 16208 Parthenia St., North Hills. (818) 891-6661. Inexpensive. 8. East India 
Grill  
</P>
<P>
 After being closed for about six months due to earthquake damage, Encino's 
East India Grill reopened in early July with a new chef, Mohammed Ashraf Ali, 
and a spate of colorful new dishes. (Last week it was renamed Akbar Grill.) 
This is still a restaurant that breaks the monotony of our cookie-cutter 
similar Indian restaurants, relying on such condiments as mustard seed oil, 
green coconut, cilantro and tamarind to do so. Try such snacks as potato bhaji 
, delicious, savory potato croquettes full of chopped onion, and main dishes 
such as saffron chicken tandoori, hot from the clay oven with a cashew infused 
crust. 
</P>
<P>
 18003 Ventura Blvd., Encino. (818) 343-1838. Moderate. 9. Downtown Bistro and 
Cafe  
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell Frieder and his baker wife, Susan, change the menu constantly at 
their homey little high desert restaurant, formerly called Cakes and Company. 
This fall, Frieder has added such dishes as braised whole lamb shank cooked 
with cinnamon and lavender, honey-marinated pork tenderloin with a touch of 
Dijon and tasso (Cajun-spiced ham) to complement his exemplary duck confit and 
traditional Louisiana-style gumbo. Pancakes are killers at breakfast; fluffy, 
sour cream-based Heavenly Hots, corn-based, Rhode Island-inspired Johnny cakes 
to go with the good homemade breads and preserves. A truck stop, this ain't. 
</P>
<P>
 858 W. Lancaster Blvd., Lancaster. (805) 948-2253; reservations recommended. 
Moderate to expensive. 10. Daily Grill  
</P>
<P>
 The experts have announced that we're all retreating back to the safety of 
American comfort foods; the Daily Grill, in its many Southland locations, is 
cashing in on the trend.  
</P>
<P>
 No one makes a better BLT, better french fries or better plain American fare 
like meatloaf. The casual, comfortable ambience is a throwback to homey 
small-town grills of the post-Depression era. Excellent sourdough bread to 
start off a meal here; good, simple desserts such as rice pudding to finish 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 12050 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. (818) 769-6336 . Also, 16101 Ventura Blvd., 
Encino. (818) 986-4111. Reservations taken for parties of six or more. 
Moderate. 11. Talesai  
</P>
<P>
 Talesai is an offshoot of a successful Sunset Boulevard Thai restaurant, and 
it has been designed with timeless beauty -- a sleek serving bar, a dose of 
modern art, spare, metallic colors that add a cool hipness. This is modern, 
authentic Thai food, the only rub being that dishes sometimes lack the sharp 
flavors and pungency that they would have when Thais cook for themselves. 
Standouts include hor mok , a delicate, coconut-rich fish mousse served on red 
clay, coriander-crusted lamb and the city's best sate.  
</P>
<P>
 11744 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, (818) 753-1001; reservations recommended. 
Moderate. 12. Dr. Hogly Wogly's Tyler, Texas Barbecue 
</P>
<P>
 This Valley roadhouse barbecue hasn't changed since the '60s, so expect to 
come walking into a time warp. Meats are slow-smoked over hardwoods like 
hickory, oak and cherry and usually fall off the bone tender. Pork ribs are a 
specialty; the restaurant recently took top honors in a citywide rib cook-off. 
I'm a fan of the flaky, complex brisket, served sloppy in a bland sauce with 
two slices of retro bland white bread.  
</P>
<P>
 8136 Sepulveda Blvd., Van Nuys. (818) 782-2480. Moderate. 13. Il Mito  
</P>
<P>
 Il Mito closed briefly during the earthquake, then gaudily announced that it 
had been reborn. I can't say all the hype was necessary, but I can say that 
food here is still top-notch. Chef-owner Michael Fekr is a protege of Antonio 
Tommasi, and he cooks with a steady hand. The casual Art Nouveau style makes 
the restaurant a favorite with industry types and New Agers. They come for such 
dishes as risotto with beets, duck with blueberries and incredible minced 
shrimp ravioli, not only to discuss their latest scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 11801 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. (818) 762-1818; reservations recommended. 
Moderate to expensive. 14. Moonlight Tango Cafe  
</P>
<P>
 Forties atavism rules at this square, glass-ceilinged supper club, where owner 
Vicki Criezis regularly books big bands and other anachronistic entertainment 
forms. Criezis, formerly associated with good Greek restaurants such as the 
Great Greek and Cafe Athens, has a menu here that is a mix of New Orleans, 
California and the Mediterranean. Don't miss Texas Gulf crab cakes with red 
Apache sauce, Opelousas black roux seafood gumbo, great Italian-style scampi or 
the caviar roe whipped with avocado puree. Shhhh. We won't tell anybody this is 
a fancied up Greek dish called taramo.  
</P>
<P>
 13730 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. (818) 788-2000; reservations recommended. 
Expensive. 15. La Pergola  
</P>
<P>
 The ebullient Tino Pettignano raises his own produce -- pumpkin, squash, 
peppers, green beans, artichokes -- in 6,000 square feet of gardens behind his 
restaurant. For that alone, he deserves some kind of award. His restaurant is 
also loaded with charm -- a beamed ceiling, white brick walls, gorgeous Italian 
pottery, all of which makes La Pergola a compelling destination. Try stuffed 
zucchini flowers; good, fresh pastas such as panzerotti , a giant pocket filled 
with white corn and prosciutto, and the sumptuous fettuccine del giardino , 
made with spring fennel, Maui onions and pine nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 15005 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. (818) 905-8402; reservations recommended. 
Expensive. 16. Jin Hung Won  
</P>
<P>
 Chinese cuisine takes chameleonic shapes throughout Asia; perhaps nowhere is 
it more immediately appealing than in Korea. This modest North Hills restaurant 
serves the Valley's best Chinese cooking, in part because it hasn't yet learned 
to be insincere, in part because of the pervasive Korean influences. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask for cha jiang min , sticky wheat noodles in brown sauce, the exemplary 
steamed dumplings, an irresistible thing called spicy crispy chicken and stewed 
meatballs -- fine, fatty pork meatballs with heavily browned crusts. Bring a 
healthy appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 9102 Sepulveda Blvd., North Hills. (818) 893-6656. Inexpensive to moderate. 
17. Barcelona 
</P>
<P>
 Spanish food is but a distant cousin of Mexican, robust Mediterranean fare 
dependent on olives, rice, tomato and seafood. Jose Maria Companys is from 
Spain's Catalonia; his modest grill is decorated in rustic appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 Foods are straightforward, grilled meats or the tiny appetizers known as tapas 
. Try a blood sausage called morcilla or chorizo , a fatty Spanish sausage; 
saffron-rich paella chock full of lobster, sausage and large prawns; the 
peasant-style, charcoal-grilled chicken, and the wonderfully eggy dessert, 
crema Catalana.  
</P>
<P>
 14054 Burbank Blvd., Van Nuys, (818) 997-6604; reservations recommended. 
Inexpensive to moderate. 18. Montana's Bar and Grill 
</P>
<P>
 Another new addition that has made a reasonably big splash, this 
quasi-American bistro, which occupies a former L'Express, succeeds on sheer 
energy. The decor in here is Late Grunge, the food mostly American comfort. 
Montana's makes some of the best Buffalo wings in the city; chewy interesting 
pastas, and good, solid American entrees such as meatloaf, pork chops and a 
crusty, smooth turkey pot pie. 
</P>
<P>
 One more selling point is the sensible half portions, available on all but a 
few items. 
</P>
<P>
 3575 Cahuenga Blvd. West, Universal City. (213) 850-6220; reservations 
recommended. Moderate. 19. Vegetable Delight 
</P>
<P>
 This remarkable Chinese restaurant fashions wonders out of gluten, tofu, 
mushrooms, yam paste and nuts, the handiwork of a shy Chinese chef who learned 
his craft among Buddhists on the island of Taiwan. Don't be put off by a name 
like "smoked veggie fish." It's made from pressed tofu sheets, looks exactly 
like real fish and tastes terrific. The only thing the chef has failed to 
reproduce are the bones. Among the many delights are onion pancakes, hot pot 
with Napa cabbage, assorted mushrooms and mock meat balls, and an amazing 
"squid" made from yam paste.  
</P>
<P>
 17823 Chatsworth St., Granada Hills. (818) 360-3997. Moderate. 20. Tribeca 
</P>
<P>
 One more restaurant that came traipsing over the hill in 1994 was Tribeca. The 
restaurant makes this list on chutzpah and enthusiasm. The bar is a scene, 
packed with attractive young men and women; the dining area is problematic with 
undersized tables, hard-backed chairs. The kitchen can be erratic. Solid 
American cooking is the saving grace -- terrific swordfish with olive oil, 
basil and capers; good blackened prime rib, encrusted with pepper. Desserts are 
a treat -- pear shortcake, a tart plum cobbler, the bittersweet cappuccino 
creme brulee. 
</P>
<P>
 17401 Ventura Blvd., Encino. (818) 386-1339; reservations recommended. 
Moderate to expensive.

 I love to do my holiday shopping between Thanksgiving and Christmas when the 
stores are bright with lights and festive with decorations. That's part of the 
fun. So, for me, it's too early to start now. But now is the time to prepare 
home for the upcoming holiday season.

 It's certainly not too soon to have the dining room chairs recovered, or get a 
slipcover made for the sofa. Hal David Interiors has excellent workmanship and 
some of the best prices in town. For a standard seven-foot sofa, the cost is 
$299 for either a slipcover or a reupholstery job. To reupholster a standard 
dining chair, figure $35 each. A small but select stock of fabrics are 
available at heavily discounted prices. Tapestries that retail for around $40 a 
yard are between $15 and $20, and a Schumacher print that retails for $25 sells 
here for $9.95. Pick up and delivery are free.

 Hal David Interiors, 1424 S. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles. MasterCard, Visa.

 Should you need more fabrics to choose from, Home Beautiful has some excellent 
buys on damasks, so popular today for that rumpled look in upholstered pieces. 
A 62-inch wide machine-washable (55% cotton and 45% polyester) damask that 
retails for $24 to $30 a yard is $12.98. An imported damask that retails for 
close to $100 and sells at another fabric discounter for $50 a yard can be 
purchased for $30.

 If your windows need a lift, Stern's Draperies has ready-made drapes in 
antique satin, 105 inches wide by 84 inches long, for $50. But it's in the 
custom-made draperies that Stern's shines. One San Fernando Valley company gave 
a recent customer an estimate of $1,000 for a drapery job that Stern's quoted 
at $350.

 It's a good idea to get at least two estimates on custom draperies, and J.P. 
Discount Fabrics & Draperies also is known for quality work at a low cost. It, 
too, carries some ready-mades at good prices. In a commercial-grade polyester, 
a drape measuring 40 by 44 inches is $20, and a 64-by-94-inch drape is $44.

3-HOUR TOUR: SATISFYING A HEALTHY CURIOSITY; A VISIT TO THE ENCINO/TARZANA 
REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER CAN HELP DEMYSTIFY THE FACILITY BEFORE YOU NEED TO USE 
IT. 
</P>

<P>
 Hospitals usually aren't high on anyone's must-see list. Most people would do 
almost anything to avoid walking through those off-putting automatic front 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 But many hospitals have been working hard to change that perception. Most 
routinely give tours to pregnant couples and siblings-to-be, to demystify the 
facility before the birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 A tour of a local hospital can appeal to a wider audience than just a growing 
family. Some people are interested in finding out something about the way the 
place looks and runs -- before they need it. For those new in town, checking 
out the local hospitals can be one way to decide in advance which emergency 
room to opt for, or which facility may be more suitable for a surgical 
procedure or diagnostic test. 
</P>
<P>
 Children, too, like visiting hospitals. They can learn a lot about the way a 
big institution works and what a career in health care might involve. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff at Encino/Tarzana Regional Medical Center conducts tours for adults 
and children interested in exploring the inner workings of the hospital. To 
schedule a tour, call Janice Deutschman, (818) 708-5667. 
</P>
<P>
 9:45 a.m.: Encino/Tarzana Regional Medical Center includes two recently merged 
hospitals in Tarzana, one on Ventura Boulevard and the other on Clark Street. 
The 233-bed facility is south of the Ventura Freeway and just east of Reseda 
Boulevard, at 18321 Clark St. Pull into the driveway and park in the four-level 
parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Check out the gift shop to your left when you enter the lobby. While not 
large, the store offers a wide range of small-scale gift items, from toys and 
stationery to earthquake survival kits, dainty nightgowns, candy and flower 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 10 a.m.: Meet Janice Deutschman, public relations coordinator, in the lobby of 
the Women's Pavilion, just north of the main hospital entrance. The tour begins 
in the Resource Library, a mini-multimedia center open to the public. There are 
four three-foot-long bookcases filled with videos and books on topics from 
breast-feeding basics to parenting, diabetes and measles; there is also a new, 
free on-line information service. All the books can be checked out -- at no 
charge -- for two weeks at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 10:15 a.m.: "Are they real?" asks one 5-year-old of the infants in the newborn 
nursery, everyone's favorite part of the tour. Children on the tour are amazed 
at how little the newborns are, and at how neatly and tightly each is wrapped 
in a blanket, with all the fuzzy heads turned in the same direction. 
</P>
<P>
 10:20 a.m.: We walk through a typical nursing unit, past real patients in 
single rooms and around a nursing station with a few nurses gathered around. 
There are large, artfully done photographs on the walls of the halls, featuring 
close-ups of adorable, healthy children. We go past the Department of Maternal 
Fetal Medicine, where perinatalogists check pregnant women with signs of 
difficulty, and where ultrasound tests are done. 
</P>
<P>
 10:28 a.m.: We go past admitting, the registration zone of the hospital, which 
looks like a physician's office waiting room, with desks and chairs instead of 
examination rooms. Next stop is the facility's telephone switchboard nexus, 
staffed 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 10:35 a.m.: It's on to the emergency room, through a small waiting area, then 
into the diagnosis and treatment center. A teen-ager struggling with an asthma 
attack breaks the calm quiet of the tour and suddenly seems to make the group 
realize that this is, indeed, a place for the sick. We see the various 
treatment areas, including glass-enclosed, three-sided rooms designed for 
particular types of patients, such as the ear/nose/throat room, the X-ray room 
and the children's room. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurse Kathy Kelly makes a point of showing the children around the kids' room, 
telling them, "This is important, because now that this is all familiar to you, 
it won't be as scary if you have to come in." That may be, after all, the best 
reason for adults and children to take a hospital tour. The children are given 
emergency room coloring books and crayons -- and seem perfectly comfortable 
strolling through the area. 
</P>
<P>
 11 a.m.: We walk to the dietary department, where registered dietitian and 
manager Jeff Nelken shows us the vast expanse of a hospital kitchen. We stand 
in the walk-in refrigerator and the big freezer, which is kept at 5 to 10 
degrees below zero, see the large commercial ovens, meet the chef and 
salad-maker and tour the hospital's food storeroom that keeps three days worth 
of food -- from Pillsbury's cinnamon streusel topping to gefilte fish. Nelken 
explains to the group how he tries to use food to make patients happier, from 
adding pretty garnishes to the Jell-O to giving children dinosaur menus that 
feature kid-friendly food. 
</P>
<P>
 11:25 a.m.: Next stop, the laboratory, where a technician in a long, white 
coat shows the group how throat cultures are assessed for strep infection. Each 
of us looks at blood cells under a microscope, and feels the clean-but-gooey 
petri dishes used to test for bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 11:45 a.m.: Back to the Women's Pavilion conference room for juice and 
cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon: After the official tour, some participants visit the hospital's Clark 
Street Cafe for lunch. It's interesting to people-watch -- to see the hospital 
staff, volunteers and visitors -- and the food is well-priced, with burgers $2, 
soup of the day $1 and sandwiches $2.70. 
</P>
<P>
 12:45 p.m.: It's out through the main lobby to the parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 You and the kids have learned a lot about hospitals and the people who work in 
them, though, despite the warm hospitality and the fascinating sights, you may 
feel a little relieved when those automatic doors open and you're out in the 
fresh air. The hospital's a nice place to visit, but . . . .

CLUB SCENE; PLACE TO BE FOR HAPPY HOUR, HAPPY FEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Cherie Saunders 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every night from happy hour to the wee hours, Bobby McGee's in Burbank plays a 
wide variety of music -- from rock to retro -- and has a state-of-the-art 
lighting system and a huge dance floor to move the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 SCENE: By 9:30 p.m. on a recent Friday, the place was jumping. During popular 
songs, the dance floor turned into one big moving mass of people. A Laker game 
drew a small crowd of men around television monitors in the bar area, but 
thinned as quickly as the Orlando Magic's winning margin grew. Tables and 
booths around the dance floor were filled, making seating areas on the patio a 
haven for the weary. Lights and lasers flickered and flashed on the dance floor 
to the bumping beats of the club's recently improved sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 CROWD: The men significantly outnumbered the women in this crowd, ranging from 
age 21 to 40. By 10 p.m., the club easily reached its capacity of 380. There 
were a large number of men in business suits and women in conservative attire 
who must have came directly from work for happy hour, which begins at 4 p.m. 
Monday through Friday. Still, they were outnumbered by the jeans, tank dresses, 
bustiers and dress shirts of the non-happy-hour crowd. According to Rick Luna, 
32, of Van Nuys, who has been coming here for more than two years, "No one's 
stuck-up here. And I like the fact that there's a mixture of races -- black, 
Hispanic, Asian, white, everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 MUSIC: The music takes wide swings from rock, to rap, to funk, to retro. This 
is welcomed by some, frustrating to others. "There's a little bit of everything 
so you won't get tired of just one type of music," said Raymond Luna, 30, of 
North Hills. But Lucy Garcia, 32, of Burbank said, "The club needs more soul, 
more music with rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD: The club's friendly and efficient staff of bar-tenders, bouncers and 
waitresses get high marks from the regulars. Shellee Bailey of Arleta, here to 
celebrate her 26th birthday, said, "I've been coming here for over two years 
because of the friendly atmosphere and the music." 
</P>
<P>
 BAD: "We need more women and less guys," noted Mike Urias, 29, of North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 WORD: "I'm checking IDs of everyone who looks under 90," said the club's 
bouncer to a group of thirtysomethings who seemed insulted at the idea of being 
carded. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby McGee's, 107 S . First St., Burbank. Happy hour is from 4 to 8 p.m. 
Monday to Friday. Music for dancing runs from happy hour to 2 a.m. Monday to 
Friday; 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. Saturday and Sunday. Monday Night Football is offered 
with a free buffet. Information: (818) 841-1935. Cherie Saunders

FILLET OF SOUL; RIBS AND FRIED PICKLES ARE AMONG THE FEW HIGH NOTES ON B.B. 
KING BLUES CLUB MENU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Max Jacobson reviews restaurants every 
Friday in Valley Life! 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 B.B. King Blues Club hopes to emulate on CityWalk the legendary blues 
guitarist's original club on Beale Street in New Orleans. Blues on the mall, 
folks. You figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, this three-tiered club does have something of the look and feel of 
old N'awlins. The purple-and-gold-spattered proscenium stage (where a fine 
house band holds court after 9 p.m.) seems right, and the wrought-iron 
balconies on each of the levels call to mind the Quarter (the French Quarter, 
of course). 
</P>
<P>
 Photos of many legendary blues musicians hang in places of honor along the 
walls. The ghost of Elvis might lurk in one corner, near a framed guitar that 
once belonged to Mississippi John Hurt. Johnny Taylor and Rufus Thomas gyrate 
silently inside their glass frames, photo pastiches in black and white. The man 
himself, B.B. King, puts in a personal appearance now and then; he plans about 
five a year, a manager told me. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you'll be lucky. More likely you'll boogie along with an Otis Redding 
video that runs intermittently overhead in the dining areas, or take in 
well-traveled bands with names like the Blue Knights and Lost Souls. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish the food were as tight as the music. Come at lunch and there is a 
Southern-style buffet, and at dinner the food runs to barbecue. But much of it 
gives a mass-produced effect worlds removed from the forceful, hands-on 
authenticity of the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what I mean. Order corn on the cob, and you'll get half an ear, totally 
waterlogged. Pulled pork wastes a tangy, interestingly flavored barbecue sauce 
on a hopelessly dry mass of shredded meat. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some bright spots, such as the fried dill pickles. This has to be 
one of the quirkiest appetizers to come down the lane since Dr. John was in 
medical school, and it's a lot better than you might guess. Essentially, it's 
thinly sliced pickles, dipped in batter and deep-fried, accompanied by a wash 
of cool ranch dressing for dipping. The batter is quite crisp, and the textural 
crunch is a shocker. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem with fried dill pickles is quantity. They are not like potato 
chips -- you can't eat many more than just one. 
</P>
<P>
 The kitchen does a credible job with the spicy Louisiana hot wings, but I 
suggest that you avoid an appetizer called B.B.'s Gone Fishing. As we got it, 
this was flavorless boiled shrimp and oddball chunks of smoked catfish crowned 
by an unpleasantly sweet and pungent red sauce. In the center was a strange 
thing called catfish pate, which had a mild, smoky finish and was about the 
consistency of gummy cream cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm trying to like the restaurant's take on Louisiana gumbo. It's made with 
file (powdered sassafras root), as it should be, and has the proper murk. But I 
couldn't find any of the shrimp that were supposed to be in the bowl, and the 
rice they put in at the last moment strikes me as excessively al dente for this 
sort of food. 
</P>
<P>
 The red beans and rice, now, are nicely simmered, with a good, homey flavor. 
The problem with this dish is the split grilled sausage used as garnish. It 
doesn't remind me of any chaurice I've ever had -- this sausage tastes to me 
exactly like an ordinary hot dog. 
</P>
<P>
 The barbecued meats are better than either of those dishes. Beale Street baby 
back ribs is about the best meat dish the kitchen puts out -- tender, juicy 
ribs that come away easily from the bone. The barbecued chicken is generic, but 
the crunchy breaded catfish is great, dribbling juice and spurting steam when 
the cornmeal batter is cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes with a finely chopped, tangy coleslaw. The smoked prime rib (good 
meat, nice and smoky) is available either in the enormous B.B.'s cut (around 20 
ounces) or in the smaller, but ample, Memphis Belle cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Baked potatoes, often mealy in touristy places like this one, taste as if they 
have been cooked with care -- a small surprise -- and the greens (collard and 
turnip) that come with the barbecued dishes are credible. But the other 
accompaniments to barbecue are likely to be tired french fries and dry corn 
bread with cloying honey butter. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have the appetite for dessert, the best choice is Southern bread 
pudding, a dense, eggy square served warm. Another good one is Mississippi mud 
pie, chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce, though it lacks the usual 
crushed Oreo cookie crust that represents the "mud" in the formula. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Tennessee bourbon pecan pie had me singing the blues. This sticky 
commercial product had a taste of stale crushed pecans and a flaccid crust that 
practically disintegrated when poked with a fork. The thrill, my friends, was 
gone. Where and When

 Have you ever wanted to give your compliments to the chef, but didn't know 
where to find him in the restaurant? Now, a Burbank restaurant offers an 
opportunity not only to praise the cook, but also to ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Classroom Restaurant at the Equestrian Center is offering a Chef's Table 
at lunch, dinner or both on Wednesdays. It features a multi-course meal with 
wines for $17.50 at lunch or $27.50 for dinner, including gratuities. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrons are served by the students and staff of the Los Angeles Culinary 
Institute and are able to view the preparation of their meal through a glass 
window to the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important, Chef Raimund Hofmeister, president and executive chef of 
the institute, offers comments and answers questions during the preparation and 
service of the meal. And afterward, patrons can mingle with the students and 
staff and can sometimes tour the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Hofmeister says this dining experience is an educational workshop for his 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives the students a real-life situation where they have to prepare a meal 
and be confronted by the customers," he says. "And the people who come here 
really love it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually give a critique of the students' work," Hofmeister added. "And 
sometimes I get booed by the customers for being too harsh." 
</P>
<P>
 The Classroom Restaurant, 480 Riverside Drive, in the Equestrian Center, 
Burbank. Reservations required for the Chef's Table ; call (818) 840-1320. MORE 
MEATLESS 
</P>
<P>
 Chin Chin, the chain of Chinese dim sum restaurants, has added a Vegetarian 
Delights section to its menu in response to customer requests for more 
vegetarian dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Included are assorted sauteed vegetables in a choice of flavors: garlic, Kung 
Pao, sweet and sour, orange, curry or black bean, for $6.95 each. Also 
available: string beans stir-fried with bits of pickled cabbage, Chinese 
broccoli with oyster sauce or baby bok choy in a light garlic sauce, for $5.50 
each. Spicy eggplant with purple onions, scallions and garlic is another new 
dish, for $6.25. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY ALMANAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California had its own North versus South civil war in the 1880s when 
residents of what is today Orange County fought to secede from Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Though bloodless, this civil war was spirited, according to the book "A 
Hundred Years of Yesterdays." 
</P>
<P>
 Locals had many reasons for wanting their own county. The two often cited in 
history books: 
</P>
<P>
 * It cost $6 to take the stagecoach from Anaheim to the county seat in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county's only rolled fire hose was kept in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 After much debate and pressure, Orange County was born in 1889. Today 
</P>
<P>
 P. J. O'Rourke, the conservative humorist and political pundit, will give a 
talk this morning at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Rourke is a best-selling author of several books about politics and is often 
a panelist on Sunday morning news shows. He will offer his take on current 
events during the speech at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The library is at 18001 Yorba Linda Blvd.

WEST COUNTY RACES; INCUMBENTS IN CITIES, DISTRICTS OUTPACE CHALLENGERS IN FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Incumbent candidates in west Ventura County's largest cities and school 
districts continued to outpace challengers in fund-raising, financial 
statements filed Thursday show. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, Councilman Tom Holden has raised $31,897, more than any of the 
other 10 candidates vying for two council seats, according to his latest 
campaign disclosure statement. A letter-writing campaign asking voters to 
contribute $25 or more has paid off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done letter campaigns which have been very successful," Holden said. 
"Our contributions show that we have a broad base of support." 
</P>
<P>
 Holden said he is spending the majority of the money mailing brochures to 
Oxnard voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard council challenger John C. Zaragoza, a former city solid waste 
superintendent, has raised the second-largest amount in the race with $22,556. 
He has spent $19,600 to date, mostly on newspaper and television advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Maulhardt, a former grower, almost doubled his campaign fund in the 
filing period from Oct. 1 to 22, raising $10,630 for total of $22,288. Much of 
Maulhardt's funding has come agricultural businesses and from farmers such as 
the McGrath family, which contributed $600. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Camarillo, where six candidates are competing for three City Council seats, 
four-term incumbent Stanley J. Daily is leading fund-raising efforts, netting 
$6,195. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily was followed by two-term councilwoman Charlotte Craven, who has raised 
$5,218, and Mayor Ken Gose, who has $3,466 in his campaign coffers. Richard 
Lundberg led the challengers with $2,405. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Union High School Trustee Jean Daily-Underwood, first elected to the 
board 20 years ago, has $11,585 in contributions, continuing to outpace school 
board candidates across the county in fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenger Robert Q. Valles, a businessman and a personnel officer at the Port 
Hueneme Navy base, has raised $8,204. Six candidates are running for three 
seats on the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ojai, where seven candidates vying for three open seats, challenger Suza 
Francina, a yoga teacher and health columnist, was the only person to raise 
more than $2,000, with $2,060. Incumbent Nina Shelley has received $1,774, and 
the other candidates have each raised less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Port Hueneme, where three longtime councilmen decided not to defend their 
seats, only five of the 14 candidates raised more than $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Turner, a dentist, maintained his fund-raising lead with $5,421, mostly 
from members of a regional dental organization. Frank McElfish raised $3,548 
and and Anthony Volante raised $2,975. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Paula, where eight candidates are running for three council seats, 
law clerk Laura Espinosa leads the pack with more than $5,000 in contributions, 
surpassing newspaper publisher Don Johnson, who raised nearly $4,000. Incumbent 
Mayor Wayne Johnson has received about $2,100. 
</P>
<P>
 In the crowded Oxnard Harbor District race, where 11 candidates are running 
for three seats, challenger Jess Herrera led the field with $7,539. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera, chief administrator of Local 46 of the International Longshoremen's 
and Warehousemen's Union, received $1,000 from his employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenger Oras Racicot raised $6,639, followed by Irma Lopez with $6,200 and 
Bill Hill with $4,937. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, the three candidates for two open council seats -- challenger 
Evaristo Barajas and incumbents Linda Brewster and Don Gunderson -- reported 
spending less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Christina Lima and correspondents Maia Davis, Julie Fields, 
Jeff McDonald, Jeff Mitchell contributed to this report.

MAN ACCUSED OF STEALING 52 CAMPAIGN SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While complaints of disappearing campaign signs are a common election season 
phenomenon, catching a political thief in the act is rare. 
</P>
<P>
 But authorities said an off-duty Santa Paula police officer, Sgt. Wes Easley, 
saw a man remove a campaign sign just before 8 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they found the man with 52 campaign signs in the rear of his 
Chevrolet Blazer. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the suspect as Robert Hassebrock, 37, of Santa Paula, a 
manager at H & H Oil Tool Co. They cited him for petty theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Hassebrock could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Hassebrock said he took the signs down because he 
believed voters should base their votes on what they hear from the media, not 
what they see in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just kind of a strange one," Police Cmdr. Mark Hanson said Thursday. "I 
don't know what motivated the guy other than what he said." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 52 signs, 27 were for Democratic Assembly candidate Mindy Lorenz, 22 
for Democratic state Senate candidate Jack O'Connell, two for Democratic 
gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown and one belonging to county Board of 
Education candidate Angela Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than annoying," said Leslie Medina, a spokeswoman for the Lorenz 
campaign. "This is happening on a daily basis. It's not just a random sign here 
or there." 
</P>
<P>
 Medina said she believed that Lorenz's signs in particular are being targeted 
in an "organized effort." She said the signs cost $3 or $4 apiece.

2 MEN ARRESTED IN THEFT OF TEEN-AGER'S SNEAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They were nothing fancy, just a simple pair of tennis shoes, but a 15-year-old 
Thousand Oaks boy believed his life was in jeopardy because of them. 
</P>
<P>
 So he handed them over to the two men who confronted him and demanded the 
sneakers Wednesday afternoon on a city street near Thousand Oaks High School. 
</P>
<P>
 He told police that he and another juvenile were standing near a gas station 
at Calle Jazmin and Avenida de Las Flores just after 4 p.m. when the two men 
approached them. The boy told police that the men made verbal threats and said 
they wanted his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, who was not identified by Thousand Oaks police detectives because of 
his age, told police he then noticed an object that looked like the butt of a 
handgun sticking out of the pocket of one of the men. 
</P>
<P>
 Frightened, he took off the sneakers and gave them to the men, who got into 
their car and drove away. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by the two boys, police found the two suspects a few blocks away, about 
to enter a Wilbur Road convenience store. They were identified as William 
Amaya, 20, of Thousand Oaks and Alvaro Casanova, 22, of Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 They were arrested for strong arm robbery and taken into custody. Detective 
Ernie Montagna said deputies did not find a handgun in the suspects' car, but 
did find several other items that could be considered weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things like that happen all the time," Montagna said. "It's standard in 
strong arm robberies for someone to come up on a victim and threaten them with 
something that looks like a weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 Incidents of teen-agers mugging each other -- and even in some instances 
killing each other -- for sneakers became relatively common in large cities in 
the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 But the robbery of something as minor as footgear in the middle of Thousand 
Oaks prompted concern and surprise Thursday in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely we are concerned about it," said Keith Wilson, principal of 
Thousand Oaks High School. "One of our highest goals around here is to maintain 
a safe campus and we work really hard at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the police notified him of the robbery early Thursday. Seven 
monitors are stationed around the high school immediately after school ends, he 
said. But by 4:10 p.m., when the incident took place, the monitors would have 
been gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, the monitors' area of supervision does not extend across the 
street to the gas station. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson did not know whether the boy, who reportedly lives near the school, was 
a high school student. He said this was the first time he had heard of 
something like this occurring in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Alex Fiore said he too was surprised to hear about the theft, but 
credited police with making quick arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fiore hastened to add that he believes Thousand Oaks is a safe place to 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things will happen anyplace, in any city, in any town,"

FIRMS URGED TO PLUG INTO COMPUTER NETWORK AGE; THOUSAND OAKS: ECONOMIST SAYS 
FOREIGN CONCERNS ADAPTING TO WEB OF INFORMATION ARE LEAVING MANY U.S. COMPANIES 
BEHIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 American business executives got a sobering warning Thursday at a Thousand 
Oaks conference on the dawning of the computer-driven Information Age: adapt or 
die. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. companies, the conferees urged, must quickly master worldwide information 
networks such as the computer-based Internet or risk being left behind by 
savvier domestic and foreign competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the midst of a transformation," economist Michael Rothschild told 
the audience of about 75 at the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 While some insightful foreign companies are learning to adapt to the growing 
worldwide web of information, many U.S. companies are "still embedded in the 
Machine Age," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothschild's remarks opened Passport to Tomorrow, a conference that the World 
Affairs Council of Ventura County organized to address the dizzying changes in 
the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
 And the conference closed Thursday night with appearances by former Vice 
President Dan Quayle and Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento). 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the morning, Rothschild and panelists from industry and academia 
declared that the "Global Information Age" will change the world even more 
profoundly than the invention of the printing press in the 15th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rothschild authored the theory of bionomics, which holds that the world 
economy is actually an ecology that should be tended like a growing garden, not 
merely repaired like a non-growing machine. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of computers, Internet connections and fax machines has boomed 
exponentially since about 1989, propelling the world economy into a greater 
dependence on the latest information for its survival and growth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As cells process sugar and protein, so must companies feed themselves -- 
information as well as money -- to grow, he said. 
</P>

 "I believe learning is the ultimate source of profit and growth," said 
Rotschild, president of the Bionomics Institute.

 "What companies ought to be up to is gleaning knowledge from the day-to-day 
experience of other companies," he said. "There ought to be some kind of 
analysis of what could be done differently. Very few companies do this. They 
just move on to the next project."

 Companies are doomed to lose out to competitors if they ignore the advent of 
the Information Age, said panelist Liev Blad, a managing partner of the Los 
Angeles Electric Vehicle Alliance and chief executive officer of Hub 
Engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, they must overcome a fear of computers that is blocking their 
progress, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at the point in the United States now where we are so technology-rich 
and application-poor," Blad said. "And we look to forward-moving countries of 
the world to tell us how to put these technologies to use." 
</P>
<P>
 A split is growing between executives who understand computers and those who 
do not, warned Professor Jon Goodman, director of the Entrepreneur program at 
USC. Society should quickly embrace these information tools too, she said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "When you go into . . . a classroom and you do not see saturated information 
technology in that school, you can be sure the children are being 
shortchanged," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But one panelist warned that computer-related jobs can isolate people from the 
society they serve -- such as telephone information operators who sit plugged 
into headsets, typing at keyboards and talking to disembodied voices all day 
under constant supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Wood, who represents 70,000 unionized telephone workers in California, 
Hawaii and Nevada as vice president of the Communication Workers of America, 
asked: "Will we create this type of environment for more and more workers?. . . 
. That's a decision we have to make as we consider this new technology."

REGULATORS PROBING WHETHER 20TH CENTURY RATE HIKES SURPASS 6%; INSURANCE: 
COMPANY SAID IT PLANS TO PETITION FOR REVERSAL OF RULING THAT IT MUST PAY 
POLICYHOLDERS REBATES UNDER PROP. 103. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Faced with "a pattern of complaints" about auto insurance bills, the state 
Insurance Department has launched an investigation into whether 20th Century 
Insurance Co. is charging higher premiums than allowed under the 6% rate 
increase it was granted last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The department said it has received "more than 10" consumer complaints about 
increases exceeding 6%. A consumer group headed by Proposition 103 author 
Harvey Rosenfield contends that it has fielded three or four dozen complaints 
about premium increases of as much as 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate matter, the Insurance Department plans to send lawyers into Los 
Angeles Superior Court this morning to counter what it contends are delaying 
tactics by 20th Century to avoid execution of a key California Supreme Court 
ruling until a new insurance commissioner takes office in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Twentieth Century said it plans to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse 
the California high court's Aug. 18 decision, under which the Woodland 
Hills-based insurer must pay policyholders $119 million in rebates and interest 
under Proposition 103, the 1988 insurance rate-cutting initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it wants to delay the payment pending its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the auto rate increases, the state's fifth-largest auto insurer said 
it is abiding by the Insurance Department's rate order. As with any rate hike, 
the 6% figure is a statewide average, so some motorists will receive higher 
increases and others will get lower ones or no increases at all, spokesman 
Richard Dinon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Insurance Commissioner William Ahern said Thursday that regulators are 
poring over policyholders' bills and documents contained in the 20th Century 
rate filing "to figure out what's going on and to see if it's legal." 
</P>
<P>
 Policyholder Barbara J. Constine of Los Angeles said her rates jumped 12%, to 
$418 from $372 a year ago. "Nothing's changed. It's the same car and same 
coverage," she said in an interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinon said the rate filing approved by the Insurance Department provided 
average increases of about 90% in uninsured motorist coverage and 10% in bodily 
injury liability, but about a 20% decrease in comprehensive and physical damage 
coverage. The net effect, he said, is that 20th Century will receive a 6% 
increase in total auto premiums over the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Proposition 103 challenge, Ahern said that Superior Court Judge Dzintra 
Janavs received the California Supreme Court's 7-0 decision affirming Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi's order that 20th Century pay the rebates. Janavs 
then asked Garamendi to submit a proposed order to implement the decision and 
gave 20th Century until Nov. 23 to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel this is dragging things out," Ahern said, adding that department 
lawyers would ask Janavs today to expedite the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, in a separate telephone interview Thursday, said: "It's obvious why 
the industry is trying this improper and devious maneuver to delay the effect 
of the Supreme Court decision. They think they are going to elect their own 
boy, Chuck Quackenbush as commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Quackenbush opposes state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) in the 
Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also announced late Thursday that James O. Curley, 52, has 
resigned as president and director, effective Oct. 31, "to pursue other 
interests."

AS WIRELESS AUCTION NEARS, IT'S DECISION TIME FOR BIDDERS; TELECOM: ASPIRING 
PROVIDERS OF ADVANCED COMMUNICATIONS MUST REGISTER BY TODAY TO TAKE PART IN 
DEC. 5 SALE OF LICENSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By the close of business today, federal regulators will learn who wants in on 
one of the biggest financial sweepstakes in U.S. history: a multibillion-dollar 
auction of licenses for advanced wireless services that could revolutionize the 
way Americans communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of frenetic deal making that has resulted in a series of landmark 
alliances among the nation's biggest telecommunications companies, aspiring 
auction participants will register with the Federal Communications Commission 
today and later place deposits of as much as $16 million for the right to 
participate -- with the eventual winners gaining the privilege of offering 
so-called broad-band personal communications services, or PCS. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dec. 5 auction of 99 broad-band licenses will be by far the largest and 
most important in a series of controversial wireless license sales that began 
this summer and have so far wildly exceeded financial expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 For the government, the December auction is expected to produce a windfall of 
more than $10 billion. For industry powerhouses and daredevil entrepreneurs 
alike, it offers a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of what some 
predict will be a $40-billion-a-year industry early in the next century. For 
consumers, it holds the prospect of go-anywhere communications with which 
people can send and receive phone calls, computer data and perhaps even video 
though devices as small and as portable as a wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are licenses to run the telephone companies of the future . . . and 
build the wireless lane of the information superhighway," said Reed E. Hundt, 
chairman of the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high expectations of the FCC -- and of telephone companies that 
have in some cases revamped their long-term strategies virtually overnight to 
position themselves for PCS -- developing the new services will be no cakewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than half a dozen competing broad-band PCS technologies, and 
several have yet to be fully tested, noted Pekka Soini, director of business 
development for Nokia, a Finnish electronics powerhouse. A few that have been 
tested aren't suitable for use in moving vehicles or have "compromised voice 
quality," said Gary Brush, a product manager at Bellcore, the research arm of 
the regional Bell telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Justice Department is investigating whether some of the 
recent alliances established to bid on PCS licenses could violate federal 
antitrust laws. Many experts think the department ultimately won't take any 
action, but some say the auctions could still trigger a flood of lawsuits by 
disgruntled bidders, further delaying the deployment of PCS. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a high-stakes game with a lot of money on the line, and I don't think 
you can expect people to just walk away and be good losers," said an official 
of one company that plans to bid in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, PCS is undeniably creating enormous excitement and anticipation both 
inside and outside the telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles lawyer Johnnie Cochran, for example, couldn't be busier these days 
with clients such as O.J. Simpson and Michael Jackson. But last month he flew 
to the nation's capital to hear a pitch on PCS, two Washington lawyers say. A 
spokesman for Cochran confirmed he flew to Washington in September but declined 
to discuss the nature of the visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people who have looked at this understand there is a great deal of 
risk associated with an industry that is not yet built and proven, but there 
appears to be a consensus that wireless communications is one of the great 
growth areas of telecommunications over the near future," said a partner at 
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, a major Wall Street merger and 
acquisition law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 It has only recently become clear, however, just how much risk the would-be 
PCS providers will have to assume. The federal government's first wireless 
auction in July, involving so-called narrow-band PCS licenses (to be used for 
paging services) and some specialized interactive TV licenses, was a far more 
expensive affair than anyone had anticipated, drawing more than $800 million in 
bids. 
</P>
<P>
 The rich prices prompted an 11th-hour scramble among potential bidders to 
fortify their financial war chests for the December auction. Just last week, 
the regional Bell telephone companies US West, Bell Atlantic and Nynex 
announced they would team with cellular provider AirTouch Communications in the 
PCS bidding. Earlier this week, long-distance carrier Sprint Corp. and three of 
the nation's largest cable TV companies said they would form a new company, in 
part to bid for PCS licenses. Those contestants are expected to be joined at 
today's filing deadline by AT&T, GTE and many others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes sense to form alliances, because you are going to be competing 
against the likes of AT&T and McCaw Cellular" and other big telecommunications 
firms, said Arun Sarin, senior vice president for strategy and development at 
AirTouch. Sarin added that forming such deep-pocketed alliances "absolutely 
gives us an advantage" over companies without cellular holdings or the 
resources of the regional Bells. "Because we already have 110 million 
(customers), we can buy equipment cheaper and have better (business) 
agreements." 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts say these alliances -- some of which have goals even more 
sweeping than winning a PCS license -- may prove to be unstable over the long 
term. Critics also worry that the combined firepower of telecommunications 
giants will work against federal efforts to encourage small businesses and 
those owned by women and minorities to gain a foothold in PCS. 
</P>
<P>
 When Congress first gave the FCC authority to conduct the auctions, it 
directed the agency to find ways to encourage participation by so-called 
designated entities of small businesses, minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite bidding credits and other advantages, no minorities or women won 
licenses in July's auction. And many industry officials say there is great 
reluctance among some of the regional Bell companies and other wealthy bidders 
to collaborate with designated entities, out of fear they may later face legal 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have two kinds of potential legal risks," said an official of one 
cellular phone company. "Someone may file (a lawsuit) against your 
designated-entity partnership and allege that it is a sham, and the second area 
is that people aren't certain the FCC can legally require you to give a 
preference to women and minorities for PCS spectrum." 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of a diverse PCS ownership pool could thwart development of the 
kind of intense competition that drove down long-distance phone rates following 
the breakup of the AT&T monopoly, some critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the small companies are getting shafted in this whole process," said 
Bruce Kushnick, president of New Networks Institute, a New York-based 
consulting firm and a longtime critic of the regional Bell companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that there is not going to be real competition," he said, 
"just a continuation of the current giant local telephone oligopoly, where 
there is some competition but no price war" that would make wireless services 
affordable to all.

GAINING ALTITUDE; AIRLINES POST STRONG THIRD QUARTER, BUT ANALYSTS SEE MORE 
BUMPS AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning to pull out of its steep dive, the nation's major airlines made an 
impressive amount of money in the third quarter and are positioned to post the 
first annual industrywide profit in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Those gains were underscored Thursday as UAL Corp., the parent company of 
United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines both reported earnings gains of nearly 20% 
in the third quarter. Over the last two weeks, American, Northwest, Alaska, 
Continental and Southwest also have recorded significant profit gains -- in 
some cases quarterly records.  
</P>
<P>
 The improved profits came from painful cost cutting and layoffs, lower fuel 
costs and a healthy nationwide economy. "They are mostly exceeding 
expectations," Merrill Lynch analyst Candace E. Browning said of the carriers' 
results. "More people are flying." 
</P>
<P>
 The stocks of UAL and Delta both closed sharply higher Wednesday. UAL's stock 
jumped $3.75 to $89 a share; Delta rose $2.75 to close at $49.50. 
</P>
<P>
 If the trend continues, the airline industry could finish the year with about 
$1 billion in profits -- a reversal from the $12.7 billion in losses it has 
suffered since its most recent profitable year, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet few in the industry are celebrating. A single strong quarter for the 
industry -- or even a $1-billion collective profit for the year -- hardly makes 
up for the four years that drove venerable carriers such as Pan American 
Airways and Eastern Airlines out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The profit that the industry posts this year is not an indication that it is 
all sunny skies," said Christopher Chiames of the industry's Air Transport 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the spate of good fortune comes at an awkward time for airlines such 
as American and Delta, which are trying to wrest concessions on wages and work 
rules from skeptical unions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must do better and become consistently profitable, and the entire company 
is committed to doing that," Delta Chairman Ronald W. Allen said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta reported third-quarter net income of $186 million, but that included 
$114 million from a one-time accounting charge. Excluding that, Delta's 
earnings from July through September were $72 million, up from $61 million a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta is due to start negotiating with its pilots union in a month. It is 
hoping for a contract that will allow it to meet its goal of saving $2 billion 
on costs by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, American Airlines chief Robert L. Crandall has called for $750 
million worth of work-rule changes that would require employees to work longer 
hours for the same pay. The company last week announced record quarterly 
earnings of $205 million, nearly double those of a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of our earnings, some may ask if the company still needs to change," 
Crandall, chairman of AMR Corp., American's parent, said last week. "The answer 
is that it clearly does." 
</P>
<P>
 UAL, which went through an employee buyout in July in return for wage and 
work-rule concessions for United Airlines, on Thursday reported earnings of 
$178 million, up from $149 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Airline executives view cost reduction as crucial to their long-term survival. 
USAir Group, which spends nearly twice as much to move passengers as does 
low-fare Southwest Airlines, cited high operating costs as the primary reason 
it was one of the few carriers that lost money in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the industry's generally heady profits, analysts and experts say 
debilitating fare wars or rising fuel prices could outweigh the positive 
effects of stepped-up traffic and reduced expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon Bros. analyst Julius Maldutis predicted that the impressive earnings 
"are going to stiffen the resolve of unions," but he said it may be weakened by 
more moderate earnings in the fourth-quarter and for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides labor problems, airlines also face the prospect of both fuel costs and 
taxes rising in 1995, according to Aviation Forecasting & Economics, an 
Arlington, Va.-based consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 And competition among carriers still runs unabated, holding down ticket prices 
even with the increase in passenger traffic. Low-fare upstarts are forcing the 
more expensive long-haul carriers to moderate their prices, said Aviation 
Forecasting's president, Michael K. Lowry. And new competitors are in the 
wings. 
</P>
<P>
 "For your higher-cost, full-service carriers, this is bad news," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are going to see diminished profitability." Wing and a Profit 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's airlines are coming back in 1994 after four years of heavy 
losses. They are posting impressive third-quarter earnings and are on track to 
post their first annual profit since 1989. The profits are a result of cost 
cutting and layoffs, lower fuel costs and a better economy. AIRLINE PROFITS

COMPANY TOWN; DISNEY'S LITVACK TOPS LIST OF UNKNOWN BUT INFLUENTIAL EXECUTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sanford M. Litvack's name is nowhere to be found among the stars, agents and 
moguls who make up the annual lists of Hollywood's most powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 But if anyone bothered to compile a list of the most influential people in the 
entertainment industry who are virtually unknown, Walt Disney Co.'s only senior 
executive vice president would be at or near the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Litvack has quietly assumed the lion's share of responsibilities of Disney 
President Frank G. Wells, who was killed in a helicopter crash last April. His 
ascent went virtually unnoticed, however, because it came as Chairman Michael 
D. Eisner and former studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg waged an extraordinarily 
open battle over Katzenberg's desire for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 With Katzenberg's departure, insiders say Litvack has emerged as something of 
a de facto second in command to the charismatic Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's actually becoming quite indispensable and has taken on a lot of the 
things Frank did. He's frankly taken a tremendous burden off of me," said 
Eisner, who also depended heavily on Litvack while recuperating from quadruple 
bypass surgery this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner stressed that Litvack is one of several executives to whom he has given 
increasing responsibilities in the wake of Wells' death and Katzenberg's 
departure. But he added that Litvack makes his personal "dream team," a 
not-so-subtle dig at Katzenberg's use of the phrase at a splashy news 
conference this month to describe his collaboration with director Steven 
Spielberg and entertainment mogul David Geffen in a new studio venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Litvack also has strong support among Disney board members. Director Irwin E. 
Russell said he has actively urged Eisner to give Litvack more responsibility 
since Wells' death.  
</P>
<P>
 Added director Ray Watson: "He doesn't have the power that comes with being 
president and reporting directly to the board (as Wells did). But he has the 
trust of the chief executive officer and the board of directors." 
</P>
<P>
 Litvack's low-key style has contributed to his anonymity. The executive, who 
goes by the nickname of Sandy and who once worked as the federal government's 
chief trust buster, admits that he doesn't know many people in the 
entertainment industry and isn't active on the Hollywood social circuit. "I can 
make it down a street without having to sign an autograph," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts who follow the company also know little about Litvack. Said Jeffrey 
Logsdon of Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles: "He's invisible to Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
 The executive, who speaks in rapid bursts with a slight accent from his native 
Brooklyn, describes his role of chief of corporate operations as analogous to a 
chief of staff to Eisner, bringing to his attention the things he needs to know 
about and screening from him the less important matters.  
</P>
<P>
 Litvack estimates he's taken on roughly 90% of the tasks occupying Wells' 
time, a logical step since the two were usually working on them together. Among 
Litvack's responsibilities now are negotiating executive contracts and helping 
Eisner revamp Disney's organizational structure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 58-year-old grandfather of three, who is six years older than Eisner, 
agrees that moving into his new role has probably been made easier by his age 
and wide-ranging experience, which has helped blunt potential speculation that 
he is trying to position himself for the top spot someday. Disney director 
Stanley P. Gold adds that Litvack benefits from being "a mature fellow in an 
industry that from time to time has its share of childlike behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he agrees that Litvack's age is a plus, Eisner called it irrelevant. 
He even asked a reporter how old Litvack is, saying he didn't know. But he did 
say that Litvack "isn't into some kind of self-aggrandizement and bowing at 
every opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Litvack has increasingly taken on delicate tasks at Disney, usually overseeing 
negotiations with what his admirers describe as a mix of toughness and 
diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's bright, but combines it with a lot of street savvy and a firmness that 
borders on toughness," said former U.S. Atty. Gen. Benjamin R. Civiletti, 
Litvack's boss when he was assistant attorney general in charge of antitrust in 
the Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Early this year, Litvack was Disney's point man in Europe, working out an 
agreement with banks there to bail out the ailing Euro Disney theme park. He 
and Disney Chief Financial Officer Richard Nanula slogged through three months 
of tense negotiations, walking away from the table at one point before a 
compromise was reached in March. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Litvack also oversees the delicate human resources area, which includes 
policies involving negotiations with union representatives at Disney World and 
Disneyland. Last March, some workers were irked by a Litvack memo saying Disney 
was tightening up on health benefits for retirees due to high costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Litvack has also been dealing with issues surrounding Katzenberg's exit and 
the former studio chief's contention that he is still owed substantial amounts 
in bonus payments. He declined to comment on the issue. Ironically, Litvack 
sued one of his former law firms -- Donovan Leisure Newton & Irvine -- in 1992 
over deferred payments he claimed he was owed in a dispute that has since been 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Litvack has risen quickly since Eisner and Wells lured him away from private 
practice just three years ago to become the company's general counsel. He 
joined with the understanding that his duties would eventually expand beyond 
legal work. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first tasks by Litvack, who handled litigation for Disney while in 
private practice, was to rein in legal costs. In one memo, he complained to 
outside lawyers about everything from photocopy charges to unnecessary parking 
costs. He also showed a sense of humor, attaching a sample time sheet that 
listed billings by partner "M. Mouse" and associate "G. Goofy." 
</P>
<P>
 Litvack and Wells, who was also a lawyer, quickly became close. On Litvack's 
first day on the job, the two made a pact that they were free to interrupt each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said: 'Let's make a deal. You can walk in anytime you want, and I'll walk 
in anytime I want,' " Litvack said.  
</P>
<P>
 He recalled Wells once having to explain to an office guest that "Sandy has 
sneak-in privileges" when Litvack walked in on a meeting.

FORSTMANN LITTLE BUYS ZIFF PUBLISHING EMPIRE; MEDIA: PRICE OF $1.4 BILLION IS 
LESS THAN WHAT HAD REPORTEDLY BEEN SOUGHT. PC MAGAZINE IS AMONG THE PROPERTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ending a widely watched auction of one of the nation's most successful 
publishing companies, Ziff Communications Co. said Thursday that it will sell 
the bulk of its assets -- including the influential computer publications PC 
Magazine and PC Week -- to the New York investment firm Forstmann Little & Co. 
for $1.4 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The price is short of the $2 billion to $3 billion the Ziff family had 
reportedly been seeking for Ziff Communications and its primary operating unit, 
Ziff-Davis Publishing Co., which dominates the computer publishing field and 
has revenue of about $1 billion. But the transaction does not include Ziff's 
trade show business, its database company or a developing on-line information 
service, which are now being auctioned separately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forstmann Little is an ideal home for Ziff-Davis Publishing," said Dirk Ziff, 
who along with his two brothers inherited the company from his recently retired 
father, William B. Ziff Jr. "From the beginning of this process, it has been a 
high priority for us to find a home for Ziff-Davis that will respect its 
traditions, make the most of its innovations and provide a rewarding 
environment for its people." 
</P>
<P>
 Forstmann Little, which has purchased 19 companies for more than $12 billion 
since it was founded in 1978, said it will retain the current management, 
including Ziff-Davis Chairman and Chief Executive Eric Hippeau. It denied any 
intention to sell off pieces of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ziff family and Ziff-Davis management have built a great company which 
dominates its markets and has large growth potential," senior partner Theodore 
J. Forstmann said. "We're looking to own this for a long time and build it into 
a lot bigger company." 
</P>
<P>
 Forstmann Little, which just last week bought a consumer products company from 
Eastman Kodak for $700 million, is acquiring Ziff's magazine operations and 
market research company as well as the piece of Ziff-Davis Interactive that 
provides electronic information about the computer industry to on-line 
information vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziff's eight U.S. magazines had a combined circulation of more than 3.5 
million last year and wield enormous influence in the computer industry.  
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the mid-1980s, the magazines were pioneers in conducting 
sophisticated technical tests of computer products, and their reviews can often 
make or break a new personal computer or modem or CD-ROM drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ziff family will retain a small minority stake in the company. But the 
sale largely ends a remarkable family business in which Bill Ziff Jr. built a 
small consumer magazine company he inherited from his father into a consumer 
magazine powerhouse, then sold almost everything for more than $800 million in 
the early 1980s while suffering from cancer -- then rebuilt the company from 
scratch into the dominant computer publishing firm. 
</P>
<P>
 His sons decided they would rather focus their energy on the family investment 
vehicle, Ziff Bros. Investments. Shortly after their father's retirement 
earlier this year, the sons announced their intention to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been some controversy in the publishing world as to whether the Ziff 
magazines have peaked or whether they still have good growth potential in a 
booming market. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishing companies including European giant Reed Elsivier and New York-based 
K-III Holdings were reportedly nervous about the prospects and decided not to 
pursue Ziff aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 Forstmann will put up $900 million for the purchase, with the major investors 
consisting of 18 to 20 large pension funds. The rest of the money will be 
borrowed, and the deal is expected to close by year's end.

 Microsoft Retools China Strategy: Microsoft has begun courting partners in 
China to help design and launch the Chinese version of its next-generation 
Windows 95 software, signaling a new approach to the world's biggest untapped 
market.The senior-level effort to cultivate ties with software developers, 
industry regulators and the trade press aims also to smooth feathers ruffled 
during the U.S. software giant's blunt-edged entry into China last year. "There 
is no question we've made mistakes here," Microsoft Corp. Vice President 
Charles Stevens said. Company executives acknowledge having alienated key 
electronics ministry officials by relying heavily on managers from archrival 
Taiwan.

 Northrop Grumman Loses Contract Dispute: The Los Angeles-based aerospace 
concern lost its protest of a $398-million Navy award for computer systems that 
went to Intergraph Corp. of Huntsville, Ala., Intergraph said.The U.S. General 
Service Administration's Board of Contract Appeals upheld Intergraph's 
selection for the 12-year contract awarded in July. The deal calls for 
Intergraph to provide computer systems and related equipment used in such 
programs as electronic warfare and underwater surveillance, Intergraph said. 
Northrop Grumman declined to comment, saying it had yet to see the decision.

NATIONSBANK ACQUIRES THREE MORTGAGE LENDERS IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NationsBank Corp., the country's third-largest banking company, announced its 
first foray into California on Thursday with the purchase of three small 
Pasadena-based mortgage banks. 
</P>
<P>
 NationsBank said its home loan unit, NationsBanc Mortgage Corp., bought 
Cypress Financial Corp., Rancho Santa Margarita Mortgage Corp. and RSM Funding 
Corp. Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The three mortgage banks have combined loan portfolios of $1.3 billion and 22 
offices scattered across Southern California and Arizona. By comparison, 
NationsBanc has a portfolio about 35 times that size. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte, N.C.-based NationsBank, a regional powerhouse, has been expanding 
nationwide and has said it wants to move into the West. Its purchase of the 
three Pasadena banks, all of which are owned by private investors, will allow 
it to begin making loans in California for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 A sharp drop in loan demand caused by tepid home sales and the end of the 
refinancing boom has triggered a wave of consolidations and mergers in the 
mortgage banking industry. Large, out-of-state institutions have been pursuing 
many of Southern California's smaller mortgage bankers in the hope of gaining a 
toehold in the vast but depressed market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think Southern California and its real estate market have a bright 
future," said Ellison Clary, a NationsBank spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has not yet decided whether any of the newly acquired offices will 
be closed, Clary said. Those that remain open will be renamed NationsBanc 
Mortgage in January, he said.

FTC TO ASK COURT TO BLOCK SALE OF AMERICAN TOBACCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Trade Commission said Thursday that it would seek a temporary 
federal court order to bar the British firm BAT Industries from acquiring 
American Tobacco Co. from American Brands Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 It said the planned $1-billion acquisition could substantially reduce 
competition in the U.S. market, resulting in higher cigarette prices. 
</P>
<P>
 American Brands announced the planned sale last April. 
</P>
<P>
 The FTC said it would ask the court to stop the sale until the conclusion of 
an administrative trial and any appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 BAT owns Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., based in Louisville, Ky., maker of 
Kool cigarettes and other brands. Stamford, Conn.-based American Tobacco's 
brands include Carlton, Pall Mall and Lucky Strike. 
</P>
<P>
 American's announced sale of its tobacco interests comes as anti-smoking 
sentiment is growing and new laws restricting smoking are being put on the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarette sales volumes are falling. Tobacco sales generated most of the 
company's sales and profits last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other conglomerates are also weighing sales of their tobacco interests or 
moving them into separate corporate units. 
</P>
<P>
 The FTC said it would argue in court that the U.S. cigarette market is highly 
concentrated and largely shielded from new entrants and that a takeover would 
remove one of six major cigarette makers.

SANTA FE TAKEOVER BATTLE BUILDS UP STEAM; RAILROADS: BURLINGTON NORTHERN AGREES 
TO RAISE ITS BID TO ECLIPSE RIVAL OFFER FROM UNION PACIFIC. UP SAYS IT'S 
WILLING TO TOP THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Burlington Northern stepped up its pursuit of the Santa Fe railroad Thursday 
by agreeing to raise its bid for Santa Fe Pacific Corp. to nearly $3.2 billion, 
eclipsing a hostile rival offer from Union Pacific Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Union Pacific spokesman immediately said his company is willing to 
negotiate a "superior" bid to the new Burlington proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman, Gary Schuster, declined to elaborate. But industry observers 
are watching to see if Union Pacific's board raises the stakes still higher at 
its regularly scheduled meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball is definitely in UP's court," said Scott Flower, an analyst at 
Kidder, Peabody & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington and Santa Fe said their sweetened pact calls for Burlington to 
exchange 0.34 of its shares for every share of Santa Fe common stock. The 
exchange ratio was originally 0.27 per share. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Thursday's closing prices, the swap is valued at $17 per Santa Fe 
share, or a total of $3.18 billion. Union Pacific has offered to exchange 0.344 
share of its stock, valued Thursday at $16.73 per Santa Fe share, or $3.13 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 A Burlington-Santa Fe marriage would create the nation's largest railroad, 
with 33,000 miles of track. Santa Fe, based in Schaumburg, Ill., also would 
provide Burlington with a significant presence in California. Burlington, based 
in Ft. Worth, Tex., is a major shipper of coal and grain across the Great 
Plains. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington's revised offer for Santa Fe was not unexpected. In light of Union 
Pacific's bid, major Santa Fe investors had been pressing Burlington to raise 
its price before Burlington's and Santa Fe's shareholders vote on the deal Nov. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's expectation of a higher Burlington offer also was evident 
recently in Santa Fe's stock price, which had traded above the value of 
Burlington's original offer announced June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington agreed to lift its offer after delving further into Santa Fe's 
business and concluding that the potential increase in the combined companies' 
profits is higher than originally thought, Burlington spokesman Richard Russack 
said. "There was more value there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the pressure is on Union Pacific, a Bethlehem, Pa.-based railroad whose 
routes also stretch through California, the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has Burlington matched Union Pacific's offer, but Burlington also is 
thought by many analysts to have a much better chance of getting approval from 
the Interstate Commerce Commission. Santa Fe's board, in fact, rejected Union 
Pacific's offer largely on grounds that it would not get ICC clearance. 
</P>
<P>
 With those two advantages, Burlington "has UP in a tough place," Flower said. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific maintains that its offer can clear antitrust scrutiny. The 
company on Wednesday released a report by a five-member "panel of experts" 
that, not surprisingly, concluded that a Union Pacific-Santa Fe merger "should 
have good prospects of obtaining ICC approval." 
</P>
<P>
 In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Santa Fe rose $1.125 to $15.25 a 
share; Union Pacific fell 87.5 cents to $48.625, and Burlington lost 50 cents 
to $50 a share.UNION PACIFIC COR

 Suit Filed Over Derivatives: Procter & Gamble Co. filed the $130-million 
lawsuit against Bankers Trust New York Corp. over a derivative investment that 
turned into a huge loss for the consumer products giant.The suit, filed in 
federal court in Cincinnati, charges that Bankers Trust did not accurately and 
fully disclose the terms and risks of the investment it proposed to P&G. 
Derivatives are complex hedge investments whose value is based on stocks, 
bonds, commodities, currencies or other financial instruments. Procter & Gamble 
took a $102-million loss to close out two so-called interest rate swaps 
designed by Bankers Trust. The suit also seeks unspecified punitive damages.

 Chevron Wins Pension Ruling: A federal appeals court ruled that 44,000 former 
Gulf Oil Co. workers are not entitled to the money that existed in a pension 
plan when Gulf was purchased by Chevron Corp. in 1984. The U.S. 5th Circuit 
Court of Appeals in New Orleans found that nothing in federal law or the Gulf 
pension plan prohibited Chevron from merging the fund into its own pension plan 
in 1986. The former Gulf employees had claimed they were owed the surplus 
assets, estimated at more than $600 million, that had accumulated before the 
plans were combined.

 AST Posts Loss: As expected, AST Research Inc. announced a fiscal 
first-quarter loss of $39.9 million on revenue of $495.4 million.That contrasts 
with a profit of $8.2 million on revenue of $514.4 million recorded for the 
same period a year ago. Company officials blamed the loss on development and 
production delays and competitive pricing by rivals Compaq and IBM. Along with 
a management restructuring that is under way, Chief Executive Safi Qureshey 
said, the Irvine-based company will try to halve the number of models it sells 
in order to help cut production costs and streamline its marketing operations. 
The company recently announced the layoff of about 500 employees in Orange 
County and the resignations of several key executives.

CONSUMER BRIEFS: PROBE OF CATALOGUE TAXES SOUGHT

<P>
 Six senators have asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether 
mail-order and catalogue companies engage in deceptive advertising by implying 
that no sales taxes apply to goods shipped across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though current law exempts mail-order businesses from collecting sales 
taxes for jurisdictions where they don't have a presence, 46 states and the 
District of Columbia require that a so-called use tax on the purchase be paid 
to the state where the customer lives.Few people know about this law and few 
states enforce it.  
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.) is sponsoring legislation that would require 
mail-order companies to collect taxes on all sales. Bumpers says consumers are 
hurt by such advertising practices because they may be required later to pay 
use taxes on earlier purchases, which would then include interest and penalty 
charges. He also said the ads give an unfair advantage to interstate sellers. 
Bumpers' efforts are supported by the retail store industry but face strong 
opposition from consumers and the direct-mail industry.

30-YEAR, FIXED-RATE MORTGAGES TOP 9% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty-year mortgage rates surpassed 9% this week, the highest level in 2 1/2 
years and a striking reflection of the way higher interest rates throughout the 
economy are making home loans more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing experts, who had expressed surprise at the strength in home buying 
despite the steady rise of interest rates this year, said they are not 
expecting a profound slump now. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages reached 9.03% this week, up from 8.85% last 
week, according to a national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., 
the government agency more often called Freddie Mac. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the 30-year rate exceeded 9% was March 20, 1992; the average 
then stood at 9.03%. Only a year ago, the mortgage rate had hit 6.74%, a 
25-year low. 
</P>
<P>
 For the consumer, the increase represents a significant jump in monthly 
payments. For example, a homeowner with a 30-year $100,000 mortgage at 9% would 
pay $734 a month, excluding taxes and insurance. That's $71 more than a similar 
loan carrying an 8% rate and $140 more than one at 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 On one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial 
rate of 5.88%, up from 5.77% last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The rates do not include the fees known as points.

NEXTEL CLEARS HURDLE TOWARD WIRELESS NETWORK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nextel Communications Inc.'s plan to create a national network providing 
wireless phone, fax and paging services cleared a regulatory hurdle Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rutherford, N.J.-based fleet dispatch company reached an agreement with 
the Justice Department allowing it to acquire some radio licenses from Motorola 
Inc. But Nextel is barred from buying new licenses in markets where it already 
holds similar permits, according to federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 The licenses are currently used by both companies to provide dispatch services 
to cab, trucking and delivery companies. But Nextel, with digital technology 
developed by Motorola, plans to use the "specialized mobile radio" licenses to 
provide cellular-like service, two-way paging, faxing and messaging. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies plan to compete with existing cellular and paging companies as 
well as the providers of the next generation of mobile phone and data services 
known as personal communications services.

 Penalties for Mail-Order Delays: Neiman Marcus Group Inc. has agreed to pay 
$85,000 to settle Federal Trade Commission allegations that it failed to comply 
with the agency's mail-order requirements regarding shipping delays.According 
to the FTC's complaint, the specialty retailer failed to offer consumers the 
option of agreeing to the delay or canceling the order and getting a refund. In 
a separate settlement, Beverly Hills-based Ronco has agreed to pay a $50,000 
penalty for failing to send consumers their merchandise within the time 
indicated in its ads. The manufacturer of food dehydrators and hair products 
was also accused of misrepresenting when consumers could expect delivery of 
their orders. In both settlements, the companies did not admit to any 
wrongdoing.

 Privacy Protection: The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit consumer 
organization, has released a "Privacy Survival Guide" to help consumers take 
control of personal information circulated about them. For a free copy, call 
the clearinghouse at (800) 773-7748.Among the tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Find out what is in your credit report. To protect yourself from being 
harmed from incorrect information, order your credit report once a year and 
make sure it is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Find out if information about your medical history is stored in the Medical 
Information Bureau, the insurance industry data base. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid entering sweepstakes and other contests if you want to stay off 
mailing and telemarketing lists aimed at "opportunity seekers." 
</P>
<P>
 * Be especially protective of your Social Security number. Your credit report, 
bank account and other financial records are usually linked to it.  
</P>
<P>
 * Think twice before joining a "buyer's club" or using a debit, credit or 
check-cashing card when paying for groceries. Your name and address can be 
linked to the list of the purchases created when your groceries are "read" by 
the price scanner.

 Consumer Bill of Rights: President Clinton this week endorsed consumers' 
rights to service in the marketplace -- convenience, courtesy and 
responsiveness to their problems -- as he signed the 1994 proclamation 
establishing National Consumers Week. "Consumer organizations throughout the 
country are thrilled with the President's inclusion of an individual's right to 
fair and considerate service as a part of the national Consumer Bill of 
Rights," said Polly Baca, director of the U.S. Office of Consumer 
Affairs.Clinton's action is the first addition to the Consumer Bill of Rights 
in nearly 20 years.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, President John F. Kennedy delivered a message to Congress outlining 
these basic principles affecting consumers: the right to choice, information 
and safety in the marketplace, and the right to a fair hearing. In 1975, 
President Gerald R. Ford expanded these to include the right to consumer 
education.

O.C. ECONOMY IS GOING NOWHERE FAST, STUDY SAYS; ANNUAL CSUF FORECAST SEES 
GROWTH IN 1995 BUT AT A GLACIALLY SLOW PACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recession that plagued the nation in 1990 and 1991 lingered in Orange 
County for another 2 1/2 years and is still reluctant to leave, according to 
economists at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 In its annual "Orange County Economic Outlook" report, released today, the 
university's Institute for Economic & Environmental Studies foresees 
improvement through the first nine months of 1995, but at a glacially slow 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are lagging behind the national economy instead of leading it," said Anil 
Puri, chairman of the CSUF economics department. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of potential bright spots, including a growing business 
services industry and the county's increasingly important role in international 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Puri said that 1994 is the first year since the recession began in mid-1990 in 
which Orange County employers will, collectively, add more jobs than they trim. 
The projected 0.76% gain, he said, would add 8,500 jobs to local payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Puri forecast a slightly stronger job increase for next year -- 0.85%, or 
9,500 new jobs. Construction, business services, the entertainment and 
amusement industries and government are expected to be the major sectors 
hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are also a few trouble spots, the economist said Thursday, in 
advance of a breakfast meeting today at which 300 local business executives are 
expected to gather to hear the predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman University, which has been issuing yearly Orange County outlook 
reports since 1982, will release its 13th annual forecast in December. UC 
Irvine will follow early next year with a consumer confidence poll, and several 
big banks, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America and First Interstate, will 
issue reports on the Orange County economy as part of the statewide forecasts 
they will release in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses use the forecasts to help with budget and market planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's forecast is a fairly downbeat one, Puri acknowledged 
Thursday. "The recession lasted longer than we expected," he said, "and that 
length, almost 2 1/2 times the national recession, is unprecedented. So we are 
not as positive as we were last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he is not predicting a return to recession, Puri said, the continuing 
decline in defense spending, a shrinking manufacturing base and uncertainty 
about interest rates and inflation mean that "things will continue to be 
difficult in the next few quarters. There are no major engines of growth 
purring along smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the engines that are running, Puri holds out the most hope for 
international trade, citing improving economic conditions worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 A study soon to be released by CSUF's economic institute will show that 45% of 
Orange County's foreign trade is with Pacific Rim nations, Puri said. With the 
exception of Japan, where a growth rate of only 2.5% is expected next year, the 
average expansion among Pacific Rim nations will range from 8% to 11% in 1995, 
Puri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign trade, he said, "provides a significant stimulus to the Orange County 
and regional economies. Nearly one in 10 jobs in Orange County is directly or 
indirectly dependent on international trade." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Orange County businesses exported almost $7 billion worth of goods, 
with computers, electronic equipment and machinery at the top of the list. The 
new study predicts annual growth of about 6% through the end of the century and 
suggests that the average will be closer to 7.5% if the United States ratifies 
the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreement -- a world trade pact that would slash 
tariffs, cut agricultural subsidies and open previously protected foreign 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat offsetting Orange County's growth in foreign trade next year, 
however, will be the continued decline of the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal defense budget trimming began in earnest in 1987, Puri said, and in 
the ensuing six years Orange County military contractors slashed 31,000 jobs 
from their payrolls, 11,000 of them in high-technology fields. 
</P>
<P>
 He is predicting that an additional 19,000 defense-related jobs will be lost 
to the county by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The recently announced decision by Hughes Electronics to close much of its 
Fullerton research campus, lay off about 1,000 of the workers and transfer 
almost 5,000 more to facilities outside Orange County "is just one aspect of 
the continuing job losses" related to defense cutbacks, Puri said. One Sign of 
Recovery 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's economic recovery will lag the national pace next year. But a 
positive sign is that growth in the county's gross product -- the dollar value 
of all goods and services produced during the year -- is expected to start 
outstripping increases in the national gross domestic product by the end of the 
year. Change from previous quarter in U.S. gross domestic product and Orange 
County gross product:

Promising Signs 
</P>
<P>
 Two positive signals for the local economy are in jobs and personal income. 
Hiring will accelerate at the end of this year for a net annual gain of 8,500 
jobs. And the county's total personal income -- a measure of liquid income 
including wages, dividends, interest and Social Security payments -- is 
expected to rise by almost 5% after several lackluster years.

STUDY TRACKS INCREASE IN COMMERCIAL OCCUPANCY RATES; REAL ESTATE: BUSINESSES 
RELATED TO ENTERTAINMENT LEAD RETAIL SECTOR'S IMPROVEMENT, ACCORDING TO GRUBB & 
ELLIS SURVEY.

<P>
 Orange County's commercial real estate market continued to strengthen during 
the third quarter, as both office complexes and industrial centers added 
tenants, according to a study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The office vacancy rate dropped to 18% for the quarter, compared to 19.6% a 
year earlier, said a report by Grubb & Ellis Commercial Real Estate Services in 
Newport Beach. The total amount of office space newly occupied during the first 
nine months of the year was 32.1% more than for the same period last year, the 
real estate brokerage found. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is slowly recovering. We had a good quarter, and I think we 
will do a little better during 1994 than last year," said George Economos, a 
senior vice president with Grubb & Ellis. "With vacancies continuing to drop, 
tenants . . . are now trying to tie up space before low vacancy rates push 
rents up further." 
</P>
<P>
 About 329,757 square feet of office space was taken off the market during the 
quarter, up sharply from 1993's third-quarter total of 187,434 square feet of 
newly leased space. Most of the increase was because of the 200,000-square-foot 
State Compensation Insurance Fund Building in Santa Ana, which was completed 
and 75% leased during the quarter, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 The retail sector showed significant improvement as well, mostly from 
entertainment-oriented retailers, such as theaters, restaurants and bookstores, 
the study found.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a rush in retail development in Orange County," said John 
Davidson, a broker with Grubb & Ellis. "That's mostly due to a real 
entertainment push by developers with the new movie theaters. The food users 
are also being more inventive, hooking up with theaters."  
</P>
<P>
 New retail space is the only commercial construction going on now in the 
county, according to Grubb & Ellis, with a total of 3.2 million square feet 
being built, mostly in south Orange County. Of the county's 334 shopping 
centers with more than 50,000 square feet of space, 201 had vacancy rates of 
less than 5% during the third quarter, the study found, and 93 centers had no 
vacancies at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Countywide, the vacancy rate for retail space stood at 6.1%, up from 5.2% for 
the third quarter last year. The increase was mostly because of the fast pace 
of new construction, the report said. Less Space Available  
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County commercial real estate market improved during the third 
quarter, as more tenants moved into office, retail and industrial centers.

OUT-OF-SHAPE AST POSTS A $39.9-MILLION LOSS; COMPUTERS: THE FIRST-QUARTER 
FIGURES ARE CAUSING ANALYSTS TO WONDER IF THE COMPANY IS FALLING BEHIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The difficulties AST Research Inc. has had in matching its strategy with its 
continual growth were apparent Thursday as the personal-computer maker posted 
$39.9 million in first-quarter losses on revenues of $495.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, equal to $1.23 a share, contrasts with a profit of $8.2 million, 26 
cents per share, on revenues of $514.4 million during the similar period last 
fiscal year. The results were in line with predictions AST had made earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officers blamed the losses on production delays and competitive 
pricing by rivals Compaq Computer Co. and IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with an ongoing management restructuring, Chief Executive Safi Qureshey 
said Wednesday that the company will decrease the number of PC models it sells 
by half to help it cut production costs and streamline its marketing. For 
example, AST now sells computers with 10 types of hard disk drives, but by 
February that will be reduced to three, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Qureshey also defended AST's decision to buy Tandy Corp.'s manufacturing 
operations in Fort Worth, Tex., last year, despite criticism that the company 
hasn't integrated the plant into the rest of its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tandy decision was a very bold move, and there are always these sorts of 
(integration) issues that you have to go through after you buy a new plant," 
Qureshey said. AST gained engineers, patents and a significant amount of sales 
from the purchase, he said. "We believed it was the right move, and we still 
believe so." 
</P>
<P>
 But two weeks ago, AST announced plans to terminate about 500 Orange County 
workers, shut its Fountain Valley manufacturing facility and transfer the work 
to Taiwan. Also, the Irvine-based company has had three key vice presidents 
resign since June. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's poor financial performance has left industry analysts and former 
employees worried whether Qureshey has fumbled the company's expansion 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they allege, senior managers and the company's board are now just 
reacting to competitors' price cuts instead of fighting back with innovative 
products of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're looking at a lot of bread and butter issues, just getting more 
products out and coordinating their marketing," said Mike McGuire, an analyst 
at Dataquest, a research firm in San Jose. "I'm still uncertain as to 'what is 
AST?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly they need to get their manufacturing and forecasting and production 
cycles in much better shape than they are now." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Chu, AST's managing director for Asia until joining rival Dell Computer 
Corp. three months ago, said that AST suffers from a lack of managerial 
coordination among its engineers, production managers and marketers. "The 
different departments weren't moving at the same pace," he said. "It wasn't 
just a single department, it was throughout the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Chu and others said the loss of the three top executives and other senior 
managers will only make President Jim Schraith's job more difficult. He and 
Qureshey now face pressure from investors to demonstrate that AST's acquisition 
of Tandy's plant in Texas will help company profits by mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is that this business has been growing rapidly in the last two to 
three years, and AST is losing momentum while others have been gaining," said 
Stephen Dube, an analyst at Wasserstein Parella Securities Inc. in New York. 
"If AST doesn't click into gear," he said, "they'll lose out at an accelerating 
rate" as distributors seek more reliable suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 AST's news wasn't all bad -- its international revenues increased 7% during 
the quarter, with its strongest gains in Europe. Overall, AST said it shipped 
309,000 computers during the three-month period, and company officials have 
been meeting with vendors and suppliers to ensure smoother deliveries during 
the current quarter, traditionally one of the busiest sales periods. 
</P>
<P>
 AST's strategy since the late 1980s has resembled that of Japanese auto makers 
the decade before -- concentrating on product quality and customer service 
without sinking much money and effort into the development of expensive 
technological advances. The decision to buy the Tandy plant and others was 
meant to be an extension of that strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, analysts hailed the Tandy acquisition as a step that would 
enhance AST's ability to grow. For its part, AST was making rosy predictions 
about its 316,000-square-foot plant as recently as August. A month later, the 
company began to suggest its financial weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio of vice presidents who left AST had been hired over the previous 18 
months. They were brought in specifically to help AST integrate its far-flung 
operations, officials said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent departure was that of James Forquer, vice president of 
worldwide operations, who left last week. Forquer had formerly been at Apple 
Computer. Another Apple vet, Gerald Devlin, former AST vice president of sales 
in the Americas, left in June. And Howard Elias, who joined AST in June, 1993, 
after 17 years at Tandy Corp., left for Digital Equipment Corp. three months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of new managers -- including Kirby Coryell and Robert Parmalee, who 
are splitting Forquer's duties, and Chet Pribonic, heading AST's notebook 
computer business unit -- must do a better job integrating AST's engineering 
with its other departments, said several former employees who asked their names 
not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the earlier days the company was able to innovate using the standard parts 
that everybody else was getting too," said a former engineering employee. "Now 
they're not doing that, and they're turning into more of a clone company 
instead of becoming less of one." 
</P>
<P>
 Innovation is becoming more difficult as competitors grow in size and gain 
more clout with suppliers like Intel Corp., which dominates the market for 
microprocessor chips. Bruce Edwards, AST's chief financial officer, told a 
meeting of stock analysts earlier this month that AST was having trouble with 
parts it bought from Intel's rival Cyrix Corp. Intel may have made it difficult 
for AST buy Intel chips as punishment for seeking its rivals' products, 
analysts suggest . 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its high-tech aura, much of the PC industry involves cookie-cutter 
manufacturing and matching products to customer demand. AST needs to show it 
can quickly adapt, said Ian Gilson, an analyst with the investment banking firm 
Van Kasper & Co. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to change a marketing strategy over a short period of 
time," Gilson said. "Everybody who tries to do it gets a lot of complaints from 
people in their (sales) channel. Nobody knows where they stand, how easy it 
will be for them to get their machines in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock was up 69 cents to close at $12.125 on Nasdaq.

AMEX REVIEWING ITS LISTING OF ANAHEIM-BASED STATORDYNE; STOCK MARKET: COMPANY 
REPORTS $302,000 IN CAPITAL, BELOW $1 MILLION MINIMUM REQUIRED BY THE AMERICAN 
STOCK EXCHANGE. 
</P>

<P>
 Statordyne Corp. said Thursday that the American Stock Exchange is reviewing 
whether to delist the company for not having sufficient capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim-based company, which makes electrical power enhancement systems, 
reported only $302,000 in capital as of June 30, the end of its fiscal 
year.Because AMEX requires minimum capital of $1 million to list a company's 
stock, Statordyne could be dropped by the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Statordyne is one of several spinoffs of Conversion Industries of Pasadena, a 
company that AMEX recently delisted because of disclosure issues. Statordyne 
went public in June, 1993, with a $2.8-million securities offering priced at $3 
a share. The stock has declined ever since, closing Thursday at $2.125 a share, 
down 37 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 30, the company reported that it lost $2.1 million, or 46 cents a 
share, for its fiscal year ended June 30. That compared to a loss of $698,510, 
or 21 cents a share, for the previous 12 months. Annual revenue totaled 
$405,328. The company did not report any revenue for fiscal 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Statordyne said Thursday that it has received a $5.1-million order 
for its power systems, boosting its backlog to $7.8 million. Citing the new 
order, a company spokesman expressed confidence in Statordyne's future as a 
publicly traded company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to show AMEX our business plan through 1995. We have a strong 
case to present," spokesman Lance Ignon said. "Look what happened today -- we 
tripled our product backlog with one order. That's a tremendous endorsement. If 
we can show AMEX our future looks good, they aren't going to delist us."  
</P>
<P>
 Tom Mariam, a spokesman for the stock exchange, said he could not comment.

ED ROLLINS' HARD ROAD TO REDEMPTION; POLITICS: THE GOP CAMPAIGN COMMANDO'S 
LOOSE TONGUE COST HIM DEARLY. BUT, LIKE A PHOENIX, HE'S BACK -- AND WORKING 
WITH FIVE CANDIDATES.

<P>
 He's back. He's busy. And he wants redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesser operatives might have crumbled after such a spectacular collision with 
ignominy. They might have shriveled up and died, metaphorically anyway, to find 
themselves consigned to the status of a David Letterman joke. Saddled with 
labels like "liar" and "racist" -- his own dark vision of how his post-New 
Jersey obituary might read -- others might have limped off to the Sahara of 
corporate communications, the political junkie's notion of hell itself. 
</P>
<P>
 But not Ed Rollins. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who in 1993 helped deliver New Jersey to Republican gubernatorial 
candidate Christine Todd Whitman is determined that this year, he will have a 
hand in turning over a seat in the U.S. Senate from California to first-term 
Republican congressman Mike Huffington. At the same time, he's juggling four 
other GOP candidates in as many states. 
</P>
<P>
 He has resolved to restore his reputation, and to resurrect himself as the 
Republican party's top non-elected vote-getter -- one of the few in his party, 
as he puts it, "who knows the game now." 
</P>
<P>
 Except that after the votes are counted -- after, if Rollins' strategy holds 
true, Huffington defeats Democratic incumbent Dianne Feinstein -- don't look 
for Rollins to attend too many media breakfasts. That was how he got in trouble 
last time, boasting that the Whitman campaign had paid out half a million 
dollars to African American clergy and elected officials to help limit the 
turnout of predominantly Democratic black voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "My little crisis" is how Rollins characterizes this particular debacle, or 
sometimes "my little firestorm." His remarks the week after Whitman's big win 
landed him in front of a grand jury, produced a two-month inquiry by the FBI 
and saw him sacked from his weekly stint as a political analyst for the "Today" 
show. The grand jury and the FBI exonerated him; "Today" did not invite him 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Huffingtons did. Never mind that Gov. Whitman has not spoken to 
Rollins since his little crisis. The freshman congressman and his wife 
immediately called Rollins to commiserate. They took him to dinner, and over 
the entree, mentioned that one day soon, they might be needing his help. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very kind," Rollins remembered. Quietly, he took over as the 
Huffingtons' chief strategist in early June. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wistfulness is not generally a quality associated with someone who looks just 
like one of Santa's elves. Gazing out his one small window at the 
Huffington-for-Senate headquarters in Costa Mesa, Rollins -- short, round and 
bearded -- sounded momentarily pensive as he mused, "If I could have that one 
paragraph back. . . . If I could answer the same question and have most of the 
facts stay the same. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 He shook his head. He was flush with bravado when the words leaped out, he 
said. Somehow, "my mouth and my brain were not connected." It was a "sin of 
arrogance," his own pet phrase for Rollinsgate, and it cost him. Big time. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that this was the first time his loose tongue had been his undoing. 
Rollins is known as a guy who can rattle off a catchy quote almost before the 
question is finished. But sometimes, as his occasional friend and frequent 
sparring partner James Carville observed, "he talks too much." In 1989, for 
example, Rollins lost his job as head of the National Republican Congressional 
Committee after he urged GOP candidates to distance themselves from George 
Bush. Rollins later retaliated by marketing his services to independent 
presidential candidate Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the New Jersey gaffe so shook Rollins that he sought solace in the 
Catholic Church, from which he had been estranged off and on for decades. 
Experienced political hands contended that the racial overtones of Rollins' 
comments about New Jersey were so damaging that he was washed up in politics 
forever. But Rollins was not so sure. Soon enough, his desire for redemption 
saw him managing five campaigns in the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 But if he was starting to look like the Lazarus of American political 
consultants -- risen again -- this was not an image the Feinstein camp was 
about to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't risen yet," snapped Kam Kuwata, Feinstein's campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics is nothing if not nasty. But even in politics, theoretically, there 
are some minimal standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in my life that I know of, I caused pain and anguish to 
others," Rollins said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, though, "I got her elected." 
</P>
<P>
 And when the votes are in, so to speak, for a political consultant that's what 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The political consultant is judged by only one yardstick: winning," said 
Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia government professor who wrote "The Rise 
of Political Consultants" (Basic Books, 1981). "It's a commentary on our system 
when we value winning more than we do ethics." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the implication that Whitman's campaign strategists might have tried to 
pay black leaders not to turn out in the race against Jim Florio is a 
reflection of "the gutter level at which politics is conducted," charged 
University of Southern California law professor Susan Estrich, one of the 
primary architects of Michael Dukakis' failed 1988 presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you're going to play in the gutter," Estrich continued, "Ed's a good 
gutter player." 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins, she said, "does what he has to do to win. And what he has to do makes 
me want to take a shower." 
</P>
<P>
 Carville, who ran Bill Clinton's march to the White House in 1992 and who 
managed Florio's losing campaign in New Jersey in 1993, was less harsh. One 
post-New Jersey explanation that Rollins offered was that he had shot his mouth 
off just to tweak Carville. His arch-rival had kept him up so many nights, it 
was almost as if he wanted to make him miss one night of sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 But in their up-and-down relationship, that was then. Just last weekend, 
Rollins and Carville were back at it, jousting on "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good guy who had a bad day," Carville said. "Well, it was an awful 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carville and Rollins are master players in that merry band of political 
rogues, the consultants, a species that grows in influence with each election. 
Their job is to package candidates -- and to persuade the public to believe 
every single glowing half-truth they manufacture to accompany those candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to rebound is hard-wired into their profession. Besides, Sabato 
said, "There are so many scandals concerning the candidates, who has time for 
the scandals of the political consultants? The public is scandal-saturated -- 
and the half-life of any scandal is very short." 
</P>
<P>
 While insisting that "the role that consultants have is so misunderstood," 
Rollins conceded that their antics often "add to the cynicism that Americans 
have about politics." He said he laments the philosophical mushiness of both 
major political parties, and bemoans the fact that a candidate's "message" has 
been reduced to "30 seconds on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, said the man who -- with Jim Baker -- takes credit for 
engineering Ronald Reagan's 49-state triumph in 1984, "In the final analysis, 
you've got to play the game the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 In New Jersey, Rollins took particular joy in beating "the White House team." 
The race was closely watched, in large part because of the consultants who were 
running it. "It became Rollins and Carville," Rollins said, "not Whitman and 
Florio." 
</P>
<P>
 By suggesting after the election that African American ministers and 
officeholders might be influenced by payoffs, Rollins did "an awful thing," 
Carville said -- but that isn't enough to drum him out of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Criminality finishes off careers, that kind of stuff. That's for candidates," 
Carville said. "He wasn't convicted of anything."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, after the New Jersey firestorm, "I didn't want to do any more races," 
Rollins said. "Even though it was a self-inflicted wound, I don't like the 
public part of it. That was very public." 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins was radioactive, and he said he tried to steer away the first 
candidates who called him after the New Jersey election. When George R. 
Nethercutt Jr. telephoned to say he was thinking of challenging House Speaker 
Thomas Foley in Spokane, Rollins said, " 'George, the last thing you need is 
me,' " Rollins recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rollins did take on the Nethercutt race, and recent polls show that Foley 
is in big trouble. Rollins is also serving as consultant to Long Island 
hide-a-bed heiress Bernadette Castro, the Republican challenger to Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan in New York. Another 1994 election client is Bruce Benson, 
whose race against Democratic Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado was looking good until 
word leaked out that Benson had been arrested for drunk driving and was 
embroiled in a sex scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Texas, Rollins is counseling comptroller candidate Teresa Doggett, an 
African American. Rollins also advised another African American candidate, Joe 
Watkins, who was defeated in the primary in his bid for Pennsylvania's 
Republican Senate nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 To Rollins, who in his youthful days as a Democrat was an early supporter of 
California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, these assignments prove that many 
African American candidates -- and, presumably, voters -- are willing to look 
beyond his utterances about New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, said Mayor Elihu Harris of Oakland, one of California's largest blocks 
of urban black voters. Black voters were "victimized" by Rollins' tactics in 
New Jersey, Harris said, and forgiveness may not be so swift. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic theologian Michael Novak, who holds the George Frederick Jewett chair 
in religion and public policy at the American Enterprise Institute in 
Washington, said Rollins' own admission that he had bent the truth by 
"repeating rumors" in New Jersey should not be easily dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some sins that have a dimension we don't give enough credibility 
to," Novak said. "It's not just what you did to yourself, but what you've done 
to other people, and especially when it comes to truth. You can't get an 
untruth back. I think this is why the black ministers were so mad at Rollins." 
</P>
<P>
 But if there's damage, Novak said, "it's also to the system. To discredit the 
system seems triply bad." 
</P>
<P>
 For Rollins, it seems, the tainting that Novak and others refer to hurts the 
most. "The connotations of dirt and sleaze are what bother me," Rollins said 
over lunch recently. "It's not who I am. It's not who I want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Who he is, is a 51-year-old former boxer who did not take off his gloves until 
he had lost too many teeth to count -- and until finally, just once, he 
couldn't spring back from the mat. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins grew up in Vallejo, Calif., and did not part with what he maintains 
are firmly blue-collar Democratic roots until he fell under the spell of Ronald 
Reagan in the 1960s. But even after he followed Reagan to Washington, working 
in the White House and then managing the 1984 reelection campaign, he remained 
a spiritual Californian. In fact, said Sherrie Rollins, her husband's ties to 
his native state were what made the Huffington campaign so attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing he needed was another campaign," she said. "The reason he did 
California was because it was California." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the fact that Huffington was waging a come-from-behind fight added 
to Rollins' interest, as did the apparently endless amount of money Huffington 
was spending. Estrich, for one, said it is common for a consultant to charge 
15% of the total amount spent on a campaign. At last count, Huffington's bid 
for the Senate was expected to cost about $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sherrie Rollins, who is 36 and a senior vice president of ABC in New York, 
said she worried that her husband might be overextending himself. Twelve years 
ago, Ed Rollins was nearly killed by a stroke, the apparent legacy of a head 
injury from boxing. Now, she said, "I really was worried about him physically 
doing it. I kept saying, 'How could you put one more thing on your plate when 
you're spread so thin as it is?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Rollinses met while she was working in the Bush White House, a job she 
left when her husband signed on -- briefly -- to work with Ross Perot in 1992. 
It was her first marriage; he had a brief marriage years before. 
</P>
<P>
 From the "New Jersey incident," as she refers to it, she learned that "he puts 
everything in perspective. His attitude was, at least one of his dogs didn't 
die. Not to mention his wife." She laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 The fallout from New Jersey also sent Ed Rollins back to church. After decades 
of religious ambivalence -- occasionally going back to church, but leaving 
again just as quickly -- he has missed only three Sundays in church in the last 
year, Sherrie Rollins said. For the first time since his boyhood, Rollins 
declared, "I am now a practicing Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
 But many members of his faith might argue that penitence constitutes more than 
a few weeks of ugly press accounts. Sinners, said theologian Novak, must pay a 
price. "That begins with penitence," he said, and involves "mortification and 
rethinking (of the sin), and that means publicly and privately being 
questioned." 
</P>
<P>
 For Rollins, a victory in California would represent more than just a 
comeback. This time, he hopes it will bring a resurrection of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 But cruising the freeway back to Huffington headquarters, Rollins allowed that 
it may be time to do now what many people assumed he would do a year ago: Walk 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Sherrie would like to start a family, he said, and so after this 
election he plans to move from suburban Washington to New York to be with her 
full-time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is my last round," he volunteered. "I think I have kind of 
really gotten my fill of it this time." 
</P>
<P>
 But even campaign commando Ed Rollins seems unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey notwithstanding, he said, "This is probably what I do best."

AROUND TOWN: IS THERE A GHOST OF A CHANCE HE'S RIGHT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My interview with the vampire takes place in a peach-colored house on a 
tree-shaded street in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Just home, sweet home, save for the doormat that goes "Boooo!" when stepped 
upon. But, it is almost Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who lives here, however, is no average suburbanite. The first clue? A 
mop of improbably blue-black hair, which he swears is home-grown. Wiglike, it 
all but obscures his green eyes. Sea-green, he explains: "All Gorfs had 
sea-green eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the canine teeth (his own, he swears), long and pointy. And 
that voice: Is it British or ghoulish? 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say I'm a cross between Vincent Price and Elvis Presley," says 
Albert Ryan -- Sir Albert, if you will. 
</P>
<P>
 He's entitled to a title, he claims, as a descendant of "Lord Gorf," an Irish 
nobleman burned at the stake in 1706 for Satanic savagery. 
</P>
<P>
 "He supposedly tortured and murdered people and drank their blood -- men, 
women and children. Very vicious. We don't like to talk about it," says Sir 
Albert, proceeding to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 As he tells it, his Gorf ancestor had a fancy burial in Tipperary but, two 
years later, was exhumed by a pair of grave robbers. The corpse "bolted upright 
in his coffin and opened his eyes, which blazed like live coals." His 
horrifying scream, and the fresh blood on his face and hands, sent the 
intruders fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
 "One died of a heart attack," Ryan says, and "the other died in an asylum." 
Throughout the village, people turned up dead with small bite marks on their 
throats and wrists. 
</P>
<P>
 It was on Halloween about 40 years ago that 8-year-old Albert was told by his 
Irish-born parents of this legacy. He hoped they were joking; still, he'd had 
his suspicions. "All the males in the family seemed to have large canine teeth. 
My father's literally stuck out of his mouth." And his Irish uncle was a 
"dead-ringer (so to speak) for Bela Lugosi." 
</P>
<P>
 It was inevitable he would search for his roots in Ireland. "I found out it 
was no joke," he says. He makes vague reference to some library documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Always, he was bent on being an actor and, like bats to a belfry, was drawn to 
macabre and sinister roles, beginning at Bishop Montgomery High in Torrance, 
where he played the homicidal maniac in "Arsenic and Old Lace." Perhaps, he 
muses, he was a bit weird even then. 
</P>
<P>
 On Irish and British stages, he gravitated to ghostly roles. Perhaps it was 
only a short leap into a second profession: vampirologist and ghoulologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very secret branch of parapsychology," he explains. So secret, he 
adds, that, in all of California, there are but five vampirologists. As demand 
is limited, he has a day job as a speech therapist at a facility for the 
developmentally disabled. Vampires preferring darkness, vampirology is no 
9-to-5 gig. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his clients, he mentions assorted police departments, Metropol and 
Scotland Yard. Could we, uh, verify that? "Oh, no. It's very secretive. Nobody 
will divulge any knowledge of having anything to do with it. . . . They'll say, 
'We don't know you, we never had this conversation, it never happened. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 He dismisses the skeptical as being as unenlightened as those who don't 
believe in UFOs. Deadpan, he'll tell you, "I have myself authenticated 40 
vampire cases," among them two "terrifying close encounters" that convinced him 
of the existence of blood-sucking vampires and flesh-nibbling ghouls. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how does a vampirologist do his thing? Well, he explains, a hunt 
typically begins with the spotting of a tombstone riddled with holes. Should a 
vampire lie below, flowers placed there will wilt at once. "And there will be 
an aura. If you happen to be psychic, which I am, you will detect it 
immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan describes a memorable sighting, that of Ubour the vampire in Bulgaria: 
"We saw the vampire literally rise up out of the grave, jellylike, bloated, its 
skin like leather, its eyes bulging out of its head. And it had only one 
nostril. It glided across the ground. There were spurts of hair sticking out of 
his head. It was ghastly, absolutely ghastly." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, lest you think Ryan has been nipping at the elderberry wine, he wishes to 
go on record: "I don't believe somebody bites somebody and turns them into a 
vampire." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His sister, Marie, who lives with him, says: "I think he's done some of these 
things." The police investigations? "I'll be honest, I don't know."  
</P>
<P>
 The vampirology? "I look at every bit of that very lightheartedly . . . but 
there are a lot of things in the world you can't explain." 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible Sir Albert's vampire character and reality have somehow fused 
in his mind? 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope not," Marie Ryan says. 
</P>
<P>
 To become a vampire, "You must lead a very evil and wicked life and die in an 
unredemptive state," Ryan says. In short, one makes a pact with the devil to 
become "a full-fledged vampire in good standing." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, L.A. has survived riot, floods, quakes. Are vampires next? "There's more 
reason than you can imagine to be afraid," Ryan says. "I've investigated 12 
cases of absolute vampirism in 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he adds, vampires "seek blood indiscriminately," selecting victims at 
random. 
</P>
<P>
 His snooping, he'll tell you, has brought threats on his life. "There are 
sects, cults of vampires, we know now." Once, a voodoo doll appeared on his 
doorstep. There was a phone threat in a voice that "I knew was not human." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 OK, we've got to ask: How about Tom Cruise in that other "Interview With the 
Vampire"? "He really stumped me," says Ryan, who saw an advance screening 
hosted by the Count Dracula Society. "He does amazingly well." And the film? 
"One side of me liked it -- the dark side." (Not as scary, though, as his 
all-time favorite, a low-budget '60s thriller, "Carnival of Souls.") 
</P>
<P>
 As for his lighter side, there's Lord Gorf, the Irish vampire. In a sparkly 
green cape, he becomes a cartoon vampire, entertaining at parties and charity 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children love me." 
</P>
<P>
 But he's a bachelor vampire. "I've come close, but usually when they find out 
my background, well, 'It's been nice knowing you. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 Have you been putting us on, Sir Albert? Well, "Of course a lot of this is 
handed down. . . ." And it's a long way to Tipperary.

BAD HEIR WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROY RIVENBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles, Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, Duke of Cornwall, Duke of 
Rothesay, Earl of Plumbing and Baron of Those Little Plastic Things on the Ends 
of Shoelaces, Duke of Earl and Great Steward of Chee-tos, arrives in L.A. on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, actually, Charles gets here Monday, but there wasn't enough room on the 
plane for his full title, so it arrives Tuesday on a separate flight. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, some people are worried that Britain's heir to the throne is so 
booked with black-tie dinners and boring tete-a-tetes with dignitaries that he 
won't get to experience the real Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to fear. We've dreamed up a five-day itinerary designed to bring ultimate 
embarrassment and disgrace to the Royal Family. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because we're The Media, of course. Day One 
</P>
<P>
 * Questioned by lawyers as a potential juror in the O.J. Simpson case. 
Dismissed after London tabloid releases photos of Princess Di frolicking in the 
nude with Judge Lance Ito during trip to France. 
</P>
<P>
 * Poses in new advertisement for the Gap: "His Royal Highness wears khakis." 
</P>
<P>
 * Tea with Oliver Stone, then rescues passengers aboard doomed MTA bus 
programmed to explode if it goes slower than 50 m.p.h. Day Two 
</P>
<P>
 * Announces at news conference that he is giving up watercolor painting and 
henceforth wishes to be called "the prince formerly known as artist." 
</P>
<P>
 * Visits Disneyland, tries to claim the castle for Mother England. Later 
confers with Dumbo about "the ear thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * Appears on "Love Connection" under the alias "Chucky W." Wins date to Viper 
Room. Day Three 
</P>
<P>
 * Arrested for hijacking Queen Mary and taking it on harbor joy ride. News 
reporters checking rumors of the royal incarceration call jail officials to 
ask, "Do you have Prince Charles in the can?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Makes intimate phone calls to Heidi Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>
 * In an effort to "mix with the common people," joins a group of graffiti 
taggers defacing freeway signs. When the group is later caught, His Almost 
Majesty's mum is ordered to pay cleanup costs for her son's handiwork. Day Four 
</P>
<P>
 * Announces that he will marry Roseanne because "neither of us has a last 
name." 
</P>
<P>
 * Appears on "Leeza Gibbons" talk show for the topic "Men who wear plaid 
skirts." 
</P>
<P>
 * Hosts royal banquet with Larry King, Rodney King, Don King, Carole King, the 
Lion King, Billie Jean King and the L.A. Kings. Afterward, in what is billed as 
a "major public policy address," denounces Rose Bowl officials for "always 
having a parade queen, but never a king." Day Five 
</P>
<P>
 * Tours wax museum in Buena Park, remolds Di's face to look like Camilla 
Parker-Bowles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Receives unexpected challenge to throne when Mike Huffington abruptly moves 
to England and buys TV ads attacking Charles as "a career monarch who will do 
anything to stay in the Royal Family." 
</P>
<P>
 * Driving on left side of the road, causes massive pileup on Santa Monica 
Freeway. Transported to County-USC Medical Center, where doctors -- in a 
pre-Proposition 187 frenzy -- deport him for not having a green card. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * Doug Adrianson, Ann Harrison, Linda Sator Harrison, Bea Maxwell and Heather 
Stewart contributed to this fantasy.

THE GOODS; WHEN IT'S PRIME TIME; DOES YOUR CAR NEED A PAINT JOB? BEFORE YOU 
SCRATCH THE SURFACE, KNOW THE COSTS AND HAZARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY LIBMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You're thinking about having your old car painted and are puzzled about 
whether it's worth it and how much to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you've got a new model and are confused by talk about its expensive, 
difficult-to-match paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about car painting can be difficult: Are higher- priced jobs notably 
better than cheaper ones? Does a paint job increase a car's value? 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing a Paint Shop: To check out a shop's work, visit and watch cars being 
painted, says James Coray of Hill & Vaughn, a classic car restoration firm in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask to see one of their repaints," Coray says. "You can see if the paint is 
smooth and shiny or pitted like the skin of an orange. If the paint is pitted, 
the application was done very poorly." 
</P>
<P>
 Watch how cars are prepared for painting. Some low-priced firms may cut 
corners, says Barry Meguiar, chairman of Irvine-based Meguiar's Inc., which 
makes waxes and other car surface products. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some may not prep the surface completely and may leave trace amounts of wax 
and silicone on the finish, which prevent paints from completely adhering to 
the surface. After a few months or years, paint will start shrinking and 
cracking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another factor is stripping (taping) off the trim and door jams. If you don't 
strip properly, paint will be on the chrome, trim, rubber, key locks and door 
handles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many car dealers don't have their own body shops," Meguiar adds. "They farm 
work out to a body shop they can trust. If someone is doing a lot of paint work 
for a car dealer, it's probably a good sign they can be trusted." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Price Ranges: At the lower end, prices are $149.95 to $399.95 at Earl Scheib 
Auto Painting shops and range from about $189 to $600 at Maaco Auto Painting & 
Bodyworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some medium-priced shops charge $800 to $900, says David Sanger, owner of 
Brought Back Bugs, a San Diego service and restoration company for Volkswagens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Depending on the color you select, how you maintain the paint job and how 
much you leave it in the sun and rain, you could pretty much count on four to 
seven years of decent paint life out of an $800 to $900 job." 
</P>
<P>
 A high-quality, high-priced facility will paint the outside of any medium-size 
car for $2,400 to $4,800, Sanger says. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't aim for a job that looks like a show car. That's a $15,000 to $20,000 
paint job, Coray says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing Cheap: "Generally if you go to a lower-priced shop and the paint job 
is appealing to the eye and you pay for additional catalysts and hardeners, you 
should be OK," says Tony Jones, coordinator of the automotive collision repair 
department at Cypress College in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time I talk to someone, I recommend that they opt for the higher-end 
prices at the mass production paint shops. The additional additives give more 
durability to paint. And the increased dollars you're paying normally aren't 
that great." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About Color: Those who seek value through a long-lasting finish will probably 
choose a light color, Meguiar says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you only want something that looks decent and won't embarrass you, a light 
color is a lot more forgiving. It doesn't show oxidation, light scratches or 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're looking for something you can be proud of, you probably want a 
darker color. The darker the color, the more the luster. But dark colors take 
more effort and time to keep up and require a bigger decision on what type of 
finish you use and who'll do the painting." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 When to Paint: If you want to increase the resale value of the car, you may 
spend more on painting than if the purpose is to keep the car, Meguiar says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's got paint problems but otherwise is in good shape, nothing will add 
to the resale value as much as appearance," he says. "Buying a car is an 
emotional thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual for painting to add thousands of dollars to the value of a 
luxury car, but you can't expect that kind of increase with, say, a 
Volkswagen." 
</P>
<P>
 Before investing in a car you are selling, "Look in the newspaper," Sanger 
says. "Go look at cars. Ask people what they are selling for. Then calculate 
how much a paint job would increase the value of your car." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Cars / New Colors: New cars receive a base of pigmented paint and a 
clear-coated cover to protect the base from ultra violet rays and contaminants, 
Meguiar says. 
</P>
<P>
 Most colors are easy to match, but metallic surfaces are difficult, Sanger 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have problems with the way metallics flow because they are little chunks 
of fleck material, and you have to put that on properly," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only other jobs that high-quality facilities will tell you they have 
trouble with will be the three-stage, pearl paint job, paint with graphics 
underneath and other custom jobs," Sanger says. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Word: Recent environmental laws have increased the cost of auto painting, 
says Robert Ernst, research coordinator for I-Car Tech Center, a nonprofit 
training group for auto collision repair in Rolling Meadows, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, Los Angeles and Orange counties began to regulate the 
amount of volatile organic compounds that can be released into the atmosphere 
as paint dries, Ernst says. As a result, primer, paint and top coating had to 
be reformulated. 
</P>
<P>
 Laws for the disposal of paint and other materials were also changed, Ernst 
says. "That is considered hazardous waste. You can't dump it on the ground or 
pour it down the drain. It has to be taken away by a licensed hauler and 
properly disposed of -- not only the paint but the tape you'd mask off the 
handles with, the paper you'd put on the windows and glass, and the filters 
that separate out the particulates." 
</P>
<P>
 Also increasing the cost of painting in Southern California were air pollution 
regulations requiring new equipment. "You have to have a high-volume, 
low-pressure spray gun," Ernst says. "So everyone had to retool and buy new 
guns. They put on a greater volume of paint using less air pressure, so you get 
less over spray."

THE FINE ART OF ADVERTISING; TWO ENTREPRENEURS ARE RACKING UP ON A EURO-TREND 
-- FREE POSTCARDS. YES, FREE.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNELL GEORGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not some retro "Candid Camera" stunt. No test of honesty or integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Though you might have wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly you've already seen them around town, at your favorite coffeehouse 
along the La Brea corridor, at that low-lit yet lively West Hollywood bistro. A 
hanging rack loaded up with postcards of edgy collages, striking still lifes of 
faded sunflowers, moody photo tableaux. Something on the order of the art-card 
variety, available at many a high-toned boutique, starting at about a buck-25 a 
pop. 
</P>
<P>
 But why does this sign exclaim "FREE"? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what stops a woman taking a mimosa break during a recent Saturday 
brunch at Cha Cha Cha in east Hollywood. Perplexed, she stares at the sign 
attached to a rack. Free? Her eyes ask her equally confounded friend. She puts 
one card in her bag. Looks around. Then, after a beat, takes a handful more. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's common," says Annett Sell. "People always think there's a hitch." 
</P>
<P>
 "And there is!" teases Jan-Peter Flack, then shakes his head. "The hitch is 
that there isn't one." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Sell and Flack, who are from Germany, were surprised that this phenomenon 
hadn't already swept the States. Free postcards emblazoned with big-name ads 
are available at cafes and restaurants all over Italy, Switzerland, England, 
Austria and the Netherlands, Flack explains. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the advertising is very blatant," he says. "You might get one nice 
postcard and the rest are crappy -- with no aesthetic consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 What Sell and Flack have set out to do with their cottage-industry enterprise, 
Pik:Nik Free Postcards, is multifold. Playing up the fine art aspects, they've 
set out to provide a different mode of advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Their customers are independent artists who have tired of the usual 
attention-getting routes (from gallery crawls to portfolio peddling), or 
companies shooting to attract a more sophisticated and style-conscious audience 
through a more personalized campaign strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you are much more direct, and far less expensive," Flack says. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he emphasizes, "To justify something like this, the artistic aspect of 
the cards dominates the racks -- so that whoever has the rack doesn't feel 
exploited." 
</P>
<P>
 "And," Sell adds, "neither do the customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Sell and Flack, who make their living in the entertainment industry as a set 
designer and art director, respectively, are sensitive to those aesthetic 
considerations. They were both surprised as well that the European version of 
the cards were so popular, despite some mediocre designs or blatant product 
hawking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cafes and restaurants are one of the last intimate places where you're not 
exploited by advertising," Flack says. So in this venture, the partners want to 
make sure that the image is always the central focus, "where advertising and 
fine art are blurred. We want you to be lured into the beauty of the image. You 
have to look hard for the message." 
</P>
<P>
 Out of their pooled creative impulses and resources, Pik:Nik was born. The 
name, Sell admits, grew out of their personal proclivities toward nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 " Picnic is sort of a retro word and we are big fans of '40s, '50s and '60s 
design," says Flack, who reports that their icon, a bikini-clad '50s babe, 
still lacks a name. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, the Pik ," Sell adds, "plays on picking up the cards." 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, the partners were hard pressed to persuade business owners or 
potential advertisers to pick up anything. Most wouldn't buy into the concept 
until they'd seen some results. Recruiting a cadre of artist friends, they 
printed up the first batch of cards (10,000 of each design). 
</P>
<P>
 They had a time keeping the racks full. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cards are so popular," Sell says, "now they want to meet us." 
</P>
<P>
 And Pik:Nik has grown from 12 racks to about 70. The phone, she attests with a 
bewildered smile, doesn't stop ringing: Artists responding to an early "Artists 
Wanted" card, restaurateurs wanting to find out where and how soon they can get 
their own racks installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Flack says at this point he is most interested in looking into such concerns 
as museums, book publishing, theaters, fine-dining establishments, as well as 
the film and fashion industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be an excellent vehicle for the entertainment industry, to reissue 
classic jazz album covers, or a reprint of a '50s cult classic film poster with 
a very small tag line -- so no one feels offended." 
</P>
<P>
 And for independent artists? 
</P>
<P>
 With a rack that changes every month like a mini-gallery, the partners, 
looking at about 20,000 cards per image and growing, hope they can provide the 
sort of promotion and exposure benefits a rarefied gallery atmosphere never 
could. 
</P>
<P>
 And, they are happy to report, one photographer has already sold a print 
featured in a recent card series as result of the underground exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, the focus is to keep up with the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never want to compromise the art," Flack says. "There's a lot out there 
that's pathetic. We are in the visual arts, that's how we make a living, and we 
vow to keep the integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, they hope you collect 'em all.

PROSECUTORS TARGETING BLACK JURORS, SIMPSON TEAM SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a series of testy exchanges between a prosecutor and a prospective juror 
in the O.J. Simpson murder trial Thursday, Simpson's attorneys accused 
government lawyers of treating black jury candidates differently than others. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latest defense attack in a case in which race has long loomed as an 
issue, and prosecutors immediately denounced it as a calculated public 
relations tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense comments appeared carefully choreographed, with Simpson's two lead 
attorneys simultaneously addressing reporters on different floors of the 
Downtown Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a pattern, we'll be asking the judge to look into it," Johnnie L. 
Cochran Jr., one of the lawyers, told reporters on the 12th floor. "We're 
really concerned about the tenor of the questions and the way they go after 
certain jurors." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the lobby, Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro was telling the 
rest of the press corps: "It implies an insidious effort to try to get black 
jurors removed for cause because they are black, because they have black 
heroes, and because O.J. Simpson is one of them. There's no other reason." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the issue of how black prospective jurors are being questioned, 
defense sources accuse prosecutors of using a disproportionate number of their 
challenges so far to seek the removal of black panelists. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have long said that they hope to impanel a racially mixed jury to 
hear the murder case against Simpson, who has pleaded not guilty to the June 12 
murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. Simpson is black; both 
victims were white. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 33 panelists who remain in contention after in-depth questioning, 18 
are black. Eight are white, three are Latino, two are Native American and two 
are of mixed race. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, prosecutors declined to respond directly to the latest attack by 
Simpson's lawyers, but accused their adversaries of trying to score points with 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "This appears to be just the latest in a series of efforts to try to 
manipulate public opinion," Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman said. "In the 
midst of jury selection, I think that is very inappropriate and unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 Although defense attorneys have privately been discussing the issue for 
several days, it flared up publicly Thursday after an unusually pointed 
exchange between Hodgman and a 71-year-old black South-Central man who had 
difficulty remembering the answers he gave on a juror questionnaire last month 
and who became increasingly defensive as the prosecutor questioned him. 
</P>
<P>
 When the man said he had heard something about a polygraph, Hodgman asked: "Do 
you know what a polygraph is?" 
</P>
<P>
 The man took offense at that question and others posed by Hodgman, at one 
point exclaiming: "You're pumping me as if I'm on trial. You're sort of riling 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran, a longtime admirer of Hodgman, nevertheless sharply criticized his 
counterpart for the way he treated the man and another prospective juror 
earlier this week. In the earlier exchange, Hodgman pressed a black woman with 
questions about her paranoid schizophrenic brother until she broke down in 
tears, prompting Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito to intervene and apologize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'd make a juror cry," Cochran said Thursday. "I don't think 
I'd make a juror say: 'I'm riled up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys also were angry about the spirited, and ultimately 
successful, campaign that prosecutors waged to have another black woman excused 
from the panel after she expressed doubts about some aspects of the prosecution 
case but insisted that she could be fair despite those doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 After that woman was excused, Shapiro was furious, saying: "My blood is 
boiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran said he too was bothered by the prosecutors' determination to have 
that panelist removed: "They finally got her excused. She said she could be 
fair, but they persisted and got her off." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he declined to take questions about jury selection, Hodgman said 
prosecutors were not attacking anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are proceeding very, very carefully and very, very cautiously," he said. 
"From the very beginning, I've sought to have fairness and humanity for our 
individual jurors." 
</P>
<P>
 The man who was at the center of Thursday's exchange was allowed to remain on 
the jury panel, but three others were excused. Since questioning of the 
prospective jurors began, 63 have been interviewed by the judge and lawyers, 
and 30 have been excused. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those who have been dismissed have admitted violating Judge Ito's 
order that they avoid all television, radio, newspapers and magazines -- and 
that they not so much as enter a bookstore. Ito imposed that order Oct. 18 
after the release of a salacious book that allegedly tells the story of Nicole 
Simpson's final months. 
</P>
<P>
 Since imposing that order, Ito has taken a hard line with prospective jurors, 
dismissing any who have had the slightest contact with media. Among other 
prospective jurors who have been excused in recent days are a man who watched 
cartoons with his grandson and a woman who watched a Barbara Stanwyck movie on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, a 29-year-old woman from the Santa Clarita Valley said she had 
watched videotaped episodes of "Beverly Hills 90210" and "Melrose Place." Her 
husband made the tapes, deleting the commercials as he went. But not even those 
precautions were enough to satisfy Ito. 
</P>
<P>
 "The order is no TV at this point," he said. "Watching tapes of TV programs is 
a no-no." 
</P>
<P>
 Some prospective jurors have been excused for other reasons as well. Thursday, 
one man said he was bothered by interracial marriage and believed that blacks 
were responsible for violent crime in his Harbor Gateway neighborhood. After a 
brief conference with the lawyers at the bench, Ito excused him. 
</P>
<P>
 Although jury selection has lasted longer than a month, more than 20 
candidates remain to be questioned from the first group alone. If 12 jurors and 
eight alternates cannot be found from that group, more than 200 other 
prospective jurors have completed detailed questionnaires and could be called 
in for interviews and possible service. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Ito still is trying to resolve a number of issues that will 
help establish the parameters for the trial. Thursday, Ito returned to an issue 
that has surfaced in varying ways for weeks -- the admissibility of evidence 
seized from Simpson's Ford Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense has mounted a number of challenges to that evidence, first arguing 
that the warrant authorizing police to seize the car was improperly drafted, 
then maintaining that police were wrong to keep re-entering the car for 
subsequent searches once it was in their custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito rejected both those arguments, but the defense has mounted another attack 
on some of the Bronco evidence, arguing that a June 15 break-in of the car 
rendered anything taken from it after that date inadmissible. Among other 
things, police searched the car after that time with a substance known as 
Luminol and discovered what investigators say was blood. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Simpson's lawyers argued that the break-in of the car -- a 
tow-yard employee acknowledged entering the car and removing receipts signed by 
O.J. Simpson and his ex-wife -- broke the official chain of custody of the 
vehicle. They hoped to show that police supervision of the vehicle was so lax 
that evidence inside the car could now be unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to head off that argument, prosecutors called Detective Richard Haro, 
one of the LAPD investigators who worked on the Simpson case, who testified 
that he had placed a hold on the car. The tow-yard manager agreed, saying that 
the car was stored in a closed facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Simpson's attorneys emphasized that once the car had been broken into, 
there was no way to guarantee that evidence found after that was untainted. 
Subsequent searches revealed more bloodstains and other items, including a 
missing light bulb that investigators have speculated Simpson removed to avoid 
illuminating the cab of the car as he was entering or leaving it on the night 
of the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 But without clear supervision of the car, there is no way to tell who removed 
the light bulb, much less to conclude what that person's motive might have 
been, said Simpson attorney Gerald F. Uelmen. "We are left to speculation," he 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen also used the session to reiterate an essential part of Simpson's 
defense: that investigators and others connected with the case were sloppy and 
careless in investigating the murders with which Simpson is charged. Under 
questioning from Uelmen, for instance, Haro acknowledged that he did not check 
a box on a form used to request a special hold on vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 And the tow-yard manager, Robert B. Jones, admitted that people could have 
entered the vehicle without his knowledge and that he had failed to promptly 
notify the LAPD of the break-in despite city regulations requiring that he do 
so "without delay." 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks on the investigators have not succeeded in persuading Ito to 
disallow much of the evidence in the murder case, but Simpson's attorneys hope 
that the accumulation of those criticisms will undermine the prosecution case 
in the eyes of jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito took the latest request under submission, saying he needed to review 
transcripts of a previous hearing before issuing his ruling. 
</P>

HUSBAND'S BUSINESS TIES POSE DILEMMA FOR FEINSTEIN; POLITICS: SHE SAYS HIS 
MYRIAD INVESTMENTS DO NOT INFLUENCE HER VOTES AND SHE IS AWARE OF POTENTIAL 
CONFLICTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING and DWIGHT MORRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly after the Senate unanimously approved legislation sparing the nation's 
airlines from a $2.5-billion fuel tax, Dianne Feinstein decided to oppose the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Democrat announced on the Senate floor in June of last year 
that she would have voted against a special tax exemption for the ailing 
airline industry if the amendment had been subject to a roll-call tally rather 
than a voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein later acknowledged in an interview that the statement prevented any 
possible criticism that she was assisting the business interests of her 
husband, Richard C. Blum, a prominent San Francisco merchant banker who 
controls a 6% stake in Northwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode underscores Feinstein's dilemma whenever an issue arises that 
affects her husband's myriad investments in everything from cable television to 
container products. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the wealthiest members of the Senate and the most prolific 
fund-raiser among all federal candidates, with about $34 million in campaign 
receipts since 1989, Feinstein faces a dizzying array of potential conflicts 
involving both her personal and political finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Her opponent in this year's California Senate election, Rep. Mike Huffington 
(R-Santa Barbara), has attacked Feinstein in television commercials as "a 
senator who serves special interests . . . and her own." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein says she is an active legislator who serves the legitimate needs of 
all her constituents, regardless of whether they give money to her campaign or 
get involved in her husband's investments. Such connections, Feinstein insists, 
have no bearing on her decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to be very careful," she said last week. "I make up my own mind on all 
issues and I prize this independence." 
</P>
<P>
 A review of the senator's first two years in office found that Feinstein 
supported several positions that benefited Blum, his wealthy clients and their 
investments. She was a vocal proponent of increased trade with China while 
Blum's firm was planning a major investment there. She also voted for 
appropriations bills that provided more than $100 million a year in federal 
funds to three companies in which her husband is a substantial investor. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate ethics rules permit Feinstein to vote on bills that affect her 
husband's finances so long as the legislation is not designed to specifically 
benefit Blum or his investments. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the 61-year-old Feinstein has taken actions that adversely 
affected her husband's economic interests. She sided with Los Angeles city 
officials in their successful battle against the airline industry to triple 
airport landing fees. The increased fees at Los Angeles International Airport 
cost the airlines $49 million per year and Northwest $3 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said she was the only senator to support the $2.5-billion fuel tax 
on airlines "because they are big boys running big companies. I didn't feel 
they should be exempted. My view was contrary. I wanted to make it clear." 
</P>
<P>
 The first-term senator could have blocked the tax exemption by refusing to 
approve a unanimous consent agreement when her office was notified in advance 
by Senate leaders. Instead, after the measure passed, Feinstein opted to 
declare her opposition in a statement that got buried in the fine print of the 
Congressional Record for June 24, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 That same day, Eastern newspapers reported that the board of directors of 
Northwest Airlines, including Feinstein's husband, would meet to consider 
filing for bankruptcy protection. Although Feinstein said she did not know 
about the stories and was unaware of developments at Northwest, she conceded 
that the timing of the fuel tax measure offered her a "new sensitivity" to how 
her actions might be perceived. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Senate campaign, Feinstein has been criticized by Huffington 
for allegedly catering to political action committees and corporations that 
have piled at least $7.8 million into her campaign coffers since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said she does not have the luxury of refusing special interest money 
when she is running against Huffington, a former oil tycoon who has spent about 
$25 million of his personal fortune in an effort to defeat her. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Feinstein is engaged in a money chase that took her to 17 
fund-raising events over the past two weeks, a Times analysis of federal 
election records indicates that her campaign has relied more heavily on small 
contributions than on special interest money. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her take from PACs has increased to $1.3 million -- a 38% jump over 
1992 -- the total represents only 17% of her contributions through Sept. 30. 
This is well below the average Senate winner's receipts in 1992, when PACs 
accounted for 27% of campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the records show that Feinstein has raised nearly $2.6 million from 
supporters who gave less than $200, accounting for 35% of her 1993-94 
contributions. The senator also has received $428,000 in bundled contributions 
through EMILY's List, the abortion rights, Democratic women's group that 
Feinstein sought to exempt from proposed campaign reform legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 She appears to have provided relatively few favors to financial supporters. A 
review of hundreds of Feinstein letters sent to federal agencies on behalf of 
constituents and hundreds of individual campaign contributions over the past 
two years turned up only a few dozen matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Feinstein has provided access and legislative assistance to key 
support groups that have rallied around her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The former San Francisco mayor courted the state's agricultural industry after 
her 1992 victory over Republican Sen. John Seymour and devoted her first two 
years in office to tirelessly pursuing California farm aid, including a 
controversial export promotions program. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on the Senate Appropriations agriculture subcommittee, she helped 
secure $83 million in new funding for programs that benefit California farmers. 
She issued more than 100 letters on behalf of California constituents to the 
Agriculture Department, many of them to Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud to have agriculture support," Feinstein said. "I've worked very 
hard to get it. I think they really believe they have a voice in me." 
</P>
<P>
 Through Sept. 30, agriculture PACs have given the Feinstein campaign $147,143 
-- 12% of her special interest money, and second only to unions. Individual 
farmers, ranchers and others employed in businesses dependent on agriculture 
donated an additional $116,408 to Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The support signals a dramatic turnaround from the governor's race in 1990 
when Feinstein received only 1% of her special interest money from agriculture. 
Similarly, the Central Valley overwhelmingly supported Seymour in his 
unsuccessful 1992 race against Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not been a lot of senators that we've had this much access to," said 
Jean Sagouspe, a prominent Los Banos grower. "When (Sen. Alan) Cranston was in 
there, we just didn't get anything. Seymour was accessible but couldn't get 
anything done. She is accessible and gets things done." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein labored hard to save $90 million for California farmers that had 
been cut out of the Market Promotion Program, a controversial subsidy to expand 
agricultural export markets. The national program, which cost $1.25 billion 
between 1986 and 1993, has been criticized by the General Accounting Office as 
ineffective and a potentially unnecessary benefit for commercial farms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the problems have gotten straightened out," Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some public interest groups were critical of Feinstein for withdrawing her 
support of President Clinton's health care plan in June after she had accepted 
$390,970 in contributions from interests opposing comprehensive reforms. A 
study by Citizen Action, a consumer research and advocacy group, found that 
Feinstein ranked third in the Senate in special interest contributions from the 
health industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does raise eyebrows," said Chuck Lewis, director of the Center for Public 
Integrity, a nonprofit group that has studied health care lobbying. "People can 
draw their own conclusion, but there is no question she has embraced the 
Washington politics-as-usual . . . system. There are very few people who have 
shaken the money tree any better than (Feinstein)." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said the Administration's plan would cost between 150,000 and 
500,000 jobs in California. "The fact that doctors contribute to me had nothing 
to do with my taking my name off the Clinton health care plan," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 No individual has raised more political money for Feinstein -- and perhaps 
more questions about potential conflicts -- than her husband. In the 1990 
governor's race, Blum arranged a $3-million loan to his wife's campaign. 
Reporting violations surrounding the loan brought a $190,000 fine from the 
California Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 For some critics, the proximity of Feinstein's political operation to her 
husband's investment practice remains too close. This year the Northern 
California headquarters of the Feinstein for Senate campaign is downstairs from 
a brick Montgomery Street complex in San Francisco that houses the office of 
Richard C. Blum and Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Feinstein turned her sights on a Senate seat, federal laws -- which ban 
corporate giving, restrict PAC contributions to $10,000 and limit personal 
contributions to $2,000 -- have significantly dampened the ability of Blum's 
business associates to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Blum says he is spending "26 of every 24 hours" to get his wife 
reelected, primarily raising money through friends and business associates. 
Asked if his fund-raising efforts this year have surpassed reported estimates 
of $1 million, Blum said he no longer keeps track. "I don't know and I don't 
care," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential pitfalls created by Blum's active role in raising political 
funds are "a nightmare," said Ellen Miller, executive director of the 
nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. "The next best thing to handing a 
check directly to (Feinstein) is handing it to her spouse." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum, 59, earned the bulk of his estimated $50-million fortune by investing in 
undervalued companies on behalf of some of America's wealthiest people and 
largest corporations. His company manages $750 million in investments for about 
70 clients, including oil heir Gordon Getty and Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax returns released by Blum and Feinstein show that the couple's income rose 
from $292,000 in 1980, the year they married, to $3.9 million last year. The 
couple was hit by the tax increase contained in President Clinton's 
deficit-reduction plan that Feinstein supported. They paid 29.6% of their 
adjusted gross income in federal taxes last year -- up from 24.2% in 1992 -- 
and owed an additional $180,518. They also took advantage of a provision in the 
Clinton plan -- added at the urging of Feinstein and other senators -- to defer 
$120,345 of their federal tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has criticized Huffington for refusing to release information about 
the sources of his wealth and divulge his tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's tax returns offer little insight into her husband's merchant 
banking business. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you see is that he is generating seven-digit figures coming out of his 
financial interests," said Robert K. Mah, a San Francisco certified public 
accountant whose firm was hired by The Times to review the couple's tax 
returns. "But what you don't see is the makeup of those financial interests to 
determine if there is any potential conflicts of interest between Feinstein's 
track record and his investments." 
</P>
<P>
 Such detailed financial information, Mah said, would have to come from Blum's 
corporate tax returns, a list of his clients and other financial records. Blum 
said he would release his corporate returns when Huffington makes his tax 
records available. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate financial disclosure documents, together with a client list Blum 
released in 1990, reveal a wide range of business ventures and investments in 
industries that come in contact with Congress, government agencies and federal 
regulators. These include the Bank of America, cable television holdings in 
Georgia and California, a pair of San Francisco Bay Area high technology firms, 
an interstate trucking company and broadcast properties. 
</P>
<P>
 When Feinstein first ran for Senate in 1992, she and Blum sought legal advice 
from the Democratic law firm of Manatt, Phelps, Phillips & Kantor on the 
question of participating in decisions that affect her husband's business 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Manatt, Phelps stated that it was "very unlikely" that any actual conflicts of 
interest would arise because Senate rules are so broad. "Somewhat more 
problematic," the Manatt, Phelps memo said, "is the possibility of an 
appearance of a conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 As a candidate in 1992, Feinstein vowed to stay clear of any mergers between 
the private and public sectors of her household. She appointed her top Senate 
staffer in Washington, Michael McGill, to steer her away from potential 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Feinstein said, no problems have surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's never been a question so much of right or wrong. That is easy to deal 
with," Blum said. "We try to go beyond that -- even if it is right, how does it 
look?" 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, Feinstein declared her strong support on the Senate floor for 
continued trading with China while her husband was planning a major investment 
in that country. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, Blum said, he has been preparing to place up to $150 
million on behalf of several investors in Chinese enterprises that make 
products such as cement, bicycles, washing machines and telecommunications 
equipment. Blum said he would put between $2 and $3 million of his own money 
into the investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum's economic interest in China is "news to me," Feinstein said. "All I know 
is presently he doesn't have any investment in China." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum also serves as vice chairman and director of Shanghai Pacific Partners, 
an import-export broker that participated in building a $30-million residential 
and retail high-rise on the outskirts of Shanghai. Blum's firm joined with the 
state-run Shanghai Investment Trust Corp. to form one of the first joint 
ventures between San Francisco and Chinese investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was cited by Chinese officials as a testament to the friendly 
business ties between Shanghai and San Francisco that Feinstein had initiated. 
Since she began America's first sister-city relationship with a Chinese city in 
1979 as mayor of San Francisco, Feinstein has developed a close relationship 
with Jiang Zemin, the former Shanghai mayor and current president of China. 
</P>
<P>
 While mayor of Shanghai in the 1980s, Jiang danced with Feinstein during a 
visit to San Francisco. In August of last year, Feinstein and Blum traveled to 
Beijing at the invitation of Jiang for lengthy face-to-face meetings with top 
Chinese leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Such encounters are fondly remembered when deals are clinched back in China, 
according to American experts in Chinese business practices. They said that 
Feinstein's consistent support for China's interests cannot help but benefit 
her husband's efforts to earn profits there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that he's got some kind of an advantage over the ordinary Joe 
Schmo investor," said William Triplett, former chief Republican counsel to the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "There is a particular Chinese phrase 
guanxi. It means relationships . . . any kind of a connection gives you an edge 
over other people. This really sounds like a case of guanxi. " 
</P>
<P>
 In separate interviews, Feinstein and Blum flatly rejected the notion that his 
business practices have benefited from her ties to China. They said that Blum 
had developed his own separate relationships in China before he met and married 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is in San Francisco running his business, I am in Washington being a 
United States senator and they are two separate things," Feinstein told a 
reporter. "I don't know how I can prove it to people like you. Maybe I get 
divorced. Maybe that is what you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Three companies in which Blum holds considerable investment interests have 
received $100 million a year in federal funds through appropriations bills that 
Feinstein voted to approve. Two firms, URS Corp. of San Francisco and Frequency 
Electronics Inc. of New York, have defense contracts and the third, National 
Education Corp. of Irvine, received education grants for jobs programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein should have recused herself, Huffington contends, from voting on 
legislation that benefited Blum's investments. The senator has said there was 
no conflict because the multibillion-dollar spending bills carried no specific 
reference to the companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Two longtime clients and personal friends of Blum have connections to a San 
Francisco firm that would have benefited from a special provision in 
Feinstein's original desert protection bill. The firm, Catellus Corp., was the 
only private property owner in Feinstein's original bill that received special 
allowances to exchange its 366,000 acres of desert land for other government 
surplus property. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, which specifically mentioned Catellus, was criticized by 
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt at a Senate hearing in April of last year. "It 
can be read to mandate me to lay up all of Idaho for discretionary selection by 
the Catellus Corp. That is not good policy," Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The language remained in Feinstein's bill until September, 1993, when several 
Republicans on the Senate Natural Resources Committee objected to Catellus 
receiving favorable treatment above all other landowners. The committee voted 
unanimously to yank the provision from the Senate bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catellus "special deal" is cited by Huffington in television commercials 
as a prime example of Feinstein going to bat for a special interest. Companies 
and individuals affiliated with Catellus have provided at least $119,000 in 
campaign contributions to Feinstein since her 1990 gubernatorial race, records 
show.  
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said she picked up the Catellus language straight from House-passed 
legislation and did not support it, even though she kept the provision in the 
bill after making more than 50 other changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did not catch my eye initially," Feinstein said of the Catellus provision. 
"When I understood that Catellus had to be put at the head of the list, I said 
I agreed to have it taken out. It was just that simple."

 Dianne Feinstein has raised more campaign funds than any federal candidate 
since 1989 and is one of the wealthiest members of the U.S. Senate. Here are 
some of the positions Feinstein has taken that affected the interests of her 
campaign donors and the investments of her husband, San Francisco merchant 
banker Richard C. Blum: 
</P>
<P>
 * Jan. 21, 1993 -- Feinstein introduces California Desert Protection Act with 
a provision that allows the Catellus Corp. to exchange 366,000 acres of desert 
land for surplus government property. Companies and individuals affiliated with 
Catellus donated at least $119,000 to Feinstein. Provision is later dropped 
after criticism that it would give Catellus preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 24, 1993 -- After the Senate passes a $2.5-billion fuel tax exemption 
for the nation's airlines on a unanimous voice vote, Feinstein announces her 
opposition to the measure. Blum controls a 6% stake in Northwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 18, 1993 -- Feinstein votes for an education spending bill that 
provides more than $50 million to National Education Corp., an Irvine firm that 
lists Blum as a major stockholder. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 2, 1993 -- Feinstein sides with Los Angeles city officials in their 
successful battle against the airline industry to triple landing fees at LAX. 
The increase costs Northwest $3 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 25, 1994 -- Feinstein withdraws support of President Clinton's health 
care plan while accepting $390,970 in contributions from providers and other 
interests opposing comprehensive reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 25, 1994 -- In a speech delivered on the Senate floor, Feinstein urges 
Clinton to increase favorable trade relations with China at the same time Blum 
is planning to invest up to $150 million there on behalf of several clients. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 19, 1994 -- At the request of California farmers, Feinstein helps save 
controversial $90-million federal program to expand the state's agricultural 
export market. Among special interest groups, growers are the second-largest 
contributors to Feinstein campaign.

U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT MEMO ASSAILS PROP. 187; ELECTION: ADMINISTRATION'S 
LATEST BROADSIDE COMPARES THE MEASURE TO A TEXAS LAW DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In yet another broadside aimed at Proposition 187, the Clinton Administration 
released a Justice Department memorandum Thursday saying that there is no 
difference between the California initiative and a Texas law denying education 
to illegal immigrants that was struck down as unconstitutional in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has made no secret of its distaste for the hotly 
debated measure, which would bar illegal immigrants from receiving many public 
services.  
</P>
<P>
 The memorandum released by Assistant Atty. Gen. Walter Dellinger, head of the 
office of legal counsel, represents an unusually aggressive move by Washington 
to lobby against a pending state ballot initiative.  
</P>
<P>
 Dellinger's 1 1/2-page memo dealt only with the educational provision of the 
ballot initiative and did not discuss its prohibition on providing illegal 
immigrants with non-emergency health and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (education) provision . . . is in all material respects 
indistinguishable from the Texas statute that the Supreme Court held to be in 
violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment," Dellinger 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dellinger assessment will not constitute a formal legal opinion on the 
constitutionality of the initiative and will have no binding effect on 
implementation of Proposition 187, if it is approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make sense to turn schoolteachers and nurses into Border Patrol 
agents. It doesn't make sense to kick kids out of school or not to give them 
immunizations," Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said Thursday in her strongest comments 
to date on the issue. "When we look at what's happening in America today, we 
see the problems associated with neglect and it doesn't serve any purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 The President denounced the initiative as unconstitutional in an Oct. 21 news 
conference. "If you turn the teacher and other educators into instruments of a 
sort of state police force, it's like bringing a Big Brother into the schools," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In past weeks, the proposition has been harshly criticized by a steady 
procession of Administration officials from the attorney general to White House 
chief of staff Leon E. Panetta and Immigration and Naturalization Service 
Commissioner Doris Meissner. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reno in particular has engaged in a running dispute with California Gov. 
Pete Wilson over immigration issues. Wilson has accused the federal government 
of allowing illegal immigration because it does not adequately protect the 
borders. Reno and other Justice Department officials have accused Wilson of 
supporting measures, while he was a senator, that hampered enforcement of 
sanctions against illegal immigrants and their employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's Justice Department memo and the attorney general's comments came as 
the Los Angeles Times Poll reported a sharp erosion in voter support for 
Proposition 187, with likely voters favoring it 51% to 41%, down from a 59%-33% 
spread two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Legal Counsel researches constitutional questions for the 
President, and its work -- often delivered to the Chief Executive by the 
attorney general or through the White House counsel -- usually remains 
confidential until a sanitized version of the office's opinions is published 
years after being written. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the current memo stops short of being a full-scale opinion of the 
office, a later Justice Department analysis of the proposition's 
constitutionality could address whether the government would be able to cut off 
federal funds to education, health and welfare programs in the state if it is 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Texas case (Plyler vs. Doe), Dellinger noted, the court found that 
discrimination against children not legally residing in the United States 
presented the court with an "area of special constitutional sensitivity" 
because the children "are in no way responsible for their illegal status." 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas law "directing the onus of a parent's misconduct against his 
children does not comport with fundamental conceptions of justice," the court 
reasoned. That differential treatment could be upheld only if it "furthers some 
substantial goal of the state," the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applying the same reasoning to Proposition 187, Dellinger wrote that it "does 
not refer to any goals of the state different from those articulated by Texas 
in Plyler." 
</P>
<P>
 The California measure goes farther than the Texas law by requiring school 
districts to verify the legal status of "each parent or guardian" of all pupils 
and to inform the INS and state officials if the districts find or reasonably 
suspect the parent or guardian to be in violation of the immigration laws, even 
if the pupil is a citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 "This requirement could have the effect of exposing the parents of potential 
students to deportation as a result of their children's enrollment in school," 
Dellinger wrote. "Many children who are citizens or lawful residents may 
therefore choose to forgo an education so as to protect parents who may not be 
lawful residents of this country," Dellinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dellinger did not note in his memo that the 1982 decision was rendered by a 
5-4 court and that only one member of the majority (Justice John Paul Stevens) 
remains on the court. He also did not mention that the ruling followed a 
Supreme Court decision nine years earlier that held that the right to education 
is not a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas decision "is certainly a fragile precedent," said Bruce Fein, a 
former Reagan Administration Justice Department official and conservative 
commentator. "It was a 5-4 majority, and four of those in the majority are 
gone. So, it is not clear how it would turn out." 
</P>
<P>
 Fein took sharp issue with the Dellinger memo being made public. "This sounds 
like using (the legal counsel's office) for partisan political purposes," he 
said. "Why in the world is this Administration offering an advisory legal 
opinion on this issue? It's none of their business." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the philosophical fence, Prof. Laurence Tribe of Harvard 
Law School noted recently: "This court is very serious about adhering to 
precedent in the absence of an overwhelming reason for change." 
</P>
<P>
 After Reno's news conference and before Dellinger's memo was made public, Carl 
Stern, Reno's chief spokesman, said that the attorney general had not sought 
and would not issue "a formal opinion" on Proposition 187. "We're not in the 
business of pre-clearing state ballot issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition is likely to be challenged in the courts if it is passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno, for her part, noted that reporters had been asking her about 187 "for 
the last five weeks. And rather than say, 'there's serious difficulties,' I 
thought we should be informed one way or the other. . . . Everyone recognizes 
that this is an issue that has got to be addressed, that there are 
constitutional issues that have got to be addressed with respect to it, and 
that we should do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern said there is no further legal research being done by the department on 
Proposition 187 at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 includes a clause, common in statewide initiatives, saying 
that if any portion of the measure is held invalid, other portions would remain 
in effect.

PRUDENTIAL ADMITS TO FRAUD, AGREES TO SETTLEMENT TERMS; INQUIRY: CRIMINAL 
CHARGES ARE FILED. BUT CASE WON'T BE PRESSED IF BROKERAGE ADHERES TO STRINGENT 
CONDITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Capping an investigation into what is believed to be the largest fraud by a 
single brokerage against small investors, federal prosecutors on Thursday filed 
criminal charges against Prudential Securities for its $8-billion limited 
partnership program. But prosecutors agreed not to press charges if the 
brokerage lives up to a strict settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential for the first time formally admitted that it had knowingly made 
"false and misleading" statements to retirees and other small investors, who 
bought partnership units based on Prudential's false assurances that they were 
safe, tax sheltered and certain to bring a large return. 
</P>
<P>
 Over more than a decade, more than 600,000 investors nationwide put money into 
Prudential's approximately 700 limited partnerships. Their losses are believed 
to have totaled over $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubled brokerage firm, a subsidiary of giant Prudential Insurance, also 
agreed as part of the settlement to transfer immediately an additional $330 
million into an open-ended settlement fund established a year ago for its 
clients. It thus doubled the amount paid into the fund so far.  
</P>
<P>
 Prudential said it had already set the additional amount aside on its books, 
and had been expecting to have to pay it anyway under a 1993 agreement with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission that established the settlement fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The Prudential case stands as perhaps the most dramatic symbol of the 
overzealousness with which some brokerages pursued profits during the go-go 
1980s, encouraging their salespeople to go to great lengths to earn huge 
commissions and fatten the bottom line. The Prudential abuses also occurred at 
a time when securities regulators and prosecutors were focusing on high profile 
cases, such as those involving junk bond promoter Michael Milken and convicted 
insider trader Ivan F. Boesky, paying scant attention to schemes that affected 
smaller investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Jo White, U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said the agreement not to prosecute 
Prudential -- called a "deferred prosecution" -- was based on fear that an 
indictment could throw the firm's 18,000 employees out of work and further harm 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was also based on the fact that Prudential had cooperated in the 
inquiry and agreed to admit wrongdoing. Company officials have said privately 
that an indictment probably would have put the company out of business, similar 
to what happened to now defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert and E. F. Hutton & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 White emphasized that criminal investigations are continuing of former 
executives believed responsible for the wrongdoing, and that charges may 
eventually be filed against them. 
</P>
<P>
 White hinted that one advantage of forcing Prudential to pay the $330 million 
immediately is that it would be available to investors even if Prudential 
should collapse. "This guarantees it's there" for investors, she said. Any 
money not used to pay customers' claims will revert to the government, White 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of state securities regulators, meanwhile, warned that as a Jan. 10, 
1995, deadline looms, thousands of investors across the country who are 
eligible to receive money from the fund haven't yet filed a claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased that the government has decided to end its investigation 
and not take further legal action," Prudential President and Chief Executive 
Hardwick Simmons said in a written statement. He said the firm is "dramatically 
different" today, and added, "I believe the government's decision underscores 
the fact that we have taken extraordinary steps to resolve the partnership 
problem and fund any legitimate claims of investors." 
</P>
<P>
 The admission of criminal wrongdoing, however, represents a remarkable 
pirouette by Prudential, which up until now has fiercely denied in civil 
lawsuits and arbitration cases that it broke the law. Although Prudential to 
date has paid out more than $1 billion in partnership claims, the denials have 
helped Prudential keep the costs of its settlements down, often preventing 
small investors from getting back the full amount of their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in a federal court hearing in New Orleans in January involving 
Prudential's Energy Income Fund partnerships, Prudential lawyers called expert 
witnesses and argued that the firm had done nothing to defraud investors. At 
the end of the hearing, based largely on Prudential's presentation, a judge 
approved a hotly contested class-action settlement that paid investors much 
less than their full losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the documents filed Thursday as part of the settlement with prosecutors, 
Prudential admitted most of the wrongdoing it had specifically denied in the 
New Orleans hearing. Nevertheless, White said, the New Orleans settlement is 
final. Investors covered by such private class-action settlements aren't 
eligible for the big settlement pool that Prudential added to on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential aggressively marketed dozens of partnership programs from the early 
1980s through 1991, in areas such as real estate, aircraft leasing and even 
horse breeding. The criminal charges, however, focused on the Energy Income 
Funds, which were the subject of a 1993 investigative series in The Times. 
Prudential sold about $1.4 billion of Energy Income units to over 100,000 small 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnerships lost money because huge amounts were siphoned out in fees and 
commissions -- 15% in the case of Energy Income Funds -- and because income 
projections had been based on dubious assumptions about how much the real 
estate, oil and gas and other investments would yield. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the settlement, the charges were filed in the form of a criminal 
complaint rather than an indictment. The accusations include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Prudential "falsely instructed its brokers that the investment was safe, low 
risk and suitable for all investors." The firm's employees at various times 
told customers that the partnership units were comparable in safety to 
municipal bonds and federally insured bank certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 * The firm falsely told investors that the income would be tax sheltered. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prudential misled investors into thinking they were receiving income from 
the partnerships when in fact they were only receiving back their own original 
investment.

 Syrian President Hafez Assad, angrily rejecting suggestions that he should 
visit Jerusalem or make some other dramatic gesture to prove his commitment to 
peace, said Thursday after hosting a crucial meeting with President Clinton 
that if the Israelis will not believe his word, the peace process will 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing we have that proves our design for peace, except our saying 
that we want peace," Assad told a rare news conference. "And anyone who does 
not believe what we are saying, he would have no other way for peace. It would 
be he that does not want peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Assad's outburst, with President Clinton at his side, came just moments after 
the Syrian president asserted that he was ready to negotiate a peace that would 
enable "Arabs and Israelis to live in security, stability and peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Assad both said their three-hour meeting at Assad's grandiose 
palace overlooking Damascus produced some progress in bridging the differences 
between Syria and Israel in the painfully slow negotiations -- conducted 
through U.S. mediators -- aimed at ending almost half a century of animosity 
between the two neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We achieved a few things and we didn't achieve others," Assad said, speaking 
through a Syrian government interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said, "There was some progress made, the details of which I will not 
and I should not discuss at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters that progress had been 
made in several areas in dispute, including security arrangements. But he 
refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in Jerusalem, Clinton was challenged in a news conference to cite 
anything that Assad had said that was new. "I think his statement did break 
some new ground," Clinton replied, again without elaborating.  
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who shared the Jerusalem news 
conference, said Clinton reported progress but no breakthrough. "We are 
advancing in tiny steps, inch by inch," Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's hope to keep the focus on the modest but real progress in the 
negotiations was dashed when an Israeli journalist, traveling with White House 
reporters, asked Assad if he could assure the Israeli public that its security 
will not be damaged if Israel relinquishes the Golan Heights captured from 
Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of the Israeli public, according to the polls, does not believe 
it is physically safe to give up the Golan Heights," the Israeli reporter said. 
"This mistrust has been added to by the fact that you haven't visited Israel; 
you haven't met with Mr. Rabin, there's no direct talks; you haven't spelled 
out the exact terms of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Assad's face darkened. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern of any country in the world about its security does not justify 
that particular country to (hold) the lands of other states," he said in 
reference to the Golan Heights, which Syria claims as its sovereign territory 
despite almost three decades of Israeli occupation. "To be secure and not to 
have any concern from anything -- this was never there in reality or in books." 
</P>
<P>
 He rejected "attempts to confine the peace process to small things, to formal 
things concerning the visit of one party to the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Assad's opening statement -- agreed to in advance by U.S. officials -- 
broke some new ground, at least on a symbolic level. Assad, who in the past was 
reluctant even to say the word Israel , called his adversary by its name with 
seeming ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad also defined, for the first time, his minimum requirements for a peace 
treaty -- Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and from southern Lebanon. 
In the past, Assad had implied that he would not sign a treaty with Israel 
until all Arab-Israeli disputes have been settled, including such hotly 
controversial issues as the future of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad said Syria is ready "to commit itself to the objective requirements of 
peace through the establishment of peaceful, normal relations with Israel in 
return for Israel's full withdrawal from the Golan . . . and from the south of 
Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that Assad's word "should be reassuring to the people of Israel 
and should encourage more dialogue and a greater willingness to pursue the 
peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the President took the same message directly to the Israeli Parliament. 
In a speech to the Knesset, Clinton said: "I believe something is changing in 
Syria. Leaders understand it is time to make peace. There still will be some 
hard bargaining, but they are serious about proceeding to bring peace with 
security. . . . We will walk with you on the road to Damascus." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was the first U.S. President to visit Damascus in 20 years, and Assad 
tried to make the most of it. Ever since Clinton's visit was announced last 
week, Syrian authorities have been spreading paint and planting trees to spruce 
up the appearance of the capital. A few ramshackle homes on the route from the 
airport to town were torn down to eliminate an eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
 In the news conference with Assad, Clinton held out the payoff that the Syrian 
president wants most: a new, cordial relationship with the United States to 
fill the void caused in Syrian foreign policy when its superpower patron, the 
Soviet Union, collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told President Assad of my desire to see the relations between our two 
nations improve," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be easier said than done. Sens. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Dennis 
DeConcini (D-Ariz.), brought to Damascus on Air Force One to demonstrate 
congressional support for the Clinton-Assad meeting, told reporters they will 
oppose better relations with Syria until Assad curbs terrorist groups 
headquartered in Damascus and in Syrian-controlled parts of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simply decrying terrorism is not enough," Leahy said. "We can tell if 
terrorism stops; we can tell if the (training) camps disappear. I will look 
only at the deeds, not the words." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Assad did not even condemn terrorism in words during the 
news conference. And Clinton and Assad came perilously close to accusing each 
other of fibbing about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not discuss terrorism as a separate title," Assad said. "This was not 
one of the topics on the agenda in my discussion with President Clinton, and we 
are discussing what is more important." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who had said before leaving for Damascus that he would raise the 
issue of terrorism with Assad, appeared taken aback. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our meeting, I said, and I believe President Assad agrees, that if we are 
going to have peace in the region and a peace agreement is made, then 
supporting those who try to undermine peace . . . is inconsistent with that, 
particularly if they try to undermine it with terrorist tactics," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not, we cannot, and we will not support the killing of innocent 
civilians," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said that Assad, during their private meeting, denounced 
terrorist acts such as the deadly bus bombing last week in Tel Aviv by 
Palestinian militants of the Hamas organization and the shootings earlier this 
year by an Israeli settler of worshipers at a Hebron mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Jerusalem news conference later, Clinton said he "regrets" that Assad 
did not denounce terrorism in public.

COLUMN ONE; DOMESTICS: HIRING THE ILLEGAL HITS HOME; THE THRIVING MARKET FOR 
LOW-COST CHILD CARE AND MENIAL HELP SHOWS HOW IGNORING IMMIGRATION LAW HAS 
ENTRENCHED ITSELF IN CALIFORNIA LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It doesn't matter that Margarita is an illegal immigrant, speaks no English 
and has neither a driver's license nor a car. In Los Angeles, she has no 
problem finding work, even with the bad economy. 
</P>
<P>
 She is one of the army of undocumented domestics in California, doing such 
essential tasks as caring for children, cooking and cleaning. Willing to work 
more than 50 hours a week for about $130, she has found parents eager to hire 
her, regardless of her status. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though Margarita says she misses her children and grandchildren back 
in Mexicali, she stays here because "they all depend on me" to send money. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarita's story reflects the economic forces that have converged to make 
domestic work a magnet for undocumented immigrant women in California. It also 
tells why, experts say, these women will continue to do these jobs even if 
voters approve Proposition 187, a measure intended to crack down on illegal 
immigrants by denying them public services. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic work is just one of several fields employing thousands of 
undocumented workers in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing rivals domestic jobs in showing how the personal lives of U.S. 
citizens have become intertwined with, and often dependent on, people employed 
here illegally. As such, it reflects the clash between the gut feelings many 
voters have about illegal immigration and what is being practiced in thousands 
of California homes. 
</P>
<P>
 That conflict made headlines this week when Senate candidate Mike Huffington, 
a strong supporter of Proposition 187, acknowledged that for five years he 
employed a woman living in this country illegally to care for his children. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, for all of the anger reflected in opinion polls about illegal 
immigration, American families still want illegal nannies and housekeepers who 
will work hard for long hours and meager pay -- often for less than the minimum 
wage. It is one of the stubborn contradictions of the immigration debate 
sweeping the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to believe people will give up their domestics no matter what law 
they pass," said Julia Wrigley, a sociologist who has studied domestics and 
their employers. In Southern California, she said, "there are lifestyles . . . 
that depend on there being cheap labor available." 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize it's not legal or the all-American thing to do," said a Woodland 
Hills woman who employs an illegal immigrant from Mexico to watch her two young 
sons at home. But, she said, given the lack of child care options and the fact 
that she and her husband work outside the home, "What's our alternative?" 
</P>
<P>
 That is an argument made by many families, particularly those with modest 
incomes or headed by a single parent. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is a mean edge behind some of the hiring. Operators of employment 
agencies that place domestics say there is no shortage of legal residents 
willing to do the work; but these workers normally won't put in difficult 
12-hour days for less than they could earn at a fast-food restaurant. Rather 
than accept that fact and pay more, many families -- even in wealthy 
neighborhoods -- offer wages that only illegal immigrants will accept. 
</P>
<P>
 Eva Meszaros, owner of Eva's Domestic Agency in Van Nuys, said her firm 
routinely turns down requests from would-be customers who demand: "Give me one 
of your starving girls who are willing to work for $100 a week." 
</P>
<P>
 The undocumented domestics, for their part, often have few job skills or 
prospects in their native countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you compare the opportunities in the United States and the opportunities 
in their home countries, the U.S. is still going to be a better deal," even if 
Proposition 187 passes, said Deborah Cobb-Clark, an Illinois State University 
economist who has studied employment of Latina immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics on illegal domestics, a diverse group including Salvadoran 
housecleaners and English nannies, are imprecise. As with other figures on 
undocumented immigrants, experts say, they should be used cautiously. But a 
1989 survey of illegal immigrants who applied for legal residency under an 
amnesty program provides a sense of the numbers.  
</P>
<P>
 Based on the survey, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service estimated 
that more than 41,000 illegal immigrants in California who applied for amnesty 
were working as private household employees in the late 1980s. That sum was 
almost half of all undocumented domestics in the contiguous 48 states. It also 
suggests that of the 133,576 domestics counted in California in the 1990 
census, nearly one in three was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Further estimates show that the overwhelming majority of the undocumented 
domestics came from three countries: Mexico, El Salvador and Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the amnesty program legalized many workers, the ranks of illegal 
domestics have been replenished. For newly arrived undocumented women, experts 
say, domestic work is the leading type of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most-demanding domestic jobs -- such as round-the-clock assistance to 
the disabled and the elderly -- undocumented workers are particularly 
prevalent. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Shusterman, a Los Angeles immigration lawyer, said he knows of families 
in fancy neighborhoods who also hire illegal immigrants, not to save money but 
because "these illegals are people they can trust and have personal qualities 
they haven't found in American workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, President Clinton's first nominee for attorney general, Zoe Baird, 
withdrew after disclosing that she and her husband had hired undocumented 
household help. 
</P>
<P>
 What prods many families to hire undocumented domestics, particularly poorly 
educated immigrants from Third World countries, is their desire to exert 
control over people living and working in their homes. As Wrigley points out in 
her upcoming book, "Other People's Children," parents would like "care-givers 
who share their child-rearing values and who operate independently, but they 
also want inexpensive, reliable, controllable employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Many employers hesitate to ask better-educated employees who are U.S.-born or 
legal residents to do menial tasks, such as cleaning up after the family dog. 
"There's a sense that these people won't stay on the job if they are asked to 
do things distasteful," Wrigley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do illegal domestics keep coming? Margarita, 43, said she arrived three 
years ago when she no longer could find factory jobs in Mexicali. She says 
employers there "only want young people." 
</P>
<P>
 Work as a housekeeper in this country has been easy to find, albeit at wages 
that amount to less than the $4.25-an-hour legal minimum. Margarita has worked 
for three families, earning from $520 to $540 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarita said her husband, who stayed with their children in Mexicali, earns 
little. He has a bad leg and can work only intermittently as a street vendor. 
Margarita saves about $200 to $300 a month, which she sends to her family. "I 
stay (in the United States) for my children," said Margarita, who lives in a 
room she rents from a family in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is similar for Guadalupe, a native of Mexico City who, like 
Margarita, asked that her last name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe, who is single and 36, said she sends up to $200 a month to her 
mother and three younger siblings. At home, she said, there were times "when we 
had to decide between buying shoes or clothes" for her brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Guadalupe said she was trained as a computer programmer, jobs were 
sporadic. "You can't save money that way," she said. "I thought I could come 
here and save money." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the impact of Proposition 187, many domestics apparently would not miss 
the public services the initiative would deny them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Proposition 187 would bar public education for illegal immigrants, 
many domestics have no children in this country. The workday often is too long 
to accommodate family responsibilities; immigrant women who have families and 
who speak little English often work in garment shops. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, even though domestics might miss publicly funded health care 
services that would be banned by the proposition, "they're not necessarily 
going to have health care back home either," said Cobb-Clark, the economist. 
</P>
<P>
 The main option for government officials who want to stop illegal hiring -- a 
stepped-up crackdown on rogue employers -- is not likely to have much impact on 
domestics. Occasionally the INS responds to tips, but the agency does not have 
enough investigators to go door to door in residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're dealing with limited resources," said John Brechtel, the INS 
investigations chief for the district extending from Orange to San Luis Obispo 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, although some families require their domestics to have Social 
Security cards or other proof of legal residency, many others ignore the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 There is "no hint of a preference" among most employers whether their 
domestics are legal or not, said Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo, a USC sociologist 
researching families who hire housecleaners. "For most employers, it's not 
convenient to broach the topic." 
</P>
<P>
 What is more important for many families is getting an employee at a good 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 The going rate for legal live-in housekeepers in Southern California begins at 
about $125 a week, according to employment agencies. It rises to more than $500 
weekly for those with good references and many years of experience, 
particularly if they are from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Full-time "live-outs" commonly earn an extra $20 to $50 a week, in lieu of 
room and board. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for live-ins who neither speak English nor drive, particularly illegals, 
the pay can sink below $100 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics blame the abuse on racism. Domestics often "feel like they're treated 
like chattel, and not like human beings," said Nancy Cervantes, a lawyer with 
the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 She and others familiar with the problems of undocumented domestics also say 
they were surprised at how so many parents are willing to put their children in 
the hands of people they pay so poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among well-intentioned employers, there is "such a big supply (of 
available domestics), people think, 'Why should I pay more?' " Wrigley said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the families who hire undocumented domestics, life without them is nearly 
impossible or, at least, unpleasant to imagine. Working parents often lament 
that they have few other child care options, if they cannot or do not want to 
handle it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills woman who employs an illegal immigrant said she briefly 
considered putting her boys in day care. 
</P>
<P>
 She concluded that it was too expensive and impersonal. "I like the idea of 
having one-on-one attention given to my child," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, "when a child is sick, some employers don't understand" that many 
parents need to stay home, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring a domestic means that her children stay in the cozy confines of their 
own house. If she needs to stay at work late, or if she and her husband want to 
go out at night, there is no need to make hasty child care arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Their housekeeper "is like a member of the family. She pitches in and helps 
out," the mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she sometimes feels bad about not being able to pay more. She and her 
husband pay their live-in worker $175 for a five-day week, along with room and 
board and occasional bonuses. She said they cannot afford to pay the extra $75 
or more a week commanded in her area by legal resident housekeepers who drive 
and speak English fluently. 
</P>
<P>
 By her reckoning, what she and her husband do is proper because they 
compensate their housekeeper well compared to what many other families do, and 
her housekeeper earns far more than she probably would in Mexico. Likewise, 
even if employing an undocumented worker is against the law, she does not see 
what the real damage is. "You're not going to find any Americans who will do 
this for, obviously, this kind of pay," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some employers say they would think twice about hiring an undocumented worker 
again, given the anti-illegal immigration mood in California. They say a 
different attitude prevailed when they hired their domestics. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiring an undocumented domestic "was the kind of thing that everyone did," 
said one married professional woman with three children who hired her 
housekeeper 10 years ago. The Guatemalan woman, in her early 50s, obtained a 
legal green card a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But back when the mother was looking for a housekeeper, she was mainly 
concerned about getting one with good references who was, preferably, from a 
Spanish-speaking country. "I feel that Spanish people are very warm and are 
wonderful with children," said the mother, who is white. Many employers prefer 
hiring members of certain ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many in her situation, the mother expresses sympathy for illegal 
immigrants and says she strongly opposes Proposition 187. "It's against 
minorities," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But immigrant rights advocates worry that if Proposition 187 passes, attitudes 
will harden. They say working conditions that already are awful for many 
domestics, particularly live-ins, will worsen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new arrivals can be found in conditions of near-slavery," Wrigley 
contended, sharing rooms with the babies they care for instead of getting their 
own living quarters, and prevented from having independent social lives. Some 
complain that they are not allowed to step outside for a breath of air; in 
Spanish, live-in jobs sometimes are described as encerrado, a word also used to 
mean "locked up." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some employers are close with their domestics, Wrigley said, others 
"assume their care-givers don't have the same human needs. . . . It can be a 
very lonely life." 
</P>
<P>
 Meszaros said domestics have told her of cases where "they were expected to 
work until 1 or 2 at night, and sometimes have to be ready again at 6 in the 
morning." There also are reports of employers who sexually abuse domestics. 
</P>
<P>
 Many undocumented domestics prefer jobs as housecleaners, working for a 
variety of employers instead of a single boss. 
</P>
<P>
 But in doing research on people who hire housecleaners, USC's Hondagneu-Sotelo 
has found everything from an employer who claims to have gone years without 
even learning her domestic's last name to a family who sponsored their domestic 
and her children for U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 If they cannot make a go of it as housecleaners, many illegal domestics opt 
for full-time jobs as "live-out" housekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe switched to live-out jobs after working as a live-in housekeeper for 
a couple who were doctors. "They wanted to see me active all day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once when she sat down to relax before preparing dinner and putting the 
couple's twin infants to bed, the mother "looked at me and said, 'You know 
what, why don't you go outside and wash the cars?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe eventually quit that job, and now she baby-sits during the day for a 
family that she says treats her well. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, she is taking English classes in hopes that it will improve her job 
prospects when she returns to Mexico someday. She worries that the 
anti-immigrant sentiment she believes is behind Proposition 187 could make her 
life more difficult, and possibly force her and other undocumented immigrants 
taking classes at public schools to drop their studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, reflecting the thinking of many undocumented domestics, Guadalupe is 
not concerned enough to seriously consider leaving the United States anytime 
soon, regardless of what happens with the proposition. She needs to earn more 
money to help her widowed mother put the family's three youngest children 
through college and high school in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a matter of economics, Guadalupe explained, and America still is the 
land of economic opportunity -- even for an illegal immigrant.

Workers

 Most domestic workers in California--including nannies, cleaners, housekeepers 
and others who work in private homes--are immigrants. According to the 1990 
U.S. census, immigrants accounted for more than 58% of the state's domestics, 
with the figure rising to 80% in Los Angeles County and nearly 69% in Orange 
County.

THE TIMES POLL; HUFFINGTON CUTS FEINSTEIN LEAD TO A FEW POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican U.S. Senate challenger Mike Huffington has crept to within a few 
points of Democratic incumbent Dianne Feinstein, suggesting that the 
hard-fought, frequently nasty contest may go down to the wire with the outcome 
highly in doubt, the Los Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein leads by 4 points among registered voters, 46% to 42%, and her 
margin narrows to 3 points among likely voters, 48% to 45%. Just two weeks ago, 
Feinstein enjoyed a 9-point lead among registered voters and a 7-point margin 
among likely voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lead is within the poll's margin of error," poll Director John Brennan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the poll -- conducted before the disclosure of Huffington's employment of 
an illegal immigrant as a nanny -- illustrated that despite spending more than 
$25 million so far to vanquish Feinstein, Huffington remains an enigma to much 
of the electorate. Asked what they think of the Santa Barbara congressman, 27% 
of voters said they liked him and 44% disliked him -- with 23% saying they did 
not know enough about him to make a judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all this television, he goes into the final weeks of the election with 
almost a quarter of the voters unsure," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein is liked by 41% and disliked by 45%, with only 10% saying they were 
unsure of her. Important to Feinstein, she is ahead among those who are 
uncertain about Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 And Feinstein's supporters are more committed to her than Huffington's are to 
him. According to the poll, only 73% of the Republican congressman's supporters 
described themselves as "certain" to vote for him. Of Feinstein's backers, 81% 
said they would definitely vote for her. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feinstein-Huffington contest has attracted national attention for the 
vociferousness of the mutual attacks. Both candidates have leveled harsh 
accusations against their opponent and have angrily denounced the assaults made 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
 By Oct. 19, the end of the last financial reporting period, they jointly had 
spent almost $36 million, breaking the record for spending in a U.S. Senate 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money spent by Huffington, the heir to a Texas oil and natural gas 
fortune, has come from his own bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to the poll, the negative advertising the candidates have 
splashed across California television screens is coming back to haunt them 
both: 11% who dislike Huffington cite his ads as a reason, as do 8% of those 
who dislike Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, both of these people are disliked," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll questioned 1,235 registered voters, of whom 762 are considered 
likely to vote Nov. 8. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is 3 
percentage points in either direction; for likely voters it is 4 points in 
either direction. Margins of error for smaller subgroups may be larger. 
Participants were questioned Oct. 22-25. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the poll, no single reason accounts for the tightening of the 
Senate race, and the outcome may depend on voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll was taken after both candidates had announced positions on the 
controversial anti-illegal immigration initiative, Proposition 187 -- Feinstein 
opposes it, Huffington supports it. But that issue was a wash among voters, 
with equal percentages of people saying they were more likely or less likely to 
vote for each candidate because of their position. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the poll was concluded before The Times reported that for more 
than fours years Huffington had employed an illegal immigrant as a nanny for 
his two children. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Los Angeles Times Poll demonstrated once again the stunning impact 
that Huffington's accumulated commercials have had on Feinstein, once the most 
popular politician in the state. In March, 1994, before Huffington began 
dominating the airwaves, Feinstein received favorable ratings from 63% of 
registered voters -- meaning that she has fallen 22 points over the course of 
the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But the first-term senator, who rolled to victory in 1992 against little-known 
Republican appointee John Seymour, maintains a stable standing among voters. In 
the last six weeks, her favorability ratings have not markedly changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein is running well among more dependable older voters, winning the 65 
and older age group 48% to 39%, and those 45 to 64 years old by a margin of 49% 
to 41%. The candidates essentially split the votes of those under age 45, who 
are historically less apt to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein is having trouble hanging on to her Democratic base. Among 
Democratic men, 22% said they would vote for Huffington, as did 20% of 
Democratic women. That is more than double the percentage of defectors that 
Feinstein saw in her 1992 race against Seymour, who won only 11% of Democratic 
men and 7% of Democratic women. 
</P>
<P>
 To make it worse, Feinstein also is not doing as well attracting Republican 
women as she did in 1992. Exit polls taken in November, 1992, showed that 
Feinstein won the votes of 26% of Republican women, while only 15% say they 
support her now. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, between the Times poll taken Oct. 8-11 and the current poll, 
Feinstein's standing among Republicans fell 7 points, from 23% to 16%. Most of 
the drop came among self-described moderates and conservatives, the poll found. 
She also lost ground among those making less than $20,000 annually and those 
with a high school education or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington gained among those same groups and also was running well among 
independent voters. Forty-six percent of independents indicated they would vote 
for him, while 39% sided with Feinstein. Huffington also leads among those who 
disliked both candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps tellingly, given the massive amounts of negative artillery unleashed 
in this campaign, voters' impressions of each candidate tend to mirror what 
they have heard on 30-second television ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who like Feinstein, 31% said it was because she has "done a good job 
as senator" and 16% cited her record as mayor of San Francisco. Twelve percent 
said they were attracted by her experience, another 12% said they "just like 
her" and 10% said she stands up for California in Washington -- a major tenet 
of her advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who do not like her seemed to have taken to heart the criticisms by 
Huffington, who castigates Feinstein as a career politician who caters to 
special interests. Twelve percent said she is a career politician, another 12% 
said they "just do not like her," 11% said she had a poor record as San 
Francisco mayor and 10% said she is dishonest or unethical. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who liked Huffington, 16% said they "just like him," 16% said it was 
because he is not Feinstein, 12% cited the use of his own money in the campaign 
and 10% said they favor him because he is a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who disliked Huffington reflected the attacks on him by Feinstein, who 
contends that he is a recent Texas immigrant unworthy of voters' trust. 
Twenty-one percent said he was a carpetbagger, another 21% said he was trying 
to buy the election, 16% said he could not be trusted and 11% disapproved of 
his campaign advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ideas, the idea of cutting government, the idea of reforming welfare, 
really haven't caught on," poll Director Brennan concluded. "It's still more of 
an anti-Feinstein vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Though 11% of those who did not like Feinstein cited her experience as San 
Francisco mayor, her tenure there is clearly paying dividends in the tight 
Senate race. When the contest is broken down geographically, Feinstein not only 
leads as expected in the Bay Area but also in the rest of Northern California, 
which generally votes Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbent senator also leads in Democratic-leaning Los Angeles, but trails 
Huffington in the more conservative surrounding counties. Senate Race Down to 
the Wire 
</P>
<P>
 With less than two weeks left until Californians vote, Democrat Dianne 
Feinstein holds only a razor-thin lead over GOP challenger Rep. Mike Huffington 
in the U.S. Senate race.

Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,659 adults statewide, by telephone, Saturday 
through Tuesday. Included in the sample are 1,235 registered voters and 762 
likely voters. Interviewing was conducted in English and Spanish. Telephone 
numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the state. Random-digit 
dialing techniques were used so that listed and unlisted numbers could be 
contacted. The sample was weighted slightly to conform more closely with census 
figures for sex, race, age and education. The margin of sampling error for the 
total sample and the sample of all registered voters is plus or minus 3 
percentage points; for likely voters it is 4 points. For certain subgroups the 
error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results can also be affected by other 
factors such as the wording of questions and the order in which they are 
presented.

U.S. TURNS AWAY SHIP LADEN WITH GOODS FOR HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a week after the United Nations lifted three years of crippling 
international sanctions against Haiti, the U.S. military intervention force 
here turned away the first major shipment of raw materials, spare parts and 
medicine crucial to jump-starting the Haitian economy and rebuilding the 
nation's health and welfare, U.S. commanders confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After three days of waiting offshore in Port-au-Prince harbor this week, the 
1,500-ton American container ship Ocean Fleet was forced to turn and sail late 
Wednesday for the neighboring Dominican Republic. It took with it vital 
components that Haitian business people said could have employed about 6,000 
workers at more than 20 factories throughout the capital, most of them idled by 
the embargo that was lifted 13 days ago with President Jean Bertrand-Aristide's 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, according to commanders of the U.S. military force that now 
controls the vital Port-au-Prince seaport: Title 46 of the U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulations, covering civil transportation safety rules in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Applying U.S. federal safety standards in a sovereign port hundreds of miles 
off America's shores, the U.S. military's Harbor Defense Command found, after 
examining the first major shipment to Haiti of formerly embargoed goods and 
materials, that three of the 76 containers loaded and cleared in Miami three 
days before were stowed in a way that presented "a potential hazard" to the 
port and the 1,000 American troops encamped there. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Mike Rauworth, who effectively serves as harbor master 
and port captain in Port-au-Prince, confirmed Thursday that he signed the order 
refusing permission for the vessel to dock largely because a single container 
was packed with a potentially hazardous combination of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a potential risk that would be very serious if it came up 
in a U.S. port fully equipped with reliable infrastructure and firefighting 
facilities . . . and we've got none of that here," Rauworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that calcium hypochlorite and sulfuric acid were packed in a single 
container and stowed at the bottom of the ship's hold, directly violating 
American regulations. Those regulations, he said, indicate that the combination 
of the chemicals and their location on the ship presented "an explosion hazard, 
a fire hazard and the possibility of a dangerous gas mixture." 
</P>
<P>
 Rauworth described in detail the human disaster that could result if a fire or 
explosion occurred involving calcium hypochlorite -- a chemical needed to 
purify Haiti's fouled drinking-water supply. It had been barred under the 
strict U.S.-sponsored trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 But his decision to turn away a vessel containing crucial cargo at so critical 
a moment for Haiti presented another risk: the potential for conflict between 
the needs of the U.S. military force sent to stabilize Haiti and the needs of 
the people they came to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the impression that were there not hundreds of American troops at the 
port, we would have unloaded," said an angry Richard Sassine, whose 
long-established R. Sassine Co. shipping agency consigned the Ocean Fleet and 
its cargo. "If the U.S. Coast Guard wasn't there, Port-au-Prince would be 
pumping with work already." 
</P>
<P>
 Without tens of thousands of new jobs, said Sassine, other Haitian business 
people and Aristide himself, no real stability can come to the impoverished 
nation. Haitian unemployment is estimated at 80%, at a time of unprecedented 
popular expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite U.S. pledges of $200 million in foreign aid, the heart of future job 
creation lies in Haiti's private sector, a minority group already wary of 
Aristide's populist past and now flabbergasted by the decision to turn away the 
ship bearing the goods they need to create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people who have been out of work for months who believed the minute 
the military regime was finished, they'd be back to work in a week. It has been 
a month now, the boat came and went, and it really didn't make any sense to me 
at all," said one company director, who predicted that the decision to reject 
the ship will cost his factory 200 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sassine stressed that his company deliberately gave priority in its first 
post-sanctions shipment to Haiti's privately owned medical manufacturers, 
health-goods producers and assembly-plant owners -- "whatever factories are 
standing by and waiting to start work." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now is the time we're looking at the future," he said. "It's time to go back 
to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph Boulous could not have agreed more. The director general of Haiti's 
largest pharmaceutical manufacturer, Pharval, was awaiting seven huge 
containers aboard the Ocean Fleet filled with syrup bases he needs to produce 
drugs ranging from aspirin and vitamins to sophisticated antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely it's a big hang-up in restarting a factory like this, which 
employs 125 people and supplies medicines at affordable prices . . . and these 
things are crucial to us starting up again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty nervous they (the U.S. military) will continue turning back ships. 
It'll be a mess. It's a second embargo all over again . . . and I don't really 
understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sassine said he plans to unload the three offending containers at the port of 
the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo, and attempt again to dock the Ocean Fleet 
in Port-au-Prince in a week or two. 
</P>
<P>
 But he stressed that his agency, Haiti's oldest with 40 years of experience, 
has shipped the same chemical combinations into Port-au-Prince in the past. And 
he emphasized that the ship was fully loaded, officially cleared and presumably 
checked by the U.S. Coast Guard before it left Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Coast Guard's apparent failure to detect the chemical combination 
before the ship left Florida, Rauworth said it lacks the resources to inspect 
every shipment leaving American shores. The onus of responsibility in complying 
with safety standards, he said, is on the ship's owner and agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Rauworth also stressed that the U.S. military is well aware of the need to 
restart Haiti's economy and facilitate commercial trade through the port. But 
he conceded that the Harbor Defense Command's policy is to give priority at the 
port to the U.S. military's strategic needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commercial usage here is certainly something to be encouraged and to be 
facilitated within the appropriate capabilities and mission of the military," 
he said. "But the plain fact is that it cannot displace the main mission of the 
military." 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating the task, Rauworth said, is another simple fact: There is 
no local civilian in charge of the Haitian Port Authority at the moment. There 
was, but he was arrested Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Authority chief Max Paul, a close aide of the capital's now-exiled police 
chief Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, is now under U.S. military detention, 
after the Caribbean military force in charge of port security helped document a 
kickback scheme in which Paul allegedly had siphoned more than $1 million from 
the port authority's pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not here to run a civilian port authority," Rauworth said. "I am here to 
make this port a safe and functional one. . . . Safety standards don't 
recognize international borders."

<P>
 Three young children were stabbed to death Thursday, and police interrogated 
their estranged parents into the night in what authorities said may have been a 
child custody dispute turned tragic. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Nat Holmes said neither Dora Buenrostro nor her husband, 
Alejandro, had been dismissed as suspects in the multiple murders. 
</P>
<P>
 At daybreak, the mother led police to the bodies of the first two victims 
inside her apartment. The body of the third child was found about 12 hours 
later, bringing a tragic end to a daylong search for the youngest of the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jacinto Police Sgt. Barry Backlund identified the victims found inside the 
apartment as Susana Buenrostro, 9, and her brother, Vincent, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 They were found after Dora Buenrostro had rushed to the local Police 
Department about 6:30 a.m. and beckoned police to return home with her. She 
maintained that her estranged husband was inside her home, and she feared for 
her children's safety, Backlund said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Dora Buenrostro's statement, an all-points-bulletin was issued for 
Alejandro Buenrostro. He was found at his job in Los Angeles about noon and 
taken into custody by Los Angeles police without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7 p.m. Thursday, the body of a young girl, believed by authorities to be 
the couple's third child, Diedra, 4, was found about 10 miles away, in the 
unincorporated community of Lakeview, a police spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-year-old girl said children she had been baby-sitting told her about a 
body in an abandoned post office. She found the body strapped to a car seat and 
ran to a nearby home to call police. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors in the well-kept apartment complex told reporters that despite thin 
walls and close quarters, they heard no commotion early Thursday until police 
arrived. A police spokesman said no witnesses had been located. 
</P>
<P>
 Several blocks away, psychologists and mental health counselors spent a 
wrenching day at the elementary school, helping classmates and teachers cope 
with the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're about as emotionally spent as adults can be after a day like this," 
Supt. Bill Marshall of the San Jacinto Unified School District said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students arrived on campus, already whispering the rumor of the slayings. 
Counselors gingerly broke the news to others, and then spent the day counseling 
students and staff on how to cope with their grief and confusion, Marshall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers of Alejandro Buenrostro, 37, a salesman at Colortone Lacquer Co. in 
the Silver Lake area, about 80 miles from San Jacinto, said they were stunned 
that he was considered a suspect in his children's deaths.  
</P>
<P>
 His supervisor said Buenrostro was already at work when other employees showed 
up about 7:40 a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not doing any surmising, but Alex is well-liked, and everybody here 
knows him as a devoted father," the employer said. "This whole thing is weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Velia Cabanila, who shares a common wall in the four-unit garden apartment 
with the Buenrostro family, said the only noise she heard after midnight 
Wednesday was "a thump" around 3 a.m. Thursday, but then all remained quiet 
until police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, she had heard arguments on many occasions, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother was not very friendly, and I could usually hear a lot of arguing 
going on, screaming at the kids," Cabanila said. 
</P>
<P>
 On various occasions, she said, she allowed the children to use her bathroom 
because their mother was gone and the apartment was locked. 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, Adela Bond, said the mother was friendly. Bond said she 
believed that the mother frequently took the children to Los Angeles to spend 
weekends with their father. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had separated more than a year ago and appeared to informally share 
the children's custody, neighbors and Buenrostro's employer said.

COURT UPHOLDS SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court, in a ruling that could help O. J. Simpson's 
defense, reaffirmed Thursday that novel scientific evidence must be shown to be 
generally accepted by scientists before it can be admitted in a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The court, ruling on a field sobriety test, had been asked to substitute the 
state's stricter standard for admitting scientific evidence such as DNA results 
with a federal test that gives more discretion to the trial judge. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 6-1 vote, the justices declined, saying the Orange County case before 
them did not warrant a modification of the standard requiring general 
acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's decision to reaffirm the more conservative state standard means 
that Simpson's prosecutors will have to show that the DNA techniques and 
analysis used in the case are accepted by a cross-section of the scientific 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court case has been widely followed because of its implications 
for Simpson, and the court Thursday took the unusual step of issuing a summary 
of its opinion to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "DNA has to meet the . . . standard just like any other kind of scientific 
evidence," said Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Brentford Ferreira, who wrote a 
friend-of-the-court brief urging the court to retain the state standard, "but 
we are confident that it will." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court has not yet ruled specifically on the 
admissibility of DNA, and lower courts have been divided over whether certain 
kinds of DNA evidence meet the state standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren had urged the court to rule that "general" acceptance 
does not require a consensus or majority opinion by scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office also wanted the high court to decide that 
statistical analysis used to determine the probabilities of a false DNA match 
could be admitted without meeting the standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Although those suggestions "may well have merit," the court majority wrote, 
the drunk-driving case "is not a good vehicle for addressing them." 
</P>
<P>
 "The general acceptance test has been the rule in California for over 40 
years," said Ferreira, "and you don't willy-nilly throw out that kind of 
precedent. By retaining the general acceptance test, trial judges will look to 
scientists rather than deciding themselves the question of reliability." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had been divided over the standard the court should adopt. Some, 
including the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, feared that a 
looser standard would enable defendants to submit so-called "junk" science in 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Frederick R. Millar Jr., Lungren's DNA coordinator, said he 
was disappointed that the court failed to adopt the more flexible rule but 
pleased that the justices seemed willing to consider modifying the standard for 
DNA at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the case was watched because of its implications for DNA evidence, it 
dealt with a field sobriety test known as horizontal gaze nystagmus, or HGN. 
</P>
<P>
 The test determines a person's ability to focus on a moving object. A police 
officer usually holds a pen or a finger a few inches from the suspect and asks 
him to follow it with his eyes without moving his head. If the suspect's pupils 
jump, some investigators believe, it is a sign of intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
 The case stemmed from the December, 1990, arrest of William Michael Leahy for 
speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol on Pacific Coast Highway in 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Leahy could walk a straight line and stand on one leg, but he failed the 
vision test. 
</P>
<P>
 A blood test 90 minutes later showed that his alcohol level exceeded the legal 
limit. His attorney, however, argued that the level rose after the arrest 
because of a drink he consumed five minutes before he was stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Leahy was convicted, but a Court of Appeal later overturned the conviction 
because no hearing had been held to determine whether the vision test was 
generally accepted by the scientific community. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Chief Justice Malcolm 
Lucas, upheld the lower court and ordered Orange County prosecutors to submit 
the test to such a hearing. If it meets the state standard, the court decided, 
the conviction can be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Marvin Baxter dissented, arguing that "one need not be a rocket 
scientist to be able to observe and assess the reaction of the suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Orange County Dist. Atty. Donald Clarence, the prosecutor in the case, 
said he expects the trial court will rule the test admissible. He also said he 
doubts that the Supreme Court ruling will affect many convictions because the 
vision test rarely is the crucial evidence leading to guilty verdicts in drunk 
driving cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, he said, the defendants would have been convicted even without 
submission of the test results. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County Deputy Public Defender Alan J. Crivaro predicted the test 
results would be ruled inadmissible, forcing the prosecutor to retry Leahy. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to focus on a moving object can be impaired by caffeine and 
influenza, he said, and 10% of the population exhibit the vision symptoms 
associated with intoxication at all times.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; PROPOSITION 188; EDUCATOR RECANTS HER ADS BACKING MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Declaring she is committed to ensuring "the public health of all citizens," a 
public school educator who stars in a TV ad for Proposition 188 recanted her 
testimonial Thursday on behalf of the tobacco industry initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, if I could turn back the clock, the commercial would never have 
been made," said nonsmoker Nancy Frick, a vice principal at a Kern County 
middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement released by opponents of the measure, Frick said 
producers of the TV spot agreed to pull it off the air effective Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188 critics, who had deplored the ad, immediately hailed Frick's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is reassuring that a teacher, a role model for children, would have the 
courage to admit she made a mistake," said Carolyn Martin, a teacher and 
co-chair of the No on 188 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Ads for the initiative indicate that it would place new restrictions on 
smoking, but in fact it would repeal 150 local ordinances on the books now that 
generally are tougher on smokers. The ballot measure, if passed, would 
supersede local ordinances, and could force repeal of a new statewide law that 
is more stringent than the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188's backers include cigarette maker Philip Morris U.S.A. It is 
opposed by a coalition of health groups, including the California branch of the 
American Lung Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Stitzenberger, strategist for the Yes on 188 campaign, said that after a 
story about the ad appeared in Wednesday's editions of The Times, Frick was 
inundated with harassing telephone calls. "I know they (opponents) put her 
through hell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stitzenberger said sponsors agreed to remove the TV commercials, along 
with similar radio spots featuring Frick, so that the educator can once again 
"enjoy peace and calm" in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (opponents) tried to shoot the messenger," he said, dismissing the flap 
over the commercial as insignificant. He said the campaign's stated theme -- to 
stop minors from gaining access to tobacco -- still will be delivered during 
the final days before the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping up its campaign, the tobacco industry began airing the ad in Los 
Angeles on Monday, with Frick pitching Proposition 188 as the best defense 
against minors' use of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spot, Frick says she has worked with children for 24 years. "I know 
what motivates them, and I understand the way they think. I want to stop kids 
from smoking. Proposition 188 will do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Stitzenberger said that Frick was a friend of someone in the Proposition 188 
campaign and that her husband had been featured in an earlier campaign mailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a nonsmoker, my decision was based on my belief at the time that a 
statewide, uniform smoking policy would be in the public interest. I was 
mistaken," Frick said in her statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Frick could not be reached at Mountain View Middle School in Lamont. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Knepprath, a spokesman for the drive against Proposition 188, denied that 
Frick was badgered into changing her mind about the commercial. He said his 
group spoke with Frick only after she had decided to try to get the ads taken 
off the air. 
</P>
<P>
 John Chavez, superintendent of the 2,600-student district in Lamont, said 
Frick had called him to ask if she could appear in the ads. Chavez said he told 
Frick that she could do what she wanted as an individual. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday, Chavez said, Frick changed her mind. Chavez said that he 
received 10 to 15 complaints after he was quoted in The Times and that if Frick 
received similar calls they "could be construed as harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Chavez added, Frick reversed herself when "she realized, like I did, that 
Proposition 188 is a weaker position" than the new state law that goes into 
effect Jan. 1. "All we care about is that we don't want kids to smoke."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; NEWS ANALYSIS; GOVERNOR; ONE WORD TOUCHES OFF ID CARD 
FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL and AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When all the rhetoric is stripped away, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and 
Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown agree on the basic concept of workers 
being required to have a card that offers proof to prospective employers that 
the holder is legally residing in the United States. There are differences on 
the details, but general agreement on the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week the issue of identity cards mushroomed into a volatile campaign 
dispute between Wilson and Brown, apparently triggered by a misunderstanding 
Tuesday over a single word. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday morning, Brown was standing beside a huge mock-up of a "National 
Identity Card" bearing Wilson's photo -- not a flattering one -- and vital 
statistics that understated his height by five inches -- and declaring: 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson's latest idea is about big government, about Big Brother, and 
about a police state. It's a bad idea and it is wrong," Brown said, standing 
outside the Department of Motor Vehicles building in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, Wilson told reporters: "I have never, ever supported a 
national ID card." And he added, "I have never seen such hysteria on any 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The episode illustrates how it is possible in the heat of an election campaign 
for rhetoric to overtake facts, how an old subject can suddenly be new when 
thrust in a different context, and how a campaign can seize on a hot issue if 
it seems to be headed in the direction the candidate wants to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Brown's campaign handlers have detected a dramatic swing of opinion in 
the polls during the past two weeks away from support of Proposition 187, the 
ballot measure to deny education and non-emergency health care to illegal 
immigrants. Until this week, polls had found overwhelming support for the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown opposes Proposition 187; Wilson supports it. The Brown campaign believes 
that voters switching from "yes" to "no" on Proposition 187 are likely to vote 
for Brown, the state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 The ID issue first came up early in the week when Susan Yoachum, political 
editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, interviewed Wilson on the subject of ID 
cards and wrote a story for Wednesday's editions of the Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
 In her article, she related saying to Wilson at the end of the interview: 
"You're governor, you're reelected governor, 187 passes. Will there be a card 
that people have to carry in California to prove that they are legal 
residents?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson replied with a simple "yes," according to Yoachum. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing Wilson said was substantially different than he had been saying for 
the last two years on the issue. But the use of the word carry put a new 
perspective on the issue, along with the proximity to the election, when 
experts have expected the ballot measure to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of everyone having to carry cards, and not just those who might be 
called on to demonstrate they are in the country legally while seeking a job, 
for example, put fresh light on the idea of ID cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown seized on the issue Thursday. She had scheduled a routine news 
conference in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, she said in a solemn voice: "Rather than just tell you what I 
think about it, I'd like to show you what I think about it. I'd like to ask you 
in the press to come with me, take a little trip, a journey with me, and I'll 
show you what I think of Pete Wilson's latest cockamamie idea, which is a 
national ID card for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Staff aides handed out directions and everyone drove to the Department of 
Motor Vehicles building in Hollywood, puzzled as if they'd just been plunked 
down in the middle of a scavenger hunt. At the DMV, Brown stood by the mock-up 
of the Wilson ID card and criticized Wilson for wanting to create a vast new 
bureaucracy and spend billions of dollars on identity cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson met with reporters, including Yoachum, in San Francisco Thursday and 
said he had not heard Yoachum say the word carry in her question. 
</P>
<P>
 Cards would be needed, he said, only when someone was applying for a job or 
entering a child in school. They would not have to be carried all the time. 
This was a critical difference in the meaning of his response, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Brown forces already were in motion to capitalize on a political 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown chose the DMV office because she has used the DMV as an example of waste 
and inefficiency during the Wilson Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's going to create this card and administer it?" she asked. "It sounds to 
me like a cross between the IRS and the DMV, which sounds to me like a 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Brown's complaints against Wilson's card proposal is that the 
facilities would have to be created from scratch. She has proposed that the 
federal Social Security card be made tamper-proof and be used as the 
identification needed for obtaining a job. But all existing Social Security 
cards would have to be replaced with tamper-proof versions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brown's own economic plan, of which she has distributed 1.8 million copies, 
she minimizes the cost of converting to new Social Security cards, saying the 
DMV can issue driver's licenses for $7.40 each. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Brown proposed the costs of each card be covered by charging a 
fee to the cardholder.

RUSSIAN HIJACKER FOILED; MAN KILLS SELF IN EARLIER INCIDENT 
</P>

<P>
 Police foiled an attempt to hijack an airliner carrying 164 passengers at a 
Moscow airport Thursday, hours after a man in southern Russia blew himself up 
when commandos stormed the airliner he had seized. 
</P>
<P>
 Police at Moscow's southeastern Vnukovo airport quickly arrested a man who 
tried to commandeer a Tu-154 airliner early in the evening, the Ministry for 
Emergency Situations said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One terrorist has been seized without risk to passengers," ministry spokesman 
Karl Smolikov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Security sources said earlier that the hijacker took over the airliner and 
demanded a ransom of $2 million as well as a pistol, a radio, cigarettes, an 
English translator and a map of Iran and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The airliner had been due to fly to the town of Mineralniye Vody in Russia's 
increasingly lawless southern frontier region, site of a rash of unsuccessful 
and sometimes bloody kidnapings this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other incident, a man who seized a Yak-40 plane in Makhachkala, capital 
of the crime-ridden Russian republic of Dagestan, blew himself up when police 
commandos stormed the plane in thick fog at dawn Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-pound explosive charge ripped a huge, jagged hole in the roof of the 
plane and badly mangled the hijacker's body.

RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT SURVIVES OUSTER VOTE; POLITICS: NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION IS 
DODGED BY SLIM MARGIN. SUPPORT FOR YELTSIN'S ECONOMIC PLAN SEEN AS FRAGILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Russian government narrowly survived a no-confidence vote Thursday and 
vowed to press ahead with a squeaky-tight budget aimed at squelching inflation 
by the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 But Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin won the backing of only 54 lawmakers 
out of a legislature of 450, showing just how fragile support remains for 
President Boris N. Yeltsin's economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bruising attack, Communist Party leader Gennady A. Zyuganov called the 
Russian government a "thief-ocracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky advised Cabinet ministers to "resign 
this year, otherwise you will be arrested next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Together with other opposition leaders, they urged Parliament to oust a 
government they accused of impoverishing and humiliating Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bid to bolster Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin sacked his agriculture minister just 
hours before the no-confidence vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Viktor N. Khlystun, a moderate who had held the post since 1991 and was 
unpopular with the farm lobby, was replaced by Alexander G. Nazarchuk, a leader 
of the hard-line Agrarian Party. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight hours of impassioned speeches, the Duma, or lower house of 
Parliament, voted 194-54 in favor of the no-confidence motion, with 55 
abstentions. But the measure failed to get the 226 votes needed to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the weakest performance for the Yeltsin team since the new Duma was 
elected 10 months ago. The president's few remaining allies went so far as to 
warn their fellow lawmakers that, if they tried to dump Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin 
might dissolve Parliament once again, as the Russian constitution now permits 
him to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid rising prices, increasing crime and unemployment, and a growing gap 
between rich and poor, public support for Chernomyrdin's policies is tepid at 
best. A recent survey of 6,000 Russians found 14% trust their government; 54% 
do not. 
</P>
<P>
 But after five years of intense political turmoil, the desire for stability is 
overwhelming. Although 23% of those polled held a positive view of Chernomyrdin 
and 40% dislike him, 23% said they wanted him to resign, while 41% said they 
would prefer he stay. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, around the corner from a gleaming Duma building that has just 
undergone a $17-million face lift, several thousand workers gathered to demand 
the wages that have gone unpaid for months as part of the government's battle 
against inflation. "Give us a chance to survive and not go bankrupt!" one 
banner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar protests organized by trade unions in Chelyabinsk, Novosibirsk, 
Yekaterinburg, Orenburg, Vladivostok and other cities drew tens of thousands of 
people, Itar-Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Radical coal miners who were once key Yeltsin allies demanded that the 
president and government resign. Others only pleaded for salaries sufficient to 
feed their children and for protection against unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to the Duma, Chernomyrdin vowed to pay government debts to all 
workers by year's end. But he warned lawmakers that subsidies to ailing defense 
plants will no longer be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply do not need so many weapons anymore," Chernomyrdin told lawmakers.  
</P>
<P>
 Defense spending is to increase to 22% of all budget expenditures in 1995, up 
1% from this year, he said. The Farm Belt's share of the budget will remain 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The government hopes to squeeze the federal budget deficit to 7.8% of the 
gross national product in 1995, down from 8.8% this year, he said.

DESPITE BOYCOTT ORDER, 50% TURN OUT ON 1ST DAY OF MOZAMBIQUE ELECTIONS 
</P>

<P>
 About half of Mozambique's 6.4-million electorate voted in the country's first 
free ballot Thursday, despite confusion from a last-minute boycott order by the 
main, ex-rebel opposition, electoral officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many voters had either not heard of the boycott decreed by Mozambique National 
Resistance (Renamo) leader Afonso Dhlakama or went ahead and voted as a form of 
insurance in case the former rebel chief changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Dhlakama was under intense pressure to do so, despite his claim that the 
result from the ballot box would be fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, the European Union and neighboring countries including 
South Africa urged him to take part in Mozambique's first democratic elections, 
which are for Parliament and the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Frank, a spokesman for the independent National Electoral Commission, 
told a news conference that there were no reports of intimidation despite the 
boycott call. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not have exact statistics at this point. But our observation was that 
at least 50% of the electorate voted, which is a sign that voting is going 
normally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6,000 monitors observed the voting, which is due to continue today. 
Frank said it did not appear necessary to extend balloting for an optional 
third day. 
</P>
<P>
 Some diplomats said Dhlakama may have called the boycott in a bid to 
strengthen his bargaining position with the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front 
(Frelimo) and its leader, President Joaquim Chissano, expected to win the 
parliamentary and presidential polls.

POLITICS; STRATEGISTS HOPING NOV. 8 BECOMES DAWN OF INDEPENDENTS' DAY; THERE'S 
A BUMPER CROP OF THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES THIS FALL. CAMPAIGN ORGANIZERS SAY THE 
TREND COULD LEAD TO AN ELECTORAL REALIGNMENT IN 1996. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mounting voter discontent with both political parties is boosting independent 
candidacies in this midterm election campaign and signaling the potential for 
far-reaching political realignment in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of independent and third-party candidates for the House, Senate and 
governorships around the country is higher than for any off-year election since 
the recession year of 1982. While few of these insurgents are likely to 
prevail, some organizers -- inspired by the big presidential vote for Ross 
Perot in 1992 -- are hoping to use the experience and support to spark another 
independent bid for the White House in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot veterans are planning a campaign built around procedural reforms aimed 
at the center, while another possible independent bid for the White House looms 
on the left from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has said he is considering such a 
move because of President Clinton's failure to live up to his liberal campaign 
promises. A recent survey by the Times Mirror Center for People and the Press 
indicated there is even more support for a new party among liberals than among 
moderates who backed Perot. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of two independent candidacies in 1996 -- one from the center 
and one from the left -- could splinter the electorate and transform the 
American political scene, a shift that proponents of the independent 
candidacies believe is just what the voters want. 
</P>
<P>
 "If nearly 20% of the people voted for Perot in 1992 after he showed himself 
to be totally incapable of being President, my feeling is if we ran somebody 
who was really qualified, we could do even better," said Nicholas Sabatine, who 
led Perot's drive in Pennsylvania and is now chairman of the Patriot Party, an 
offshoot of the Perot movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to be assured their candidates get spots on ballots in all 50 
states by 1996, Sabatine said. 
</P>
<P>
 As they themselves acknowledge, Sabatine and others with similar ambitions 
face enormous obstacles in mounting a credible bid for the White House. They 
need to organize grass-roots support, gain ballot access and, perhaps above 
all, find a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, the Patriot Party is fielding gubernatorial candidates in 
Pennsylvania and Alaska. Two allied groups, the American Party in Oregon and 
the Independence Fusion Party in New York, both drawing heavily from the ranks 
of Perot supporters, also are running candidates for governor in their states. 
</P>
<P>
 Pathways of American political history are littered with the bones of 
third-party movements that either died aborning or soon fizzled. The 19% of the 
vote Perot got in 1992 was the largest third-party share since ex-President 
Theodore Roosevelt got 27% on the Bull Moose ticket in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
 For a third party to become competitive, says Democratic pollster Mark 
Mellman, it has to find a candidate who is either "fabulously wealthy," like 
Perot, or already famous and respected. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the names being bandied about by veterans of the Perot movement, 
according to Gordon Black, erstwhile Perot pollster now active in the 
Independence Fusion Party, are former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin L. 
Powell, 1992 Democratic presidential contender Paul E. Tsongas, former 
Republican Sen. Warren G. Rudman of New Hampshire and Connecticut Gov. Lowell 
P. Weicker Jr., an ex-Republican who won the governorship as an independent in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Third- and fourth-party proponents are encouraged by polls registering rising 
levels of voter disgust with major parties and alienation from the political 
system. A survey taken last summer by the Times Mirror Center showed that 53% 
of those interviewed wanted a third major party, a jump of nearly 10% since 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means more than just the fashionable gobbledygook that polls sometimes 
reflect," says David Gillespie, Presbyterian College political scientist and 
author of "Politics at the Periphery: Third Parties in Two Party America." 
"These results basically say that the American people are no longer committed 
to a two-party system." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the declining loyalty to the major parties, according to Johns 
Hopkins political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg, is the negativism that now 
dominates election campaigns and other political debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the past 20 years, both sets of politicians, Democrats and Republicans, 
have been busy explaining to voters that other sets are a bunch of no-good 
scum," he said. "And each side has been so diligent at providing evidence that 
they have both succeeded." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsberg and other analysts also say voter frustration has grown during two 
decades of divided government -- when Republicans for the most part controlled 
the White House and Democrats dominated the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the 1992 election ended divided government, inter-party 
antagonisms have hindered Democratic President Clinton's efforts to break the 
gridlock and have fueled insurgent candidacies. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Winger, who heads the Coalition for Free and Open Elections, a 
clearinghouse for information about legal requirements for third parties, 
counts 266 third-party independent candidates for the House, compared to 168 in 
1990; 48 independent candidates for the Senate, as against 17 in 1990; and 60 
running for governorships, compared to 38 four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The caliber of third-party candidates is a lot higher than it used to be," 
Winger said. "People with resources and credentials are running." He cited Wes 
Watkins, a seven-term former Democratic member of the House from Oklahoma who 
polls show has 15% of the electorate backing his independent bid to become 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 In Virginia, former Republican state Atty. Gen. Marshall Coleman is getting 
about 10% of the vote in his independent Senate race against Democratic 
incumbent Charles S. Robb and Republican challenger Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the most active party in this fall's congressional races is the 
Libertarian, which has 82 House candidates on the ballot. The Libertarian 
Party, created in 1971 as a champion of individual freedoms, bills itself as 
the nation's third-largest party. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1992 the Libertarian program, which seeks to eliminate most federal 
agencies, gained less than three-tenths of 1% of the vote for presidential 
candidate Andre Marrou, a Las Vegas real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of the Libertarian experience, insurgent candidates having the most 
impact this fall are advocating more moderate reforms. Although they cover a 
wide range of politics, their programs all reflect growing mistrust of 
government. Here's a look at such candidacies in three states. 
</P>
<P>
 * New York. Wealthy businessman B. Thomas Golisano's willingness to spend as 
much as $10 million of his own money is making him a significant presence in 
the New York gubernatorial race. With polls showing Golisano, an Independence 
Fusion Party candidate, getting 5% of the vote, Republicans fear that his 
conservative rhetoric will siphon off support from their candidate, George 
Pataki, and help reelect Democratic incumbent Mario M. Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, Golisano's campaign manager, is hoping his candidate will get at least 
50,000 votes, enough to ensure ballot status for the party in 1996. His 
platform advocates term limits, campaign finance reforms and giving voters the 
right to ballot initiative, referendum and recall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maine. The independent candidate with the best chance of chalking up a 
victory Nov. 8 appears to be Angus King, a former public television talk show 
host, businessman and aide to ex-Maine Democratic Sen. William Hathaway. King's 
message is that government is too big and too inefficient and he wants to make 
it smaller and more representative. "He wants to get government out of people's 
faces," said his spokesman, Dennis Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 By dipping into his own wallet, King is matching his Democratic opponent, 
former Gov. Joe Brennan, in spending and is running close to him in the polls. 
Republican candidate Susan Collins lags behind. 
</P>
<P>
 * New Mexico. Former Democratic Lt. Gov. Roberto Mondragon, the Green Party 
candidate for governor, is not expected to win against incumbent Democrat Bruce 
King and Republican challenger Gary Johnson, who is leading. But Mondragon's 
backers are counting on him getting enough votes -- more than 5% -- to earn the 
Greens status as a "major party," which would mean ballot status and a 
state-financed primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our focus is not only environmental, we're very much interested in political 
reform, changing the campaign finance law and term limits on officeholders," 
says Green Party chairman Abraham Gutmann, who blames much of New Mexico's 
problems on the state's long domination by the Democratic Party. Third-Party 
Prospects? 
</P>
<P>
 For a third party to be competitive, says Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, it 
needs a candidate who is "fabulously wealthy" or already famous and respected. 
Former Ross Perot pollster Gordon Black says these names are mentioned as 
possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
 * Colin L. Powell, Ex-Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman 
</P>
<P>
 * Paul E. Tsongas, 1992 candidate for President 
</P>
<P>
 * Warren G. Rudman, Ex-senator from New Hampshire 
</P>
<P>
 * Lowell P. Weicker Jr., Independent Connecticut governor

'AMERICA WILL STAND WITH YOU,' CLINTON REASSURES ISRAELIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel must not "give in to the doubts that terror brings," President Clinton 
exhorted Thursday as he pledged to the Israeli people that "your journey is our 
journey, and America will stand with you now and always." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, Clinton was continuing an 
18-month effort to minister to the Israeli psyche -- telling a nation scarred 
by recent acts of terror that peace has begun to yield true benefits and that 
the final goal has come within sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once in this area, you were shunned," Clinton said. "Now, more and more you 
are embraced." Israelis, he said, have begun to see "that they can free 
themselves from siege." 
</P>
<P>
 Watched from the visitors' gallery by the parents of Israeli Cpl. Nachshon 
Waxman, who was kidnaped earlier this month by extremists and killed in an 
unsuccessful rescue attempt, Clinton said Americans share Israel's grief over 
its losses. But achieving a stable peace, he said, is the best way to put an 
end to such attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all the bloodshed and all your tears, you are now far closer to the day 
when the clash of arms is heard no more and all the children of Abraham -- the 
children of Isaac and the children of Ishmael -- will live side by side in 
peace," Clinton said. "It is the promise of making sure that all those who have 
sacrificed their lives did not die in vain." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the terrorists, Clinton said, "is to make the people of Israel, 
who have defeated all odds on the field of battle, to give up . . . on the 
peace by giving in to the doubts that terror brings to every one of us. But 
having come so far, you cannot give up or give in." 
</P>
<P>
 And in a final, highly personal fillip, Clinton recounted to his listeners how 
his onetime pastor, a mentor now dead, had enjoined him to stand by Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen years ago, he said, he and Mrs. Clinton visited Jerusalem's holy 
sites with their pastor as part of a religious mission. A few years later, 
"when he became desperately ill, he said he thought I might one day become 
President." At that point, Clinton recounted, his friend and teacher told him, 
" 'If you abandon Israel, God will never forgive you.' He said it is God's will 
that Israel, the biblical home of the people of Israel, continue for ever and 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's emotional and largely extemporaneous speech was the latest effort in 
a campaign that he began early in his presidency after a meeting with Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, as Clinton has recounted since, Rabin pledged that he would 
"take risks for peace." Clinton, in turn, asked what steps the United States 
could best take to help the process of peace. The Israeli leader urged the 
President to use his office to reassure Israelis, who face a series of deeply 
unsettling decisions about relinquishing land in return for promises of peace 
from neighboring Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
 Those doubts within Israel have deepened of late, both because the nation now 
faces the extremely divisive issue of whether to relinquish the long-occupied 
Golan Heights to Syria -- something that Rabin had previously pledged not to do 
-- and because of recent, dramatic terrorist acts.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton saw that division on clear display before his speech, as Rabin and 
opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu both delivered long talks outlining their 
contrasting positions on the question of trading land for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Netanyahu, whose Likud bloc opposes trading away any of the territory now 
under Israel's control, sharply attacked any suggestion that international 
forces on the Golan, perhaps including Americans, could adequately provide for 
Israel's security if the land were returned to Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only Israeli forces on the Golan can protect Israel," Netanyahu declared. 
</P>
<P>
 And he broke off from his Hebrew text to speak in English as he chided Clinton 
for not accepting Israel's position that Jerusalem must remain, undivided, 
under Israeli control. Jerusalem "is a united city under Israeli sovereignty, 
and it will always be so," Netanyahu declared. Clinton, like his predecessors 
in the White House, has taken the position that the final status of Jerusalem 
should be determined as part of an overall settlement of all issues between 
Israel and its Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's mission of reassurance over the past 1 1/2 years has suited him, 
given his deep beliefs both in the power of words and in the importance of 
psychological factors in human affairs. Ever since Rabin talked to him about 
the issue, the President has taken repeated opportunities -- interviews on 
Israeli television, public speeches and other occasions -- to repeat the basic 
message that Israel does not stand alone and that Israelis can now afford to 
drop their long-ingrained siege mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's Knesset speech provided the highest-profile forum that Clinton has 
yet had for making those points. He seized the opportunity with considerable 
energy, despite an exhausting schedule in which he spoke until well after 
midnight Wednesday night with Jordan's King Hussein in Amman, then left near 
dawn to fly to Damascus for almost four hours of meetings with Syrian President 
Hafez Assad before flying here for still more meetings, the speech and a press 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton began his speech with a recitation of the steps the United States has 
taken to "minimize the risks of peace" -- efforts to enhance Israel's military, 
particularly its air force, joint projects to develop defenses against missile 
attacks such as those that hit Israel from Iraq during the Persian Gulf War, 
and steps to expand Israel's economy. And he repeated U.S. pledges to work for 
the elimination of the remaining parts of the Arab boycott of Israel and to 
maintain Israel's strategic edge in military power. 
</P>
<P>
 His speech began visibly to gain energy toward the end, as Clinton abandoned 
his prepared text and warmed to a series of scriptural images -- a favored 
rhetorical device for this President steeped in the southern tradition of 
biblical politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeating a line he had used the previous day before the Jordanian Parliament, 
Clinton reminded his listeners that the Koran recounts Mohammed's saying to 
people of other faiths that "there is no argument between you and us. God will 
bring us together, and unto him is the homecoming." And Moses, he said, had 
told his people as they prepared to cross the River Jordan that they must 
"choose life so that you and your descendants may live." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are willing to make peace with their neighbors are choosing life, 
Clinton said, "and once again, America is proud to walk with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's speech was warmly received by the legislators. And he heard 
similarly enthusiastic greetings from city crowds along his way Thursday. 
Landing at Tel Aviv's airport after flying from Damascus in late afternoon, the 
President passed enthusiastic crowds that lined the streets as his lengthy 
motorcade entered Jerusalem to the sound of pealing church bells. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the President heads to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for a speech to U.S. 
troops and discussions of security issues.

CLINTON DROPS WALKING TOUR OF JERUSALEM; MIDEAST: TIRED PRESIDENT CANCELS PLANS 
AMID ARAB-ISRAELI CONTROVERSY OVER HOLY CITY'S FUTURE. FIRST LADY GOES IN HIS 
PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What President Clinton wanted to see in Jerusalem was what every visitor wants 
to see -- the walled Old City, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the Via 
Dolorosa, the Western Wall of Judaism's Second Temple, Al Aqsa Mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before he set foot in the city Thursday, Clinton ran into the most 
sensitive and probably the most difficult issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict -- 
the future of Jerusalem and its religious shrines -- and in the end he canceled 
the walking tour his staff had carefully planned for days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on my last leg -- I'm really tired," Clinton said, arriving an hour late 
from Damascus, the third capital of his six-nation tour, and looking very weary 
indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The President instead dispatched Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Western Wall, 
Judaism's holiest site as the only major part that remains of King Herod's 
temple. The couple had toured the Old City more than a decade ago on a visit 
the President recalled in a speech to Israel's Parliament later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid elaborate security precautions -- the virtual clearing of all the men and 
women who had been praying at the wall, a check of its numerous chinks and 
holes and a cordon of hundreds of police -- Mrs. Clinton went to the wall for 
about 15 minutes Thursday evening and prayed there briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton's fatigue was real, the political controversy had proved 
insoluble -- even to veterans of the Middle East peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis, who describe Jerusalem as "the united and eternal capital of the 
Jewish people and State of Israel," objected strongly to Clinton's request that 
Mayor Ehud Olmert not accompany him on the planned excursion, lest that act 
signify U.S. acceptance of the Israeli claim -- as Olmert said it would. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a united Jerusalem," Olmert said. "When the mayor visits along with 
the President, it is just an issue of protocol. But the minute someone says to 
a mayor you cannot visit a certain party (of the city), a political problem is 
created. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "What is more important is that we agree among ourselves. As long as we agree 
regarding the status of Jerusalem, and we show determination and strength and 
unity regarding its future, its status and its integrity, other things can be 
important but won't be determining." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians, who envision Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of an 
independent Palestinian state, said they would close the doors of Al Aqsa to 
Clinton if he were accompanied by Olmert, an opponent of Israel's accord with 
the Palestine Liberation Organization on Palestinian self-government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see Jerusalem as an area where the status is not yet defined or decided," 
said Ziad abu Zayyad, a prominent member of the PLO's mainstream Fatah faction. 
"Any official visit by a public personality to East Jerusalem may imply that 
they recognize it as part of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 Most countries, including the United States, did not recognize Israel's 
incorporation of Arab East Jerusalem into the boundaries of its capital city 
after the 1967 Arab-Israeli War when it was captured from Jordan; in fact, most 
other countries regard the status of Jerusalem as an unresolved international 
question and have kept their embassies in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen compromises, such as a group of religious leaders to greet the 
President and show him the shrines, were proposed but pleased no one. 
</P>
<P>
 Faisal Husseini, a minister in the Palestinian Authority, commented, "The 
situation is that now the whole issue of Jerusalem is on the agenda, and every 
move takes on political implications so that everything is sensitive. Once 
again, Israel failed to prove it has full authority over Jerusalem." 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton decided that problem was just too difficult to resolve in an 
evening and canceled the tour, American and Israeli security personnel 
rejoiced. They had grown increasingly anxious about the plan for the late-night 
walking tour through the Old City's maze of crowded streets and narrow 
alleyways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to line his whole route with police, shoulder to shoulder," a 
senior officer said. "We already had 2,500 men in the Old City, and we were 
going to have to close it in its entirety to protect the President. This was a 
huge undertaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Elaborate security measures have been taken to protect Clinton in the wake of 
a series of terrorist attacks here this month by Muslim militants belonging to 
the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas.

SYRIANS HOPE TO PROFIT FROM MIDEAST PEACE DIVIDEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tareq Shallah listens to the tedious drumbeat of peace negotiations in the 
Middle East and hears the sweet clinking of coins -- for him and his Syrian 
friends, for sure. And profits for the unknown Israelis who have always been 
the enemy, well, why not? 
</P>
<P>
 As head of the Syrian Assn. of Travel Agents, Shallah has already seen the 
beginnings of the peace dividend. Two years ago, with peace talks new and 
flailing, his company lured nary an American tourist to Syria. But last year, 
with the escalating pace of the talks, he sponsored two U.S. tour groups. This 
year, he has booked six. And for next year, more than two dozen are on the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, even the specter of droves of Israeli tourists to Syria's historic old 
crusader fortresses -- such as the 600 a day who are expected to swoop into 
Jordan following this week's peace treaty signing -- no longer chill his blood. 
"If you look at it from a business point of view, as a source of income, then I 
guess we have to put up with it!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Thursday's visit by President Clinton to the Syrian capital, the first by 
an American President in 20 years, Shallah and others are growing increasingly 
optimistic -- and impatient -- that it is time for years of flirtation with 
peacemaking to finally pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Syria have seen that our president is really serious about 
improving relations with the U.S. and they hope the U.S. could give something 
to Syria so they won't let down our president," Shallah said. "In that sense, 
most people are looking to President Clinton and his visit as maybe a savior." 
</P>
<P>
 There was anxiousness among Damascenes who awaited concrete news from the 
closed-door talks, a feeling that Syrians have too long paid the price of 
leading the Arab rejectionist front against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you been to Israel? Is it true their lifestyle is very elevated, better 
than ours?" asks a curious oil-company employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Better than anywhere else in the Middle East," he is assured. He turns to a 
friend and nods knowingly. 
</P>
<P>
 From the old, domed Hamadiya souk -- where enthusiastic merchants were 
offering a 50% discount Thursday "for Clinton," to Damascus University, where 
students quietly debated the news -- there was a sense with the American 
President's visit that a chink in the old armor of war may be opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Syrians who listened to Hafez Assad's cautious remarks Thursday came away 
convinced that the Syrian president meant what he said about peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Assad said this morning that peace is something strategic; that is 
what I understand," said one Damascus University professor. "And today when we 
listened to President Clinton and he gave a commitment that the U.S. will carry 
on to bring a settlement, we believed." 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton gave signs that he had hoped for more from his nearly four-hour 
meeting with Assad, many Syrians were disappointed that neither the U.S. nor 
Syrian leadership appeared to make concrete strides toward breaking the logjam 
of the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 And many were equally disappointed that Clinton made no move to remove Syria 
from the list of nations supporting terrorism, an act that would clear the way 
for badly needed new foreign investment. Largely skeptical of Jordan's quick 
peace agreement with Israel, they wonder if Syria will get the kind of break on 
foreign debt relief that welcomed Jordan's king to the peace fold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to stay in my country and get a high enough salary to live on, 
but to do this we have to cancel the external debt and get U.S. aid for Syria. 
And until now we don't hear anything," said a young university graduate who is 
thinking of going abroad to seek work. 
</P>
<P>
 Manar Alwan, a 23-year-old French literature student in Damascus, said peace 
has its own rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow we feel we are near an ending," Alwan said. "And you feel something 
different when you make a peaceful relation with your enemy. You start feeling 
safety in your home." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Syrians are talking about peace with words such as dignity 
and honor. It is hard to find anyone who disagrees with Assad's insistence on a 
full recovery of the occupied Golan Heights, or with the banners that drape 
Damascus proclaiming, "Peace, But Peace With Honor." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Syria still isn't ready to leap toward peace appeared clear in 
the English-language Syrian Times published on the morning of Clinton's 
arrival. The paper put the news of Jordan's peace treaty with Israel near the 
bottom of the page -- enclosing the word treaty in quotation marks -- while 
leading the page with reports of Palestinian demonstrations against the 
"treaty." 
</P>
<P>
 "Partial and unilateral solutions . . . will continue to be rejected by us," 
warned the daily Al-Baath, mouthpiece of the ruling Baath Arab Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's visit was carried live on Syrian television, from the long line of 
ceremonial handshakes at the airport to the departure of Air Force One into the 
Syrian afternoon, the camera lingering as it disappeared into the blue. 
</P>
<P>
 A clutch of Syrian officials talked animatedly on the tarmac. And the business 
began in Damascus of trying to understand what, if anything, the plane had 
brought.

CLINTON SEEKS CUTOFF OF HAMAS' MIDEAST FUNDING; TERRORISM: PRESIDENT ASKS 
SYRIA, SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT TO PUT A STOP TO ALL SUPPORT FOR THE GROUP. HE'S 
MADE LITTLE PROGRESS. 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton is privately asking the rulers of Syria, Saudi Arabia and 
Kuwait to choke off support for the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, but he 
has made little headway, U.S. officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has promised to launch an all-points offensive against Hamas, which 
claimed responsibility for last week's bombing of a Tel Aviv bus that killed 23 
people as part of its crusade against Arab-Israeli peace agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts on terrorism say Hamas uses Syria as a base of operations and raises 
money from private citizens in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, both close U.S. allies. 
All three countries are on Clinton's tour of the Middle East this week. 
</P>
<P>
 When the President raised the issue of terrorism with Syrian President Hafez 
Assad on Thursday, he got a frosty response. Clinton said he told Assad that 
support for Hamas or other terrorists is "inconsistent" with the pursuit of 
peace, and he quoted Assad as expressing "deep regret" over the killings in Tel 
Aviv by saying: "We have to end the killing of innocents." 
</P>
<P>
 But Assad did not repeat that sentiment publicly at the two presidents' news 
conference here, and refused to be drawn into a discussion of Syria's role as a 
haven for leaders of Hamas and other terrorist groups -- the chief reason his 
country is kept on the official U.S. list of terrorist nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher acknowledged that the issue remains a 
sticking point between the United States and Syria. "The allegation is not that 
the Syrian government itself engages in terrorism, but they do provide some 
comfort (to terrorists) by providing a place for them to be," he said. "We're 
going to continue to press that." 
</P>
<P>
 In Saudi Arabia, where Clinton is scheduled to make a brief stop today, the 
royal family has repeatedly assured the United States that it is not sending 
any official money to Hamas. But government officials have warned that they 
don't believe they can do much to stop private fund raising for the militants. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the money raised among wealthy Hamas sympathizers in Saudi Arabia, 
Kuwait and other Persian Gulf states is ostensibly for charitable purposes such 
as the schools and medical clinics that Hamas runs in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. But U.S. officials charge that some of the money ends up supporting 
terrorist activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that there are limits on any government's ability to stop 
private fund raising. We have the same problem here in the United States," one 
official said. "But there are some things the Saudis can do." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Saudi citizens have funded paramilitary training camps for Islamic 
militants, reportedly including some Hamas members, in Yemen, Sudan and 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher is expected to bring the issue up in a meeting today with Saudi 
Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al Faisal. Officials said it is not 
clear whether Clinton will mention the problem when he sees King Fahd. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Syria, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait could stop all support for Hamas from 
their territory, the terrorist group would still survive, U.S. officials 
acknowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Hamas raises money from private sympathizers in several other 
countries -- including the United States, which Israeli officials charge is the 
group's main base of operation outside the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas also relies on donations from grass-roots adherents in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, where most of its members live. And the group reportedly has 
received millions of dollars in subsidies from the radical Islamic government 
of Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has vowed to redouble efforts by the FBI to 
determine whether Hamas has engaged in any illegal fund raising or other 
actions in the United States, and will encourage the Saudis to do likewise, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has created a new "inter-agency group" to look at the 
problem, and it met in Washington this week for the first time, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group plans to determine whether new laws are needed to make it easier to 
prosecute supporters of overseas terrorists, and to see whether laws now on the 
books can be enforced more diligently. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officials noted that the crime bill passed by Congress in August 
includes a section that makes it a crime to "knowingly" raise funds for 
terrorist operations. The previous law did not have such a requirement, and was 
difficult to enforce because it was open to challenge on constitutional 
grounds, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, U.S. ambassadors around the Middle East asked all Arab 
governments to issue public condemnations of Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 McManus reported from Washington and Lauter from Damascus.

BRAZIL'S MOST WANTED ARRESTED AT AUTO SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Following a five-month chase, Brazil's most-wanted fugitive was returned to 
prison here Thursday after his love of flashy imported cars led to his arrest 
at an annual auto show. 
</P>
<P>
 Castor de Andrade, head of an organized crime syndicate that runs the 
country's $2-billion-a-year illegal lottery, was arrested in Sao Paulo as he 
toured the nation's largest auto show with his niece and nephew. He had been 
recognized by a Rio de Janeiro couple at the event who told police. 
</P>
<P>
 The aging crime boss, his gray hair dyed black, sported a mustache and a fake 
beard as he was taken into custody Wednesday without incident in the middle of 
the showroom. Police had shadowed him after being tipped off by the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am who you think I am," he told the officers when they asked him for 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade, whose organization until last year operated openly on the streets of 
Rio de Janeiro with virtual impunity for decades, is the last of its top bosses 
to avoid capture. Thirteen other "godfathers" have been convicted and sentenced 
as a result of a crackdown on the organization that began early last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade escaped from police in May when he fled his home after being notified 
that officers were coming to take him to prison to begin serving a six-year 
sentence for racketeering. Andrade had been free on bail.  
</P>
<P>
 Andrade's attorney, Helio Bialski, said Thursday that Andrade had been hiding 
out since May in Curitiba, a city of 2 million 225 miles southwest of Sao 
Paulo, Brazil's largest city. He arrived in Sao Paulo by bus early Wednesday 
morning, his attorney said, and came to the auto show to buy a car before 
driving to Rio de Janeiro to turn himself in. 
</P>
<P>
 Sao Paulo Police Capt. Sassi Darci dismissed that claim. "He had no intention 
of giving himself up," Darci said.  
</P>
<P>
 Andrade's organization allegedly funds and controls the samba schools that run 
Rio de Janeiro's Carnaval and has given millions in bribes and payoffs to 
hundreds of police officers, judges and politicians.

U.S. WILL INTRODUCE RESOLUTION IN U.N. TO LIFT BOSNIAN ARMS BAN IN 6 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, acting under a controversial congressional 
mandate, will formally submit a resolution today to the Security Council to 
lift the ban on arms sales to embattled Bosnia-Herzegovina, a U.S. official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution, the official said, will call for an end to the ban in six 
months. Many U.N. diplomats see little chance of council approval. Some predict 
that the Clinton Administration will never put the proposal to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But the American official insisted that the sentiment of other council members 
had not been fully tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to see the formal reaction from the other countries," he said. "After 
we get the responses, we will decide what we will do and when." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the embargo resolution and a related U.N.-NATO "agreement in 
principle" on air strikes appear to be the last remnants of the 
Administration's early policy of advocating "lift and strike" -- lift the 
embargo on selling arms to the Muslim-led Bosnian government while launching 
air strikes at the Bosnian Serb aggressors. 
</P>
<P>
 The "agreement in principle" on air strikes was worked out by negotiators from 
the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at U.N. 
headquarters Thursday. U.N. officials said details will not be announced until 
the agreement is approved by the North Atlantic Council and Secretary General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is understood that the two sides agreed that U.N. officials would 
submit three or four proposed targets to NATO planes when Bosnian Serbs violate 
exclusion zones of Sarajevo and Gorazde or endanger lives of U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 It would then be up to NATO pilots to choose one of the targets for attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from the Administration, NATO had said it wanted authority for 
a "more robust" response to violations -- the right to attack strategic targets 
such as munitions dumps, arms factories and military headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the United Nations, including its military commanders, have long insisted 
that retaliation must be "proportionate" -- wiping out of a tank or artillery 
piece or other heavy weapon in violation of the exclusion zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the United Nations said, the Serbs would retaliate against lightly 
armed peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Congress has passed a law providing that no U.S. money will be used 
to enforce the embargo, if the Security Council fails to approve the resolution 
by Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution is opposed by Britain, France and Russia -- all with veto 
power.

RACIALLY RESTRICTED SCHOLARSHIP IS REJECTED; LAW: RULING BY FEDERAL APPEALS 
COURT SETS THE STAGE FOR A SUPREME COURT CONFRONTATION. CASE CHALLENGES 
UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that college scholarships that are 
restricted to students based on their race are unconstitutional.  
</P>
<P>
 The broadly worded, unanimous opinion by the three-judge panel of the U.S. 4th 
Circuit Court of Appeals sets the stage for a Supreme Court confrontation on 
whether two-thirds of the nation's colleges can continue to set aside at least 
some scholarships exclusively for minority students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the criteria by which men and women can be judged, the most pernicious 
is that of race," wrote Judge H. Emory Widener of Richmond, Va. "The casual 
invocation of benign remedial aims" is not enough to justify a state-funded 
scholarship that bars some students from applying solely because of their race, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision invalidates the University of Maryland's Banneker Program, which 
awards all-expenses-paid scholarships to promising black students. In a closely 
watched lawsuit, the state-funded program had been challenged by a Latino 
student who was deemed ineligible to apply, even though he had a 4.0 grade 
average in high school and a score of 1,340 out of 1,600 on the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Podberesky, now 22 and a first-year medical student at the University 
of Maryland, is entitled to the $35,000 in scholarship aid he should have 
received as an undergraduate, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a decisive victory, and it's an important statement," said Richard 
Samp, an attorney for the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative group 
that supported the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed. That's all I can say now," said Evelyn Cannon, the 
state's chief of litigation. The U.S. Department of Justice and the NAACP Legal 
Defense Fund had supported Maryland in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, an obscure lawyer in the George Bush Administration set off a 
national controversy over "race-targeted" scholarships when he advised 
officials of the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz., that they could not earmark 
scholarship money exclusively for African American students.  
</P>
<P>
 To do so violated federal civil rights law, said Michael L. Williams, an 
Education Department official who is black. However, faced with a barrage of 
criticism, the Bush White House quickly rescinded Williams' order and announced 
that it would study the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 In February of this year, the Clinton Administration reversed the stand 
entirely and gave its approval to "race-targeted financial assistance" at the 
nation's colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the doors to post-secondary education to remain open for minority 
students," said Education Secretary Richard W. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy does not concern scholarship programs that give an edge to 
minority students, but rather those that take applications only from students 
who are, for example, black, Latino, Native American or Asian. It was not clear 
if the ruling would affect other, specifically targeted scholarships, such as 
those directed to women. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the General Accounting Office found that race-targeted 
scholarships make up only a small portion of all scholarships -- 5% in 
undergraduate schools, 3% in graduate schools and 10% in professional schools.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the study also found that at least two-thirds of the nation's 
higher-education institutions had at least one of these scholarship programs. 
University officials said they are especially important for attracting minority 
students to highly competitive fields of study, such as a graduate chemistry 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 In a landmark case in 1978, the Supreme Court said universities may not use 
racial quotas in admission but that they may use race as a "plus factor" in 
favor of minority applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton Administration officials said "race-targeted" scholarships are 
legal if they are intended to "remedy past discrimination," or if they are 
needed to "achieve a diverse student body." 
</P>
<P>
 The University of Maryland certainly has a history of racial discrimination. 
The late Justice Thurgood Marshall, though a native of Baltimore, could not 
apply for admission to the University of Maryland Law School. As a lawyer, he 
later won a ruling striking down that discriminatory admissions policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the appeals court said Thursday that this discrimination is too far in the 
past to justify a current discriminatory policy that favors black students. 
</P>
<P>
 It ordered that the university no longer "require that the applicant (for a 
Banneker scholarship) be of the African American race."

GOVERNOR; WILSON, BROWN SET STATE RECORD FOR FUND RAISING; THE TWO CANDIDATES 
HAVE COLLECTED MORE THAN $47.5 MILLION IN CONTRIBUTIONS. REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT 
CONTINUES TO RAISE MORE THAN HIS DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT. 
</P>

<P>
 Pete Wilson and Kathleen Brown have set a record in the amount of campaign 
money collected in a race for governor, according to preliminary finance 
reports from the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Between them, the Republican incumbent and the Democratic challenger have 
raised $47.5 million over the past two years -- with Wilson collecting $26.8 
million compared to $20.7 million for Brown. The figures, released Thursday, do 
not include several million more expected to be reported by the end of the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the two leading candidates for the office -- Wilson, then a U.S. 
senator, and his Democratic opponent, Dianne Feinstein, collected a total of 
$45 million in their pursuit of the office, according to figures compiled by 
California Common Cause. The amounts raised and spent in that race far exceeded 
any previous governor's campaign in California history and, by one measure, 
more than any gubernatorial contest in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Council of State Governments, the 1990 California race -- 
counting all candidates' campaigns -- was the most expensive race for governor 
in the United States up to that time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest campaign filings in the California race, which covered the Oct. 
1 to Oct. 22 period, Wilson continued to show his ability to raise more than 
state Treasurer Brown, collecting $3.9 million to her $2.4 million. At the end 
of the period, Wilson had $1.7 million on hand compared to $533,000 for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Brown campaign said it was expected that Wilson as the 
incumbent would raise more. "We believe we will continue to be competitive 
financially until the election," said Brown campaign spokesman John Whitehurst. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson aides, with their candidate leading in opinion polls, are pleased to be 
ahead on the money-raising side of their contest. "We're right on track for 
where we want to be," Wilson aide Dan Schnur said.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY; NOW THE MEDIA ARE 'TOO OBJECTIVE' FOR SHAPIRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The usually unspoken but omnipresent issue of race sent the media manipulators 
into action at the O.J. Simpson trial Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Robert L. Shapiro made one of the trial's most open efforts 
to manage the news when he challenged the reporting ability of the three 
journalists who make up the pool of reporters allowed inside the courtroom. He 
said they had not conveyed what he considered hostile questioning of possible 
jurors who are African American.  
</P>
<P>
 The small pool of reporters was created when Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito 
decided to limit the number of journalists observing voir dire, the questioning 
of jurors. The pool members give descriptions of the courtroom scene to 
colleagues who only have access to an audio feed of the proceedings. Such pools 
are a standard practice in the news business. For example, when the President 
attends church or another event in a limited space, he's accompanied by a pool 
of reporters, who fill in their colleagues afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro attended the trial pool's midmorning briefing, and listened to an 
account of the questioning of a 71-year-old African American man from 
South-Central Los Angeles. As is the case with all the pool reports, Linda 
Deutsch of Associated Press, USA Today's Sally Ann Stewart and Jim Hill of CNN 
gave a clear, factual and unadorned account. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not what Shapiro had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said he wanted to hear what the "public is getting" from the 
reporters doing the briefing. Standing in front of the camera, with the poolers 
off to the side, Shapiro said: "I don't disagree with the report." But he 
didn't like it, either. If there had been cameras in the courtroom, the 
viewers' "impression would have been different" than the one conveyed by the 
pool reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospective black jurors, he said, were "being questioned differently" than 
white jurors. But when Shapiro was pressed to give examples, he declined to do 
so, invoking instead former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart's comment 
on defining obscenity -- that he knows it when he sees it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a subtlety that is not coming out," he said. "What you don't know is 
how it was said." The pool reporters, he said, should report "not only the 
wording, but the body language." 
</P>
<P>
 What was occurring in the courtroom, he said, was "an insidious effort to get 
black jurors removed. It may be subtle," he said, but "anyone in the courtroom 
can see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, pool member Deutsch commented that it was the first time in her 
career she had been criticized "for being too objective." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, co-defense lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. went up to the press area 
on the 12th floor to launch a variation of the assault. He stopped near the 
cameras always on duty there, and began talking to reporters about Deputy Dist. 
Atty. William Hodgman's questioning of the man from South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 He objected to Hodgman asking the man if he knew what a polygraph was. "They 
didn't ask that question to anyone else," Cochran said. "It was demeaning." 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the defense's tactic quickly reached the 18th-floor offices of Dist. 
Atty. Gil Garcetti. Plans were made for a news conference by Hodgman and 
co-prosecutor Marcia Clark. "Judging from what I've read and seen, we've got to 
do it," press aide Mike Botula told a few reporters waiting in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgman and Clark emerged from an elevator and stood before the cameras. Only 
Hodgman spoke. He denied accusations of hostile questioning. "This appears to 
be just the latest in a series of efforts to manipulate public opinion," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd heard Hodgman's questioning of the south L.A. man, who seemed angry. From 
what he told of his life, he had good reason to be so. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd heard the same story many times from African American men. He'd been 
mistakenly arrested once, and the police refused to listen to his story. He was 
released only when witnesses said the cops had arrested the wrong man. Another 
time, he said, he was driving a new car, showing it off to a relative. The 
police stopped him, questioning him closely in the apparent belief he had 
stolen the car. 
</P>
<P>
 As I listened, I could hear the old man's anger welling up as Hodgman bored 
in, doing his job but showing no mercy as he tried to find out if the man 
favored Simpson. "You're getting me riled up," the man said at the end. "I feel 
like I'm on trial." 
</P>
<P>
 But other reporters listening in the pressroom had a different impression than 
I did. They thought the prospective juror was being unresponsive to Hodgman's 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That points up the wisdom of Shapiro's suggestion that jury selection should 
be televised. Court rules forbid showing the jurors, but the camera would show 
the body language and facial expressions of the attorneys and Judge Ito. This 
is particularly important when the subject is race. L.A. doesn't need any 
disagreements and rumors about whether white prosecutors Hodgman and Clark are 
being racist in questioning African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Shapiro's credibility, the defense took the opposite 
position recently when it opposed televising the hearings next month on 
admitting DNA evidence, another crucial stage in the trial. This untimely 
defense reversal makes Shapiro more of a media manipulator than an advocate of 
an open courtroom.

THE SIMPSON CASE: A DAILY UPDATE; TRIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A look at some of the key events in the O.J. Simpson murder trial on Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Summary: After an unusually acerbic session between a prosecutor and a 
prospective jurors, defense attorneys accused prosecutors of treating black 
jury candidates differently than others. Government lawyers dismissed that 
charge as public relations work by the defense and said they were treating 
prospective jurors fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Court action: Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito heard arguments in the 
defense's latest attack on evidence seized from Simpson's Ford Bronco, which 
was burglarized while in police custody. Ito did not rule, however. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outside the court: A lawyer for Simpson warned that any attempt to 
distribute purloined copies of a videotape of Simpson's 1985 marriage to Nicole 
Simpson will be met be a lawsuit. "Such an act, in addition to being illegal . 
. . is also morally offensive, repugnant and irresponsible," said Anthony 
Michael Glassman, a lawyer for Simpson.

PANEL BLASTS RESALE OF 'LEMON' CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New cars that normally would be classified as "lemons" are being resold to 
unsuspecting buyers, and the head of the Assembly's Consumer Protection 
Committee wants the practice stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "In brief, the manufacturers are packaging their lemons as peaches," said 
Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame), the committee's chairwoman."Only 
the fruit, in many cases, is rotten." 
</P>
<P>
 Speier and other committee members heard Thursday from disgruntled car buyers 
who complained about buying nearly new cars from dealers only to find out 
later, after a run of constant troubles ranging from squeaky doors to bad 
brakes, that the vehicles had a history of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California has a so-called lemon law, Speier said there is a 
loophole. 
</P>

 Under state law, a new car is declared a lemon if it cannot be fixed after 
several attempts. The buyer is given a replacement. The car labeled a lemon can 
be resold by the manufacturer, but only after it has been repaired and its 
title changed so that future buyers know it was a lemon. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem, the committee was told, is that some manufacturers are buying 
back the faulty autos before they are officially listed as lemons and reselling 
them without telling buyers about their history.

 Authorities Thursday found a bone in one of six small areas where they are 
focusing the search for the remains of 10-year-old Kevin Collins, who 
disappeared more than a decade ago in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not know if it's dog, deer, bear, human. We do not know," Allegan 
County Sheriff David Haverdink said. 
</P>
<P>
 Searchers were concentrating on 6-by-6-foot areas scattered over six wooded 
acres and identified as different from surrounding areas by two tracking dogs 
and a heat-seeking helicopter, Haverdink said.

FLORIDA INCREASES DEPORTATIONS TO OPEN CELL SPACE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants charged with crimes will face deportation even before they 
go to trial under a pilot program announced Thursday by Florida and the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deporting criminal aliens is an important part of the strategy to open up 
space in our prisons for more dangerous offenders," Gov. Lawton Chiles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida has already begun deporting some illegal immigrants serving time for 
nonviolent crimes. Eligible inmates receive clemency in exchange for agreeing 
to be deported and not return. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new program, to be tested for three months, immigrants will be deported 
after they are charged instead of being brought to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida spends about $60 million a year on the 2,700 immigrants in its 
prisons. The new program came under immediate criticism from civil libertarians 
and from Chiles' challenger, Republican Jeb Bush. A Bush spokesman dismissed 
the program as a "political stunt."

DEMOCRATS GAINING IN KEY RACES, NEW SURVEYS SHOW; CAMPAIGN: GOP ROLLS OUT 
ATTACK ADS DEPICTING RIVALS AS HYPOCRITES, LIARS AND FAILURES. ELECTORATE'S 
FOCUS ON LOCAL ISSUES SEEN GIVING EDGE TO INCUMBENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With a smattering of new polls showing Democrats closing the gap in several 
key races, the Republican Party announced three new attack ads Thursday that 
portray Bill Clinton and Democrats as hypocrites, failures and liars. And the 
White House responded by accusing the Republicans of intellectual dishonesty. 
</P>
<P>
 The activity, from the tightening of the races to the charges and 
countercharges, seems typical of the final days before an election. Yet amid 
the latest round of rhetoric and statistics, there are signs of subtle shifts 
in public sentiment and political strategy that suggest Democratic Party losses 
on Nov. 8 might not be as severe as many experts have predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 One factor, according to a new poll, is that voters are focusing more on local 
issues as elections draw closer, a trend likely to benefit incumbents because 
they have more political heft than newcomers. Most incumbents are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Another element is President Clinton's rising popularity in response to recent 
foreign policy successes, sentiment that may be trickling down to his fellow 
party members. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's improving fortunes, which have been apparent in polls for a week, 
showed up again Thursday in a poll by CNN/USA Today. It found that the number 
of Americans who approve of his job performance stood at 48%, compared with 46% 
who disapprove. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, several prominent Democrats also seemed to be closing in races that 
only two weeks ago looked like shocking losses: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Massachusetts, a strong performance in a debate this week apparently 
helped Sen. Edward M. Kennedy continue to pull away from Republican challenger 
Mitt Romney. According to a poll released Thursday by the Boston Globe and 
WBZ-TV, Kennedy is now leading by 20 points. Only two weeks ago it was a dead 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Florida, two new polls showed that Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles had 
either pulled even or passed Republican Jeb Bush, son of former President 
George Bush, only three weeks after Chiles was down by 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * In New York, two other polls show a statistical dead heat between Gov. Mario 
M. Cuomo and Republican challenger George Pataki, a state legislator. The 
number of undecided voters in both surveys has grown. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Pataki's support appears to be bleeding away to an independent 
candidate, while Cuomo's is stable. The polls were conducted after Cuomo 
received the surprise endorsement of New York City's Republican mayor, Rudolph 
W. Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
 A new poll by the Times Mirror Center for People and the Press in Washington 
also found considerably more support this week for Democratic congressional 
candidates than a few weeks ago, though it found that other factors, besides 
Clinton, were driving the change. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 47% of registered voters said that they are likely to vote Republican 
versus 44% Democratic, a significant narrowing from the 52%-40% margin that 
Republicans enjoyed Oct. 9 in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the survey, which polled 1,577 registered voters between Oct. 20 
and 24, suggested that Republicans hold a wider lead among those people 
considered most likely to vote, based on their past voting patterns. Among that 
group, Republicans still held a 51%-43% advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Democrats are doing better, the Times Mirror poll suggests, is that 
voters are thinking more about local issues as Election Day nears. The 
percentage of voters who say that local issues are important has risen 11 
points to 38% in the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 That in turn tends to make them look more favorably on incumbents because they 
have the advantages of seniority and political clout. Indeed, the percentage of 
people who said that they were inclined to vote for an incumbent has risen by 6 
points to 55% in the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also possible, the Times Mirror poll authors suggest, that voters think 
more positively about incumbents because Congress is now in recess and 
legislators are home campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour acknowledged at a 
press conference here that Democrats are gaining in many races. However, he 
argued that a shift is to be expected in the late days of a campaign, a time 
when undecided voters often turn to their traditional party. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour announced that the Republican National Committee is about to spend $2 
million to air three new ads on local stations in 25 states attacking the 
Democratic Party and Clinton in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 One ad asks voters: "Are you really fed up with Congress? Well, on Nov. 8 
you've got a chance to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Another says: "Their power is crumbling, the Clinton Democrats. Now they're 
lying about Republicans."  
</P>
<P>
 The third, playing off a recently leaked White House memo about ways to cut 
the deficit, charges that "behind closed doors the Clinton White House is 
discussing cuts in Social Security and Medicare and billions more in tax 
increases." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials around the country are expected to announce today the states 
in which those ads will run. It was unclear whether they will appear in 
California, except on Cable News Network. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration reacted quickly. White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta 
charged that the Republican ads are a sign the other side is "obviously 
worried" about a Democratic surge. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, echoing Panetta, called a briefing at 
the White House to criticize a national platform that has become the 
centerpiece in the agenda of 355 Republicans running for Congress. Every 
Republican who signed the so-called "contract for America" has pledged to vote 
for cutting taxes and passing a balanced-budget amendment.

BOOST FROM GIULIANI LIFTS CUOMO BACK INTO TIGHT CONTEST; POLITICS: POLLS SHOW 
NEW YORK GOVERNOR AND GOP CHALLENGER ARE NOW IN A DEAD HEAT. NUMBER OF 
UNDECIDED VOTERS HAS GROWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three days after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani broke party ranks to endorse Gov. 
Mario M. Cuomo for reelection, the race in New York state has narrowed 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Two polls show a statistical dead heat between Cuomo and his Republican 
challenger, state Sen. George Pataki. Significantly, the number of undecided 
voters in both surveys has grown. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliani's endorsement, plus the growing strength of B. Thomas Golisano, a 
Rochester, N.Y., businessman who is seeking the governorship as an Independence 
Fusion Party candidate, appear to have caught Pataki -- the front-runner for 
months -- in a political pincers. 
</P>
<P>
 Golisano, 52, the chairman of a national payroll company, has pledged to spend 
up to $10 million of his own money on his campaign. The polls show Golisano, 
who supported independent presidential candidate Ross Perot in 1992, siphoning 
votes from Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Giuliani chipping away at Pataki downstate and Golisano chipping away 
upstate, the whole election becomes less well-defined and more uncertain than 
it was," said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Public Opinion 
Poll, which now shows Pataki ahead of Cuomo by 1 percentage point, 37% to 36%, 
with Golisano at 8% and 17% undecided. A month ago, the group found Pataki 
leading Cuomo, 44% to 38%. 
</P>
<P>
 A New York Post/Fox 5 poll showed Pataki leading Cuomo 39.5% to 35.4%, with 
Golisano at 6.5% and the rest undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 The margin of error in both polls put the race effectively even. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have an unpopular incumbent and an unknown challenger," Miringoff said. 
"Neither has closed the sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliani's backing of Cuomo gave the 62-year-old governor's reelection effort 
a psychological lift. But it is unclear how that will translate into votes, 
especially because the mayor subsequently has announced $800 million in new 
spending cuts, further reducing services, in order to balance New York City's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuomo needs a strong turnout in New York City to offset pervasive weakness 
upstate. Polls show only that a third of voters statewide approve of his 
performance in office.  
</P>
<P>
 "On Election Day, they (Cuomo's advisers) will pray for rain north of the 
Bronx," said a political consultant who has run campaigns for both Democrats 
and Republicans. "It's a wild contest all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Wild may be an understatement. With plots and dark promises of revenge, the 
race could be scripted from the pages of a Gothic novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), who recruited Pataki, and other Republicans 
have threatened to field a candidate against Giuliani if the mayor runs again. 
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), who polls show to be in an easy race for 
reelection against Republican Bernadette Castro, so far has refused to endorse 
Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan is mad because the governor met during the Democratic State 
Convention with the Rev. Al Sharpton, a preacher and political activist who was 
then opposing Moynihan for the Democratic nomination. Moynihan crushed Sharpton 
in the Democratic primary in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the intrigue, real estate developer Abraham Hirschfeld is seeking 
retribution against Cuomo, who blocked Hirschfeld when he tried to run for 
lieutenant governor four years ago. Cuomo also opposed his bid to buy the New 
York Post. Hirschfeld is underwriting an ad campaign portraying a hellish 
version of New York -- including a body bag, a chalk drawing of a corpse, 
rubble-strewn lots and "going out of business" signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Mario Cuomo's New York," Hirschfeld's ads charge. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to portray Pataki as D'Amato's pawn, some Cuomo commercials show 
a newspaper photograph of the senator leading Pataki by the hand, with the tag 
line: "George Pataki? Maybe we should just call him Al." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Cuomo ads take the theme further, alleging that D'Amato has "treated 
government like his private preserve, dolling out contracts and favors to his 
cronies, fending off ethics charges and criminal probes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, D'Amato has tapped his pal George Pataki to be our governor. . . . 
Imagine what they'd do to us in Albany," these commercials conclude. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to capitalize on Cuomo's longstanding opposition to the death penalty, 
a Pataki commercial features a weeping mother whose son was murdered. "I blame 
it on Cuomo and his liberal policies," she says. "Cuomo does not care about the 
victims of crime. He cares about the criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Pataki advertisement, resembling a video game, shows a seemingly 
endless list of taxes and fees that the Republican candidate charges Cuomo 
supported during his 12 years in office. The list almost spills off the screen. 
"Mario Cuomo . . . Too liberal for too long," is the tag line. 
</P>
<P>
 The differences between the two campaigns are stark. Recently, dueling 
fund-raising dinners were held within a block of each other in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman -- who has become a star this fall 
helping fill Republican coffers after winning office with a platform stressing 
a 30% tax cut over three years -- appeared with Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
 "This race, you see, is not about who can give the best speeches or collect 
the most endorsements from the political Establishment," she told party 
faithful as they dined on veal. "Democrats cannot resist spending other 
people's money. They're determined to try the taxpayer's patience. We know that 
the only way to control spending is to give government less to spend in the 
first place." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have largely missed out on the national recovery," said Pataki, a 
49-year-old former mayor of Peekskill, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a block away, in another ballroom with President Clinton present, 
Democrats dined on chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magnificent heritage and achievement of progressive change is being 
threatened," Cuomo said. "There are forces that are threatening to drag us down 
into a ditch of diminished expectations. . . . What they would settle for is a 
puny, shriveled place, an America of naysayers and negativists." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is wrong for us to deny that heritage," the governor added. "That's why 
I'm running."

STERNER PENALTIES SEND U.S. PRISONER COUNT PAST 1 MILLION; CORRECTIONS: STATE 
AND FEDERAL INMATE POPULATION GREW DUE TO TOUGH SENTENCING, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
SAYS. CRIME RATE DROPPED, MEANWHILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The number of state and federal prison inmates topped 1 million for the first 
time this summer, reflecting tougher sentencing on an array of crimes and a 
greater proportion of drug arrests leading to prison terms, the Justice 
Department reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The incarceration rate nationwide also reached an all-time high, with 373 of 
every 100,000 people behind bars -- up from 188 per 100,000 a decade earlier. 
Only Russia has a higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
 California, the nation's most populous state, had more federal and state 
prisoners than any other state, with 124,813 men and women locked up. The 
incarceration rate, however, was only slightly above the national average, at 
382 per 100,000. That compares to a rate of 164 per 100,000 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison population of 1 million is double the number a decade ago. The 
cause appears to be harsher treatment of criminals -- not a sharp increase in 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Other statistics show that the crime rate for violent offenses peaked in 1981, 
at 35 incidents per 1,000 population, according to Allen Beck, a statistician 
at the department. In 1992, the latest year for which there was data, there 
were 32 violent crimes per 1,000 people, according to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the prison population expanded because Americans lost faith in 
rehabilitation and turned to a "lock-'em-up" strategy, analysts and corrections 
specialists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reflects an increasingly widespread belief that the rehabilitation 
strategies of the last several decades have not worked," said Gerald M. Caplan, 
dean of McGeorge Law School in Sacramento and former head of the National 
Institute of Justice, the Justice Department's research arm. "It's a 
desperation strategy in the absence of other alternatives. No one really knows 
what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 William P. Barr, former President George Bush's attorney general, said that 
the leveling off of violent crimes in recent years proves the effectiveness of 
the strict incarceration movement of the late 1980s, which he spearheaded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has held the crime rate lower than it would have been," Barr said in an 
interview. "The price of putting these people in prisons is lower than the 
price of leaving them out on the street where they would commit more crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Some criminologists agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the tougher policies for locking up violent criminals, "the violent 
crime rates would have gone up at least 15% and probably much, much more," said 
Jeffrey Roth, a criminologist at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based 
research center. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth and others have disputed policies put in place by Congress in recent 
years that markedly increased incarceration rates for drug offenders and other 
nonviolent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "If instead of building so many more prisons they had spent the same money on 
prevention with young people, we might well have had a real drop in violence," 
Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department attributed half of the increase in state prison 
populations and three-quarters of the increase in federal prison populations 
between 1980 and 1992 to people convicted of drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1980 and 1992, the proportion of drug arrests that resulted in prison 
admissions grew fivefold, from 19 per 1,000 to 104 per 1,000. Currently, 60% of 
federal prisoners are behind bars for drug convictions, most of them for 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison populations have also swelled because of increases in the arrests and 
likelihood of incarceration for a variety of crimes, including aggravated 
assault, burglary and sex offenses, according to Justice Department officials. 
More parolees and people on probation ended up behind bars again because of 
heightened surveillance and widespread drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
 In federal prisons, the increase in inmates is also attributable to harsher 
sentencing guidelines. In 1987, the federal government abolished parole and 
since then, 10 states have passed measures to mandate "truth in sentencing," so 
that criminals serve their full sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Some corrections specialists have argued that prisons filled up in the last 
decade because of misguided policies, like the war on drugs, that have cost 
taxpayers large sums but have ignored underlying problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the drug convictions, drugs are still widely available, especially 
in the inner cities where most arrests are made, said Chase Riveland, who heads 
the Department of Corrections in Washington state. "We're locking up poor 
people from the inner cities, who sell drugs to support their own habits 
instead of treating their addictions." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives and liberals alike predicted that prison populations will 
continue to mushroom because of both tougher sentencing policies and an 
expected rise in the teen-age population starting at the end of this decade. 
Teen-agers account for a disproportionately large share of crime. Behind Bars 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's prison population exceeds 1 million for the first time, the 
Justice Department announced.

THOMAS SAYS, 'I AM NOT AN UNCLE TOM'; SUPREME COURT: THE JUSTICE HOLDS RARE 
MEETING WITH AN INVITED GROUP OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. HE REPORTEDLY TELLS FOES TO 
'GET OVER IT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In an extraordinary meeting with an invited group of black journalists and 
other African Americans, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas rejected 
suggestions that his opinions have hurt blacks or that he has forgotten his 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not an Uncle Tom," he answered when asked about selling out to whites, 
according to a report in Thursday's Washington Afro-American newspaper that was 
confirmed by several people who were at the Wednesday meeting. "I do not pay 
attention to that nonsense. That is one of the problems we have as black 
people. We don't allow differing views." 
</P>
<P>
 Repeating a vow he has made before to remain on the court in spite of his 
critics, Thomas said: "I'm going to be here for 40 years. For those who don't 
like it, get over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Justices virtually never hold on-the-record meetings with the press. And 
Thomas, appointed in 1991, has been the most media-shy of all the current 
justices. He has turned down interviews and repeated requests for informal 
visits from many publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas defended his version of a "colorblind Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 "I disagree with the prevailing point of view of some black leaders that 
special treatment for blacks is acceptable," the Afro-American newspaper 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas also was quoted as saying: "It would seem that some black people want 
to say that when you, as a black, become successful, you cease to be black. 
That's ridiculous. If a white person becomes successful, (does he) cease to be 
white?" 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in Wednesday's session said it was designed to appeal to Thomas' 
black constituency. Armstrong Williams, a longtime Thomas friend who brought 
the group together, said he chose people who would be open to seeing Thomas as 
a "human being." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a local business executive and radio host who served as Thomas' 
confidential assistant at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, has been 
a vocal supporter of Thomas. He said Thomas had "nothing to do" with selecting 
the group at Wednesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the fact that no whites were there, Williams said: "It had 
nothing to do with race. I found people who wanted to know him. . . . I have an 
obligation to have him portrayed differently." He argues that the media have 
painted Thomas as "a monster." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he intends to take a handpicked group of reporters to the court 
every three months. He said he would choose only those who had demonstrated 
that they would be fair to Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Court public information officer Toni House said Thomas would not comment on 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Of about 30 people who attended, Williams said, five were journalists. They 
were James Wright of the Afro-American; Barry Murray of New Dimensions 
publishing; Ernest White, a talk show host on WDCU-radio; Raynard Jackson of 
National Minority Politics, and a reporter from Black Professional magazine in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Brazile, a longtime liberal activist, said she was ambivalent, given her 
liberal views, about visiting Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said Thursday that she was struck by Thomas' willingness to reach out.

GROUP CONDUCTS ABORTION PILL STUDY IN SECRECY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fearful of violence, a research organization is conducting the first 
nationwide study of the French abortion pill RU 486 without saying where the 
work is being done or how many clinics are participating. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may have noticed there are some nuts out there who do bad things to 
people who deliver abortions," said Dr. C. Wayne Bardin, research director at 
the Population Council, the nonprofit group sponsoring the study. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 women have been given the pill since September as part of the 
$8-million study, which could make the drug routinely available in the United 
States by 1996, Bardin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The availability of RU 486, now called mifepristone, will not be advertised, 
Bardin said Thursday at a news conference. Women coming to clinics for surgical 
abortions will be advised, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the news conference, the Planned Parenthood Federation of 
America announced that its clinics in San Diego; Aurora, Colo.; Cambridge, 
Mass.; Des Moines; Houston, and Williston, Vt., are participating. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Johnson, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of 
America, said she did not expect Planned Parenthood's participation to require 
any additional security. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Dr. John Britton and his bodyguard were shot to death outside an 
abortion clinic in Pensacola, Fla. The National Abortion Federation in 
Washington has reports of 38 bombings and 91 cases of arson at abortion clinics 
since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 The RU 486 study is aimed at determining the pill's safety and effectiveness. 
When it is completed in the spring of 1995, an application for approval will be 
submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a tragedy that pro-abortion advocates want to use women as guinea 
pigs," said Wanda Franz, president of the National Right to Life Committee. 
"NRLC opposes testing of RU 486 for abortion both because it kills unborn 
children and because its long-term side effects for women are unknown."

POLICE BID FAREWELL TO SLAIN OFFICER; MOURNING: MOST OF ALL, LAPD'S CHARLES 
HEIM IS RECALLED AS "JUST AN ORDINARY COWBOY . . . JUST A GREAT GUY." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Into the crown of her police hat, she tucked a wad of white napkins. "For when 
I cry," said Detective Jayme Weaver, securing the napkins before putting the 
hat on her head and walking into Grace Community Church in Sun Valley for the 
funeral of Officer Charles Heim on Thursday morning. They had graduated from 
the Los Angeles Police Department Academy together in September, 1983.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, Chuck was just always happy," said Weaver, 32, who works in the 
Devonshire Division, laughing for the moment even though she anticipated tears 
soon. "Living his life to the fullest." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Dean Heim, gunned down Friday at a Hollywood motel while checking out 
a report of drug dealing, was remembered Thursday as a meticulous and 
aggressive policeman, a caring father and husband, a prankster, a horse lover, 
a cowboy and an embellisher of stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "His wife tells me he could make a minnow of a story into a whale," LAPD 
Chaplain Richard Bargas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of you have stopped me and said, 'Don't forget to say he was just an 
ordinary cowboy,' " the chaplain said to the crowd of 4,800 gathered at the 
funeral. "No frills, no lace, just a great guy." 
</P>
<P>
 As the chaplain finished his remarks, a loudspeaker filled the air with the 
strains of a Willie Nelson recording: "Mama, don't let your babies grow up to 
be cowboys. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Heim, 33, the 11th LAPD officer killed in the line of duty in the last five 
years, died early Saturday after being shot the previous night when he and his 
partner, Officer Felix Pena, were investigating a tip. He had been a member of 
the mounted unit of the LAPD's elite Metro Division, but was about to join the 
Hollywood Division.  
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all the officers from both divisions were present Thursday, along 
with a legion of police officers from across Los Angeles and the state. They 
blanketed the vast church, overflowing its capacity of 4,500, and later spilled 
across the grassy slopes surrounding the spot where Heim was to later be buried 
at Eternal Valley Memorial Park in Newhall.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the officers -- half of them, by one estimate, members of the LAPD -- 
filed into the church practically in formation. As the rest walked in, 
spectators could read the badges on their uniforms: Beverly Hills, Azusa, 
Culver City, Newport Beach, Burbank, Chino and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Heim's wife, Beth, also a Metro Division officer, sat in the front row of the 
church, her long hair pulled back into a single braid, her five-month pregnancy 
barely visible in her two-piece black outfit. With her were family members, 
including Heim's father, who uses a wheelchair, and 12-year-old Charles, Heim's 
son from a previous marriage, who was wearing a gray-blue suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks just like him," said Donna May, 33, who was engaged to Heim before 
they broke up in 1990. "He's one person I'll never forget." 
</P>
<P>
 So many officers came Thursday that the funeral had the edge of a bittersweet 
reunion. For the members of Heim's Police Academy graduating class of 
September, 1983, it was even more poignant. They occasionally see one another 
in the field but rarely get together. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've all been together in 11 years," said Sgt. 
Stephany Payne of the West Valley Division. 
</P>
<P>
 But they all remembered Chuck Heim. They chipped in and bought the cross of 
flowers displayed in front of the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept our class going, kept morale up -- he was real supportive of the 
female classmates," Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the mourners were Police Chief Willie L. Williams and Mayor Richard 
Riordan. Standing in the back of the church with others who lined the walls 
when seats ran out was former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Jimmy Render, Heim's partner for 4 1/2 years in the Metro Division, 
remembered him as "a caring sensitive person. . . . He was like a brother to 
me."  
</P>
<P>
 Render also remembered Heim as a prankster.  
</P>
<P>
 On duty on horseback, the officers were under instructions "not to modify the 
uniform." But Heim blithely ignored those rules. At Christmastime, he bedecked 
his beloved horse, Panzer, with a Santa Claus hat. At the Venice Beach 
boardwalk during the summer, Panzer donned sunglasses.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our supervisors would just shake their heads," Render said as the group in 
the church laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the front of the church, next to his coffin, was a picture of Heim proudly 
standing next to his horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the words of remembrance, there was a hint of the personal anguish that 
so often accompanies police funerals, but no one dwelt on it long:  
</P>
<P>
 "He had some difficult problems in his own life and he was in the process of 
working them through when his life was taken away," the chaplain told the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What was mostly shared was the sense of the tough-minded, quick-witted police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck was a warrior," said Sgt. Kirk Smith of the mounted unit, speaking in a 
commanding, authoritative voice. "And he died as a warrior." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was the one who put him in the mounted unit and later designated Heim as 
the man who would lead the riderless horse at police officers' funerals. "Chuck 
could sit on a horse under a hail of rocks at a disturbance or work crime 
suspension, then go out and scoop up an injured rabbit and take it home," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to miss you, Chuck," Smith said. "I promise you . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Smith paused for an eternity; the silence filled the church and left the 
mourners hushed and still. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . that you will not be forgotten," he continued, the crispness in his 
voice slightly dulled with his pain. "This is not an empty promise or a promise 
based on emotion, but a promise based on the fact that you were so deeply loved 
by so many people." 
</P>
<P>
 At the cemetery, it took 45 minutes for officers to gather after driving, 
riding and walking to the slope of the graveside, seas of dark blue uniforms 
broken by patches of the khaki uniforms of sheriff's deputies and California 
Highway Patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the cemetery, every conceivable display of police ceremony and ritual was 
in form, from a bagpiper playing "Amazing Grace," to two trumpeters playing 
taps, to a 21-gun salute. 
</P>
<P>
 At other funerals of fallen police officers, a line of four mounted officers 
walk to the grave followed by the riderless horse. As requested by Heim's wife, 
there would be no riderless horse at this funeral, because that duty had been 
Heim's. But instead of the four mounted officers, nearly the entire mounted 
unit came to pay their respects: 21 officers in black Stetson hats and black 
leather gloves sat on horseback at the entrance to the cemetery before 
proceeding to the grave site. 
</P>
<P>
 Heim last rode his horse Panzer several weeks ago. "I would suspect and 
actually like to think that Panzer misses him," said Lt. Earl Paysinger, noting 
that the horse will remain in the department until Beth Heim decides if she 
wants him. "For us, our horses are our partners." 
</P>
<P>
 Heim's patrolman partner, Pena, who was wounded in the right hand Friday night 
in Hollywood, stood at the grave site with his arm in a sling. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the service, from the western edge of a hill, four police 
helicopters suddenly flew into view. One broke from the rest and flew off alone 
in a "missing-man" formation, signifying that a colleague had been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Williams presented the flag that draped Heim's poplar coffin to Heim's 
widow. Another officer handed her a Stetson like the one mounted officers wear 
on duty. Beth Heim made her way to a limousine, tearfully clutching the flag, a 
friend on one side and her late husband's young son from a previous marriage on 
the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Heim also had a daughter, who died of cancer at age 5 in 1985 and is 
buried in the same cemetery. Her bronze grave marker, reading, "Melissa May 
Heim, Beloved Daughter and Sister," was bordered with pink rosebuds. Her 
father's coffin was buried just inches from hers.

ON THE ROAD AGAIN; COMEDIAN: BOB HOPE DELIGHTS 400 FANS AT A RECORD-STORE CD 
SIGNING.

 The line started forming hours in advance, snaking down the alley behind 
Sunset Strip. It was longer than those for the Moody Blues and Dead Can Dance, 
way longer than the one for Weird Al Yankovic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the doors opened a full 10 minutes early, and the man did not disappoint. 
Oh, he could have dressed like the others -- hair extensions, leather pants -- 
but you don't need the trappings when you're really big. 
</P>
<P>
 You can coast when you're . . . Bob Hope -- Unplugged. 
</P>
<P>
 In what has to have been one of the most piquant cultural exchanges since 
Nixon hit Peking, the 91-year-old, ski-nosed, conservative comic made a rare 
personal appearance Thursday night in the head-banging heart of rock-and-roll. 
Plugging his new video-and-CD boxed set, "Bob Hope Remembers . . . World War II 
-- The European Theatre," Hope greeted some 400 fans at the Tower Records store 
on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sunset has lost its innocence since Hope started out, and the 
comedian's eyesight and energy seemed on the wane, both the venue and the 
vaudevillian lived up to their reputations, as Hope traded wisecracks with a 
decidedly eclectic crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 There were middle-aged women from as far away as Great Britain ("I'm English," 
Hope quipped to one fan. "We were too poor to be British. ") There was a 
comedian who did his Bob Hope impression and then asked Hope to autograph a 
poster that said, "We love you, Bob." ("What should I write?" the trouper 
cracked. " 'I do, too?' ") 
</P>
<P>
 A Simi Valley couple stopped by on their way to their night jobs as Santa and 
Mrs. Claus. A U.S. Marine gave Hope a ration of corned beef hash. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course -- this being the Strip -- there were the requisite rockers. "I 
love Bob Hope," gushed Robert Green, 20, of Bellflower, who sported a purple 
earring, a goatee and a shark tattoo. "He's a legend. I've been wanting to meet 
him all my life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Meehan, the 28-year-old manager of Tower's Sunset store, said he was 
skeptical when Hope's publicists suggested that the entertainment legend make 
an appearance there. Tower -- while more mainstream than, say, the 
punk-oriented SST Records down the block -- is known, among other things, as 
the place where Slash of Guns 'N' Roses used to work. Megadeth is scheduled to 
show up there this weekend for a promotional Halloween bash. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I thought it was kind of strange," acknowledged Meehan, young 
enough to be Hope's great-grandson. "But then, the more it came upon us, the 
more I started thinking, 'Hey -- this is cool!' People love to meet an icon -- 
somebody from the old school who has been around for so long, and is still 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some customers noted, Hope is not exactly on the road to a Tony 
Bennett-style renaissance with the MTV crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, he's pretty cool," allowed Eddie Robison, 26, a Hollywood tattoo artist 
with multiply pierced ears who was browsing in a nearby aisle. "But he's a 
little old for me. I'm here to get the new Stone Temple Pilots and Nirvana 
Unplugged CDs."

JUDGE LIKELY TO LIFT BAN ON MTA FARE HIKE; COURTS: JURIST SAYS HE WOULD RESCIND 
ORDER AS BIAS SUIT PROCEEDS, BUT DOESN'T SAY WHEN. HE WOULD LET THE BUS FEES 
REACH $1.35. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge said Thursday that he is leaning toward letting bus fares rise 
from $1.10 to $1.35 and retaining monthly bus passes -- but at a higher price 
-- while a lawsuit alleging that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
discriminates against poor and minority riders proceeds to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case that is being watched closely by the nation's transit agencies, 
Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. indicated that he would lift the court order he 
issued Sept. 1 blocking the first fare increase in Los Angeles in six years -- 
but he did not specify when. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be my intention . . . to allow the fares to go to $1.35," Hatter 
said. He said that he is also inclined to retain monthly passes but at a higher 
price of $60 or $65. 
</P>
<P>
 The passes, now $42, are popular because they save riders from fumbling for 
exact change and allow unlimited boardings. The MTA is also seeking to raise 
the fare on the Long Beach-to-Los Angeles Blue Line trolley from $1.10 to 
$2.35. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter cited new information provided by the MTA that there are "extensive 
outlets" available for the purchase of 90-cent tokens, which can be used by 
riders in lieu of paying the higher fare. Tokens are available at 425 outlets, 
according to the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the plaintiffs said the fare is likely to remain at the 
current level at least for several more weeks. A status conference on the case 
is set for Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiffs' attorney Constance L. Rice of the NAACP Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund said she will argue that it is difficult for the bus riders to 
get to token sales outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the tokens are truly available, lower the fare to 90 cents," Rice said 
after Thursday's hearing. "We're talking about people who take an hour and a 
half bus ride to get to a minimum-wage job. They have to do their shopping on 
the bus. They're going to take another trip to go buy some damn tokens?" 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Guardado, a Salvadoran immigrant and bus rider who is a plaintiff in the 
case, was among those sitting in the courtroom Thursday when Hatter indicated 
that he would let the fares go up. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an injustice," she said in Spanish after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice called it outrageous that Metrolink commuters will receive a 25% holiday 
discount in December while the MTA is seeking to raise fares for poor bus 
riders. A Metrolink spokesman said the five-county rail agency is separate from 
the MTA, but the MTA provides 65% of Metrolink's operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of whether the judge allows the fares to go up, the trial will 
proceed -- most likely early next year -- on the lawsuit accusing the MTA of 
discriminating against poor and minority bus riders to fund rail projects that 
largely benefit suburban white commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, lawyers for both sides in the case will conduct settlement 
talks. The plaintiffs plan to submit a proposal to the MTA next week seeking 
increased funding for the nation's second-largest bus system. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's hearing, the MTA was represented by a new attorney from Mayor 
Richard Riordan's old law firm, Riordan & McKinzie. Assistant County Counsel 
David B. Kelsey said he hired lawyer Kenneth Klein because of his expertise in 
similar cases. Klein will be paid $220 an hour. Riordan, who serves on the MTA 
board, no longer has an interest in the law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare increase was authorized by the MTA board in July after a series of 
raucous public hearings, including one so fierce that transit police in riot 
gear were summoned. Transit officials said the increase would give the agency 
$40 million a year needed to balance its books.

LOCAL SMOKING BAN DELAYED PENDING PROP. 188; POLITICS: THE AUTHOR OF A STATE 
ANTI-SMOKING LAW TELLS SANTA MONICA COUNCIL MEMBERS THAT THEIR ACTION COULD 
HAVE SPARKED VOTER SUPPORT FOR THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY-SPONSORED INITIATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica, long on the cutting edge of social experimentation, this week 
nearly turned the place where everybody knows your name into the place where 
nobody lets you smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was on the verge of joining only a few California cities in 
banning smoking in all indoor workplaces -- including bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a flicker of political reality set in. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two council members were lobbied by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Brentwood), the author of a tough statewide smoking prohibition set to take 
effect in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman, the council members said, expressed concern that Santa Monica's 
approval of a radical anti-smoking law could be counterproductive. He warned 
them, they said, that it might spark voter support for Proposition 188, a 
tobacco industry-sponsored measure on the Nov. 8 ballot that would take away 
the power of cities to regulate smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of Friedman's arguments, the City Council agreed late Tuesday 
night to postpone a vote on the smoking ban in bars until after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the pro-Proposition 188 campaign -- trailing badly in public 
opinion polls -- branded Friedman a hypocrite. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman injected himself into a similar controversy in Beverly Hills last 
month, when the city was preparing to vote on a proposal similar to Santa 
Monica's. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman acknowledged this week that he encouraged Santa Monica Councilmen 
Kelly Olsen and Paul Rosenstein to delay their vote, saying that he felt that 
their efforts could be more productively spent opposing Proposition 188. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman authored Assembly Bill 13, which was signed by Gov. Pete Wilson in 
July and will ban smoking in most enclosed workplaces, including restaurants, 
offices, warehouses and factories, on Jan. 1 -- unless voters approve 
Proposition 188. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 188 would not only invalidate Friedman's bill, but would also wipe 
off the books more than 200 local smoking ordinances, including one in Los 
Angeles. The proposition would replace these laws with a milder statewide 
standard that would give businesses and employers more power to decide when and 
where smoking would be permitted indoors. The initiative's primary sponsor is 
the Philip Morris tobacco company, which has spent more than $5 million to 
promote it. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a state legislator, I'm reluctant to interfere with local government," 
Friedman said. "But by the same token, I'm not afraid . . . to let them know 
why I oppose (Proposition) 188." 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen, Rosenstein and Beverly Hills Mayor Vicki Reynolds, who all oppose 
Proposition 188, characterized their conversations with Friedman as friendly 
and informational, and denied that he applied political pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main motivation was to get people focused on defeating 188," said 
Friedman. He said opponents had raised less than $700,000 to counter the 
tobacco industry's heavy spending, and had to rely on groups such as city 
councils to publicize the measure's drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his concern that passage of strong local smoking bans might provoke 
people to support Proposition 188 was "very secondary" in his reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Friedman's actions drew a hot response from Lee Stitzenberger, 
campaign director of Californians for Statewide Smoking Restrictions, which is 
promoting Proposition 188. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry Friedman is a total hypocrite," said Stitzenberger. "If he really 
believes that the public supports a state-mandated smoking ban, why would he 
not want the public support of restrictive local ordinances?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman's lobbying of council members showed that he fears that his 
anti-smoking beliefs are not reflective of his constituents', Stitzenberger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Monica council member Olsen said he appreciated Friedman's call. 
</P>
<P>
 "I trust him to know -- he has more experience with tobacco companies than I 
do -- the political strategy," Olsen said, adding that he believes that 
Friedman was protecting AB 13, and in turn protecting his constituents from the 
dangers of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen and the other Santa Monica council members said it would have been 
pointless to go to the trouble of passing a strict local smoking ban when it 
could be repealed Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Santa Monica and Beverly Hills city councils have announced their 
opposition to Proposition 188. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 188 threatens to strip local governments of local control, and 
their ability to reflect their constituents' interests in creating a healthy 
environment with smoking bans," Reynolds said, adding: "And if Philip Morris is 
supporting it, how can anyone believe 188 is a smoking ban?"

NEIGHBORS DIVIDED OVER MURAL; ART: PLANNED WORK DEPICTING BLACK PANTHERS DRAWS 
VASTLY DIFFERENT REACTIONS ON THE STREET. CITY COUNCIL TODAY WILL CONSIDER 
RELOCATING IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Depending on which of the two barber shops on the corner of Jefferson 
Boulevard and 11th Avenue you enter, you will hear a different opinion on a 
planned mural celebrating the Black Panthers that would adorn the wall they 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hair Expressions, the newer, hipper salon, owner Moe Maccanico defends the 
mural, which would depict a gun-toting Huey Newton in addition to scenes of 
Panthers fighting the Ku Klux Klan and helping feed young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you tell the truth, tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and 
when you paint a picture, don't leave anything out," said Maccanico, 34. He 
argued that the Panthers are an important part of black history, and that guns 
are an important part of the Panthers. "If you painted a picture of Daniel 
Boone, he'd have a rifle in his hand." 
</P>
<P>
 But next door in Johnson's Barber Shop, 62-year-old Calvin Johnson has a 
vastly different perspective. "They can put up things much nicer than that," 
said Johnson, who believes that the Panthers are used by racists to discredit 
blacks. "I never did have any liking for this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The barber vs. barber split is echoed on the streets of this mostly 
residential neighborhood near the Crenshaw district and in the corridors of 
City Hall, where the proposed mural -- called "To Protect and Serve" -- has 
been under fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural was originally to have been partly funded with city money, but the 
organization sponsoring the work, the Social and Public Art Resource Center, 
rescinded its request Wednesday in the wake of what it called intimidation from 
police and city officials, a charge both vehemently denied. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will consider a motion today by Councilman Nate Holden, who 
represents the neighborhood, recommending that the work be moved. Holden has 
argued that putting up the mural would be like "shouting 'fire' in a crowded 
theater" in a neighborhood he says is plagued by violence. He says the 
community opposes the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Not inside Hair Expressions, though. "We see guns on TV, and with Arnold 
Schwarzenegger," said Kimberly Johnson, 29, as she gave Kimberly Armstrong a 
trim. If Hollywood can do it, she said, why not Crenshaw? "This is about the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see the big deal of putting a mural on a wall," said Kimberly 
Armstrong, 27, "if the KKK can walk down the street and say it's their freedom 
of expression." 
</P>
<P>
 Most residents said that their neighborhood may have its share of gang 
trouble, but on the whole it is a safe and friendly place, where they are proud 
to know the names of even the local panhandlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street from Hair Expressions, at Val's Cafe, owner Valerie Curtis 
was worried about the neighborhood's image being tarnished by the proposed 
mural. She would prefer a mural that celebrated lesser-known -- and less 
violent -- heroes. "There are too many people who were raised in this area 
who've done something and who we don't even know about," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others, such as Altair Bey, who lives a few houses down from the 
proposed site, said they had not even heard of the controversy until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Black Panthers? That's so old, it's like, who cares?" said Bey, 50. But 
he liked the idea less and less the more he heard about it. "That concept 
doesn't fit with the times. Huey Newton with a gun? Maybe Huey Newton with a 
book in a scholarly pose," he suggested, adding that he would rather see W.E.B 
DuBois or Adam Clayton Powell on a mural than Newton. "Right now, people are 
just trying to live and prosper."

DRIVE-BY ATTACK THAT KILLED 1 MAN, INJURED 1 
</P>

<P>
 Police in Long Beach on Thursday were seeking two gunmen who opened fire from 
a vehicle, killing one man and wounding another.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES; 
CITY PLAN TO BUILD HOMELESS CENTER CLEARS FIRST HURDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Riordan Administration's controversial plan to build a $4-million homeless 
drop-in center Downtown cleared its first hurdle Thursday with a vote of 
support from the City Council's Community and Economic Development Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee Chairman Mike Hernandez said he felt assured that the center would 
be used as a place where transients could get services -- not as a 
"concentration camp" where the homeless would be forced to reside in lieu of 
arrest."It is not going to be what people fear it is going to be," Hernandez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the mayor's plan, the city would purchase a vacant lot in the industrial 
zone east of Downtown and transform it into a fenced, landscaped area where 
homeless people could sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility would include a 50-bed shelter, showers, restrooms and lockers, 
along with a service center where homeless people could get drug and job 
counseling. The center would serve up to 800 people a day. The plan is a major 
component of a $20-million U.S. Housing and Urban Development grant to combat 
homelessness in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be considered Monday by the City Council's Housing and Community 
Redevelopment Committee before being forwarded to the full council for a vote. 
Because the plan is part of a joint city-county program, it also will require 
the support of the County Board of Supervisors.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: FIREFIGHTERS RETURN TO 
REPAIRED STATION -- AND A STANDING OVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the earth was still bucking on the morning of Jan. 17, the firefighters of 
Station 70 in Northridge sped out the back door because the front one had 
crumpled. Nine months later they returned -- to a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 people turned out Thursday to rededicate the renovated station 
and welcome back the firefighters, who had no idea how badly their 
home-away-from-home was damaged as they rushed to pull the living and the dead 
from the nearby Northridge Meadows apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 It was wonderful to be back, said engineer Gary Kahler. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a crowd of thankful neighbors, much of the city's firefighting 
brass -- as well as several elected officials -- were on hand for the 
ceremonies at the station at 9861 Reseda Blvd.  
</P>
<P>
 "They are the best in the world," said Los Angeles City Councilman Hal 
Bernson. "They lay it on the line for us every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Donald O. Manning said: "I think firefighters are in one of the 
most honorable professions. . . . I can't tell you how proud I am of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of the C Platoon at Station 70 were literally thrown from 
their bunks when the Northridge temblor -- centered virtually beneath the 
station -- hit at 4:31 that Monday morning. Those who were left in bed were 
buried in tiles and light fixtures, Capt. Bob Fickett said. Because the power 
was knocked out and there were no emergency generators, the station was as dark 
as the rest of the city. So the 10 men fumbled their way to the fire pole, slid 
down, suited up and headed out the back door. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving down a darkened Reseda Boulevard, none of the men at first noticed 
that Northridge Meadows was only two stories high instead of three. After 
extinguishing a nearby house fire, they drove back past the apartment complex 
and in the earliest light of morning could see the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawling into the collapsed structure as powerful aftershocks rolled through, 
the firefighters rescued three residents who had been trapped. They also helped 
remove the bodies of the 16 who died in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until later that they would learn their own building had incurred 
$811,000 in damage and that they would have to move out, spending the next nine 
months at a station designed for a company a third their 30-person size. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday the firefighters were glad to be back home and their neighbors 
were thrilled to have them. 
</P>
<P>
 Al and Ruth Schwartz live next to Northridge Meadows and marveled at the 
speedy work of the men of Station 70 on that destructive morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came to applaud our firemen," Ruth Schwartz said. ERIC SLATER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; RLA DROPS 
PLANS TO OPEN BRANCH OFFICES, CITING COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing fiscal and logistic considerations, the riot recovery RLA agency has 
scrapped plans to open three satellite offices that had been described as an 
effort to reach out to small businesses in impoverished neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 RLA President Linda Griego said research had shown that "physically setting up 
(the offices) was going to be too expensive and not necessarily too 
productive."The offices had been planned for South-Central Los Angeles, 
Southeast Los Angeles and the Van Nuys-Pacoima area. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego, speaking after the riot recovery agency's quarterly meeting, said RLA 
staffers are instead continuing to work out of the agency's Downtown office in 
an effort to set up networks of small businesses that can work together on 
marketing and training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, RLA officials announced that they have interviewed business 
owners in such fields as children's toys, household furniture and 
metal-working. The agency is taking a "bottoms-up approach," said staffer Linda 
Yeung, at working with the manufacturers and distributors of products ranging 
from "stuffed animals to battery-operated toys."

NEWSPAPER GROUP SEIZED BY IRS; STAFF IS LAID OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coast Media Newspapers, publisher of nine free newspapers in the Los Angeles 
area, was seized by the Internal Revenue Service on Thursday for failing to pay 
more than $228,000 in back taxes from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire staff of nearly 50 employees was laid off after being notified late 
Wednesday afternoon of the IRS takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately held company was supported by annual advertising revenues of 
about $4 million and had been operating at a slight profit, according to 
Publisher Stephen Hadland. But the company was hit hard by the recession and 
the earthquake and is saddled with $1.5 million in debt, Hadland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS plans to collect the back taxes from the publishing company's pending 
advertising payments and other accounts receivable. Hadland said the company is 
owed about half a million dollars and that he plans to reopen Coast Media when 
the tax lien is settled. 
</P>
<P>
 The company publishes the Culver City News, Lawndale Tribune, Hawthorne 
Community News, Inglewood News, Westchester News, Playa del Rey News, 
Beverlywood News, Cheviot Hills News and Rancho Park News.

3 CONVICTED IN MURDER OF POLICE OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three men were convicted of first-degree murder Thursday for killing a Maywood 
police officer, and two of them also were found guilty of murdering a Van Nuys 
market owner, clearing the way for a jury to decide whether they should be 
sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court jury found Jose Contreras, Benjamin Alberto 
Navarro and Edgardo Sanchez Fuentes guilty of the May 29, 1992, shooting of 
Officer John Hoglund, who was gunned down as he responded to a silent burglar 
alarm at a Maywood market. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoglund, 46, was the first officer in the history of the Maywood Police 
Department to be killed in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras and Fuentes also were convicted of murdering Lee Chul Kim, 49, who 
was shot May 4, 1992, in the freezer of his grocery store in Van Nuys after he 
returned from the bank with a large amount of cash.  
</P>
<P>
 The verdicts pleased Hoglund's friends who were in court Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stunned, I'm amazed and I think it's great," said his fiancee, Terri 
Smith, who recalled that the night before he was killed, Hoglund had set their 
wedding date. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes and Contreras were each convicted on 38 counts -- including murder, 
robbery and assault with a deadly weapon -- stemming from a series of seven 
robberies. Navarro, who was not charged in connection with the Kim slaying, was 
convicted on 32 counts for his role in five of the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the three men were found guilty of special allegations that 
expose them to the death penalty, including killing a police officer and 
committing murder during the course of a robbery and to avoid arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes and Contreras, each acquitted of two counts of robbery, were found 
guilty of the special allegation of committing multiple murders. 
</P>
<P>
 To convict the men, all in their early 20s, prosecutors relied on a security 
camera videotape that clearly captured the images of the three defendants 
inside the burglarized Maywood grocery store, minutes before the shooting of 
Hoglund. At one point in the video, some of them were shown walking around the 
store after the robbery, drinking Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also alleged that during the robberies, which spanned an area from 
Paramount to Van Nuys, the defendants used electric stun guns on employees to 
torture them into handing over money, threatened to cut off one woman's fingers 
and shoved a gun in a man's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is to continue Monday with the start of the penalty phase, during 
which jurors must decide whether the three should be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've known from the outset that the fiercest battle is going to be waged at 
the penalty phase," said James Leonard, an attorney for Contreras. "I'm 
confident that after a jury hears all the evidence about Mr. Contreras' life, 
they will reject the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric K. Davis, an attorney for Navarro, who described the verdicts as 
"expected," said he will present a psychologist who is an expert on Central 
American culture to testify on behalf of his client, who is from El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client has never denied his involvement, but our position has always been 
that . . .the death penalty is not the appropriate punishment," said Davis.

MENENDEZ HEARING REVIVES SOME FASCINATION WITH CASE; COURTS: AS THE BROTHERS 
HEAD TOWARD A RETRIAL, A SHARE OF THE MEDIA SPOTLIGHT IS RESTORED. SOME 'FANS' 
HAVE EMERGED, WEARING YELLOW RIBBONS OF SUPPORT. 
</P>

<P>
 The Menendez brothers murder case lumbered back into the spotlight Thursday at 
a hearing that produced little of substance, but served as a vivid reminder of 
the brothers' star quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg had set the hearing to fix 
arrangements for a retrial in the celebrated case -- when it would start, 
whether one or two juries would hear it and whether it would be held in 
Downtown Los Angeles or Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing marked the brothers' first appearance at the Van Nuys courthouse 
in months, and their presence delighted dozens of backers who came bearing 
flowers and cards and, in the apparent start of a new trend in the case, they 
sported yellow ribbons of support. 
</P>
<P>
 In the courtroom, hours of legal wrangling settled nothing. The hearing is due 
to resume today -- and supporters promised that they would be back. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, are facing a retrial on murder 
charges in the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of their wealthy parents, Jose 
and Kitty Menendez. At their first trial, which ended in January, separate 
juries deadlocked between murder and lesser manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contend that the brothers killed out of hatred and greed. The 
brothers testified that they lashed out in self-defense after years of 
physical, mental and sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Lyle and Erik Menendez had been in court before Weisberg was in 
July, and the judge's tiny Van Nuys courtroom was packed Thursday with the 
brothers' loyal supporters. Those wearing yellow ribbons, about half a dozen 
people, announced that they were a symbol for the sentiment "Free the Menendez 
Brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the hearing began, one woman waited patiently with bouquets of yellow 
and red roses for the defense, with cards for Lyle Menendez and for his 
brother's lead defense attorney, Leslie Abramson. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez, she said, was a "hero." She added that she had driven to the 
hearing from San Diego and said of the bouquets: "I want to give a red one to 
Leslie. I think she's an incredible warrior. She deserves 50 of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the courtroom, the brothers' first appearance and the way they ambled 
to their seats was greeted with approving scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the summer, Lyle Menendez let his hair grow past his collar and lost 
considerable weight. "He's so slim!" one supporter exulted. Erik Menendez 
appeared in court in a new cranberry-colored plaid shirt, which drew many 
favorable remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 As court swung into session, Lyle Menendez flashed a broad smile at a woman 
who was beaming at him. She blew him back a kiss. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing, however, immediately bogged down over a bid by Jill Lansing, Lyle 
Menendez's lead lawyer in the first trial, to return to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Lyle Menendez's approval, Lansing had resigned shortly after the first 
trial ended, saying she wanted to spend more time with her young daughter. 
Deputy Public Defenders Bill Weiss and Terri Towery took over as the older 
brother's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 In court papers filed in recent weeks, however, Lyle Menendez said that he 
wanted Lansing back, explaining that he believed Weiss and Towery were taking 
too long to get ready for the second trial. 
</P>
<P>
 If Lansing came back, said Ephraim Margolin, a prominent San Francisco 
attorney who argued Thursday on her behalf, she could be ready to begin a trial 
in 90 days. If Weiss and Towery stay on the case, Margolin said, the trial 
might not begin for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case can be over before the public defenders would be ready to begin 
trying it," Margolin said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, a complication -- the possibility that Lansing could be 
called as a witness against Lyle Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first trial, Lyle Menendez admitted that he once offered to bribe 
an ex-girlfriend, Jamie Pisarcik, urging her to lie for him by claiming that 
Jose Menendez "made a pass" at her. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear what, if anything, Lansing knows about the attempted bribe. 
But the issue prompted several closed-door hearings during the first trial and 
Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn, the lead prosecutor in the case, said Thursday 
that he would not hesitate to call her as a witness: "We are going to attack 
Ms. Lansing's credibility, if the facts bear that out." 
</P>
<P>
 In part because of that complication, Weisberg put off a ruling on whether 
Lansing is coming back.

 With the release of 100 white doves symbolizing the community's rebirth, more 
than 300 people held a candlelight vigil Thursday evening on the anniversary of 
last year's firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recovery has been a lot of unglamorous, very difficult work," said Mayor 
Ann Christoph, who presented proclamations to city workers and firefighters for 
heroism in the face of a "torrid nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the clamor of sea gulls, speakers including poets, artists, city 
officials and residents who lost their homes told of personal tragedies and of 
the city's determination to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 27, 1993, fire scorched 14,000 acres and damaged or destroyed 441 
homes, including the Canyon Acres home of sculpture David Sabaroff. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Sabaroff told the crowd at Main Beach, "the loss was really too much 
to take. It hurt a lot. I lost a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 But the community offered food, shelter and help, and Sabaroff, 47, stayed to 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Swinging a bucket filled with metal buttons reading "I Laguna Beach," Sabaroff 
proclaimed: "I love Laguna Beach. Anyone who wants one of these, come see me." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. recalled how ill he felt as he rode in a 
helicopter above the flames that were consuming his friends' houses and, as far 
as he knew, his own. When Purcell learned the next day that his home had been 
spared, he "was absolutely shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Manager Cindy King, whose Mystic Hills home burned in the blaze, 
said she had been too busy Thursday to dwell on the fire or its anniversary. 
But at some point, she realized she was wearing the same suit she had worn last 
Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I put it on unconsciously or not," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6:15 p.m., following the speakers, participants lit candles in a quiet 
commemoration. As darkness fell, the crowd began to disperse. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Mystic Hills homeowners will have their own informal commemoration. 
David Horne, president of the homeowners association, said they do not want to 
call it a celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no feeling of exuberance," Horne said, "but there was a consensus 
that we should get together." 
</P>
<P>
 Then-Mayor Lida Lenney said the trauma is still there for many people, 
including herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a television crew in town who wanted to interview me," Lenney said. "I 
really searched my soul and found out I couldn't do that. When I shared that 
with a school psychologist, I was told the same thing happened at Thurston 
Elementary School. A TV crew came in and wanted to talk to children who had 
lost their homes and children who had not. And the ones who had lost their 
homes did not want to talk on camera." 
</P>
<P>
 David Bishop of Laguna Cares, a free counseling service established 
immediately after the fire, recalled that at first the victims were numb, then 
joyous that they were alive and their community intact. In the first six 
months, counselors saw more than 200 clients. 
</P>
<P>
 One resident would hear a siren go by while at work and lose concentration for 
45 minutes. Another could not pay attention behind the wheel and had to limit 
her driving, "because her mind would drift," Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the anniversary marked the fact that "we've made it through a year, 
and we can go forward," said Nesse Smith, Laguna Cares' office manager, who 
spent hours hosing down her own rooftop that frightful day. "We look at this 
anniversary as a commemoration, but I think a lot of people have made new 
friends, realized they had friends they didn't know they had, and seen a lot of 
opportunities open up." 
</P>
<P>
 For Marshall and Sharon McNair, who attended the commemoration wearing 
"Rebirth 1994" T-shirts from the Laguna Fire Relief Coalition, the city has 
been moving forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the goal is to make sure it doesn't happen again," Marshall McNair 
said, "and you see that with people clearing away brush around their home, 
using fire-retardant materials for their roof, and the city's trying to get a 
new water reservoir." 
</P>
<P>
 Lenney said she's optimistic that the city can heal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember being in a restaurant the other day for breakfast," Lenney said. 
"And there was a group of women speaking animatedly. When they got up to leave, 
they were in good spirits. One of the women turned around and announced: 'We're 
going to break ground today!' "

RAIL DECISION SETS NEW COURSE FOR FUTURE; TIMELINE: VALLEY SUBWAY WILL PROBABLY 
TAKE DECADES TO COMPLETE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The vote is in -- but actual subway cars whisking commuters across the San 
Fernando Valley are still years, if not decades, away. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted to pursue 
construction of a mostly subway transit line across the Valley, rejecting the 
idea of an elevated rail along the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even if the project moves forward on a fast track -- which MTA officials 
concede is highly unlikely -- 16-year-olds getting their driver's licenses this 
year will be at least 40 when the 13.8-mile project is completed, sometime 
after 2018. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, too, that the largest group of riders may be people who don't even 
live here -- or who have yet to be born. More than a quarter of present Valley 
residents will have died of old age by the time the project is completed, based 
on U. S. Census Bureau statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the best conditions, construction is not expected to begin until 2002. 
It will take that long for the MTA to raise the money and complete the studies 
necessary to build the line, which would run roughly along Burbank and Chandler 
boulevards between North Hollywood and Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The line's ultimate size and shape will be determined over the next several 
years, said Judith Wilson, the MTA's director of planning and programming. So 
far, the only definite aspect of the project will be the route. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said of the route: "I won't say that it has been studied to within a 
gnat's eyelash, but I will say that it has been studied in a lot of detail." 
</P>
<P>
 Total cost for the subway line ranges between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions over how best to proceed will be addressed in a so-called major 
investment study, which will take two years to complete. The study essentially 
argues to the federal government that the project is a worthwhile use of tax 
money and that local transit officials studied all alternatives before 
deciding. 
</P>
<P>
 But how the line ultimately will operate depends on a number of factors, not 
the least of which is how much money the MTA is able to secure from the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials are uncertain even how many of the planned 10 stations along the 
line will be built when the line starts up. If funding falls below expected 
levels, some stations may be deferred or the line may terminate at the San 
Diego Freeway until more money can be found, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money for the project will come from a combination of federal, state and local 
sources. Wilson said the MTA expects the federal government to finance about 
half of the costs. More money would come from Proposition A and C funds, 
generated by voter-approved sales tax hikes of half a cent each. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the uncertainty, MTA officials said they can count on one thing: 
lawsuits. The location of the line is sure to continue to raise the ire of 
opponents, who have argued for years that the line should not cut through their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the MTA, we are no strangers to controversy," Wilson said. "Hopefully we 
won't be challenged successfully. We find that generally the best defense 
against a legal challenge is to do the very best job we can."

NEWS ANALYSIS; RAIL DECISION SETS NEW COURSE FOR FUTURE; MAYOR: RIORDAN'S KEY 
VOTE WILL LEAVE LASTING MARK -- FOR GOOD OR ILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The proposed Valley rail line presented Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan with 
a rare opportunity to leave a lasting mark on the city and prove himself as 
good a friend of the San Fernando Valley as he promised during his election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 To many, Riordan came through Wednesday by delivering a crucial bloc of four 
votes for the approval of a Metro Red Line subway extension from Universal City 
to Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision for the underground system rather than an elevated line down the 
Ventura Freeway ended more than a decade of political bickering and gridlock 
that held the Valley railway hostage as other transit projects slipped ahead in 
line. Local officials were nearly unanimous Thursday in applauding Riordan for 
breaking the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid the praise were cautions that the ultimate verdict on Riordan's 
decision will not be returned until completion of the rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the short but checkered history of subway construction in Los 
Angeles, the final outcome decades from now could be a huge plus next to 
Riordan's name -- or an indelible black mark, carved right into the Valley's 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Predicting a politician's long-term legacy is like predicting the Raiders 
will win on Sunday," Northridge political consultant Paul Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In large part, the subway has been a disaster" so far, he said. "I would 
think that the mayor would not want it to be the hallmark of his 
Administration. . . . My grandchildren would want to remember Mayor Riordan for 
something that wouldn't be costing them money." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the points Riordan scored Wednesday with Valley homeowner and civic 
groups, which mostly supported the subway, Clarke said the short-term political 
impact of the decision is also tough to gauge. 
</P>
<P>
 The political landscape can change drastically in a short period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan will stand for reelection three years from now, and "the issues that 
will appeal to voters in 1997 will not be the issues that people are dealing 
with in 1994," Clarke said. "We'll be an awfully dull community if no issue 
comes up between now and 1997" that will eclipse the rail controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, there is widespread agreement that there are fewer opportunities 
for local politicians to make decisions with such enduring effects on the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a position on the future of mass transit in the Valley, and thus ending 
the deadlock, was important for Riordan to demonstrate his commitment to a 
region increasingly willing to flex its political muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley accounted for 44% of the city's vote in last year's mayoral 
election. Nearly three-quarters of Valley voters picked Riordan over then-City 
Councilman Mike Woo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the mayor is willing to take a stand for the Valley is a good 
sign," said Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who also supported a subway. 
"The Valley is used to being ignored by the people downtown. . . . This is 
every bit as significant as Tom Bradley's commitment to the beginning of the 
subway, as other people's visions for the port or the airport. You do not have 
large capital projects like this anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles school board President Roberta Weintraub said: "I can't 
imagine Riordan having another opportunity to be a part of such an expensive 
building operation. There isn't much left in the way of money to leave your 
mark. It's going to be a critically important part of his Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 By voting for the subway alignment along Burbank and Chandler boulevards, the 
mayor was forced to abandon the endorsement he made of the Ventura Freeway 
monorail during his election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Although more vocal public support for the underground system helped change 
his mind, Riordan laid himself open to criticism by reversing course. Indeed, 
Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, the monorail's most outspoken 
champion, excoriated the mayor for "lacking vision" and going "back on his 
word." 
</P>
<P>
 "The public is always ready to look critically when an elected official 
changes position," acknowledged Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick, one 
of 11 council members who voted last week to back the subway alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 But she predicted that Riordan's conversion would resonate strongly with those 
who urged him to switch sides, many of them influential in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be remembered for a long time," Chick said. "Maybe not by a broad 
base, . . . but for all the people who were intimately involved in this, they 
will remember, and many of them are community and business leaders in the 
Valley. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley's going to continue watching closely and having high 
expectations."

PRUDENTIAL FIRM AGREES TO STRICT FRAUD SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capping an investigation into what is believed to be the largest fraud by a 
single brokerage against small investors, federal prosecutors on Thursday filed 
criminal charges against Prudential Securities for its $8-billion limited 
partnership program. But prosecutors agreed not to press charges if the 
brokerage lives up to a strict settlement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential for the first time formally admitted that it had knowingly made 
"false and misleading" statements to retirees and other small investors, who 
bought partnership units based on Prudential's false assurances that they were 
safe, tax sheltered and certain to bring a large return. 
</P>
<P>
 Over more than a decade, more than 600,000 investors nationwide put money into 
Prudential's approximately 700 limited partnerships. Their losses are believed 
to have totaled over $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubled brokerage firm, a subsidiary of giant Prudential Insurance, also 
agreed as part of the settlement to transfer immediately an additional $330 
million into an open-ended settlement fund established a year ago for its 
clients. It thus doubled the amount paid into the fund so far.  
</P>
<P>
 The Prudential case stands as perhaps the most dramatic symbol of the 
overzealousness with which some brokerages pursued profits during the go-go 
1980s, encouraging their salespeople to go to great lengths to earn huge 
commissions and fatten the bottom line. The Prudential abuses also occurred at 
a time when securities regulators and prosecutors were focusing on high profile 
cases, such as those involving junk bond promoter Michael Milken and convicted 
inside trader Ivan F. Boesky, paying scant attention to schemes that affected 
smaller investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Jo White, U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said the agreement not to prosecute 
Prudential -- called a "deferred prosecution" -- was based on fear that an 
indictment could throw the firm's 18,000 employees out of work and further harm 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was also based on the fact that Prudential had cooperated in the 
inquiry and agreed to admit wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
 White emphasized that criminal investigations are continuing of former 
executives and charges may eventually be filed against them. 
</P>
<P>
 White hinted that one advantage of forcing Prudential to pay the $330 million 
immediately is that it would be available to investors even if Prudential 
should collapse.  
</P>
<P>
 A group of state securities regulators, meanwhile, warned that as a Jan. 10, 
1995, deadline looms, thousands of investors across the country who are 
eligible to receive money from the fund haven't yet filed a claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased that the government has decided to end its investigation 
and not take further legal action," Prudential President and Chief Executive 
Hardwick Simmons said in a written statement. He said the firm is "dramatically 
different" today, and added, "I believe the government's decision underscores 
the fact that we have taken extraordinary steps to resolve the partnership 
problem and fund any legitimate claims of investors." 
</P>
<P>
 The admission of criminal wrongdoing, however, represents a remarkable 
pirouette by Prudential, which up until now has fiercely denied in civil 
lawsuits and arbitration cases that it broke the law. Although Prudential to 
date has paid out more than $1 billion in partnership claims, the denials have 
helped Prudential keep the costs of its settlements down, often preventing 
small investors from getting back the full amount of their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in a federal court hearing in New Orleans in January involving 
Prudential's Energy Income Fund partnerships, Prudential lawyers called expert 
witnesses and argued that the firm had done nothing to defraud investors. At 
the end of the hearing, based largely on Prudential's presentation, a judge 
approved a hotly contested class-action settlement that paid investors much 
less than their full losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the documents filed Thursday as part of the settlement with prosecutors, 
Prudential admitted most of the wrongdoing it had specifically denied in the 
New Orleans hearing. Nevertheless, White said, the New Orleans settlement is 
final. Investors covered by such private class-action settlements aren't 
eligible for the big settlement pool that Prudential added to on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal charges focused on the Energy Income Funds, which were the 
subject of a 1993 investigative series in The Times. Prudential sold about $1.4 
billion of Energy Income units to more than 100,000 small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them, too, were petroleum partnerships. In January, a group of investors 
filed suit in Orange County Superior Court against the accounting firm Arthur 
Andersen & Co., alleging a massive accounting fraud regarding the investments. 
Several of the investors were from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnerships lost money because huge amounts were siphoned out in fees and 
commissions -- 15% in the case of Energy Income Funds -- and because income 
projections had been based on dubious assumptions about how much the 
investments would yield. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the settlement, the charges were filed in the form of a criminal 
complaint rather than an indictment. The accusations include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Prudential "falsely instructed its brokers that the investment was safe, low 
risk and suitable for all investors."  
</P>
<P>
 * The firm falsely told investors that the income would be tax sheltered. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prudential misled investors into thinking they were receiving income from 
the partnerships when in fact they were only receiving back their own original 
investment.  
</P>
<P>
 The charges are to be held in abeyance for three years and then dropped, 
unless Prudential violates the settlement. Under the accord, Prudential must 
not violate any criminal laws and must continue to cooperate with the 
government in its investigation.

ASSESSOR SAYS HIS OFFICE NOT AT FAULT; TAXES: HE INSISTS THAT IT'S THE APPEALS 
BOARD CLERK WHO'S TO BLAME FOR A DEADLINE SNAFU THAT FORCED THE COUNTY TO 
ACCEPT PROPERTY OWNERS' ESTIMATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 County Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs on Thursday said his office was not 
responsible for bungling more than 170 property assessment appeals and directed 
blame for the situation at the Appeals Board clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs said it was solely the responsibility of Clerk Phyllis A. Henderson to 
make sure that residents and businesses appealing their property taxes receive 
a hearing on the matter before the two-year deadline expires. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessor said that for the past seven years he had gone beyond the duties 
of his office by notifying Henderson when appeal deadlines were approaching but 
that he stopped giving her those status reports in July after her office said 
his reports were no longer needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The clerk of the board told us to stop sending the notices because they 
claimed that their system would handle it," Jacobs said. "We stopped at their 
insistence." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs said he didn't know if he had received a memo from the clerk about 
halting the reminders. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson did not return repeated calls to her office Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 She has previously said she doesn't know what happened to the missing cases 
and is unsure whether the assessor forwarded them or whether her staff 
misplaced the files. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the cases were not reviewed before the statutory deadline, the county 
was forced to accept the owners' estimates of the value of their properties 
instead of the assessor's valuation -- a difference of about $172 million in 
taxable property. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs' comments were the first comprehensive response from his office since 
county officials discovered that 178 cases passed their review deadlines. 
Jacobs, who had ordered his staff not to discuss the situation this week, said 
he had been attending an out-of-town conference for the past several days and 
could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he said the clerk was responsible for the mistakes, Jacobs said 
Thursday that he was "uncomfortable" assigning blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think finger-pointing is productive," he said. "It's a real 
unfortunate situation, we realize that it's not our problem. But it was 
probably a human systems error . . . regardless of fault, we want to focus on 
fixing the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will again send remainders to the clerk to alert her office that 
appeal deadlines are approaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an engineer, and engineers focus on solving problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors, who have sharply criticized both the clerk and the 
assessor, have called for an extensive investigation into the process. 
Henderson, who is appointed by the board to her position, has been meeting with 
supervisors this week to discuss her role in the matter. Because Jacobs is an 
elected official, he does not report to the board. Nonetheless, the board has 
been considering revoking a raise Jacobs recently received from the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing we're striving to do is identify the breakdown and prevent a 
re-occurrence," said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. "We'd like to know where the 
breakdown occurred and who is responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, state officials said Orange County's practice of having property 
owners send their appeals to the assessor instead of the clerk was fraught with 
potential "conflict of interests" problems and may be a violation of state law. 
They said Orange County appears to be the only county in the state that doesn't 
require appeals to be sent directly to the clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs acknowledged Thursday that the county's system may be flawed. He said 
he has asked the appeals clerk to assume the responsibility of receiving the 
appeals at least half a dozen times over the years but she has declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs said the county asked the assessor in 1977 to handle the first appeals 
to make sure that the property owner had filled out the forms correctly. After 
checking the forms for completeness, the assessor sends the files to the clerk 
and never deals with the files again. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Henderson said she has always wanted to be the one to 
initially receive the appeals. She also said the recent foul-up might have been 
avoided had the county followed the practice of other counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs defended the workers in his office and said they have been doing an 
"exceptional" work despite a tremendous workload that has been caused by the 
state's recession. Once property values started to fall in the state, Jacobs 
said, his office was flooded with tens of thousands of appeals of property 
assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs said most of the appraisers in his office who handle the assessment 
appeals don't pay attention to the two-year deadline because it is the clerk's 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, some county appraisers have contacted some residents about 
their cases, even though their appeals had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Dodson filed an assessment appeal in 1992, when the county increased his 
tax bill by $1,000 a year after he built a new garage and apartment for his 
Yorba Linda home. He said an appraiser called about month after the two-year 
deadline expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hassled me over the phone and said I wasn't going to win," Dodson said. 
"He wanted me to cancel my (appeals hearing)." He said he considered the 
appraiser's actions "very dishonest and deceitful."  
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, however, said his staff was not trying to influence anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We absolutely don't do things like that," he said. "They (residents) can't 
withdraw if they wanted to. It would be stupid of us." In cases where the 
deadline has expired, Jacobs said, the state law requires that a resident's 
assessment prevails until a hearing can be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Knudsen, the principal appraiser in the assessment standards division 
of the State Board of Equalization, said Thursday it would be inappropriate for 
a county employee to attempt to pressure property owners due a tax rollback to 
instead withdraw their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's perfectly normal for the assessor's staff to talk with taxpayers about 
their appeals and express an opinion," he said. "I certainly hope (officials) 
didn't get a waiver of appeals knowing that (the county) had already lost" 
because of the missed deadlines.

MAN HURT BY DEFECTIVE GUN RECEIVES $100,000 SETTLEMENT; COMPENSATION: 
WINCHESTER SHOTGUN BLEW APART IN HAND OF IRVINE CABINETMAKER. MODEL HAS BEEN 
RECALLED. 
</P>

 A cabinetmaker received a $100,000 settlement this week for injuries he 
suffered when a Winchester shotgun blew apart in his hand, an accident that led 
to a national recall of the gun model, lawyers for the victim and the gun 
manufacturer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,500 guns are affected by the recall, and the majority of the owners 
have been notified that they should not shoot them and should exchange them, an 
attorney for the manufacturer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall was prompted by the malfunction that Brian Lohrke, 37, of Irvine 
and a few other gun owners experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohrke, a lifelong sport shooter, was among the first to buy the Winchester 
1001 Sporting Clay II when it came on the market last October, said his lawyer, 
Frank Nunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohrke had fired 6,000 to 7,000 rounds with his new shotgun before there was 
any trouble, Nunes said. But on Feb. 10, he was skeet shooting at the Orange 
County Shooting and Training Center in Irvine when the gun burst apart, ripping 
open his left hand and severing a major tendon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both barrels flew off the gun and landed 30 yards away," Nunes said. A 
forensic engineer who studied the shattered gun concluded that the receiver 
barrel, where the gun is loaded, had a design flaw and that an inferior quality 
of steel had been used to build the firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunes said that Lohrke did not file a lawsuit against the gun manufacturer but 
entered into negotiations that culminated Monday in the signing of a $100,000 
out-of-court settlement to cover his medical bills, lost income, pain and 
suffering. Nunes said that his client had surgery on his injured hand, which is 
now "95% back to normal," and that he has returned to his fine carpentry work. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Motsko, lawyer for U.S. Repeating Arms Co., the Connecticut-based firm 
that makes Winchester guns, said the company sent letters to its customers, 
distributors and dealers last month recalling all of its Winchester 1001 
product line, including models that are used for shooting game as well as clay 
pigeons. They were moderately priced guns that retailed for $1,000 to $1,200, 
Motsko said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had received two or three other reports of the shotguns 
malfunctioning, Motsko said, although he added that there were no other reports 
of injuries. He said that the vast majority of the approximately 1,500 people 
who bought the shotguns have been notified not to shoot them and that the 
recalled guns may be exchanged for other models. He estimated that another 
1,000 guns have been pulled off store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he said, the Winchester 1001 has gone back to the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
 Motsko said the recall of the Winchester 1001 is only the second recall of a 
new Winchester gun that he can remember at U.S. Repeating Arms over the past 30 
years. He said a new caliber version of a hunting rifle was recalled earlier 
this year for adjustments, also in response to consumer complaints. But in that 
case, he said, no one was injured.

3 CONVICTED IN KILLINGS OF POLICE OFFICER, GROCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three men were convicted of first-degree murder Thursday for killing a Maywood 
police officer, and two of them were also found guilty of murdering a Van Nuys 
market owner, clearing the way for a jury to determine whether they should be 
sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court jury found Jose Contreras, Benjamin Alberto 
Navarro and Edgardo Sanchez Fuentes guilty of the May 29, 1992, shooting of 
Officer John Hoglund, who was gunned down as he responded to a silent burglar 
alarm at a Maywood market. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoglund, 46, was the first officer in the history of the Maywood Police 
Department to be killed in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras and Fuentes were also convicted of murdering Lee Chul Kim, 49, who 
was shot on May 4, 1992, in the freezer of his grocery store in Van Nuys after 
he returned from the bank with a large amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of the verdicts pleased friends of Hoglund who were in court 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stunned, I'm amazed, and I think it's great," said his fiancee, Terri 
Smith, who noted Hoglund had set their wedding date the night before he was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes and Contreras were each convicted on 38 counts -- including murder, 
robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and stun guns -- stemming from a series 
of seven robberies. Navarro, who was not charged in connection with the Kim 
slaying, was convicted on 32 counts for his role in five of the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men were also found guilty of a laundry list of special allegations 
that expose them to the death penalty, including killing a police officer and 
committing murder during the course of a robbery and to avoid arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes and Contreras, who were each acquitted of two counts of robbery, were 
also found guilty of the special allegation of committing multiple murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a wonderful verdict," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Speer, who 
co-prosecuted the case with Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Grosbard. 
</P>
<P>
 To convict the men, all in their early 20s, prosecutors relied on a security 
camera videotape that clearly captured the images of the three defendants 
inside the burglarized Maywood grocery store, just minutes before the shooting 
of Hoglund. At one point in the video, some of them were shown walking around 
the store after the robbery, drinking Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also alleged that during the robberies, which spanned an area from 
Paramount to Van Nuys, the defendants used electric-shock stun guns on 
employees to torture them into handing over money, threatened to cut off one 
woman's fingers and shoved a gun in another man's mouth and threatened to blow 
his brains out. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial will continue Monday with the start of the penalty phase, during 
which jurors must decide whether the three should be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've known from the outset that the fiercest battle is going to be waged at 
the penalty phase," said James Leonard, an attorney for Contreras. "I'm 
confident that after a jury hears all the evidence about Mr. Contreras' life 
they will reject the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric K. Davis, an attorney for Navarro, who described the verdicts as 
"expected," said he will present a psychologist who is an expert on Central 
American culture to testify on behalf of his client, who is from El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 "My client has never denied his involvement, but our position has always been 
. . . that the death penalty is not the appropriate punishment," said Davis, 
who described Navarro as the lookout during several of the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 James Coady, a deputy public defender representing Fuentes, could not be 
reached Thursday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Speer said she plans to present her own evidence showing two of the defendants 
committed violent crimes in the past. The prosecutor said Navarro has a prior 
armed robbery conviction and Fuentes has a prior conviction for possession of 
cocaine base and had been arrested for attempted robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty phase is expected to last about a week, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoglund's fiancee said she planned to celebrate Thursday's verdicts with 
friends and family at the slain officer's favorite Mexican restaurant in 
Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want John's memory to be forgotten," she said. "He died in the line 
of duty. He's a true hero." 
</P>
<P>
 She added that "the sadness that came when we lost John resurfaced," last week 
with news of the slaying of LAPD Officer Charles Heim at a Hollywood motel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He too had all his future ahead of him," Smith said. "His baby, his health."

THE RECYCLING ROUTE; CRUSHER CHEWS UP CONCRETE, ASPHALT FOR FREEWAY WIDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the shoulder of the Santa Ana Freeway at Grand Avenue, the huge metal jaws 
of a rattling, dusty machine chomp on big blocks of concrete and asphalt, 
grinding up the material and spitting it onto a conveyor belt. 
</P>
<P>
 The belt whisks the pieces away, separating them into two streams, one made of 
chunks needing to be chewed up once more, and the other carrying off pieces no 
bigger than one square inch. 
</P>
<P>
 This is recycling at its ultimate. 
</P>
<P>
 All the concrete and asphalt came from bridges that were torn down and traffic 
lanes that were ripped up as part of Caltrans' highway-widening project. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the crusher has done its work, the pulverized material heads toward 
its second life -- as the high-quality base for new ramps and travel lanes as 
the Santa Ana Freeway is widened to six lanes along the 38-mile stretch between 
the Riverside Freeway and Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 To save money and energy, the old stuff is crushed along the shoulder or in 
the median and then relaid below the new concrete or asphalt surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major budget savings," said Caltrans engineer Bill Gilchrist, who 
helps oversee the $1.7-billion widening project. "It's needed material, and the 
mobile crushers are a whole new generation. It costs quite a bit to haul the 
concrete away to be able to recycle it." 
</P>
<P>
 The roadside recycling has been going on since the widening project began 
three years ago. The project is expected to be completed in late 1996 or early 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Caltrans, 30,000 tons of concrete were recycled on the Main 
Street intersection project in Santa Ana alone. The department does not know 
how many tons of concrete will be recycled during the entire widening. 
</P>
<P>
 The machine crunches 1,800 tons of road material a day, said foreman Bob 
Guerrero of the rock-crushing company Diversified Materials, as he wiped eyes 
bloodshot from two decades of dust and flying debris from the rock-crushing 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero said he expects the mound of material at Grand Avenue will be 
recycled by the end of the week. Then the rock crushing and recycling will 
begin anew on another portion of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Next in line is the interchange of the Santa Ana and the Costa Mesa freeways, 
then the El Toro "Y," where a mountain of used concrete and asphalt awaits its 
turn in the crusher's jaws.  
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said such concrete recycling is now common 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had an aggressive recycling campaign for many years now," he said. 
"It's a cost issue and it's also an environmental issue." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the material from bridges and roads that collapsed in the 1989 Loma 
Prieta earthquake was also recycled and used to rebuild the roads. 
</P>
<P>
 California isn't the only place where the environmentally conscious have found 
new uses for old concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 When Chicago's old Comiskey Park, built in 1910, was demolished in 1991 to 
make way for the new Comiskey Park, the used concrete was crushed up and became 
the base for area parking lots and roadways, including the reconstructed Lake 
Shore Drive.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; LAW RUBS MASSAGE THERAPISTS WRONG WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new Newport Beach ordinance aimed at curtailing prostitution has angered 
therapeutic massage professionals, who contend the ordinance brands them as 
illegitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, which received unanimous preliminary approval from the City 
Council on Monday, would subject anyone who wants a massage license to venereal 
disease testing, fingerprinting, background checks and spot inspections by 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those that are legitimate massage therapists, it is very degrading," 
massage therapist Kim Bender told the council. "We are not performing any 
sexual activities. There are those that are. . . . It doesn't take a rocket 
scientist to walk into it and tell." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin J. Murphy said the proposed law is a move to streamline the 
permit process by putting licensing functions in the hands of police and 
leaving only fee collection to the Finance Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes beyond looking at the issue of massage," he said. "It goes to the 
organization and revenue collection for those already on the books." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the ordinance gets final approval Nov. 14, testing and enforcement 
would be done by the Police Department's vice, narcotics and intelligence 
section. Therapists say that is guilt by association. 
</P>
<P>
 City law requires that masseuses and masseurs show they have 300 hours of 
training, while "holistic health professionals" must have 500 hours of training 
or 300 hours plus 500 hours of experience working for a medical professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Capt. Jim Jacobs, who crafted the ordinance and has asked the council 
approval to hire a community services officer to administer it, said the 
presence of 42 licensed massage establishments makes it necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, Newport Beach has more massage establishments than any other 
city in Orange County, possibly more than all of them put together," he 
said.HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; UCI STUDENT-FACULTY SKIT PROTESTS PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a skit designed to show the consequences of Proposition 187, UC Irvine 
faculty members Thursday hung signs labeled "illegal" or "alien" around the 
necks of students who supposedly had written papers on immigration, couldn't 
speak English or were seen hanging around the campus cross-cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the skit drew laughs from students on their way to class Thursday, 
organizers hoped to show the audience the effects on education if the 
controversial proposition is passed.The initiative would deny non-emergency 
health care, education and social services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The passage of 187 would make something like this a reality. It seems funny . 
. . but we would be expected to report any student who was suspected of being 
undocumented," Prof. John H. Smith said. "It would force faculty to become 
agents of the INS. You see where this is leading. It's dividing up the society 
into those we want to be here and those we want to eject." 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty gathered around the students in the skit, asking, "You wrote a paper 
on your immigrant history. Can you prove your citizenship?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if he's illegal or not but he's been giving me problems in 
class. Get rid of him!" 
</P>
<P>
 "What about you? I've seen you in the cross-cultural center. Don't resist, 
it'll make it harder on you, young man." 
</P>
<P>
 Most students, like senior Daphne Dodge, said they oppose the measure. "I 
heard a couple of guys walking by who yelled, 'You get what you pay for,' but I 
think that if you are working and helping the economy, you are entitled to the 
services." DEBBIE KONG

<P>
 Using a mix of science and sorcery, Candice Romero, 8, conjured up a witch's 
brew of fake blood and ectoplasmic slime as her classmates looked on and 
giggled. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly enchanted with the experiment, she announced later that, "I like the 
slime.It's gooey and sticky." 
</P>
<P>
 Candice was one of 28 students from Greenville Fundamental School who took 
part in an unusual celebration of both Halloween and science on Thursday. The 
students gathered at the Discovery Science Center's Launch Pad at South Coast 
Plaza to learn about bats and blood and skeletons and slime and other facts 
that relate to the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 The students' activities were a preview of the Launch Pad's "Scientifically 
Haunted Halloween," which will run Saturday and Sunday at 11 a.m., 1 p.m. and 3 
p.m., spokeswoman Pam Shambra said. 
</P>
<P>
 During Thursday's event, children mixed polyvinyl alcohol, borax and water to 
create small cups of clear, gelatinous goo. They also mixed red food dye with 
corn syrup to create fake blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Children assembled a skeleton and watched a slide show about bats and how they 
help humans by eating insects, pollinating plants and fertilizing crops. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the activities may have created a monster or two. Several children 
said they now planned to create slime and fake blood to trick -- not treat -- 
others, as befits the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to trick people. I'm going to tell them that I'm bleeding," said 
Jacob Long, 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Samantha Cadwell, 8, said she planned to use her homemade slime to scare her 
siblings: "Maybe I'll put some on my little sister and throw some at my older 
sister, but I have to lure her into the kitchen because my mom wouldn't like it 
on the carpet."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 100 NEIGHBORS WELCOME BACK FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the earth was still bucking the morning of Jan. 17, the firefighters of 
Station 70 in Northridge sped out the back door because the front was crumpled. 
Nine months later they returned -- to a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 people turned out Thursday to rededicate the renovated station 
and welcome back the firefighters, who had no idea how badly their 
home-away-from-home was damaged as they rushed to pull the living and the dead 
from the nearby Northridge Meadows Apartments complex. 
</P>
<P>
 It was wonderful to be back, said Engineer Gary Kahler. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a crowd of thankful neighbors, much of the city's firefighting 
brass, as well as several elected officials, were on hand for the ceremonies at 
the station at 9861 Reseda Blvd. The engines and ladder trucks had been pulled 
outside, and speaking from a podium, the voices of praise echoed in the 
concrete-and-brick bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the best in the world," declared Los Angeles City Councilman Hal 
Bernson, who represents the northwest Valley. "They lay it on the line for us 
every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Fire Chief Donald O. Manning said: "I think firefighters are in 
one of the most honorable professions. . . . I can't tell you how proud I am of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of the C Platoon at Station 70 were literally thrown from 
their bunks when the Northridge temblor -- centered virtually beneath the 
station -- hit at 4:31 that Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who were left in bed were buried in tiles and light fixtures that were 
shaken loose from the ceiling, Capt. Bob Fickett said.  
</P>
<P>
 With the power knocked out and no emergency generators, the station was as 
dark as the rest of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the 10 men fumbled their way to the fire pole, slid down, suited up and 
headed out the back door. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving down the lightless Reseda Boulevard, none of the men at first noticed 
that Northridge Meadows was now only two stories high, instead of three. 
</P>
<P>
 After extinguishing a nearby house fire, they drove back past the apartment 
complex, and now, in the earliest light of morning, could see the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawling into the collapsed structure as powerful aftershocks rolled through, 
the firefighters rescued three residents who had been trapped in the wreckage. 
And they helped remove the bodies of the 16 who were crushed. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until later they would learn their own building had incurred some 
$811,000 in damage and they would have to move out and spend the next nine 
months at a station designed for a company one-third their 30-man size. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters were thrilled be back home Thursday. Their neighbors were 
thrilled to have them. 
</P>
<P>
 Al and Ruth Schwartz live right next to Northridge Meadows and marveled that 
destructive morning at the speedy work of the men of Station 70. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came to applaud our firemen," Ruth Schwartz said. "They're wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Three-year-old Gary Garland of Winnetka felt the same way. Red plastic fire 
hat on his head and employing his mother, Tracy, as a sort of human 
hook-and-ladder, he held himself at grown firefighter level and went down the 
line, shaking hands with the men of Station 70. 
</P>
<P>
 So, did the towheaded boy want to be a firefighter, perchance, when he grew 
up? 
</P>
<P>
 He grinned and nodded his head, and the helmet slid down over his eyes. ERIC

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; EVERYDAY HEROES HONORED AT BANQUET

 After it was over, Kathleen Maher was clutching a certificate and thinking 
about her younger brother, Kevin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud of what he did, but it's an empty feeling," said Maher, whose 
brother was honored posthumously at the 15th annual Citizens Recognition 
Luncheon held by the Mid-Valley Community Police Council. "I'd rather have him 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Maher, an electrician, died Jan. 17 after the Northridge earthquake as 
he helped save a child trapped in a car. He was one of a dozen ordinary 
residents -- who stepped in to save lives, help a neighbor or catch criminals 
-- honored Thursday at the luncheon at the Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps their heroism is greater than our own," Los Angeles Deputy Police 
Chief Martin Pomeroy said. He noted that when citizens step in to help, they 
are not as well-trained or prepared as police, making their help more 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Maher was outside his Studio City home a few hours after the quake when 
a woman screamed that a live power line had fallen across her car and trapped 
her small daughter. Using a large pair of insulated pliers from his truck, 
Maher pulled the wire from the car as it whipped back and forth so the woman 
could rescue the girl. But as he tried to cut the wire, Maher was electrocuted. 
</P>
<P>
 His was the last presentation at Thursday's luncheon. Rep. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City) presented Kathleen Maher a flag that had flown over the U. S. 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Others honored had chased thieves, given first aid to a bicycle rider who had 
been hit by a car, caught a purse-snatcher and helped police find two suspected 
car thieves. The honorees talked about how they did not think about the risks 
when they acted. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Maher's story had an impact on everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart goes out to the woman whose brother died," said Michael Wolf of Van 
Nuys, another of the honorees. He and his neighbor, Jack Lattig, helped catch a 
burglar early on a Saturday morning in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheri Mendoza of Van Nuys saw a burglar take a bicycle from a neighbor's 
house, and rather than wait for police, decided to chase him in her car when he 
fled on the bike. She flagged down a patrol car and the thief was captured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't until later that I thought, 'What am I doing? I have kids at home,' 
" said Mendoza, a mother of two boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 500 attended the luncheon. The event raised close to $20,000 for the 
Mid-Valley Community Police Council, said the group's president, Philip Smith.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; REDEVELOPMENT PLAN DRAWS MIXED REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Residents and business people expressed mixed reactions to a Community 
Redevelopment Agency proposal to create an emergency redevelopment area in 
Sherman Oaks at a community meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting elicited sharply different responses in people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think overall the meeting went well," CRA project manager Lillian 
Burkenheim said. "It was a farce," homeowner activist Scott Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 people attended the second of two CRA meetings Wednesday evening at 
Millikan Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 Several commented on the proposal, according to some who attended. Burkenheim 
said about half were in favor of the plan and half were opposed. Harvey said 
most were critical of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA has proposed creating a 570-acre redevelopment area in Sherman Oaks, 
which was heavily damaged by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. The proposal 
calls for using local property tax revenues to rebuild wrecked residences and 
commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. has come out against the proposal as it 
stands, saying it does not specifically limit the CRA's powers of eminent 
domain, commit a set percentage of the project's $18.8-million budget to 
residential repair or safeguard a property owner's discretion to pay 
contractors less than union scale if they do not use CRA money. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce has endorsed the 
proposal, saying it would provide funds for residential rebuilding, has a good 
sense of priorities, and adequately limits the CRA's powers of eminent domain 
and planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey, co-chairman of the homeowner association's CRA Study Committee, 
complained that the format of the meeting discouraged people from learning from 
each other and from community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the CRA and Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's 
office presented the draft proposal. Then, those attending could ask questions 
of individual officials in booths. Lastly, people were called back together for 
a public comment period. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey said most who were unfamiliar with the subject grew tired and left 
during the last period. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was structured just fine, Burkenheim responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkenheim said a third community meeting will be held because some business 
areas were not properly notified of the first two meetings. KAY HWANGBO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; COUNCIL AGREES ON HOME-SIZE LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members have tentatively agreed to adopt some controls on 
construction of large homes, but rejected the idea of allowing 
single-room-occupancy hotels anywhere in the city as they debated a zoning code 
update that has been six years in the drafting. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also decided not to establish procedures that would give the 
Design Review Board authority to designate historic buildings and 
neighborhoods.The issue will be considered separately at a future time. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's study session was the council's final chance to polish an update 
of the city's zoning ordinance. A public hearing on the massive document will 
take place sometime after the election but before the end of the year, 
according to Community Enhancement Manager John Godlewski. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the last sticking points was the decision to adopt a 
"floor-to-lot-area" ratio that defines the permissible size of a house in 
relation to its lot size. The regulation is intended to prevent 
"mansionization" of neighborhoods where homes are built almost to the edges of 
their lots, Godlewski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council and planning commission members said the suggested formula was 
too generous but would calm residents concerned about losing their property 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also decided not to consider regulations that would permit 
single-room occupancy buildings, which often are used as temporary housing for 
the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they were concerned about the small size of the 
155-square-foot rooms. The city recently adopted an affordable housing plan 
that should accommodate many of those who would seek that type of shelter, 
Councilwoman Joanne Coontz said. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; PROTESTERS OPPOSE SMOKING INITIATIVE 
</P>

 Joe Camel had a bad day Wednesday in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of protesters from the American Cancer Society boarded a boat and 
ran an effigy of the cigarette logo up a yardarm to protest Philip Morris 
Companies' support of Proposition 188.The initiative would repeal all local 
smoking ordinances in California and block a statewide ban on smoking in most 
indoor workplaces, which is to take effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never support anything supported by Philip Morris," said Patty Day, a 
substance abuse counselor from Yorba Linda, who said she was duped into signing 
a petition to get the initiative on the ballot. "I didn't look carefully and I 
admit that." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Koehli, also a school anti-substance abuse counselor, said she objects 
to the deceptive tactics used to gain support for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is confused about this issue," she said. "Put it to the people 
clearly." 
</P>
<P>
 Also among the protesters was California Angels trainer Ned Bergert, who led 
the drive to ban smokeless tobacco from professional baseball locker rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their tactics are deceitful and their purpose is downright degrading," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Protester Art Leach said he smoked for 35 years, then quit -- the day before 
he had a laryngectomy, which his doctors attributed to his habit. That was in 
1966 and he has had to speak with an artificial voice simulator ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am angry about the millions of dollars that the tobacco companies have put 
out to get the young people to start (smoking)," he said.HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; RESIDENTS SKIP LEISURE FOR PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 50 Leisure World residents interrupted their leisure Thursday morning, 
taking picket signs in hand to march around the giant spinning globe at the 
entrance of the retirement community in protest of management policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying signs reading "Enough is Enough" and "Resident Power," the 
disgruntled seniors said the administrator of the 8,700-resident retirement 
community is paid too much and contended that his contract violates 
conflict-of-interest rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Dick Kissam, 76, said Leisure World administrator Habir Narang, who 
earns $160,000 a year, is paid more than any city manager in the county. Kissam 
and others say Narang also profited from $215,000 earned last year by the J.L. 
Moyer Co., which has an exclusive contract for the resale of Leisure World 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is a division of Narang's First Columbia Condominium Management 
company, which manages the 6,608-home community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying he's not a good manager. He probably is," Kissam said. "He's 
just getting too much money." 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Golden Rain Foundation, which governs Leisure World, does not 
agree. The board renewed Narang's contract Sept. 20, with only three of 18 
board members dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just found themselves something to do," board President Howard McCurdy 
said of the protesters. "It will probably die off." 
</P>
<P>
 Narang said most residents support the combination of management and sales as 
a "cost-effective" operation. "It's been running this way for 30 years," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach Mayor George Brown, a Leisure World resident, said he supports 
Narang. "If we had a group in support of the administration, we'd have more 
than 7,000 people out there," he said.RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; NEW MAYOR SAYS HER GOAL IS TO BRING RESIDENTS 
TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Julie Sa is challenging all residents to unite. 
</P>
<P>
 She stresses her message every time she votes on a controversial issue that 
pits neighbor against neighbor and tears the city apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Since she was elected to the City Council in 1992, Sa has routinely given 
brief speeches either before or after voting, urging the people who fight over 
projects or ordinances to "help each other and work for compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Sa, 43, said her style is the reason she was chosen this week to serve as the 
city's new mayor in the midst of heated dispute over whether the council should 
repeal a 2% utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the mediator," she said. "I think I can bring all the people back 
together to build a community that works together and cares about everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Sa's new position makes her the first Asian American mayor in Orange County. 
Sa, of Chinese ancestry, was born and raised in Korea. She immigrated to the 
United States in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Korean community is proud of Julie Sa," said Koo Oh, a long-time 
Fullerton business owner and resident who is president of the Korean-American 
Assn. of Orange County. "Some people may reject her kind of leadership but our 
city is (split) on many issues right now and we need somebody to act as the 
referee. That's what she's trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents agreed but believe Sa needs to take charge and establish her 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Julie's going to need a lot of support," former Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin 
said. "You can urge people to get along and love each other but love is not 
going to do it. She must show people how they can come together." 
</P>
<P>
 That is exactly what Sa said she intends to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to tell everybody to (mend) ties with neighbors and friends who 
haven't spoken in a long time," said Sa, who calls her parents daily and visits 
them in their Santa Ana home every Saturday. "Let's start right now, friend to 
friend, neighbor to neighbor. It's very important to get along with each other 
so we can help the city rebuild . . . eventually, I think we will all be one 
big happy family." 
</P>
<P>
 As mayor of a city of 130,000 residents, Sa, who became a U.S. citizen in 
1984, said she plans to push for a senior citizens' housing project to be 
developed at the Hughes Aircraft Co. facility once it shuts down.MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; COUNCIL APPROVES PLAN TO FIX UP STOCKPORT 
PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has unanimously backed a plan to bring picnic tables, two 
playgrounds, a hopscotch area and two small baseball backstops to Stockport 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The original plan had also called for a full basketball court at the 3.5-acre 
park, but the idea was nixed when residents, concerned about noise, pointed out 
the proximity of the Laguna Hills High School courts.The park does have a sand 
volleyball court, which the renovation will not displace. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements will also include a pathway throughout the park augmented by 
lights bright enough to provide safety but dim enough to discourage night use 
of the park. Some residents have complained about drug dealing in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The renovation is expected to cost the city nearly $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor R. Craig Scott and Councilwoman Melody Carruth said during Tuesday's 
meeting that they hope the park may be used as a practice field for youth 
soccer and baseball teams. The city has told neighboring residents that the 
improved park will not be used for actual games played by organized sports 
leagues, but it has not ruled out use of the park for practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Two tot lots will be built, one for toddlers and one for older children. A 
small asphalt area will contain hopscotch and four-square patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 One group picnic area with barbecues and a hot coal receptacle will be built, 
and other picnic tables will be scattered around the playground area. The 
backstops, expected to be used by T-ball teams and picnickers, will be placed 
in the front section of the park, far enough back to keep balls from landing on 
Wilkes Place.LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: DANA POINT; RALLY WILL SUPPORT PRESERVING HEADLANDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A rally to support preservation of the Dana Point Headlands is scheduled for 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Committee to Save the Headlands, the rally begins at noon at 
the Dana Strand parking area on Selva Road.It will include music, food and 
displays by artists and environmental groups. A ticket to the event costs $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists are against Measure C and Measure D, two local ballot 
initiatives that would allow a $500-million hotel and residential development 
on the 121-acre coastal site. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted in April to approve the development, saying it was a 
worthy project that would generate much-needed revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents contend that the development is too extensive for one of the 
last major undeveloped coastal properties in the county. They circulated a 
petition and gathered enough signatures to force a citywide vote.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; 2 TEEN-AGERS ADMIT TAGGING HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two teen-age boys have confessed to a graffiti spree at Agoura High School 
that lasted several months and caused about $10,000 damage, the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We received two names from the school district as possible suspects," said 
Sheriff's Deputy Steve Rorhbach."We interviewed them and they confessed." 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys, aged 14 and 15, are students at Agoura and Indian Hills high 
schools, said Don Zimring, assistant superintendent of business for the Las 
Virgenes Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The two spray-painted their monikers on walls and carved them into windows, 
Zimring said. They first struck in the spring of last year and continued into 
the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The taggers at one point were hitting the high school several times a week, 
Zimring said. Officials set up surveillance, hired private guards and had extra 
sheriff's patrols sent to the area, all to no avail, said Zimring. 
</P>
<P>
 After the district decided to offer a reward, information that led to the 
youths' arrest was given to Agoura High School's plant manager, Jim Burford. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will press charges against the teen-agers because of the extent 
of the damage, said Zimring. They also face disciplinary action at the district 
level, which can range from suspension to expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board will decide the two youths' punishment during closed session, 
probably at its Nov. 8 meeting, Zimring said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prior, unrelated graffiti incident, a 13-year-old confessed to tagging 
after being caught in the act during the summer at Lindero Canyon Middle 
School, said Zimring. His parents paid restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimring said the school disciplined the youth, but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The school also had a minor graffiti incident on one wall at Agoura High 
School last week that is under investigation, Zimring said. FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; LASORDA GIVES ANTI-DRUG TALK TO 700 
STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tommy Lasorda, who is well known for managing ballplayers on the base paths, 
on Thursday gave more than 700 youngsters some advice on how to walk the path 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a weeklong schedule of anti-drug-themed events to commemorate Red 
Ribbon Week in the Glendale schools, the Dodgers' manager told Rosemont Middle 
School students that to succeed in life, they must stick to the basics: hard 
work, respect and love for teachers and elders, and self-esteem. And along the 
way, avoid drugs and all their pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point in your life, someone's going to walk up to you and offer you 
an illegal drug," Lasorda told the students. "And if you are stupid enough to 
take it, you're going to make the dumbest mistake of your life. It's going to 
ruin your life, and I hope and pray none of you will allow it to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda, who has toured the country as a motivational speaker for years, said 
he imparts the same message wherever he goes, whether speaking to college 
graduates, cadets at the nation's military academies or school children. He 
implored the students to set goals, work hard and take advantage of their 
education.  
</P>
<P>
 "One day when you're 30 or 35 years old, you're going to get up in the morning 
and look at yourself in the mirror," Lasorda said. "If you can look in that 
mirror and you can honestly say, 'I did everything to the best of my ability, 
every single day,' you will be a very happy person and in most cases, a very 
successful person." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda, who spoke for free, was invited by eighth-grader David Stockhamer, 
whose father, Barry Stockhamer, is vice president of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other events in the week's anti-drug campaign at Glendale schools included the 
signing of "drug-free contracts" by students at Toll Middle School, a visit to 
Glenoaks Elementary School by a U. S. Customs agent and an anti-drug essay 
contest at Cerritos Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 After his pep talk, Lasorda drew students' names out of a basket and gave away 
Dodger merchandise as prizes, including autographed baseballs and a jersey worn 
by catcher Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty cool," said Matt DuPont, an eighth-grader who won a ball signed 
by shortstop Raul Mondesi. "But it was kind of embarrassing to go up there in 
front of all those people." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Lasorda's appearance ended, the 3 p.m. bell rang for classes to 
be dismissed, and some students rushed into the parking lot to see if they 
could catch a glimpse of the Dodgers' manager as he left the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids really listened to what he had to say," said Lois Neil, Rosemont's 
principal. "Tommy's in great demand as a motivational speaker, and we were very 
lucky to have him." STEVE RYFLE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; MOTORCYCLIST DIES AFTER HITTING CAR

<P>
 A Mission Viejo motorcyclist died this week after he lost control at high 
speed and crashed into an oncoming van on Marguerite Parkway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Webster, 46, was pronounced dead at Mission Hospital Medical Center on 
Wednesday after the 7:47 p.m. crash, which also injured the driver of the van, 
said Lt. Rex Hatch of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster was weaving in and out of traffic at a "high rate of speed" on the 
northbound side of Marguerite Parkway when his motorcycle clipped a car going 
in the same direction, Hatch said. The impact sent Webster airborne over the 
median and into a southbound van near the intersection of Estanciero Drive, 
Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The van careened across the divider into oncoming lanes, but struck no cars 
before coming to rest on a slope, Hatch said. Driver Janet Shannon, 40, of 
Mission Viejo was treated for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred near the spot where a carload of high school students 
crashed two weeks ago after the driver lost control as the vehicle sped in and 
out of traffic. Hatch said people drive too fast on that stretch, which is 
posted at 45 m.p.h. He did not know how fast Webster was going.KEN ELLINGWOOD

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; HEARING IS SCHEDULED FOR ARSON SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One-time Laguna Beach arson suspect Jose Soto Martinez, who still faces 
charges that he started three small fires in Fullerton, was in court again 
Thursday, where a judge set his pretrial hearing for Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the district attorney's office withdrew a charge that 
Martinez, 26, set last year's Laguna Beach firestorm. Days after filing that 
charge, prosecutors learned that Martinez's confession was bogus and that he 
had been in a Mexican jail when the fire began. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Fell said Thursday that, although the Fullerton 
fires are small compared to the Laguna Beach blaze, the case remains a priority 
to his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still feel this is an important case and that's evidenced by the fact that 
he is being held without bail," Fell said. "Fire has a mind of its own. You can 
start a small fire and someone might stomp it out. But that same fire can wipe 
out hundreds of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's lawyer, Frank Ospino, called his client "unreliable" and said there 
is no proof that he started any of the fires in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "The statements he's made about these fires are as unreliable as the ones 
concerning the Laguna Beach fire," Ospino said. "And that, we feel, is the crux 
of this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Ospino said the total damage caused by the fires amounted to less than $1,000, 
and because of that, his client should be entitled to go free on bail.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons we haven't tried to get bail set is the unfortunate 
financial situation of his family," Ospino said. "They wouldn't be able to post 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is being held at the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's true name is Jaime Saille Higuera. If convicted of the three arson 
charges against him, he would face a maximum prison term of 19 years, 8 months, 
Fell said.GREG HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CANDIDATES CRITICIZE TIE-BREAKER 
</P>

<P>
 A number of school board candidates are criticizing a new policy in several 
school districts that would settle an election tie by drawing lots instead of 
holding a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees in Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District and Magnolia School 
District in Anaheim this week approved the policy, citing the extra cost of 
holding a runoff election in the event that two candidates capture the same 
number of votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other districts, including Saddleback Valley Unified, Westminster and 
Ocean View school districts, also have the same policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "To think of spending $25,000 to hold a special election, we could use that 
money to equip a lot of computers" with improved software, said Craig Olson, a 
trustee in the Placentia-Yorba Linda district. 
</P>
<P>
 But Placentia-Yorba Linda trustee William Kielty, who is running for 
reelection and who voted against the policy, said the cost of holding a runoff 
is not a lot of money to determine who the voters want on the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't consider it for any other level of government," Kielty said. Drawing 
lots "is not part of the democratic process." 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela S. Rush, a candidate for the Saddleback Valley Unified Board of 
Trustees, said drawing lots to break a tie invalidates the entire election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might as well not have an election," Rush said. "The candidates might just 
as well put their names in a hat now." 
</P>
<P>
 As far back as 1963, school board elections resulting in a tie were decided by 
drawing lots, said Barry Green, a lawyer with a Pasadena law firm that 
represents school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, state law was changed to allow school districts to hold runoff 
elections when two or more candidates received the same number of votes, 
district administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ties in school board elections are rare. Bev Warner, a spokeswoman for the 
Orange County registrar of voters office said she could not remember a tie 
since she started working at the office in 1988. But the state requires 
districts to adopt a policy to decide ties before an election is held. 
</P>
<P>
 However, several districts in the county, including Tustin Unified and Garden 
Grove Unified, do not have a policy in place, which Green and other school 
officials say could result in legal action if there is a tie. DANIELLE A.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; SCHOOL, CITY SETTLE MARQUEE DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calabasas High School has won its battle with the city over the school's 
refusal to obtain a permit for a marquee that was installed in front of the 
school last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has agreed not to challenge Las Virgenes Unified School District's 
contention that, by law, educational programs are exempt from city ordinances, 
city and school officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly glad that it was resolved," said Donald Zimring, the district's 
assistant superintendent of business. "We (usually) have excellent relations 
between our staff and the city, and unfortunately, I think this evolved into 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue arose after the Calabasas Planning Commission, some residents and 
members of the City Council expressed concerns about the brightness of the 
marquee, which replaced an old, unlighted version, said Toby Keeler, a member 
of the Planning Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 "When they first lit the thing, it was like the sun coming up over the 
school," said Keeler. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeler said he personally believes that the brightly lighted sign went against 
the spirit of the Mulholland Highway Scenic Corridor, one of four such 
corridors set up in the city to preserve the area's scenic beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimring said the district has never received any complaints. In fact, he said, 
many Calabasas residents approved of the new marquee. He said the old one, 
installed when the school was built in 1976, was farther back from the road 
than the new sign, was not lighted and could not be seen from the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas City Manager Charles Cate tried to resolve the issue informally with 
the district, according to Calabasas Mayor Karyn Foley. The district, she said, 
agreed to reduce the marquee's wattage and hours of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the issue arose again later, according to Keeler, after city 
officials visited the area and discovered that the school, while adding spaces 
to the student parking lot, had trimmed an oak tree without getting a city 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "People said to them, 'Hey, what's going on here?' " said Keeler. "I mean, we 
have one of the strictest oak tree ordinances in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were wrong and we admit it," Zimring said. "An employee trimmed an oak 
tree without realizing that we needed a permit." 
</P>
<P>
 The city and the school district became involved in a heated debate over the 
matter, exchanging angry words and letters, according to city officials.  
</P>
<P>
 Keeler and the others say they hope that the matter has been resolved and that 
there will be no hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is just something that was blown out of proportion," Keeler 
said. FRANK MANNINGCALABASAS HIGH SCHO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; ARCHBISHOP TO BLESS NEW CHURCH IN IRVINE

<P>
 A controversial Greek Orthodox church, deemed an eyesore by some residents 
when it was built more than two years ago, will be officially blessed Sunday by 
the denomination's leader in the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 Archbishop Iakovos arrives in Orange County today for a weekend of activities 
highlighted by the consecration of St. Paul's Greek Orthodox Church on Alton 
Parkway in Irvine at 9:30 a.m. Bishop Anthony, bishop of the western United 
States, also will attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "To come this far, the feeling is just awesome," said the Rev. Father George 
Stephanides, the church's priest, "especially considering what we've been 
through in the last few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Protests from the community dogged the church even before it was built. In 
1991, residents of the Bloomdale cul-de-sac protested construction of the 
$6-million edifice, saying the Byzantine-style structure was out of place amid 
their homes. They also contended the 70-foot copper dome obscured their view of 
the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the controversy, we gave in 10 feet," Stephanides said. 
</P>
<P>
 The church opened its doors to parishioners in May, 1992, but the consecration 
was delayed until the interior could be completed.THAO HUA

 A heroic bystander got into the getaway car of three armed men and drove it 
away as the men were busy robbing a supermarket Thursday morning, Glendale 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three suspects, who went into the Smart & Final market at 210 N. Verdugo 
Road about 11:45 a.m., took off running when they saw that the vehicle was 
gone, but still managed to escape in a backup car driven by a fourth suspect, 
according to a police report. 
</P>
<P>
 The bystander -- whose name, age and gender were withheld by police -- saw the 
three pull up in front of the market, get out of the car and don ski masks 
while entering the building and decided to take action. The bystander drove the 
car away and called police from a public phone, police spokesman Rod Brooks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This citizen took a major chance. We don't advise people to get involved in 
crimes in progress as this person did. It's very dangerous. Thankfully, this 
individual was not harmed," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police recovered the suspects' car, but Brooks would not comment on whether 
the owner of the vehicle had been identified or whether the car may have been 
stolen. STEVE RYFLE

LOCAL ELECTIONS / SUPERVISOR; MOULTON PATTERSON UNVEILS REFORM PLAN; SHE 
PROPOSES TO CUT SUPERVISORS' BUDGETS AND ELIMINATE THEIR COUNTY-PROVIDED CARS. 
SUPERVISOR ROGER R. STANTON, A JIM SILVA SUPPORTER, CALLS PROPOSAL 
'TRANSPARENT.'

<P>
 Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson, who is in a tight race for the 
2nd District supervisorial seat, on Thursday announced a plan aimed at 
reforming and improving county government. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference outside the Hall of Administration, Moulton Patterson 
said that if elected she would slash the supervisors' budgets by 15%, eliminate 
their county-provided cars, call for performance audits of every department and 
suggest conducting at least one board meeting a month at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, who has endorsed Moulton Patterson's opponent, 
Jim Silva, said that her plan is a "transparent attempt to attract . . . 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "If she sincerely wanted to bring suggestions to the county board, 
she has had the opportunity to do so over a period of many years through public 
hearings and in direct communication with each member of the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva's campaign consultant, Dave Gilliard, said that Moulton Patterson's plan 
"is nothing but an attempt to turn a tax-and-spend liberal into a conservative 
in the eyes of the voters with two weeks to go in the election." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, a Huntington Beach councilman, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other proposals in Moulton Patterson's plan: Hire an independent 
auditor, who would get a portion of the money saved by weeding out waste in 
county government, and lobby Sacramento for more control over discretionary 
funds that are routinely restricted for specific uses. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments, Moulton Patterson and Silva filed final campaign 
finance disclosure forms showing that she has raised a total of $211,829 and he 
has raised $250,535.

 A car that was abandoned on the train tracks was struck and destroyed by a 
Metrolink train Thursday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The train, traveling about 65 m.p.h., hit the car at 6 p.m. at the Coldwater 
Canyon Avenue crossing near Raymer Street and pushed it for about a quarter of 
a mile, Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The engineer saw the car on the center of the tracks and blew his horn but it 
wouldn't move," he said.

 The train, bound for Moorpark from Union Station, was delayed for half an 
hour. No one was injured, Hidalgo said.

ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; VICA OVERWHELMINGLY VOTES AGAINST MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., considered the area's preeminent 
business group, overwhelmingly voted Thursday to oppose Proposition 187, the 
state ballot measure aimed at denying key benefits and services to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote "goes against the popular conception of the Valley as still 
lily-white, conservative and not open to thinking through problems of this 
sort," said attorney Fred Gaines, a VICA board member and leader of the group 
pushing for the opposition vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 31-2 with five abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
 David Sandel, president of Devon Industries, a VICA board member and an 
Israeli immigrant to the United States 30 years ago, said he voted to oppose 
Proposition 187 because he feared that it would encourage the victimization of 
Latino citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would result in picking on people just because of the color of 
their skin or their accent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar concerns were related to him by his company's Latino employees, who 
make up about 70% of the 400-person work force, said Sandel, who added that his 
employees are all in the United States legally. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of talk in the company about stopping this measure," said 
Sandel, who added that he also opposed the 1986 federal law that requires 
employers to hire only legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem should be stopped at the border," he said. "I don't want to be 
put in the position of being a policeman. It's not productive of good relations 
with employees." 
</P>
<P>
 David Fleming, former VICA chairman and chairman of the group's government 
affairs panel, said, however, that he thought that the views of VICA's general 
membership would belie the lopsided results of Thursday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a member here for 30 years and I've never seen us so badly split," 
said Fleming, who favored VICA taking no position on the controversial measure 
and thus following the lead of such groups as the California Business 
Roundtable and the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "The folks who want it are not saying much and the opponents are more vocal," 
said Fleming, an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming said he wanted the organization to remain on the sidelines to protect 
its institutional health. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a no-win situation -- we'll tick off some members by opposing it and 
really tick off others by supporting it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fleming was for neutrality and said he believed that Proposition 187

needed to get the federal government's attention.

 "It may be that it will take a primal scream like this to get some help from 
Washington, D.C.," Fleming said.

 "If it gets beat, they'll say the bigots in California were defeated and let's 
forget about the problem," he said.

BABY KILLED AS IMPACT EJECTS HER IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 4-month-old Rialto infant was thrown out of a car in an accident on the 
Golden State Freeway and killed, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvonne Villanueva died after her unsecured infant seat was ejected from a car 
that was rear-ended by a truck, spun out of control and smashed into the 
freeway guardrail, according to CHP Officer Wendy Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred after the driver of the car in which the child was a 
passenger tried to change lanes on the southbound freeway about 11 p.m. 
Wednesday, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvonne was strapped into an infant carrier but the it was not attached to the 
passenger seat, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car, Naomi Mendez, 20, of Rialto, and three other 
passengers, including another 4-month-old baby, were not seriously injured in 
the accident, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the truck, Jack Young, 32, of Norco, was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another truck driver who saw the accident stopped and gave the baby CPR," 
said Moore. "But she died later at the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither driver was cited, but the accident is under investigation, Moore said.

DIALOGUE WINNING AGAINST GANG BULLETS; PEACE: A TRUCE AMONG LATINO GANGS IN THE 
VALLEY MAY HAVE DRASTICALLY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF YOUNG MEN GUNNED DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They have spent their nights and weekends on darkened Valley streets, talking 
to warriors about peace. 
</P>
<P>
 They have stared down gun barrels and stood between angry combatants. 
</P>
<P>
 They have read Scriptures and fasted and prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly a year of struggling to keep the peace, organizers of a truce 
among Latino gangs in the San Fernando valley say their work has drastically 
reduced the number of young men gunned down in gang violence. Police report a 
drop of two thirds in all Valley gang homicides -- from 37 to 12 in a one-year 
period -- and the peacemakers say only one of those deaths involved a Latino 
gang member covered by their truce. 
</P>
<P>
 "As weary as you get physically, spiritually, inside of you, it's exciting," 
said William (Blinky) Rodriguez, a Sylmar businessman who helped craft the 
treaty. "It's the beginning of hope, of peace."  
</P>
<P>
 Gang members, treaty organizers, local politicians and other supporters will 
gather at the Church on the Way in Van Nuys Saturday to celebrate what they say 
is the unprecedented success of the peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Peace Summit" will include performances by rap artists, speeches by gang 
members and supporters of the treaty and the reading of a letter from South 
African President Nelson Mandela by renowned ethologist Jane Goodall, who will 
attend the event, Rodriguez said. Ethology is the study of animal behavior.  
</P>
<P>
 While there have been some incidents of violence, including the killing of a 
gang member participating in the truce, the number of gang-related homicides in 
the Valley has declined significantly, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised, but I don't take it for granted," Rodriguez said of the 
treaty's apparent success. "Every single day is like a diamond." 
</P>
<P>
 The truce began last Halloween, in part by order of the Mexican Mafia, a 
prison-based gang. 
</P>
<P>
 On that day, several hundred Latino gang members attended a meeting called by 
Donald Garcia and Rodriguez, both Christian lay ministers. Garcia is a former 
gang member who served a prison term for murder and Rodriguez's son was killed 
four years ago by gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then members of the seven-member peace treaty council and gang members 
have met every weekend at the Pacoima Recreation Center to hammer out 
resolutions to problems and to nurture a tenuous peace. Rodriguez, Donald 
Garcia, and others on the council open their meetings with Scriptures and 
prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Late at night the men are on call, responding to conflicts that could quickly 
lead to violence. On the streets they play the role of mediators, hearing both 
sides of a dispute, then helping forge a resolution that does not include 
bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is dangerous, they admit, and to do it successfully requires the 
respect of the gang members they work with, and divine help, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize when we hit those streets we're facing death," said Steve 
Martinez, 28, a member of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're out there and we give our lives to the Lord. . . . We're all 
Christians, and we give all the Glory to God in the name of Jesus. He's the 
only reason we've been able to do this for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, there were 37 gang-related homicides recorded in the 
Valley for the year ended in September, 1993. For the same period this year, 
there were 12. 
</P>
<P>
 But police note that the decline in gang-related homicides is not limited to 
the Valley. In all of Los Angeles, there were 276 gang-related homicides by the 
end of September, 1993. For the year ended last month, there were 182. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline in Valley gang-related homicides could be the result of several 
factors, including better crime analysis information and more officers on the 
street, as well as the treaty, said Lt. Fred Tuller, coordinator for the Valley 
of the police anti-gang unit called CRASH -- Community Resources Against Street 
Hoodlums. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are all factors," Tuller said. "We're talking about something that's 
not scientific. I will give Blinky Rodriguez credit. I think he has played a 
role and we welcome that." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the organizers of the truce is paid for the work, and this year 
Rodriguez has seen his share of "skeptics, criticism and people with polluted 
agendas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond the numbers, the impact of the truce can be seen in the lives of 
its participants, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months ago Alex Martinez, Steve's brother, was a gang member. "I started 
dealing drugs, I was smoking drugs, I was on a real low," Alex Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
 He became involved, first as a representative of his gang, attending weekend 
meetings. Later he left the gang and became a member of the council, one of the 
group who takes to the streets to head off bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still from the 'hood," Martinez said. "You never leave that, but I'm not 
a gang member. I couldn't do it no more."

RESIDENTS ASK EPA TO RESTORE GOLF COURSE; ENVIRONMENT: THOSE LIVING NEAR MCCOLL 
DUMP SITE WANT GUARANTEE THE FACILITY WILL BE RETURNED TO ITS ORIGINAL STATE. 
FEDERAL OFFICIALS ASSURE THEM IT WILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 About 60 residents living near the McColl dump site told representatives of 
the Environmental Protection Agency Thursday night that they want a written 
guarantee that a golf course on the site will be fully restored when the 
hazardous waste is cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're tied of living with that," said resident Mark S. Howells. "We want a 
golf course. The community is on the edge here." 
</P>
<P>
 EPA representatives agreed to draft a statement affirming that the golf course 
could be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's meeting was the first large public gathering held by the EPA to 
discuss the McColl cleanup in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally a pig farm, the 22-acre site was used as a dumping ground for 
petroleum waste products produced by oil companies making aviation fuel during 
World War II. All told, officials believe, the oil companies -- later 
determined to be Shell, Atlantic-Richfield, Texaco, Union and Phillips 
Petroleum -- buried about 12,000 cubic yards of the waste in 12 sumps at the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 A golf course was built there in 1960, followed by several hundred homes in 
the immediate vicinity in 1976. Two years later, the hazardous waste was 
rediscovered after lying dormant for several years, and disturbed residents and 
various concerned agencies began a tidal wave of lawsuits that have since kept 
the site tied up in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982 the federal government declared the McColl dump area a Superfund site 
eligible for a massive cleanup that the EPA estimates could cost as much as 
$120 million. The oil companies -- now united under the name of the McColl Site 
Group -- are under court order to pay for most of the cleanup, an order they 
are in the process of appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, they are engaged in an ongoing disagreement with the EPA over 
which method of cleanup would be the most effective and financially viable. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument is expected to be settled after a three-month demonstration 
project scheduled to begin in January, during which the oil companies will use 
at least two methods to cover the petroleum waste in three of the site's sumps. 
While some of the sumps will be filled with solid material, others simply will 
be capped. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials say they will decide which method to use based on the results of 
the three-month test. Once the appropriate method is determined, they say, the 
project can begin in late 1995. The complete cleanup, according to EPA 
officials, could take up to six years.

ELECTIONS / 43RD ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; GOP LEADER BOOSTS ROGAN'S TOTAL TO $377,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Armed with a new $58,000 contribution from a Republican Party leader, state 
Assemblyman James Rogan (R-Glendale) has taken a big lead in fund-raising over 
his Democratic foe as the pair enter the final leg of their hotly contested 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan's $58,000 donation from state Assemblyman Jim Brulte (R-San Bernadino), 
the Assembly Republican leader, was the standout contribution to Rogan during 
the last three weeks when, altogether, the assemblyman raised $117,710 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 His Democratic challenger, Adam Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, received 
only $28,520 during the same period, Oct. 1 through Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan, who gained the 43rd District Assembly seat during a May, 1994, special 
election to replace Pat Nolan after the veteran lawmaker was imprisoned on a 
political corruption charge, predicted, however, that Schiff will get some 
large, last-minute contributions from state Assembly Speaker Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's going to get his money in the last 10 days -- that's how the 
speaker works," Rogan said in an interview, referring to Brown's practice of 
channeling large sums of money to promising Democratic campaigns in the final 
days of an election. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions of $1,000 or more received after Oct. 22 are to be reported to 
state election authorities within 24 hours of their receipt. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest campaign finance statement did not reveal any further financial 
involvement by right-wing Christian groups in Rogan's campaign. The 
assemblyman's previous statement showed contributions of $25,000 each from 
Allied Business PAC, a group run by Christian businessmen, and from Bert 
Boeckmann, the owner of Galpin Ford, who has been involved in Christian 
fundamentalist causes and politics. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Rogan, a former Municipal Court judge, has espoused a 
strong, fundamentalist Christian agenda, including the teaching of creationism 
-- alongside evolution -- in the public schools and has enunciated a 
philosophical opposition to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbent's views and financial ties have prompted Schiff to brand Rogan 
as a tool of the radical right. Rogan has complained, in reply, that Schiff has 
waged a thinly veiled campaign of religious bigotry against him because of his 
views. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Rogan's biggest contributors during the last three weeks have come 
banking, insurance and business groups. Their contributions brought his total 
amount of contributions for the entire campaign, starting Jan. 1, to $377,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiff reported a total of $190,000 in contributions for the same period, 
beginning Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Schiff's largest contributions came from unions and law enforcement 
organizations. The California Teachers Assn. and the California State Council 
of Service Employees, for example, each gave Schiff $5,000 during the most 
recent financial reporting, while the Police Officers Research Assn. of 
California, the Los Angeles Police Protective League and the Los Angeles County 
Professional Peace Officers Assn. gave him $1,000 each.

VAN, VEHICLE COLLISION INJURES MOM, 3 CHILDREN

 Three children and their mother were in critical condition Thursday night 
after their van collided with another car at Warner Avenue and Springdale 
Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Jeff Cope said witnesses told police that Laurie K. Reed, 27, of 
Huntington Beach ran a red light and her Volkswagen van broadsided the other 
car about 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed was in critical condition with head and internal injuries after being 
taken by helicopter to UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Her three children, who were not wearing seat belts, also were critically 
injured, Cope said. Cathy, 9, Jessie, 5, and Laurie, 5, all suffered severe 
head injuries, he said. They also were taken to UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The other driver, Ryan Benz of Huntington Beach, was in serious condition at 
Huntington Beach Medical Center.  
</P>
<P>
 No citations were issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Cope said the investigation was continuing.

TEEN-AGE SUSPECT ARRESTED IN OVERNIGHT CRIME SPREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old boy who police said went on an overnight robbery spree was 
arrested Thursday morning after a victim gave authorities a description of his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach boy, who was not identified because of his age, allegedly 
robbed two people of their wallets -- claiming to have a gun -- but failed in 
five other attempts during a seven-hour period ending with his arrest about 
8:30 a.m, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we put a stop to a spree," Sgt. Darrell Klopp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged series of crimes began when a man was robbed of $240 in a 
supermarket parking lot shortly after 2 a.m. The bandit simulated having a gun 
sticking from a sweat-shirt pocket, police said. The bandit fled. Two attempted 
robberies by someone using a similar method and matching the suspect's 
description were reported within a one-mile area in the next hour, Lt. Luis 
Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The same suspect is believed responsible for crimes at two locations several 
hours later. In one instance, a would-be thief failed to wrest a purse from a 
woman at an automated teller machine and unsuccessfully demanded money from two 
other people before a man gave up his wallet about 8:20 a.m. in a shopping 
center on Algonquin Street, Ochoa said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested the teen-ager minutes later when an officer spotted a car 
matching a description given by a victim. Two victims brought to the scene 
identified him, Ochoa said. Police did not find a gun, he said.

GUNMAN HOLDS UP PATRONS, RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man with a sawed-off shotgun ordered customers at Ragamuffin's Restaurant 
onto the floor Thursday and robbed them. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after 6 p.m., a bearded man wearing sunglasses walked into the restaurant 
in the 1500 block of N. El Camino Real. The man took money from the cash 
register and the customers, according to Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Rex Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did his business and left," said Al Curtis, a customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police the man fled in a white or tan 1980s Camaro, with no 
license plates and primer white doors. He was described as Latino, 28 to 30 
years old, 175 pounds and wearing a knit cap.

GLITCHES SNARL COURT CLERK'S OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. District Court clerk's office struggled with one shutdown after 
another Thursday with a small flood in a lawsuit storage room and computer 
malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The mishaps kept some members of the public from viewing court records, but 
court officials said the clerk's office should be back in full operation by 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The small flood occurred Thursday afternoon, a spokesman said, when 
maintenance workers cleaned the building's air conditioners. Condensation from 
the machines pooled in the ceiling over the storage room and began dripping 
down, creating a huge puddle on the floor by the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Clerks were ordered to stay out of the area because of worries that someone 
would slip, said Frank Goodroe, clerk of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer system for civil filings, he said, had gone on the blink earlier 
in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems show how much the district needs a new federal court building, 
Goodroe said. The court now operates out of a temporary space in a modular 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not exactly living in a mobile home," he said. "But it's not much 
superior to a mobile home."

COURT UPHOLDS $1.65-MILLION AWARD TO INJURED DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a $1.65-million verdict to a former 
Westminster woman who contended that defects in her 1982 Chevrolet Camaro 
contributed to serious injuries she suffered in a 1984 collision, her attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which focused on the state's consumer expectation test, comes 
almost 11 years after Terri F. Soule's left ankle was crushed in a Westminster 
traffic accident, forcing her to leave a full-time job as a bookkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry Soule has waited so long and is finally going to be able to care for 
herself," said her attorney, Frank P. Barbaro. With interest on the original 
award, she will receive close to $2.4 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been living in board and care homes and now her life will change 
dramatically," Barbaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury in 1990 decided in favor of Soule, who 
was 49 at the time, in her lawsuit against General Motors Corp. Her attorney 
had argued that during the collision with another car, welding weaknesses in 
her Camaro allowed the left-front tire to push up the floorboard, causing her 
injuries. Barbaro had also contended that the car did not "crush" properly on 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for General Motors could not be reached for comment late Thursday. 
The company disputed the defects during the trial and argued that Soule was not 
wearing a seat belt at the time of the collision.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / PLACENTIA; FINDING BENEFITS AND LIABILITIES IN CITY COUNCIL 
RACE; THE TWO INCUMBENTS SAY THEY'VE GOT THE EXPERIENCE TO GET THE JOB DONE, 
BUT THEIR FIVE CHALLENGERS ARE DEMANDING MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND FEWER PERKS.

 The City Council election has shaped up as a challenge of old and new 
political values, with five challengers calling for more accountability and two 
incumbents relying on their council experience to keep them in office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Council critics, including several who are on the ballot, have hammered the 
current council for increasing the utility tax from 3% to 4%, lax reporting of 
city-reimbursed expenses, taking advantage of city benefits and failing to 
respond to inquiries from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members generally defend their expense reporting, benefit package and 
the utility tax, which was increased 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Maria Moreno, whose term is not up, has requested a review of the 
council's retirement benefits with an eye toward discontinuing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Kay, a computer consultant and activist who spends nearly as much time 
at the microphone at brief City Council meetings as any single council member, 
wants term limits for elected officials and a moratorium on development. 
</P>
<P>
 The city needs to re-examine its direction after 10 years of rapid 
development, be more responsive to residents and use the referendum process to 
give residents a say in what is built, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of these developers coming in here, making their money and then 
leaving," he said, adding the city should concentrate on luring buyers for 
empty homes in the city before any new housing is built. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay, 52, has often complained that residents who address the council at 
meetings never get answers, and pledged to respond to citizen inquiries and 
complaints if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenger Dale Goodman, 52, wants access for the disabled -- to public and 
private places. She uses a wheelchair and is a retired health-care 
administrator who has served on the city's Advisory Committee on the Disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 The council should push merchants to make their businesses accessible to the 
disabled to "start catering to a handicapped population that has a lot of 
disposable income" although it is often perceived as less affluent, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She opposes term limits but wants to eliminate benefits like city-supplied 
cars for department heads and retirement and family health-care benefits for 
council members who have served five years and reached the age of 55. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode, 56, defends the benefits, saying city officials 
don't get car allowances and their stipend is meager at $150 a month for 
serving on the council and $60 a month for sitting on the Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckenrode, who owns a pizza parlor and has served on the council for 12 years, 
has drawn fire for having a $1,823 physical examination at city expense in 
August, 1993 -- just after he turned 55. He said he will vote to keep the 
health benefits if the matter goes before the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that property tax transfers have depleted city coffers, Eckenrode said 
it "is going to take an experienced council to guide the city" through the 
coming tough financial times. 
</P>
<P>
 His highest priority is using housing assistance to encourage a stake in the 
community, he said. Continuing the redevelopment agency's first-time buyer and 
home rehabilitation assistance programs would serve that end, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With only 350 to 400 acres of undeveloped land left in the city, land use 
decisions must be made carefully by people with experience, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Carol Downey, a second-grade teacher, has been on the council for 
eight years. Like Eckenrode, she said the city is hamstrung by state and 
federal mandates on spending, so the city needs experienced council 
representatives to allocate the balance if its funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've suffered quite a loss to the state in the last three years. It will be 
quite a challenge to maintain the quality of services in the face of state 
budget cuts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also cited low-income housing programs and a city business retention 
program as keys to improving the city and building its tax base. 
</P>
<P>
 Political newcomer L. Ray Estes, 41, agrees that preserving the quality of 
services within a tight budget is the city's biggest ongoing challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The city can and should create programs for youth and foster private programs, 
he said, which would reduce gang and youth problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city can be supportive and if they have money they can set aside for 
that. Right now that's pretty hard. We have to do it without shortchanging the 
police and fire departments," he said. "But if we don't do something for youth 
now, they will be the problems for those departments later." 
</P>
<P>
 Estes has worked with the Boys and Girls Club, the Casa Placentia youth 
program and is a volunteer in a local homeless assistance program. He is a 
shipping manager for an Anaheim plastics company. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Chamberlain, 32, the youngest candidate, is a risk manager for a Long 
Beach-based company that builds and maintains petrochemical refineries. 
</P>
<P>
 His platform is a "three-point plan for better government," which includes 
restructuring city management and budgeting processes. He also favors allowing 
lower level managers more discretion in decision-making and increasing 
community outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Kay, he pledged to be more responsive to the electorate if elected. He 
said he would hold monthly meetings with residents to hear their views and 
explain upcoming council issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamberlain said he wants city employees to compete with their colleagues in 
efficiency and cost-savings programs. He would reward the most efficient 
departments with additional money to spend on programs. 
</P>
<P>
 He favors term limits, stripping council members of city medical and 
retirement benefits, planning based on 10-year budget projections and relying 
more on community-based committees. 
</P>
<P>
 James K. Itow, 49, is a Orange County Superior Court manager in charge of 
equipment maintenance. He said that 10 years in the military and 20 with the 
court system have readied him to cut through bureaucratic red tape and he would 
bring a fresh perspective to the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The council should revise city codes to be less restrictive to business, such 
as ending a ban on drive-through restaurants, Itow said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council can make it easier for businesses to open and make it . . . on 
their own," he said. "They're given certain parameters to open a business, and 
by the time it's ready to go, (city officials) change the rules again." 
</P>
<P>
 Itow said his pet project would be filling the gap left when the dial-a-ride 
program for seniors folded, possibly by purchasing a city van for senior and 
youth programs. He also wants the city to work with the school district to 
maintain play areas for children.

MAN CONVICTED OF KILLING EX-GIRLFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury convicted a Brea man Thursday of 
first-degree murder for killing a former girlfriend who had told police he was 
involved in criminal activities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Claude, 22, who was linked to the killing in part by DNA evidence, 
faces up to life in prison when he is sentenced Nov. 23, said Deputy Dist. 
Atty.Patrick K. Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Elsayed, 19, also of Brea, was shot to death in June, 1992, and found 
slumped over the steering wheel of a friend's car. The vehicle was parked at 
Savi Ranch Industrial Park near Auto Plaza Circle in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said that Claude was involved in auto thefts before the 
killing. Evidence presented at the trial indicated Claude might have killed his 
former girlfriend in part because she gave authorities information about Claude 
when she was detained during an investigation, Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 DNA testing showed Claude and Elsayed were sexually intimate shortly before 
the killing, evidence that helped link him to the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Claude's defense attorney could not be reached for comment late Thursday.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN ACQUITTED IN ROBBERIES OF 2 BANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles federal jury has acquitted a Santa Clarita man of charges that 
he robbed a pair of banks of more than $200,000 by taking two bank employees 
and their families hostage and forcing the women to open their banks' vaults, a 
prosecutor said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Yepes, 25, was found not guilty Wednesday in U.S. District Court of 
charges stemming from the June 11, 1993, robbery of TransWorld Bank in Canyon 
Country and the Sept. 17, 1993, theft of a Coast Federal branch in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Gerald Scotti, who defended Yepes, told jurors his client was with 
friends during both of the robberies and that the real thieves implicated Yepes 
after he declined their invitation to participate in the holdups. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Yepes had faced a maximum sentence of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Scotti described the verdict as "just," but said when he heard it, Yepes was 
"flabbergasted and so was his family." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always a doubt the system will work right but in this case it did," 
Scotti said. "Here is a guy who was in prison for nearly a year for something 
he didn't do." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had alleged that Yepes, along with several accomplices, held 
TransWorld officer Toula Demosthenous and eight others hostage in her own 
Canyon Country home and Coast Federal officer Terry Duranso and four others 
captive in Duranso's Canoga Park home. 
</P>
<P>
 Yepes was also accused of guarding the women overnight with some of his 
accomplices and then accompanying them to their banks the next morning to force 
the women to open the vaults and automatic teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated $214,000 was stolen in the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. David R. Fields, who prosecuted the case, declined to 
comment on the verdict Thursday, but Demosthenous said she was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, everybody is very, very upset," Demosthenous said in an 
interview. "When seven people point at (Yepes) and say, 'It's him'. . . . It's 
like no justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Yepes, who had pleaded not guilty to the charges, was the first of five 
suspects charged in the robberies to stand trial. Two others have pleaded 
guilty and two remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Chad Pelch, 24, was sentenced to 10 years in prison after he 
pleaded guilty to robbery and kidnaping charges stemming from the TransWorld 
heist in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Patrick Towers of Saugus, who was scheduled to testify against Yepes, 
pleaded guilty in December to his involvement and was sentenced to 15 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Pelch's brother, Brett, 26, who is charged in both robberies, and Donald 
Sallee, 26, who is charged with participating in the Coast Federal robbery, 
have not been caught.

A BREAK IN THE ACTION; AUDIENCES GO WITHOUT GORE FOR 'TURN OFF VIOLENCE DAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In honor of Turn Off the Violence Day, Derek Brown decided against 
decapitating one opponent. He declined to incinerate another and went out of 
his way not to plunge a third to his death. 
</P>
<P>
 He punched and kicked them into submission instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was playing "Mortal Kombat II," the infamous martial-arts video game, at 
a Santa Clarita arcade when he learned that Thursday was Turn Off the Violence 
Day, as proclaimed by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is cleaner, I guess. It's not as violent," said Brown, 24, who lives in 
Valencia. "Well, at least it's not so graphic." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not exactly what the day's sponsors -- the city's Anti-Gang Task Force 
-- had in mind. Through newspaper advertisements and 30,000 flyers distributed 
on school campuses and at other locations, the task force asked citizens to 
eschew violent entertainments for one full day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence is too often used by residents for entertainment, settling arguments 
or blowing off emotional steam," said Capt. Mike Quinn of the Santa Clarita 
Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn is a member of the volunteer task force, which was created by the city 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to make people aware of nonviolent ways to deal with anger and 
conflict. We want to help our residents realize that entertainment creates a 
climate that fosters the acceptability of violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Christenson, in line at Plaza 3 Cinemas in Santa Clarita for an afternoon 
showing of the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie "True Lies," was not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here to see Arnold blow things up and see Jamie Lee Curtis, period," 
said Christenson, 24. "I'm not leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Corwin, in line to see "The River Wild" at Edwards Cinemas in Valencia, 
was at least sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never heard of (the proclamation)," said Corwin, 36, who lives in 
Valencia. "Does this movie count as violent?" 
</P>
<P>
 Corwin said she would try, as the task force requested, to avoid violent 
television programs that evening. That meant no "Cops," of course, and some of 
the night's cable movies, including "The Last Action Hero" -- more Arnold -- 
and the martial-arts "Best of the Best II," were also off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Even "Mystery!" on public television was suspect, considering that its plot 
featured the discovery of a corpse in a hotel basement locker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'll have to just read a book," said Corwin, with resignation. "It'll 
have to be a pretty dull book." 
</P>
<P>
 At local school campuses, the proclamation received more heartfelt support. 
Hundreds of high school and junior high students signed Turn Off the Violence 
Day banners that decorated their campuses. Organizers plan to present them next 
week to Southern California television stations to encourage nonviolent fare. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Gallo, 26, of Canyon Country, also thought the "Day" was a good idea. 
"I'll go with it. It's not a lot to ask," he said as he returned a rented copy 
of "Jurassic Park" to a video store. 
</P>
<P>
 "All one day does is, it puts the idea in your head for a week or so. It makes 
you think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 That, according to supporters, was the whole idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Brown, at the controls of "Mortal Kombat," was having second thoughts. He 
had been planning to see the new movie "Pulp Fiction," which has garnered rave 
reviews despite its violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in here killing time before going to the movie, but you're making me 
feel bad," he said. "I don't know, now."

THE SCENE / ORANGE COUNTY: THE FIRST BIG GIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rock star mythology dictates that you only get into it for The Music. 
</P>
<P>
 But if that were true, bands wouldn't form until everyone mastered their 
instrument. As things go, technical skill frequently ranks behind stage 
presence, attitude and access to your parents' garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a part in a band, especially in high school, allows you to carve an 
identity outside the traditional options. So you're not an athlete or a brain? 
Then try rock star on for size. 
</P>
<P>
 It's tough to believe that Dan Hammond, 18, was in football when he started El 
Modena High in Orange four years ago. His Maynard G. Crebs chin fluff, bleached 
hair and punk-dude demeanor class him more in the weird-kid category than with 
the jocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan picked up a guitar in his freshman year. Then the bass player in his 
friend's band quit. So, as the story goes with most bass players, Hammond 
dropped the six strings for four. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping the rhythm appealed to him more anyway, he now realizes: "I have more 
fun with a bass than a guitar." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Dan has even picked up on -- although he admits to it hesitantly -- 
the attraction some fans have to bassists. His girlfriend, a senior at Mater 
Dei, did happen to mention it. 
</P>
<P>
 (And I always hoped it was a coincidence that in high school I kept falling 
for guys who played bass.) 
</P>
<P>
 Dan vehemently denies that being in a band got him the babe. But he adds: "I 
met her when I was in this band, Janitor, last year. She was going out with the 
guitar player." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Janitor was Dan's third band. He's also been in Crack Babies and Lumberjack. 
On Saturday, his current band, Phabio, performed on the high school stage at 
the Independent's Day '94 festival at Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage, located near the entrance, stood far, far away from the four main 
stages featuring 60 local alternative music acts. It was even a walk from the 
other nearest stage showcasing ska bands. But promoters intended to give bands 
with high school members a spotlight other than the coffeehouse and house party 
circuit they're generally limited to. 
</P>
<P>
 The gig catapulted Dan and his band/classmates, Justin Poysner and Garrett 
Driscoll, into campus celebrities. (Their fourth member, Chris Wellman, 19, is 
a freshman at Rancho Santiago College.) Some friends printed stickers. A couple 
of dozen paid the $15 ticket price into the music festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, Phabio, a punk band that interweaves ska and metal influences, had 
limited its appearances to one party a month. Those shows were executed as hard 
and fast as the music, what with cops minutes away and ready to bust the fun. 
Of course, they'd only been together four months, so that only added up to four 
real gigs. 
</P>
<P>
 At Independent's Day, "Why are you in a band?" became the requisite question 
to the teen musicians. Would anyone have the insight -- heck, the bravery -- to 
agree with my premise that their passion includes hopes of stardom? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I love the music," each drummer, each guitarist and each bassist 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't that enough?" asked Trust 31's drummer John Kirby, an Esperanza High 
senior. The punk band's name refers to the "31 guys under Nixon who were 
arrested during Watergate," says the 17-year-old from Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have fun and party hearty," Donald Terrell, another Esperanza senior, gives 
as his reason. The guitarist for Clean X, Terrell says he wouldn't want to see 
his name in lights. Then he admits: "If I can make this a full-time career, 
sure I'd do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Unsigned to any label, Clean X already has distributed 500 of its homemade 
tapes and dozens of baseball caps with its name embroidered on the front.  
</P>
<P>
 Phabio drummer Justin takes a simpler stand: "I'm in a band. That's all. I 
just play music." The introspective 17-year-old took up an instrument when 
Phabio started. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to play drums," says Justin, leaving the "why" part 
unanswered. He says he's not a particularly good dancer, but sitting down he 
can keep the beat line. "I play good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's 2 1/2 hours after Phabio was scheduled to play, but they still haven't 
struck a note. In fact, all seven of the high school bands on the bill are no 
longer playing at the times scheduled. The concert promoters, Taurus 
Enterprises, have apparently forgotten about them. 
</P>
<P>
 At their small stage, there are no lights, no amplifiers, no sound boards, no 
microphones. The bands were told not to bring any equipment except for guitars, 
bass, sticks, cymbals and any special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the indignity deflates their enthusiasm. This wasn't the day 
of glamour these young musicians envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin assumes "The Thinker" pose. Chris goes off to the side to fiddle with 
his guitar. Dan joins his friends in kicking around a hacky sack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they slacked on us because we're from high school," says Garrett, 17, 
Phabio's lead guitarist. "But we should have gotten the same treatment as 
everyone else. I mean, I was a little bummed out when I saw the stage. I was 
expecting something a little bigger with lights. Now we're waiting and the 
crowd's all waiting for us." 
</P>
<P>
 As with the others, Garrett's nervousness has been somewhat diffused by the 
wait. Not that he was really that nervous about playing at Irvine Meadows. "I 
was too excited to be nervous," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 As the veteran musician of the group with six years of practice, Garrett is 
also the resident long-haired rocker with a propensity for cranking out 
metal-flavored progressions on his shiny black guitar. The riffs scream rock 
god. Phabio was his first whack at punk, a genre he hasn't much cared for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer something that takes more skill. I like more melodic playing," he 
says. "The whole thing about punk is it's so simple. So when I do more 
complicated riffs in our songs, I think it gives it a nice sound." The wah-wah 
pedal isn't bad either. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a couple of roadie types from the promotion team scramble to set up 
the stage. Equipment and cords are swiped from the main stages. The activity 
attracts fans entering the park at the nearby gate, and a few settle on the 
surrounding lawn along with Phabio's dedicated friends. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2:55 p.m. the music kicks off. Dan starts making up the words as he goes 
along. Garrett starts swinging his hair. Thirty seconds into the song, the 
moshing begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a half dozen in the audience are over age 25. There's me, four parents, 
and Vince Galante, a promoter who's focusing his energy on all-ages concerts 
featuring all-ages bands. He talks to Phabio after it finishes the set about 
booking a show. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like about this age is they're so ready to go," Galante says. "The 
older bands -- even local ones still unsigned -- are set in their ways and 
think they've paid their dues and should be pampered. These kids -- this is 
where the raw energy and creativity is." 
</P>
<P>
 Post-performance moods are a mix of triumph, relief and desire to play again. 
The grief of a schedule gone awry and a stage that lacked a backstage are 
almost forgotten. It also seems to make these musicians more candid. Or have 
they undergone a transformation? 
</P>
<P>
 The attention is intoxicating, Dan has to admit. "You get a big rush playing 
in front of so many people. It doesn't compare to anything. I'll do this for 
the rest of my life. I can't not do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clean X's Donald echoed the exhilaration. "You get up on stage and jump up ad 
down and people think it's kind of cool. I'm a musician. But I love playing 
live more than sitting in a studio." Donald, who has a penchant for trashed-up 
Pete Townshend air kicks, doesn't seem like the kind who can just sit. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of days after the concert, Donald describes himself over the phone as 
"an entertainer." Celebrity status is still freshly sweet. He can almost taste 
a career in the biz. Lately, he says, "It trips me out when someone says 'Hey, 
you're in Clean X."' 
</P>
<P>
 But even if he never makes it to MTV, Donald says he'll "always be able to 
tell my kids I played Irvine Meadows." 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I don't have to tell them it was near the parking lot." 
</P>

QUOTE ME: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OC High asks: If you were the principal, what's the first thing you would 
change at your school? 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of detention, students should be punished with janitorial labor." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Hildebrandt, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, El Dorado 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd fix the bathrooms. They'd have soap; there would be two stalls in each 
bathroom with doors, toilet paper and toilets that flushed successfully." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrie Gipe, 15 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, Westminster 
</P>
<P>
 "I would try to gather funds to purchase a second set of books for all 
students so that we could eliminate the lockers." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrie Duffy, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "I would decrease the number of people. It's too crowded." 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Fais, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Capistrano Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "I would offer more activities and organizations so that everyone can 
participate. I think the system could give more chances to those out there who 
are willing to participate, but just don't know how to or just too shy." 
</P>
<P>
 Jung Kim, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Cypress  
</P>
<P>
 "I would make it a point to open all bathrooms -- yes, even some of the 
teachers' bathrooms -- at lunch. We students are forced to wait in lines for 10 
minutes, and, when you add that to time waiting in lunch lines, we have only a 
few hurried minutes to eat. At our school, only half the bathrooms are open, 
and lines always poke out the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Allison Kenne, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Loara 
</P>
<P>
 "I would purchase new books for the students and decrease class population to 
20 students or less." 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Weathers, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "I would change some of the strict policies, such as not being able to have a 
Walkman and not having senior privileges." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Vargas, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Valencia  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd make three-day weekends and shorter classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Joanna Morgan, 14 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd get rid of the dress code. It doesn't matter what people wear and what 
they don't wear. Baggy pants won't start a drive-by." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Bell, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Westminster 
</P>
<P>
 "Have more school-sponsored events that are off-campus. Also, I'd have more 
privileges for the seniors at the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Amanda Morris, 16 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd redecorate the classrooms so it doesn't look like we're in the '70s. And 
I'd introduce air conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
 Masumi Patel 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Cornelia Connelly 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have metal detectors as you walk in the school doors. That way I 
won't ever have to worry about people having weapons in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas Brightman, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Sonora 
</P>
<P>
 "I would make a stricter dress code that would outlaw wearing gang-related 
clothing to (help) make other students feel comfortable when they are at 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Tang, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
 "The dress code, because it is too harsh. We can't wear sport shirts or hats 
and have to tuck in our shirts. I 
</P>
<P>
 wouldn't enforce tucking in our shirts because sometimes we look funny 
</P>
<P>
 with our shirts 
</P>
<P>
 tucked in." 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Dang, 14 
</P>
<P>
 freshman, Saddleback 
</P>
<P>
 "I would end the teaching of such conventional subjects as math and science 
and instead place an emphasis on philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Gonsalves, 15 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, Kennedy 
</P>
<P>
 "I would put more effort into beautification of the grounds. I would put in 
more plants, flowers and trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Muno, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have an inter-district test for all the students that want to transfer 
from different cities into Brea." 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Lim, 15 
</P>
<P>
 freshman, Brea Olinda  
</P>
<P>
 "I would put line dividers in the cafeteria to help with the long confusing 
lines at lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Pai, 15 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, Troy 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have a rotating schedule so that I would have different classes at 
different times of the day. It gets boring, day after day, with the same 
schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Tricia Stough, 16  
</P>
<P>
 junior, Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
 "I would change the tardy policy. It would be more lenient to offenders. I 
would also change the policy for playing sports -- no more physicals." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Park, 15 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, Los Amigos 
</P>
<P>
 "I would make it so we had three-day weekends by extending class periods 
accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
 Samir Singh, 15 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, El Dorado 
</P>
<P>
 "I would attempt to abolish racism. Students should be more aware and know 
more about their peers' background. I'd like to stop racism on school grounds, 
maybe even in our neighborhoods. The end to racism (could) decrease violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Vu, 15 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, Los Amigos  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be more involved with the students." 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Davis, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 "Change the curriculum to have a wider variety of classes, like zoology, 
Portuguese, radio broadcasting, guitar playing, shop -- and PE with a 
trampoline." 
</P>
<P>
 Emily Correa 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Cornelia Connelly 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd make the passing period longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Kalani Sanders, 14 
</P>
<P>
 freshman, Kennedy 
</P>
<P>
 "Open campus at lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Oetting, 15 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, Canyon 
</P>
<P>
 "I would change the no-hat rule." 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Melville, 17 
</P>
<P>
 senior, San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd change the 'no eating on the grass' rule and make more food areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Rober, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Brea Olinda  
</P>
<P>
 "The cafeteria is inadequate; it will always be inadequate because it's just 
too small. We need to open our campus back up. This (closed campus) was a 
capricious act of power by the school board." 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Ingram 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "Reading period. I have nothing against reading, but I think those 15 minutes 
could be used better for study time. A lot of students work and could use that 
extra time for some last-minute studying." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonia Rodriguez, 17 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Western  
</P>
<P>
 "I would let freshman and sophomores leave the campus for lunch along with the 
upperclassman." 
</P>
<P>
 John Keeler, 14 
</P>
<P>
 freshman, Troy 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Devin McComber, 15 
</P>
<P>
 sophomore, Canyon  
</P>
<P>
 "I would change the color of the exterior to a more inviting and friendlier 
scheme. Maybe yellow and aqua." 
</P>
<P>
 John Avery, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
 "I would make a longer lunch period so the seniors would not have to risk 
getting a speeding ticket while racing back for fifth period." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Suola 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Foothill 
</P>
<P>
 "The dress code system, because I like to wear sports clothing, and most of 
that isn't gang-related. Do you see 'gang-bangers' wearing Mighty Ducks shirts? 
I also hate to tuck in my shirt because I was never raised to do that before." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Moreno, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Saddleback 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hire more counselors. There are too many people and too few 
counselors." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Llerena, 14 
</P>
<P>
 freshman, Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd try to make school more advanced. Better classroom equipment -- tables, 
chairs, computers and books. Even though the AP classes are college classes, 
they don't have all the equipment to perform like one." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadaf Ahmed, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Loara 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were principal, I would make it a goal for each student to meet five new 
people every day. I would also allow all students to go off campus at lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Ho, 16 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
 "I would put a rope line system in the cafeteria, because it's a mob scene in 
there. And I would add a period for homework." 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Patterson, 17 
</P>
<P>
 junior, Newport Harbor 
</P>
<P>
 "I would try to improve the relationship between students and teachers in 
terms of student activities because it's really hard to get cooperation from 
the teacher for student activities, since most of the teachers only stress 
academics." 
</P>
<P>
 James Balagot, 17

 senior, Irvine

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; EXPRESSION ON A STRING; HOBBY: TEENS ARE 
DISCOVERING THE PRIDE -- AND ECONOMY -- OF MAKING STYLISH AND UNIQUE JEWELRY 
WITH BEADS, AN ANCIENT CRAFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE PHAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Michelle Pham is a senior at Trabuco 
Hills High School in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beads are one of the oldest expressions of beauty in the world. Ancient tribes 
used them to adorn themselves, so did the flower children of the '60s. Teens 
today are discovering anew the beauty of beads and the personal expression 
putting them together and wearing them allows. 
</P>
<P>
 Beads come in a gazillion colors, shapes, sizes and patterns; they can cost 
pennies or be priceless artifacts. They come from all over the world and can be 
made from plastic, glass, wood, ceramic, porcelain, metal, rocks, quartz and 
almost anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the pleasure of creating, those who design their own jewelry 
save up to two-thirds of what they'd pay for similar pieces at the mall.  
</P>
<P>
 While browsing through a department store, Lake Forest hairstylist Susane 
Rodriguez saw a pair $40 earrings she liked. She returned the next day and 
sketched the earrings on a piece of paper. She took the drawing to a bead shop 
and duplicated the earrings for $6 worth of supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Making it yourself also means a custom piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills High School senior Brandi Harms likes to make jewelry to match 
her clothes. For the past three years, she has made her own necklaces, earrings 
and bracelets. She first got into beads when she worked as a summer camp 
counselor in Big Bear, where kids liked to put beads on safety pins to decorate 
their shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at home, she started tinkering with designs. Sometimes she gets her 
inspiration from pieces in department stores or at bead shops; others times 
it's strictly free-form. She has created about 50 pieces, most of which took 
from 30 minutes to an hour to string. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Trowbridge, 16, of Mission Viejo says she visits bead shops "a lot." 
Sometimes she has a design planned; sometimes she just selects the beads she 
likes. She sells her crafts to friends. Bracelets go for $5; anklets for $3. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beads are an expression of my soul. When I sell my (works), I am selling a 
part of myself," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Urone, 18, a June graduate of Trabuco Hills High and now a freshman at UC 
Santa Barbara, has been making jewelry for four years. Urone plans to sell her 
creations at a friend's Christmas boutique later this year. Making jewelry is 
"inexpensive, fun, and easy," Urone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Creations are restricted only by a person's inventiveness. Beads can be 
threaded, braided, entwined, woven, knotted, worked with metal, knitted, 
crocheted and appliqued (applied onto another surface). 
</P>
<P>
 Finished products can be as simple as necklaces, earrings, bracelets, anklets, 
rings, belts, hair accessories and scarves. But they can be more complex, like 
wreaths, flowers, paintings, masks and tapestries. 
</P>
<P>
 Annalee Dixon, co-owner of the Bead Shop in Laguna Beach, believes that beads 
have been around so long because "people are drawn to beautification. Beads are 
one part of that." 
</P>
<P>
 She says beads are something "fun to do besides surfing. We encourage people 
to find their own creativeness. Bead on!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Bead Station in Lake Forest and San Juan Capistrano offer directions over 
the counter. After customers pick out the beads, they can have an employee 
start stringing the project for them. Then the customer finishes it at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Anklets are now the rage, according to Bead Station owner Linda Mondt. Last 
year it was clothing embellishment, she said. The Bead Station also sells 
books, tools, clasps for earrings and necklaces, nose rings (also popular), and 
semiprecious stones. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can save so much by making it yourself. We will work with you to create 
whatever you want," Mondt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beads can be opaque, but also carved, spotted, swirled, shiny, dull clear, or 
translucent. The shapes can be round, flat, wavy, square, oval, tubular, 
rectangular or triangular. 
</P>
<P>
 The most primitive beads, according to history books on beads, were made from 
natural materials like wood, teeth, bamboo, bone, kernel, shell, leather claw, 
and stone. Glass beads were first prominent during the 15th Century BC in 
Egypt. By the time of the Romans, Alexandria was one of the most important bead 
centers. Byzantines later passed on bead manufacturing to Italians. 
</P>
<P>
 Beads have as many functions as they have variations. For archeologists, beads 
reveal a record of trade and also serve as a dating medium. The Chinese still 
use beads in their abacus for counting and, as recently as 1950, beads were 
used as currency in Africa.  
</P>
<P>
 Beads have also been used as religious objects and for status identification. 
For example, during the Ch'ing Dynasty in China (1644-1912), the king wore a 
certain bead while his courtiers wore different beads to identify their social 
standings. Beads also marked the rank of tribal chiefs, warriors and brides in 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a bead fanatic, plan a visit to the Bead Museum in Prescott, Ariz. 
The museum opened in 1986 and attracts about 20,000 visitors each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a funny thing, the effect beads have on people," says museum founder and 
director Gabrielle Liese. "People get caught up in the history behind the beads 
and suddenly everything they do becomes oriented around where they might find 
beads. They get hooked, and it becomes an overwhelming passion. The idea behind 
this museum was to make it possible for other people to see and compare and 
learn."  
</P>
<P>
 Beads at the museum represent all major countries and most time periods. All 
are catalogued with sources, materials and background information. The beads 
come from donors, connections and auctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adornment is instinctive in us and it has always existed, long before man 
made containers to put food in. It's just a human thing to do," Liese said.

 Wondering what to make of national health-care reform? 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledge is power, says Rock the Vote, a national organization committed to 
helping young people become more informed about political issues. 
</P>
<P>
 A comprehensive guide to health-care issues has been compiled by the group and 
is available at locations such as record stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolas Butterworth, executive director of the group's education fund, says 
the book is "strictly nonpartisan. It's for Republicans, Democrats, 
Independents, everyone. . . . This book should help you cut through the garbage 
and look for the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 And why should the usually healthy younger generation care about health 
reform?  
</P>
<P>
 There are issues, says Butterworth, that need to be addressed right now: 
pregnancy, socially transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, mental 
health and violence. Each is addressed in separate sections of the booklet. 
Also included are results of a survey on what the younger generation thinks 
about health care and health-care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the guide are also available by calling 1 (800) ROCK-VOTE. Making 
the Grade 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everyone had something to say as the grade-changing incident at 
Brea Olinda High School unfolded: attorneys, counselors, school administrators, 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 So what do students think? The Wildcat, the school paper, asked students about 
the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Injustices happen all the time. We need to pick up and move on and remember 
that we're still a great school," said one. 
</P>
<P>
 * "I was shocked," said another. "I think it was and still is a disgrace, not 
only for the students and administrators that were involved, but also for our 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 * "I don't believe this is a reflection on the majority of students and the 
staff on campus. Hopefully those who dealt with the grade changes will learn 
from this mistake and we'll be better off for that," added another.

MY TURN: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; BRENDA PUT THE ZIP IN '90210' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN HO, Jean Ho is a student at Huntington Beach High School, where this 
article first appeared in the student newspaper, the Oiler. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Please don't hate me for saying this, but I happen to love Brenda 
Walsh/Shannen Doherty, formerly of "Beverly Hills, 90210." 
</P>
<P>
 OK. So maybe I'm the only person in the world who feels this way(since the 
rest of the world's population most likely belongs to the I Hate Brenda Club), 
yet I can't help thinking that Shannen Doherty deserves at least one fan. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, I really don't think it's fair for everyone to despise her so 
much. So she happens to be a little bit on the snotty side. As if you wouldn't 
get high on yourself if you were famous.  
</P>
<P>
 A lot of actors and actresses act like pampered snobs, but the media don't 
publicize it as much as they do when they pick on Shannen. The way I see it, 
she just gets caught doing the wrong things at the wrong times. Why do you 
think her ex-colleagues in the "90210" cast always seem to be genuinely 
defending her? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they're just saying it for publicity reasons, but then again, no one's 
that good an actor. Besides, if she's as bad as people say, the other cast 
members would try to sneak in subtle remarks here and there that hint toward 
how horrible she is, except they haven't. 
</P>
<P>
 By firing Shannen, I'd say the producers made a very bad move. Aside from the 
fact that Jason Priestley and Luke Perry are on the show too, part of "90210's" 
appeal came from Shannen's notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Brandon got to be the saintly guy that everyone adores; Dylan was 
the tragic rebel that everyone wanted to comfort, and the rest of the gang made 
up the rich "brat pack" that you envied. 
</P>
<P>
 But every good soap opera needs a Susan Lucci (who plays Erica Kane on "All My 
Children"), the spoiled heroine who is sometimes incredibly devious, sometimes 
sticky sweet, but always very unpredictable. That's what helps keep the 
audiences watching. Brenda Walsh happened to be the "90210" version of Erica 
Kane. Whether they want to admit or not, everyone really did want to know what 
Brenda would have her next tantrum about.  
</P>
<P>
 What were the network executives thinking when they decided to substitute 
Tiffani Amber Thiessen for Shannen? What a JOKE! Have you seen the new episodes 
of "Beverly Hills, 90210?" Was Tiffani the only one who showed up for auditions 
or something? It sure couldn't be her modeling career that landed her the job 
or her "great" acting on "Saved by the Bell." 
</P>
<P>
 At least Shannen had talent. Remember that episode where Brenda subbed for 
Brandon at the Peach Pit? I will always admire her incredible imitation of the 
smart-alecky waitress from the '50s. I bet Tiffani can't do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, wait a minute, I forgot -- Tiffani is Brian Austin Green's girlfriend! Why 
didn't I see that before? It's sort of like that Aaron and Tori Spelling 
nepotism thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Honestly, this show is going downhill. There is no way that I will be able to 
watch Tiffani and take her character, Valerie, seriously. Those memories of 
that airhead cheerleader, Kelly Kapowski, on "Saved by the Bell" will just keep 
surfacing. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless Brenda comes back soon from her "stay" in London, "Beverly Hills, 
90210" is going to turn into a farce.

APODACA JONES PUTS TEENS IN PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have intended to write many times to commend the fine work of Rose Apodaca 
Jones. Her recent article, "Identity Crisis" (Sept. 30, 1994), however, has 
propelled me to action rather than just thought. 
</P>
<P>
 In my work as a therapist, I see teen-agers daily and find it helpful to 
understand their "world" in order to guide them forward into adulthood. Rose 
Apodaca Jones helps me do this. 
</P>
<P>
 Her grasp of the cultural and social scene of the teens and 20s living among 
us is broad enough and deep enough to make it understandable to many of us who 
are way beyond those years and not familiar with their culture. Her writing is 
clear, concise, interesting and understandable -- a commendable combination for 
a journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County deserves credit for recognizing her abilities and 
offering a platform for her work. I hope to see many more insightful articles 
under her byline in the future.

TRIBAL MUSICAL 'HAIR' GETS COVERED IN BREA REVIVAL; O.C. THEATER: THE YOUNG, 
CLOTHED CAST GETS SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THE '60S IN AN ATTEMPT TO FOCUS ON THE 
PLAY'S CHALLENGES TO THE STATUS QUO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reviving "Hair," the counterculture musical that heralded the dawning of the 
Age of Aquarius with profane lyrics and onstage nudity, is presenting an 
age-related challenge at Brea's Curtis Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Mary Engwall and director Gary Krinke have avoided controversy by 
cutting the famous nude scene at the end of the first act. Now their main task 
will be persuading audiences that Generation X actors from the politically 
correct, safe-sex 1990s actually are members of a hippie tribe from the 
rebellious, sexually liberated 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them to be the '60s when they perform it," said Engwall, as opposed 
to "a bunch of kids pretending to be hippies." 
</P>
<P>
 Most actors in the production, which opens a four-week run tonight in the 
199-seat playhouse, weren't born when the "tribal rock musical" premiered 
off-Broadway more than a quarter-century ago. To them, "Hair" initially was 
little more than a colorful period piece, a nostalgic look at a chaotic decade 
when their parents were young. 
</P>
<P>
 Krinke said the long hair, hippie garb, lava lamps and psychedelic music of 
the flower children prompted the young cast members to ask: "What were they 
doing?" And the actors "just howled," he said, when directed to simulate a 
'60s-style orgy by rolling around on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing to talk to them about the '60s," said Krinke, chair of the 
theater arts department at Fullerton College. His job as director, he said, is 
to dig back into the decade and make it relevant for the actors.  
</P>
<P>
 A member of the original off-Broadway cast, Danny Miller, provided those 
actors with some perspective on the turbulent '60s and the purpose of "Hair." 
Miller, a hippie turned drug and alcohol counselor, contacted the show's 
producers when he heard they were reviving it. Among the tips he gave was that 
they focus not on the musical's sex and drugs but on the way it attacks the 
status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 Some themes explored in "Hair," such as pollution and the tragedy of war, are 
as current now as they were three decades ago. Krinke pointed out that the 
musical's celebration of peace, love and understanding took on special meaning 
recently for audiences in war-torn Sarajevo, who braved sniper fire to reach a 
bombed-out theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very contemporary statement," Krinke said. "When (Sarajevo actors) do 
'Let the Sunshine In,' it's a prayer for them. It takes on a whole new 
meaning." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the decision to drop the nude scene -- the only thing that many people 
remember from "Hair" -- that was an artistic choice, Krinke said, not a 
concession to community values in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Nudity) was put in the Broadway show, I feel, to sell tickets," Krinke said. 
The musical "obviously stands on its own," he said, even if the actors won't be 
standing around in the altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Krinke and Engwall have fielded a lot of questions about the nudity issue, 
they said, including calls from a few actors with an exhibitionist streak; they 
refused to audition if they couldn't take off their clothes on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the nudity is gone, Krinke and Engwall are retaining the profanity 
and the satirical references to religion and middle-class morality that made 
"Hair" stand on end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're staying true to the script," Engwall said. Promotional material for 
"Hair" cautions that the musical contains "adult language and mature subject 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing what some people find offensive," said Krinke, who regards the 
content of "Hair" as "very tame" by today's standards. Nevertheless, Krinke and 
Engwall predict that some of the musical numbers, such as "Hashish" and "Holy 
Orgy," will still raise some eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's what they're hoping, because choosing to bring "Hair" to the stage 
is making a statement about their new professional theater group, Prism 
Productions. Their goal is to challenge Brea's cultural establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will alert the community as to what we're about," said Engwall, formerly 
of the Cultural Arts Commission and who has collaborated with Krinke for 12 
years on theater projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Prism wants to "add to the possibilities" of stage offerings in Brea, he said, 
rather than play it safe with traditional fare such as "Oklahoma!" and "The 
Music Man."  
</P>
<P>
 "I just am not after the standards," said Krinke.  
</P>
<P>
 Engwall promises that "Hair" will take the audience on an "emotional 
roller-coaster ride" as they relive -- or discover -- the turmoil of the 1960s 
through a series of 26 musical numbers, including such hit songs as 
"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In," "Good Morning Starshine" and "Easy to Be Hard." 
The slim plot line follows Claude (played by Brean Rod Burton) as he wavers 
between a hippie tribe and the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Engwall said she hopes this production of "Hair" will be viewed by audiences 
as chronicling the youth rebellion of the '60s, not as an endorsement of 
illegal drug use or promiscuity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brings you back to that time," Engwall said. "It makes a report on an era. 
That's what happened, that's the way it was." 
</P>
<P>
 * Prism Productions presents the musical "Hair" at the Curtis Theatre, 1 Civic 
Center Circle, Brea. Performances continue Fridays-Saturdays at 8 p.m., 
Saturdays-Sundays at 2 p.m. Through Nov. 20. $7 to $15. (714) 990-7722.

COURT DEALS A BLOW TO GETTY QUEST FOR 'GRACES'; ART: DECISION IN LONDON MAY END 
THE LONG COMPLICATED BATTLE FOR POSSESSION OF THE 19TH-CENTURY SCULPTURE BY THE 
VENETIAN ARTIST CANOVA. 
</P>

<P>
 A British court on Thursday rejected a key legal maneuver by the Getty Museum 
to win possession of "The Three Graces" by Italian sculptor Antonio Canova. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles museum had challenged a decision by Stephen Dorrell, national 
heritage secretary, giving local donors more time to raise money to buy the 
statue and keep it in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 John Russell, a London spokesman for the Getty, said the ruling Thursday by 
the Court of Appeals was "the end of the line," as this matter now may not be 
taken higher -- to the House of Lords. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot go further than this," he declared. "We are naturally very 
disappointed. Everybody knows the museum has been treated unfairly but that was 
not a matter of concern for this court." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Russell added that the Getty would "now review its policy on the buying of 
works of art in this country. . . . The trustees have always had faith in the 
export license system here. This whole thing about 'The Three Graces' 
demonstrates perhaps that that faith has been misplaced." 
</P>
<P>
 Getty trustees successfully bid 7.6 million -- more than $12 million, 
especially considering the appreciation of the British currency against the 
dollar -- for the noted 19th-Century sculpture, which, after an initial 
deadline had passed, British museums raised a matching sum to keep here. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's decision seems to end a long, complicated battle for possession of 
the work by the fashionable Venetian artist Canova. 
</P>
<P>
 He was commissioned to create "The Three Graces" by the Duke of Bedford in 
1815. The sculpture, depicting the three daughters of Jupiter, arrived at the 
family seat, Woburn Abbey, in 1819. It remained there in relative obscurity, 
until a descendant, the Marquess of Tavistock, strapped to pay taxes, offered 
to give the statue to Britain in lieu of taxes. That offer was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the piece was purchased in 1985 by an off-shore company based in the 
Cayman Islands, which, in turn, agreed in 1989 to sell it to the Getty. 
</P>
<P>
 British art authorities, however, objected to seeing this country lose "The 
Three Graces," arguing that it was of such noteworthy quality that the nation's 
cultural heritage would be diminished by its loss; experts here also decried 
the loss of Britain's artistic treasures to wealthy, foreign buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 British museum directors sought to raise a matching sum to keep "The Three 
Graces" in this country. But they failed to do so. Earlier this year, 
then-Heritage Secretary Peter Brooke delayed for six months the granting of an 
export license to the Getty while the British institutions sought additional 
funds. They were unsuccessful again. 
</P>
<P>
 When the money was not raised, at the request of the British museums, Dorrell 
-- Brooke's successor -- overturned government rules and extended the export 
permit's delay for three more months, while institutions here scrambled to find 
donors to buy the work. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul Getty II, an Anglophile and the philanthropist son of the Los 
Angeles museum's founder, then stepped in, pledging 1 million ($1.5 million) 
toward a matching fund to keep the sculpture here. Getty subsequently 
threatened to withdraw his support, temporarily angered by comments by the 
director of the Scottish museum about his relations with his father. But Getty 
relented after he received an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 His support for the cause was joined by Baron Heinrich von Thyssen, one of 
Europe's wealthiest men, who pledged the final 800,000 ($1.2 million). 
</P>
<P>
 Getty lawyers, arguing that the last British export license extension was 
"irrational and unreasonable," began legal proceedings, which previously were 
rejected in a lower court. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-judge appellate court on Thursday rejected Getty arguments that the 
Southern California institution had a "legitimate expectation" to the statue 
and that the first, six-month delay of the export license should have been the 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 The British fund-raising effort to keep "The Three Graces" was led by the 
Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the National Gallery of Scotland, both 
of which plan to display the Canova sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 Their directors solicited the younger Getty and Thyssen for their support. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Victoria and Albert said late Thursday: "It is a bit 
premature for celebration. We still have to negotiate with the owners to 
actually buy the statue outright." But she said it was "unlikely" that the 
Victoria and Albert's joint-bid with the Scottish museum would run into 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Three Graces" have remained for years in a wooden crate in a warehouse in 
south London -- ever since the Getty's original bid was accepted by the 
sculpture's current owners.

A SURREAL 'X-FILES' CAPTURES EARTHLINGS!; POLTERGEISTS, SPACE ALIENS AND 
MUTANTS FEED SHOW'S HOLD ON YOUNGER AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Deep in an industrial district here, the dank interior of a closed-down 
nightclub has been gutted and refitted with black plastic, chain link and neon 
lights for an episode of Fox's sexy, surreal TV series, "The X-Files." Detached 
mannequin limbs protrude from darkened walls to create disturbing images. 
</P>
<P>
 The seedy, smoke-filled space is supposed to resemble a Hollywood Boulevard 
nightclub -- the hangout for a contemporary coven of grunge vampires. These 
creatures of the night fall under the purview of the X-Files, which are the 
dumping ground for unexplainable FBI cases, dealing with subjects from 
poltergeists to extraterrestrials to telekinetics to genetic monsters. Probing 
these unworldly cases are the mismatched agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), a 
true believer, and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), a natural skeptic. 
</P>
<P>
 Milling about the smoke-filled nightclub are jewelry-pierced bodies in leather 
and chains. "They were looking for freaks," shrugged Shanin Graver, 26, one of 
the more conservatively dressed in a black miniskirt and lace. As one of dozens 
of extras recruited from Vancouver nightclubs, she jumped at the chance to 
appear in "X-Files." 
</P>
<P>
 "This show is different from anything else on television," she said excitedly. 
"There are science-fiction shows, but nothing that deals with the paranormal or 
the supernatural." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At least not successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 "The X-Files" has caught fire early in its second season. Ratings are up 36% 
compared to the same period last year, and 60% among adults 18 to 49, the 
demographic group for which advertisers pay most. All next month, Fox will air 
"X-Files" twice a week for a quick ratings fix during the November sweeps. New 
episodes will air in their regular time slot Fridays at 9 p.m., and specially 
chosen repeats will air Sundays at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Part mystery, part haunted house, part science fiction, part New Age 
mysticism, part government conspiracy, "The X-Files" is slowly creeping into 
pop culture. A recent New Yorker essay called it this generation's "The 
Twilight Zone." A devoted cult following dissects episodes weekly on national 
computer bulletin boards. MGM recently called creator Chris Carter to see if he 
had any "X-Files" mugs or T-shirts to use as set dressing on its big-budget 
science-fiction movie, "Species." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the show's success, Carter pointed to the legions of young 
Americans out there who believe -- or want to believe -- in the strange and 
supernatural. "There are more than you know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people who believe in these phenomena are sane, credible, normal 
everyday folk, who believe that it happened to them," he said. "You have no 
reason to doubt them. When I'm standing around on location, somebody will 
inevitably come up and say, 'Can I tell you my story?' We get lots and lots of 
fan mail. I'm a natural skeptic, but it has chipped away at my own skepticism 
about these things." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a large segment of people who believe literally in a lot of stuff 
we're doing," said Duchovny, sitting in his trailer outside the set. "Then 
there's a large subgroup who believes figuratively -- it's possible , what 
we're doing. If there is not a literal 6-foot fluke worm, at least the 
possibility of it exists. So there is the literal group and the figurative 
group, but they're both believers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The number of believers has come as something of a surprise, even to those 
involved with the show. "Chris pitched the show to me originally, and I was 
concerned nobody would buy it, because it's so far out there," said Bob 
Greenblatt, senior vice president of drama development for Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Duchovny had just come off a role in the film "Kalifornia" when his agent gave 
him the pilot script for "X-Files." "I read it, and I thought, 'A, it's a 
really good pilot. B, it's about extraterrestrials -- it's never gonna go. Who 
cares about this crap?' " Duchovny said. "Even if it did go, I thought, 'Yeah, 
it'll go six episodes, but, after six, how many shows can you do about 
extraterrestrials?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five episodes a season, as it turns out -- three more than most TV 
series. But they do not all feature your typical rash of aliens. There has been 
a shape-shifting serial killer who ate human livers, a ghost whose force 
surrounded a young girl and killed anybody who tried to harm her, and a 
beast-woman from the woods of New Jersey who fed on human victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell smart, scary stories, but we will not stoop for the easy scare," 
Carter said. "We avoid the conventions of horror or science fiction for that 
scare. If you try to analyze and put a label on the stories we tell, you do 
yourself a disservice. People say what is an X-File? I say it's like obscenity 
-- I know it when I see it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I hear from other writers and other networks, and everybody is trying to 
develop their own 'X-Files,' " Greenblatt said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, "X-Files" has been working hard this season to overcome an 
in-house challenge. Viewers may have noted a less visible role for Scully, 
played by Anderson, in the last few weeks. In last Friday's episode, she was 
abducted by an escaped mental patient who says he was experimented upon by 
aliens, and when she returns Nov. 11, she will be in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it a strange choice to take your lead actress out of a sizzling series? 
</P>
<P>
 Not when she's pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had decided sometime after learning that she was pregnant (last winter) to 
shoot around Gillian's pregnancy," Carter said. "Because the show is still in 
its infancy, essentially, I didn't think it would be good thing to write her 
pregnancy into the show. There were all these rumors circulating that she was 
going to have an alien baby. Although I addressed every possible idea from a 
creative standpoint, that was never a serious plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter considered making Scully a single mother, but he resisted domesticating 
the show. "I have chosen not to make the show about the characters' lives," he 
said. "The show works best as two FBI agents investigating paranormal or 
unexplained phenomena, and that's what drives the show. If the stories don't 
drive the show, then we're working backward." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the producers began writing lots of scenes late last season with 
Anderson talking on the phone or sitting behind a computer, and the directors 
began shooting her from the bust up. In the season finale, Carter wrote an 
episode in which the X-Files were closed, allowing Mulder to operate more 
independently to start this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I forget about the importance of our relationship in the show, because the 
story lines are what drive each episode," said Anderson, who gave birth to a 
baby girl, Piper, last month. "But, from what I can tell, from the feedback in 
the fan mail, there's a particular dedication that audience members have to 
this relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, the X-Files will be officially reopened by Mulder's boss -- Mulder 
has been a sort of paranormal free-lancer so far this season -- and Scully and 
Mulder will return to their regular working relationship in the episode airing 
Nov. 18. After that, they will just try to sustain the momentum they have 
built. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be hard to come up with really good stories every week," 
Duchovny said. "You can't be like a 'Melrose Place' -- you know, the guy's got 
a bad haircut, let's make an episode out of that. It's got to be a full-blown, 
movie-type story. So the pressure on the writers is immense."

G. LOVE'S SPECIALTY IS RAGMOP BLUES; POP MUSIC: HE AND HIS BAND, SPECIAL SAUCE, 
HAVE ATTRACTED GOOD REVIEWS AND A CORE OF FANS. THEY WILL BE AT THE ROXY 
TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Garrett Dutton III thinks that he could have been a contender as a shooting 
forward, but then he got hooked by the blues and became G. Love. Now his 
basketball passion is channeled into such songs as "Shooting Hoops," one of the 
engaging narratives that form the debut album by G. Love & Special Sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled with steady touring (the group appears tonight at the Roxy), the 
record has soaked up admiring reviews and attracted a base coalition of roots 
mavens and college-rock eclectics. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutton, a rangy youngster with Elvis features and thrift-shop duds, is only 
21, but he's done some serious digging. 
</P>
<P>
 The song "Blues Music" is his manifesto, a litany of influences from Blind 
Lemon Jefferson and Bukka White to Leadbelly and Booker T. to James Brown and 
Jimmy Smith. He doesn't listen to much current music -- he can't, since he 
doesn't own a CD player. The song "Town to Town" ends with the sound of a 
needle skipping on a scratchy record. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't file it under blues, exactly. G. Love and his two sidemen call it 
ragmop . 
</P>
<P>
 "It just came one day," says the Philadelphia native, his acquired drawl and 
jiving inflection giving his conversation the same kind of jumpy flow he brings 
to his music. "It's just a combination of everything I listened to, which was 
blues, reggae and hip-hop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were the three musics I was really listening to. Blues for myself when 
I'm playing guitar. . . . And reggae when I'm hangin' out with my friends or 
somethin', and hip-hop when we're drivin' around." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sound of ragmop is a timeless evocation of the rural blues, with G. Love's 
mumbling, murmuring vocals set in an earthy, natural framework that emphasizes 
the spontaneity and interaction of the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is so caught up, man, in high-tech gear and high-tech production," 
Dutton says, sitting near the pool at his Hollywood hotel during a recent 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, like all the records I listen to are set up with a mike in a room. 
That's what sounds right to me. All that (expletive) don't sound right to me. I 
don't want to sound like (expletive) Phil Collins, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutton grew up near Philadelphia's South Street, absorbing the polyglot 
promenade's multicultural flavor. He started playing guitar at age 8, and under 
the spell of Bob Dylan wrote his first song at 15. He began singing in the 
streets, first with friends and then alone, an M.O. he continued after moving 
to Boston in search of musical fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing on the streets, that was my best time ever, man. I used to love that. 
. . . I'd play for four hours straight. In the sun and the cold and everything. 
I just did it, man, I was into that (expletive). I was pretty much able to just 
be in my own world. I felt like a lot of strength just from being out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutton's ambitions were modest -- sell his homemade tapes and play the 
coffeehouses. But after he hooked up with bassist Jimmy Prescott and drummer 
Jeffrey Clemons, he began moving up the ladder on the Boston club circuit. The 
trio eventually connected with manager Jonathan Block, who got them a deal with 
Epic Records' newly revived Okeh label -- appropriately, one of the major 
companies in blues history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was intensely emotional," Dutton says of that step. "You have to 
understand, like a million kids have a dream about doin' what I'm doin' right 
now. So, of course, everybody tells you, from your guitar teachers to your 
parents, your parents' friends to your friends to their older brothers, 
everybody tells you that you're crazy. And you are, which is why you try to do 
it in the first place.  
</P>
<P>
 "And then if it works, then it's like, 'Holy (expletive), I can't believe 
this.' It's crazy, man. It was like so lucky. It's such a beautiful thing. I 
remember like cryin', man, to my drummer, we were so happy. It's like a dream 
come true." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Dutton, the next step involves a diminished presence for the hip-hop 
element and a sound that's even more primitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see us gettin' any more produced," he says. "I see us gettin' even 
more raw on the second album. We're talking about rentin' a loft in New Orleans 
and just shackin' out for a couple of weeks and runnin' the (tape recorder) and 
gettin' a couple of mikes in the room. Just real simple like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear us live it probably sounds pretty old-fashioned, I guess. We've 
played for all-black crowds, we've played for all-white crowds, mixed crowds. . 
. . Everybody. We've opened up for Booker T. & the MG's, we've opened up for 
Run-DMC. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found that anybody who can be opened up to a good time can get into it. 
We can always suck people into what we're doin' 'cause we're real. . . . We're 
not trying to be anything. We're kind of a bar band, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 * G. Love & Special Sauce play tonight at the Roxy, 9009 Sunset Blvd., West 
Hollywood, 8 p.m. $12 . (310) 276-2222.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; FAMA: NOT GRANDMA'S ITALIAN FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walking north on 4th Street in Santa Monica, I mutter: "I'm pretty sure Fama's 
up here -- at least I think it is. . . ." The street hit hard in the January 
earthquake hasn't looked the same since. Just when I'm ready to give up, I spot 
a message spray-painted on a boarded-up storefront: "Yo! Fama Open Every 
Night," and an arrow pointing up the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Fama, who runs the establishment with Hans Rockenwagner, confesses to 
this small act of enterprising graffiti. "When they boarded up the store next 
door, it looked like Fama was boarded up," she says. "I ran right across the 
street to the crafts store for a can of paint. But customers still call and ask 
when we're reopening." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1989, this snazzy little cafe was on the cutting edge of restaurant 
chic: extravagant, playful, deliberately noisy. The food was allegedly 
home-cooked Italian -- spaghetti and sausages as Mary Fama's Italian 
grandmother, Sally, had made them. But there were always some wild homemade 
pastas (shocking green jalapeno rotellini) and more than the occasional French 
flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 years old, Fama now has white parachuting suspended from the high 
ceilings as a kind of plump, noise-absorbing, ambience-softening cloud cover. 
Todd D'Alessandro, a young Culinary Institute of America graduate who cooked at 
Eureka, now mans Fama's kitchen -- and there's not a lot on the menu that 
grandma might make. 
</P>
<P>
 Presentation is invariably lovely, but the food is sometimes excellent, 
sometimes off target. I ate at Fama several times with the same person, and 
everything she ordered was excellent. My food was OK. She now loves Fama. I'm 
fond of it, with qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu changes a little week to week, which may explain why the kinks aren't 
out of every dish. One week, arugula is matched with small curls of delicious 
smoked salmon and gaufrette potatoes lodged in daubs of cre me frai che: It's 
all good, but what's with those silly potatoes? The next week's arrangement is 
more satisfying: The arugula is served beside a flat map of the salmon 
crisscrossed with herbed yogurt and avocado puree. 
</P>
<P>
 Caesar salad, made with fresh leaves from the heart of the romaine, comes with 
terrific little crisps of baked parmesan cheese, but needs a juicier dressing.  
</P>
<P>
 An appetizer of assorted dips, supposedly for two, includes a tangy whip with 
codfish roe, airy hummus, and a good smoky melitzana or eggplant spread. Four 
of us went through two baskets of pita bread and still didn't swab the plate 
clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Nix on mixed seafood risotto, however: too winey and briney. Have your salmon 
grilled instead, on a dreamy bed of corn, white beans and chopped vegetables 
surrounded by a moat of bright orange chile sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Fama's pasta has a sturdy, homemade tensile strength. After you've eaten all 
the big, meaty wild mushrooms off your fettucine, you may notice that the pasta 
is actually a little oily, too oily -- even for truffle oil. Lighter is the 
sweet grilled Louisiana shrimp on spaghettini with roasted garlic, spinach and 
a hint of hot chile.  
</P>
<P>
 One week, there's an alluring grilled chicken breast with green pesto-infused 
mashed potatoes and a pork tenderloin served with a potato cake fried so hard, 
a fork can't penetrate it. The next week, the green mashed potatoes have moved 
to the pork and the chicken has polenta. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't balk at the confusingly named "grilled schawarma kabob." (Shawarma, 
generally a marinated meat roasted on a vertical spit, is decidedly distinct 
from a kebab.) Semantics aside, this mandala of minted yogurt, pita points, 
lamb chunks and quenching tabbouleh is homey and satisfying, although the lamb 
should have been rarer. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a memorable nectarine and blueberry pie, desserts are 
anti-climactic. I like hazelnuts in a crisp's topping, but the pear and 
cranberry filling doesn't sing. Pumpkin pie is actually a skimpy wedge of 
custard on a soggy crust. Bread pudding, a square of petalled bread slices, is 
dry. The "rich caramel custard," however, is indeed rich. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years, Fama has one thing down cold: The service is just right -- 
friendly, informal and perfectly attentive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fama, 1416 4th Street, Santa Monica (310) 451-8633. Open seven nights for 
dinner. Beer and wine served. Visa, MasterCard, American Express accepted. 
Dinner for two, food only, $42 to $63.

DRUMMER LEAVES SOCIAL DISTORTION AFTER 10 YEARS; POP MUSIC: THE PARTING WAS 
AMICABLE, INSISTS CHRIS REECE, BUT HE AND THE GROUP HAD 'GROWN DIFFERENT WAYS 
MUSICALLY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Social Distortion faces its first lineup change in more than 10 years with the 
recent departure of drummer Chris Reece. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my decision pretty much," Reece said last week on the phone from his 
home in Long Beach. "But there were a lot of issues that led up to it. In the 
past we had pretty much seen eye to eye on how things were going but (recently) 
we just weren't seeing eye to eye on drum parts. We've just grown different 
ways musically, and it was time for us to go our separate ways. Both parties 
felt it was the best thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Reece joined Social Distortion in 1984 when the highly regarded punk band from 
Fullerton was at an ebb, its previous drummer and bassist having quit in 
disgust over leader Mike Ness' drug problems. Reece had played with a punk band 
in San Francisco, the Lewd, before moving to Los Angeles. By 1987, Ness' 
recovery had returned the band to stability and productivity, and Reece 
provided the beat for the three strong albums that ensued, "Prison Bound" 
(1988), "Social Distortion" (1990) and "Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell" 
(1992). 
</P>
<P>
 Reece, 33, emphasized that no bitterness attends his split with 
singer-guitarist Ness, rhythm guitarist Dennis Danell and bassist John Maurer. 
"It's not like we got in a big fight. Those guys are my best buddies. I still 
hang out with them, and I still think Mike's one of the best songwriters and 
guitar players around." 
</P>
<P>
 Ness in a separate interview said simply that Reece "wanted to explore 
different avenues. We've overcome many obstacles in the past. This is just 
another one." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ness said that Social Distortion, which records for Epic, is still working on 
material for the fifth album of its 15-year career. He said Randy Carr, a 
drummer from Fullerton, has filled in for rehearsals and demo recordings since 
Reece left about four weeks ago. Ness said auditions for a full-time drummer 
probably won't take place for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not our priority right now. The priority is to get the writing 
finished. Right now we're writing like crazy. I've written about 30 songs in 
the last year. I really want to dig deep. I don't want this to be just another 
Social D. record -- I want it to be the Social D. record." 
</P>
<P>
 Reece remains on the local rock scene as manager of Joyride, a fine punk band 
that, he said, is scheduled to record its third album for the Doctor Dream 
label by year's end. Reece also has been playing informally with a young, 
otherwise all-female band from East L.A. called Montezuma's Revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sound like Social Distortion but they sing mostly in Spanish. It's just 
something to keep me busy. We'll see how it develops."

FIRST PERSON / ORANGE COUNTY: AIDS VICTIM'S DYING DAYS A FAMILY ORDEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 32-year-old man is dying of AIDS in my bed. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not my lover. He's my brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 The bed is one that my wife and I usually occupy. But the disease has stripped 
50 pounds from her older brother, Michael, and he now spends much of his time 
prone, with an intravenous tube dripping liquid through a catheter in his 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael hasn't been able to eat much lately. Nausea haunts him. Food often 
sickens him. Vomiting and chills visit. Dry heaves echo down the hall from the 
bathroom in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, we have known Michael was HIV-positive. But it never seemed real. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we grapple with the scourge as it steals a loved one. The time is coming 
soon. Although we love Michael deeply and will miss him when he's gone, his 
temporary presence -- and dire need for care and support -- has put a strain on 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 Because their Ocean Beach condominium is too small to accommodate more than 
two or three people, Michael and his lover, Peter, are living with me, my wife, 
Therese, and our 2-year-old daughter, Hannah, in our 1,400-square-foot 
condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael's mother and a sister from Massachusetts have flown out to stay with 
us. An aunt from Chicago was here not long ago. So was an aunt from New York. 
Another aunt is on the way soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Therese has decided to use her sick leave so she can stay home from her job as 
schoolteacher and lend her mother and sister help. Peter does the same after 
coming home from work. 
</P>
<P>
 They work round the clock, changing IV bags, disposing of needles in a special 
container for "contaminated wastes," administering medication and helping 
Michael in and out of the tub. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone rings throughout the day like a school bell. Our two trash cans 
can't hold all the rubbish we now produce. The carpeted floor has become 
bedding for some. My makeshift dresser is the top of a desk in a loft where 
Therese and I sleep on a fold-out sofa. My starched shirts hang from a nearby 
piece of exercise equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mail is sometimes misplaced. Bugs have invaded the kitchen more than once due 
to the volume of new and interesting crumbs that are accidentally left behind. 
I had to fill my pickup truck with piles of ant-covered trash bags and take 
them to the dump after I forgot to put them out at the curb for the usual 
weekly service. 
</P>
<P>
 Making private telephone calls has come to be known as visiting the "phantom 
tollbooth," a stairwell to the garage where we go to speak without 
interruption. We refer to the kitchen as a restaurant that's always open. 
</P>
<P>
 We're getting tired, but tell jokes to lighten the mood. We take walks. We 
talk about current events. Or rent movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Michael's mother wished last week for a chance to take two or three 
days and fly back to her 11-year-old son, who thinks she won't be home for his 
birthday in December. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Monday morning, Therese and I discussed whether I should take Hannah 
away immediately if the end is violent and disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How much longer can it go on? 
</P>
<P>
 One doctor said at the most, two weeks. Michael's been with us for almost six. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannah must innately understand what's happening. 
</P>
<P>
 The usually rambunctious girl turns tender and careful when moving near 
Michael's frail body. She offers him stuffed animals. He smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Will she remember Uncle Mike when she's older? 
</P>
<P>
 Michael has taught us about dignity, sharing and laughing. No book, magazine, 
movie, poem, friendship or assignment has ever come this close to revealing 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember wincing in the late 1980s when reading parts of "And the Band 
Played On," a groundbreaking tome on AIDS by Randy Shilts, a journalist 
recently claimed by the disease, and whose gaunt face appeared on a television 
interview before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Words on paper, though, can only convey so much, and can't wake you at 3 a.m. 
and make you wonder how much longer somebody might survive. Televisions can be 
turned off with the push of a button.

 A good day for Michael is the ability to shuffle down the hallway and sit on 
the sofa for maybe an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 A bad day is full of shivers that rack his torso and shake the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael's mind is sharp, but his eyes sometimes appear dull and distant. He 
has trouble walking because his feet hurt. His once muscular calves are as thin 
as broomsticks. His boxer shorts billow over his emaciated thighs. 
</P>
<P>
 He rarely complains and is appreciative of simple things done for him, like 
help shaving or combing his hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "How is your day going?" he asked me one morning. 
</P>
<P>
 I commented on an arrangement of red gladioli on the dresser, their flowers in 
full glory. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're beautiful," Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife's family is frightened by his condition, but emboldened by the chance 
to be with him and to help him. 
</P>
<P>
 But my parents, both of Midwestern stock, are uncomfortable talking about 
subjects like AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 My 82-year-old grandfather, whom I recall walking to night church services 
during snow flurries, didn't have much compassion when word of Magic Johnson's 
HIV status got out. Look at all the sexual partners he had, my grandfather 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 My grandfather doesn't know what's going on in my home. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday, I'll tell my mother and father. Maybe they'll understand.

 It is difficult, if not impossible, for the media to ignore the anniversary of 
major events. It is particularly difficult for television, our voracious daily 
visual medium, to skip an anniversary -- especially when it is one associated 
with dramatic footage and awesome natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it is that KCAL-TV Channel 9 delivers "The Fires of Autumn," a 
year-later look at the hellish firestorms that engulfed five Southern 
California counties last October, burned more than 1,200 homes and businesses 
and left three dead and some 200 injured.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, in the hands of a team of KCAL news reporters under the 
direction of producer Lisa Brown, this is one anniversary that would have been 
better off merely noted in passing on the 10 o'clock news. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, host David Jackson, a "Prime 9 News" anchor, and reporters Matt 
Stevens, Michele Gile, Toni Guinyard, Bill Gephardt, Gay Yee and Sylvia Lopez 
have mined just about every word, phrase or theatrical pause in the Book of 
Melodrama in this grating, annoying effort to cash in on an admittedly good 
stash of footage. All this is under the guise of providing an uplifting look at 
stories of "courage, tragedy and rebuilding." A heavy-handed message of hope is 
used to justify rerunning all those neat shots of folks in distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Important issues are raised -- safety, construction, insurance -- but only 
touched upon, lest they get in the way of phrases such as "the future gagged 
while the present burned" and "victims forced to suffer and heal at once." 
</P>
<P>
 Suffering viewers will find it hard not to gag in the present. Healing at once 
is easy -- just click the remote. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Fires of Autumn" airs at 9 tonight on KCAL-TV Channel 9 (and repeats 
Nov. 6 at 9 p.m.). MARTIN ZIMMERMAN
