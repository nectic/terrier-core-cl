LILY DAMITA; STAR OF EARLY TALKING FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lily Damita, a Paris-born beauty who came to Hollywood in 1928 to become one 
of the film industry's first glamorous stars at the dawn of talking pictures, 
has died. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press said Thursday that she had been suffering from 
Alzheimer's disease and died Monday in Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthologies differ on her date of birth but she was believed to be about 90. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Liliane Marie Madeleine Carre, she appeared in French, German, Austrian 
and British movies during the 1920s, including "Fiacre No. 13," an early work 
by director Michael Curtiz of "Casablanca" fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Biographies say she was making a picture in Berlin when she was discovered by 
Samuel Goldwyn, who brought her to Hollywood to star opposite Ronald Colman in 
the film adaptation of Joseph Conrad's "Rescue." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next seven years, she made a dozen pictures and gained notoriety for 
her work, her various hairstyles and her romances. 
</P>
<P>
 Her American films included the 1929 version of "The Bridge of San Luis Rey," 
"The Cockeyed World," "Brewster's Millions" and "The Devil on Horseback." 
</P>
<P>
 Her last picture was "Frisco Kid" with James Cagney. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1930, Goldwyn permitted her to perform on Broadway in "Sons o' Guns" and 
two years later in "George White's Music Hall Varieties" opposite Burt Lahr and 
Eleanor Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 Her career ended abruptly with her marriage to Errol Flynn in 1935 when Flynn 
was first breaking into films. 
</P>
<P>
 They divorced in 1942 after having a son, Sean, a photojournalist who 
disappeared in Cambodia in 1970.

CAREY S. BLISS; EXPERT ON RARE BOOKS BUILT HUNTINGTON COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carey Stillman Bliss, a rare books expert who was instrumental for 45 years in 
building the highly respected collection of the Huntington Library, has died at 
the age of 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Bliss, who retired as the Huntington's curator of rare books in 1982, died 
March 18 at Arcadia Methodist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The author of scores of books and articles on Southern California history and 
the history of printing, Bliss also compiled "Autos Across America," a 
bibliography of early transcontinental U.S. automobile travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Albany, N.Y., Bliss moved to San Marino as a child when his father 
relocated there with the Huntington Library staff. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Pomona College, the younger Bliss joined the Huntington 
staff in 1937. Over the years, he earned the respect of rare book dealers, 
librarians and collectors throughout the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Bliss was active in the Zamorano and Rounce & Coffin clubs, which concentrate 
on rare book collections, and the Southern California Camellia Society, the San 
Gabriel Historical Society and the Book Club of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Audrey; their son, Anthony, of Piedmont, Calif.; a 
brother, Thayer; a sister, Virginia, and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Huntington 
Library in San Marino.

JOSE HOLGUIN; SOLE B-17 SURVIVOR KEPT VOW TO FIND REMAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Holguin, a World War II navigator whose unrelenting, single-minded quest 
to recover the bodies of the nine fellow crewmen who were killed when their 
bomber was shot down more than 50 years ago, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin, who became a school administrator in Los Angeles after retiring from 
the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel, was 73. By the time of his death Tuesday 
of a heart attack at his Los Feliz home, he had brought five of his fellow 
fliers home for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin began his search years after he became the lone survivor of the June 
26, 1943, crash of his B-17 after it was shot down by a Japanese fighter over 
the South Pacific island of New Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin -- whose honors included the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying 
Cross and the Prisoner of War and Army Commendation medals -- was the navigator 
and had his parachute on when the bomber was hit. He accidentally tumbled 
through an open door of the crippled plane and floated away to what would prove 
to be two years in a Japanese prison camp on New Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Only seven of the camp's 64 captives lived to see freedom again. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, 18 years after he retired from the Air Force and after he became an 
assistant principal at Verdugo Hills High School, he responded to what he 
described as "the noise from a rumbling train that just kept getting louder." 
The thought that his old comrades were "still out there" took him on the first 
of three visits to New Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 He found the wreckage of his B-17, christened "Naughty but Nice." The scantily 
clad calendar girl painted on the plane's nose was still visible but there were 
no signs of the crewmen's remains. 
</P>
<P>
 But he determined that some of the crew members' bodies had been recovered and 
buried in unmarked graves at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in 
Honolulu. He prevailed on the Army to identify the bodies in those graves. With 
the help of former Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), he determined that five of 
them were members of his crew. Those five were finally laid to rest in their 
hometowns; one, Sgt. Henry Garcia, is buried in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin never was able to locate his other four comrades in arms. 
</P>
<P>
 At Garcia's reburial in 1985, Holguin recalled the anguish he experienced when 
he first crawled from the jungle to the wreckage of his plane, with bullets in 
his jaw and leg and his back broken. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I could do was to tell the (dead) men, in my silent way, that 
I couldn't take them with me but I would be back to take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin's survivors include his wife, Rebecca, three sons, three daughters and 
five grandchildren.

CITYSCAPES: ONE PANICKED FATHER CALLED . . . TO LOCATE HIS DAUGHTER AFTER SHE 
FAILED TO CALL TO WISH HIM A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.; BUSINESSMAN OFFERS TO PULL APRON 
STRINGS ACROSS THE PACIFIC 
</P>

 Philip Marlowe he's not. Ron Hasegawa's proposed stock in trade is snooping on 
students to see if they are going to class, doing their homework, and making 
the right kind of friends. His clients, he hopes, will be worried parents an 
ocean away in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 With tales of crime and violence in the United States frequently dominating 
headlines in Tokyo, some parents worry that their offspring might encounter 
more than just cultural enrichment during their year abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 To the rescue is Hasegawa, who has founded a company dedicated to helping keep 
Japanese exchange students safe from crime -- and from their own lapses of 
judgment.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Hasegawa says his representative in Tokyo, Tomizawa Masayuki, has 
received dozens of inquiries after the company was written about in the 
Japanese press, he has not signed any contracts yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics in this county are not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I certainly don't think anything like that is useful. They're 
probably preying on the concerns of parents," said William Cassell, dean of 
international studies at Santa Monica College, which has 600 students from 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, Hasegawa hung a shingle -- or rather, advertised a fax number -- 
for a company called Intersec, a private monitoring service dedicated to 
maintaining apron strings across the Pacific.  
</P>
<P>
 He says there is a genuine need for the service. Not long ago, Hasegawa, who 
is a Los Angeles Police Department reserve officer, helped bust a Little Tokyo 
prostitution ring by posing as a john. He was shocked to find that 16 of the 22 
young women arrested were students from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasegawa began to suspect that many parents did not have much of an idea what 
their children were doing in the United States. For years, he had been 
informally keeping an eye on the children of Japanese friends when they came to 
this country to study, but now he thought there might be a need for a 
formalized watchdog service.  
</P>
<P>
 For planeloads of students from Japan, a year abroad in Southern California is 
a chance to learn English, meet people, practice surfing or driving a 
convertible -- and get away from the watchful eyes of mom and dad. But with 
images of drive-by shootings and nice girls gone wild dancing in their heads, 
some parents may want to have a better idea of what their children are up to 
here.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, for $3,000 a year, Intersec's staff will brief college and high school 
students on safety issues, drugs and AIDS, and check in weekly, monthly, and at 
each semester's end to chat with students at their lodgings. They will hang 
around and see what kind of roommates the student has, whether they are going 
to class, how their grades are and whether they look like they are getting 
enough sleep. Then they report to the parents in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Kikuchi, manager of the Los Angeles office of ICS, a student exchange 
consulting firm, says that while students abroad are blithely enjoying their 
newfound freedoms and opportunities, parents sometimes feel separation anxiety. 
One panicked father called her office to locate his daughter after she failed 
to call to wish him a happy birthday. It turns out she had forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 It might seem that parents could call their children and ask how they are 
doing rather than paying a consultant to do it. But Hasegawa says some parents 
cannot communicate with their children. Although many teen-agers who come on 
well-established exchange programs are excellent students, others "are kind of 
dropouts, who couldn't make it in the system in Japan. So the parents and kids 
are so embarrassed," Hasegawa said. "The easiest way out is to send them to an 
American high school." 
</P>
<P>
 The roster of experts Hasegawa lists in his promotional pamphlet as his 
advisers is impressive -- retired CIA and State Department officials, a retired 
sheriff's deputy and a couple of members of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Asian crimes investigation section. The weekly checkups would be done by 
moonlighting college counselors and fellow Japanese students. But the big guns 
will be there to offer help if the client's child runs into trouble, he said. 
Hasegawa says that as a reserve LAPD officer he has seen plenty of reason for 
parents to worry. He has seen Japanese students get in trouble driving drunk 
and developing cocaine habits that force them to turn to burglary to supplement 
their monthly stipends from home. Some students keep their whereabouts secret 
from their parents by collecting their monthly wire transfers at a post office 
box. Some tumble into working in the nether world of mizushobai -- "the water 
trade" -- hostess bars, restaurants and karaoke dens popular with Japanese 
expatriates. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, more than 40,000 students entered the United States from Japan, up 
from 17,000 10 years earlier. But in the last couple of years, fear of crime in 
the United States is among the factors that have helped slow the flow of 
Japanese students to this country. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a Japanese high school student, decked out in a John Travolta disco 
costume, was shot dead when he knocked on the door of the wrong house in 
Louisiana, looking for a Halloween party. Then, in August, 1993, the shooting 
death of another Japanese student at a Concord, Calif., train station further 
raised worries. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of America's dangers, real and imagined, the reaction among 
Japanese students in California to Intersec's proposed service is less than 
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Takanori Hirai, 23, a student at El Camino College, says that hiring a 
watchdog for one's offspring defeats the purpose of sending them abroad. 
"(Students) left their parents in Japan and want to do something without their 
parents' eyes looking at them. Maybe they play around and waste their parents' 
money here. But eventually they'll learn many things here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Students are their parents' kids, but they're also human beings," he said.

MENENDEZ LAWYER SENDS LETTERS SEEKING DONATIONS; COURTS: ABRAMSON HOPES TO 
RAISE $1 MILLION FOR BROTHERS' RETRIAL. ONE LEGAL EXPERT SAYS THE SOLICITATION 
IS WITHIN ETHICAL GUIDELINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Leslie Abramson has sent supporters of the Menendez brothers an 
unusual solicitation letter in hopes of raising more than $1 million for the 
brothers' retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter dated March 11 and sent from her law office under the banner "Erik 
G. Menendez Legal Defense Fund," Abramson urges "all those who expressed 
support for Erik," meaning those nationwide who have sent him about 3,000 
letters, "to contribute what they can." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, which an expert said was unusual but within the guidelines of 
legal ethics, also says: "If I were rich I would gladly represent Erik again 
for free. But the harsh reality is that I support a family and am already 
seriously in debt because of the inadequacy of the fee I received to represent 
Erik in the first trial." 
</P>
<P>
 It adds: "We need to raise over $1 million to finance the case solely with 
contributions." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter formalizes a money-raising campaign that Abramson launched in TV 
interviews moments after the first trial of the Menendez brothers ended in 
January with separate juries, one for each brother, deadlocked between murder 
and lesser manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Erik Menendez, 23, and Lyle Menendez, 26, admitted on the stand that they used 
a shotgun to kill their parents Aug. 20, 1989, in the TV room of the family's 
Beverly Hills home.  
</P>
<P>
 The brothers said they killed out of fear after years of abuse. Prosecutors 
contend that the brothers murdered out of hatred and greed for the parents' 
$14-million estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg has scheduled an April 15 
hearing to set a new trial date. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, prosecutors apparently are pursuing possible new evidence relating 
to Lyle Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first trial, one of the older brother's former girlfriends, Traci 
Baker, testified about a dinner at which family members seemed afraid that 
Kitty Menendez was trying to poison their food. A letter purportedly written by 
Lyle Menendez to Baker details the dinner and says, "We will decide later 
around what date this incident occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 That letter surfaced too late for prosecutors to use in the first trial, but 
they ordered Baker to appear this week before a county grand jury, sources said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn, the chief prosecutor in the case, declined 
Friday to confirm a grand jury investigation. He did say that prosecutors 
obtained warrants and searched Baker's apartment, her lawyer's office and even 
the lawyer's briefcase as he sat outside the grand jury room. 
</P>
<P>
 Conn declined, however, to comment on the searches. Baker's lawyer, Santa 
Monica attorney Paul Gabbert, could not be reached Friday for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Abramson did not return phone calls Friday seeking comment.But she has said 
repeatedly since the trial ended that she needs more cash to stay on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In legal briefs, Abramson has asked taxpayers to pay her $100 per hour, up to 
$250,000, for the retrial. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Cecil Mills, who 
supervises the county's criminal courts, turned her down two weeks ago, saying 
she still has a valid contract. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, the parents' estate has paid her $740,000 in fees 
and expenses; an aunt paid her $50,000 more from an investment account 
maintained for Erik Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 The estate also paid $740,000 for Lyle Menendez's defense. Two public 
defenders will represent the older brother at the second trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Abramson asked Mills to reconsider. He said he would hear her 
request on April 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging in the fund-raising letter that her prospects for public funds 
are uncertain, Abramson says: "If we have to rely on court funding alone it is 
clear that we will not have enough money to do in the next trial what we were 
able to do in the first and we may lose for want of funds."

OFFICIALS REACT CAUTIOUSLY TO NEWS OF FBI PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS and JIM NEWTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a carefully worded statement drafted by city lawyers, Compton leaders on 
Friday distanced themselves from a federal investigation into allegations that 
at least two former city officials accepted bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement, read at a news conference by Mayor Omar Bradley, emphasized 
that the two officials named in press reports this week -- Rep. Walter R. 
Tucker III and former City Councilwoman Patricia Moore -- both have left city 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to newspaper accounts, the main targets of the investigation are 
two people who no longer hold political office in the city of Compton," the 
statement said. Officials underlined the words "no longer." 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, Bradley was flanked by top city officials, including 
City Atty. LeGrand Clegg, City Manager Howard Caldwell and council members 
Marcine Shaw and Ronald Green. Bradley uncharacteristically cut the session 
short, declining to answer reporters' questions and leaving the room as soon as 
he concluded the two-minute statement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the statement, officials emphasized that they had not learned of the 
undercover investigation until news reports disclosed it. Sources familiar with 
the investigation have told The Times that the inquiry was launched more than 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation, sources have said, was in part a sting operation in which 
an undercover FBI agent posed as a businessman offering bribes to various city 
officials.  
</P>
<P>
 "At this time, neither the FBI nor the U.S. attorney's office has contacted 
any city officials regarding the alleged investigation," Bradley said at 
Friday's news conference. "Nor have these agencies subpoenaed any official 
documents or charged any elected official or department head with a crime 
relating to his or her association with the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the investigations were reported this week by the Wall Street 
Journal and The Times. Spokesmen for the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office 
have declined all comment, as have officials with the Internal Revenue Service. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the city of Compton has not been formally notified of an ongoing 
investigation, any official response to the published allegations would be 
premature," the Compton statement said. "Nevertheless, it must be stressed that 
the elected officials and management have the utmost faith in the integrity of 
the city staff." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement did not name Tucker or Moore, who have denied wrongdoing. They 
were unavailable for comment Friday.

A WEALTH OF WOES; FEDERAL BRIBERY INQUIRY IS LATEST IN A LONG LIST OF SETBACKS 
AS COMPTON STRUGGLES TO GET BACK ON ITS FEET 
</P>

<P>
 It has been a city beset for decades, its problems a familiar litany: Blight. 
Crime. Every fourth person in poverty. Schools so mismanaged they were taken 
over by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was with a certain weariness that the city of Compton greeted its latest 
spate of bad news: A sweeping federal probe had developed allegations that 
local politicians accepted bribes, that the target of that investigation was 
Compton City Hall, that an undercover agent posing as a businessman had offered 
two of the city's political stars bribes to have items placed on council 
agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the named targets were Rep. Walter R. Tucker III, a former mayor and a 
scion of one of Compton's oldest, wealthiest and most politically entrenched 
families, and former Councilwoman Patricia A. Moore, one of Compton's most 
visible activists. Sources close to the probe said other city officials were 
being investigated as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton has become well acquainted with poverty and the temptations that go 
with it. The city was once a bustling, ethnically mixed community of frame 
houses and tidy storefronts. In the 1950s it became one of many Southland areas 
in which housing integration prompted white flight. In the 1960s the Watts 
riots and other social upheavals prompted business owners -- most of them white 
-- to flee the city. With the businesses went the jobs. With joblessness came 
crime. And as crime and gang violence took a progressively bigger toll during 
the past decade, some of the city's black middle class began to move out, 
replaced by Latino immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 Today Compton is a city of 91,400 residents, 27% of whom live below the 
poverty line -- nearly twice as high as the proportion of poor people in Los 
Angeles County. Fewer than 3.5% of its households have an income of more than 
$50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a place where cynicism about the motivations of public officials has 
risen as various attempts by City Hall to bootstrap the community back into the 
middle class have faltered. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the storied auto mall, the strip of shiny dealerships that was going 
to save downtown. Then the Compton Ramada was going to be the city's salvation, 
a luxury hotel for meetings and weddings and fancy Sunday brunch. Then there 
was the wealth that the Blue Line was expected to trundle into town, to a 
transit center and shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Every deal raised Compton's civic hopes only to dash them with bad timing or 
bad management or bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
 The 66-acre auto mall, for example, ended up being built with a 10-foot brick 
wall around it, hiding the rows of shining cars from potential customers. Two 
of three dealerships defaulted on millions of dollars in city loans in 1989 and 
closed their doors. Only one dealer remains on the lonely street. 
</P>
<P>
 The Compton Ramada -- the city's first grand hotel -- had to be seized by the 
city last year. After paying the developer about $30 million to build the 
attached parking structure and convention center, the city loaned him the $6.7 
million he needed to complete the project. But the developer, Naftali Deutsch, 
never made a single payment on the loan, and now the hotel is in the city's 
lap. 
</P>
<P>
 The contractor who promised to deliver the vaunted $4.1-million multipurpose 
transit center was declared in default for failing to complete the project in 
1989. The city finished the project, but the inner mall Compton had hoped to 
see crammed with Blue Line commuters on shopping sprees is so far a vista of 
mostly empty storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
 With failure has come finger-pointing. Each fizzled venture has brought with 
it new rumors of corruption at City Hall. But much is said and little is 
proved. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxcy Filer, a 41-year resident of the city and a former councilman, said that 
when the auto mall was pushing for more dealerships and the Compton Ramada was 
in the planning stages in the early and mid-1980s, it seemed that council 
members were constantly being feted at banquets attended by city contractors 
who stood to gain from those projects and who would spend thousands of dollars 
on tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The proceeds "were supposed to go for their reelection campaigns," said Filer, 
a councilman from 1976 to 1991. "But who knows if they actually were? We could 
have filled that (auto) plaza but six or seven dealerships were turned away 
because, as far as I could see, they didn't buy tickets" to the politicians' 
testimonial banquets. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges and countercharges have created a political climate notable for 
its bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the scandal of 1985, in which Councilman Floyd A. James, then battling 
Patricia Moore to hold on to his council seat, was accused of illegally trading 
votes for record albums featuring the Rev. Jesse Jackson's fiery "Our Time Has 
Come" speech. 
</P>
<P>
 James, who won that election, ended up pleading no contest to a far less 
serious charge of sending out an illegal mailer. He served three years 
probation and two weeks picking up freeway trash -- but not before someone 
called the local police to claim that the key witness against him was growing 
marijuana in her back yard.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the 1987 Tucker scandals, involving a family so locally 
connected that they have been called the "Kennedys of Compton." That was the 
year that Mayor Walter R. Tucker, who is now dead, saw both his wife and son 
accused of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 First, his son, Walter Tucker III -- at the time a county prosecutor -- was 
charged with tampering with the date on photographs he was using as evidence in 
a narcotics case in an attempt to cover up the fact that he had withheld the 
evidence from the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Then his wife, Martha Tucker, was accused of swindling nearly $300,000 from 
eight clients who were involved with her in real estate purchases. The mayor's 
wife -- who has since said that she was "left holding the bag" in a legitimate 
real estate deal -- ultimately pleaded no contest to three counts of grand 
theft and was ordered to pay a fine. 
</P>
<P>
 His son, meanwhile, pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of preparing 
false evidence. He spent three years on probation, paid a $100 fine and was 
fired from the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walter Tucker III's political career flourished as he followed in his 
father's civic footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1991, after a bruising election, he became the youngest mayor in 
Compton history. Then, in November, 1992, he was elected to Congress from the 
37th District. At the time, his critics used words like "charmed life" to 
describe the career of the lawyer and Baptist minister. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't see how he won (the congressional seat), but it is not for us to 
understand," said Councilwoman Bernice Woods, a typical Tucker foe. "Right or 
wrong, where God puts a period, I don't put a question mark. All I know is that 
the devil does reign sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, in a 1992 interview with The Times, said: "The self-confidence I have 
comes from the fact that I have made mistakes and that God has allowed me to 
rebound from those mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Experience," he added, "has taught me that you cannot do things at the 
expense of the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been other intrigues in recent years involving Compton city 
government: Charges of nepotism and cronyism in the hiring and promotion of 
city workers. Charges -- denied -- that the late mayor Tucker had used a 
campaign fund-raiser to pay off his wife's legal expenses. Low-interest city 
loans to an auto dealership that had contributed heavily to the council 
majority. Lax policies in collecting debts owed to the city by businesses that 
had contributed heavily to council political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 There have also been concerns over legalized gambling at the city's bingo 
parlor and planned card casino. Last year, for example, council members took 
the unusual step of creating a city gaming commission, then appointed 
themselves commissioners and gave themselves a raise, at a cost of $55,000 a 
year to taxpayers. Outrage over the action forced the council to quickly 
rescind the raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the fomentation are the clannish city's many political feuds. 
</P>
<P>
 When Moore finally succeeded in unseating James in 1989, for instance -- four 
years after the votes-for-Jesse-Jackson-albums imbroglio -- her victory 
comments were characteristically personal: "The people of Compton have had 
enough of Floyd James," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 James, meanwhile, blamed his loss on a feud with another member of the 
council, a man whose son had been ousted as the city's redevelopment director. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't support his son when the city manager fired him, so they mounted a 
force against me," James said.  
</P>
<P>
 Moore and Tucker were allies when they served together on the City Council. 
But when Moore ran for mayor last year -- a race she ultimately lost -- their 
allegiance was frayed because Tucker withdrew his support for Moore's campaign 
and endorsed his younger brother instead. 
</P>
<P>
 It is because of these factors -- the city's past brushes with scandal, the 
colorful personalities of the players, Compton's tradition of down-and-dirty 
campaigns -- that some local politicians have speculated that the federal 
probe, which sources familiar with the investigation say was launched more than 
two years, was spawned by political infighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore and Tucker are gearing up for election battles this year -- she for a 
state Assembly seat and he for reelection to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe this is the work of political enemies," said Councilwoman 
Yvonne Arceneaux, a longtime Tucker supporter, who noted that this is an 
election year. 
</P>
<P>
 Life went on in Compton on Friday. The Walter R. Tucker Foundation, an 
organization named after the congressman's father that works with poor 
children, kicked off a "steps against violence" conference. And at the Compton 
Ramada, an annual women's conference sponsored by the county Human Relations 
Commission probed issues such as workplace violence and conflict negotiation. 
But these things were lost in the swirl of events, dominated by controversy, 
the same way the city's low-slung landscape is dominated by the towering 
Compton criminal courts complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people are getting tired of it," ex-Councilman Filer said. "It hurts the 
average citizen to read about this. Too many good people have moved out." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every city has problems," said Councilman Ronald Green, who was appointed to 
the council nine months ago. "But other cities don't have the image Compton has 
because they're not portrayed the way Compton is." 
</P>
<P>
 Green complained about the recording artists who sing about Compton as if it 
were the cradle of gangsta rap, and the television cameras that seem to see 
only the graffiti and vacant lots. Where were the cameras, Green wondered, when 
a group of men banded together last autumn to clean up Compton Creek? 
</P>
<P>
 "When Compton was ranked No. 20 out of 778 cities in the nation as a place 
where business could come and prosper in, nobody came to me for a comment," he 
said. "There are small things that go on continuously, that most people don't 
hear about." 
</P>
<P>
 Filer disagreed with the notion that Compton's negative image, rather than 
actual misconduct, may have lured federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't get bad press if you aren't doing these things," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; POLICE 
UNION STANDS BY PLAN TO KEEP BILLBOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tit-for-tat between Mayor Richard Riordan and the Police Protective League 
continued Friday as union officials insisted that their controversial crime 
billboards will stay up and a top Riordan aide said the tactic was interfering 
with the contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would hope that the league would de-escalate this," said Bill McCarley, 
Riordan's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 At a negotiating session Friday morning, no offer was presented to the union 
-- a result of Riordan's decision on Thursday to back off on his salary 
increase proposal while the union continues with its pressure tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is childish, naive and incredibly flawed strategy," union Pesident Danny 
Staggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union said it will hold a meetings with officers in the coming weeks to 
determine whether to escalate the dispute by distributing a videotape that 
highlights the city's crime situation.

 Which player will ask for a uniform with the number 6.8?Ignoring trademark 
claims of the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes baseball team, the students at Cal State 
Northridge will vote on whether to change the nickname of their school to the 
Quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to put the issue on the ballot next month is one of the biggest 
would-be slaps at the San Bernardino County region since the days when it was a 
running gag on the Jack Benny radio show. Each week a mythical train conductor 
would cry out, "All aboard, for Anaheim, Azusa and KOOK-amonga." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what would happen if the school embraces the Quakes, Cucamonga baseball 
spokesman Greg Scharlach said: "Well, I guess that's why there are courts." 
</P>
<P>
 If Northridge adopts the Quake theme -- there's talk of renaming its arena the 
Epicenter -- it isn't certain how many recruits would be scared off. But 
certainly the school would reap publicity by joining that pantheon of offbeat 
symbols, including UC Santa Cruz (the Banana Slugs), UC Irvine (the Anteaters) 
and, of course, Scottsdale, Ariz., J.C. (the Fighting Artichokes).

 Look who's dissing L.A. now!It's one thing to be slammed by San Francisco or 
even Seattle. But we were a bit surprised to read about another western city 
lamenting the influx of defecting Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we really need . . . more traffic and pollution?" the Las Vegas 
Review-Journal griped. "Or people complaining that we don't have the culture 
and entertainment venues of Southern California? Becoming L.A. Jr. is not an 
attractive thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Pollution? More or less? We have a hunch that what Vegas really fears is a 
bunch of nonsmokers moving there from L.A. Sr. and disrupting one of the last 
oases for tobacco-lovers. 
</P>

<P>
 Speaking of Vegas-style entertainment: Now that we're boycotting Sin City, we 
were excited to see a pyramid rising in Long Beach (see photo). The Southland's 
own Luxor! Excitedly, we inquired where the slot machines and roulette wheels 
would be placed. Alas, someone told us it's going to be a sports arena for Cal 
State Long Beach. But will the place be strong enough to withstand the 
Northridge Quakes?

of interest, tomorrow has been canceled."

 That was fine with Heiberg, who was due to turn 40 that day, and still cites 
that sign as evidence that she's 39. miscelLAny:

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VENICE; FATHER SHOT TO 
DEATH WHILE DRIVING CHILDREN TO SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Venice man was shot and killed Friday morning as he drove his children to 
school, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anselmo Cruz, 30, was driving his car about 8 a.m. through an alley behind the 
Sunset Avenue apartment building where he lived when a gunman wearing a ski 
mask ran up to the vehicle and shot Cruz several times, police said.He died at 
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 In the car were Cruz's two daughters, ages 7 and 9, and a neighbor's 
7-year-old child, said Detective Cedric Wilder of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullet fragments struck the foot of the neighbor's child, who was treated at 
UCLA Medical Center and released. The other two children suffered cuts from 
broken glass and were treated at the scene by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilder said the children could not provide a detailed description of the 
gunman. Police are asking anyone with information to call detectives at (310) 
202-4506, or (310) 202-4501 after hours.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; OFFICER 
GETS MAXIMUM TERM IN ARMED ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles police officer, convicted of masterminding the armed robbery of 
a check-cashing outlet, was sentenced Friday to the harshest prison term 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In handing down the 5-year, 8-month sentence to Bobby Rydell Marshall, 36, 
Superior Court Judge Paul Gutman said anything less would send the wrong 
message to officers who have unblemished records and to children who admired 
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 To Marshall's family, which counts among its members three other current or 
former law enforcement officers, Gutman said: "It's tragic . . . it's sad there 
is now a stain on your family's name." 
</P>
<P>
 But relatives who attended the sentencing blasted authorities for bringing 
what they said were trumped-up charges against Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was railroaded because he spoke up about the corruption in the Los Angeles 
Police Department," said Annie Mae Johns, Marshall's aunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall contends that authorities wanted to discredit him because he gave 
information to the Christopher Commission -- which investigated misconduct in 
the LAPD after officers beat Rodney G. King -- and because he wrote a book that 
portrayed the department as being riddled with brutality and racism. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury convicted him of the 1992 robbery of an Anykind check-cashing outlet in 
Lawndale that netted $27,600. He was acquitted of conspiring to rob a second 
outlet. Two earlier juries had deadlocked.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; MAN WHO 
KILLED WIFE CONVICTED OF MANSLAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who claimed he had been psychologically emasculated by an abusive wife 
for 25 years escaped a murder conviction Friday when a jury instead found that 
he had acted in the heat of passion when he bludgeoned her to death. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Van Nuys Superior Court verdict, Moosa Hanoukai, 55, faces a maximum 
sentence of 12 years for voluntary manslaughter, compared to life in prison for 
murder, as prosecutors had sought. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider it a major victory," said lead defense attorney James E. Blatt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanoukai told the jury that he attacked his 45-year-old wife with a wrench 
after she wished death upon him and their child. Hanoukai said he hit his wife, 
Manijeh, dozens of times on March 29, 1993.

CHP OFFICERS WHO BEGAN KING PURSUIT TELL OF SEEING HIM BEATEN; TRIAL: ONE SAYS 
SIGHT OF BATON BLOWS AND TASER SHOTS 'OVERWHELMED' HER. JURY WILL DECIDE 
PAYMENT OF DAMAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two California Highway Patrol officers who initiated the high-speed 
pursuit that ended in the beating of Rodney G. King testified Friday that King 
was struck several times in the head by officers wielding metal batons with 
full-force "power strokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie Singer, who was riding with her husband and partner, Timothy Singer, 
testified in federal court that she saw King shot twice with a Taser stun gun 
and hit as many as six times by baton blows from police officers trying to 
subdue him in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was overwhelmed," said Singer, who added that she was told by Los Angeles 
Police Sgt. Stacey C. Koon not to enter the fray. "It was happening so fast it 
caught me off guard." 
</P>
<P>
 King screamed and moaned, she said, as he was struck repeatedly on the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer was restrained Friday, but during last year's federal criminal trial, 
she broke down in tears as she testified that she would never forget watching 
LAPD Officer Laurence M. Powell repeatedly strike King. 
</P>
<P>
 She said then that she considered giving him medical treatment at the scene 
but did not, out of fear that she would be heckled by the Los Angeles police 
officers who had beaten him. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell and Koon were convicted in that trial of violating King's civil rights 
and are serving 30-month prison sentences. Timothy E. Wind and Theodore J. 
Briseno were acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, King is seeking $9.2 million in damages. The city has accepted 
liability for the injuries King suffered, but it has offered to pay him $1.25 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury is to determine how much King should be awarded in compensatory 
damages. In the second phase of the trial, his lawyers are to argue that the 
individual defendants also should pay King punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer testified that King continued to ignore police commands to lie still on 
the ground after the police chase was over. She said it took several commands 
before he left his car. Then he waved at a helicopter and shook his buttocks at 
the officers, she said. He was ordered to the ground, but then he resisted 
handcuffing. When he rose to his feet and advanced upon Koon, she said, he was 
shot with the Taser. 
</P>

 "His face looked as if it had been electrified," she said. "Both sides were 
moving up and down, convulsing." 
</P>
<P>
 The second Taser shot knocked King down, but he continued to resist, keeping 
his hands in a "push-up" position. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Singer also testified that he saw King hit six times, and "all of the 
blows except one, that I can recall, struck him in the head." After one blow, 
the officer said he saw King's jaw "move to the left, appearing to displace."  
</P>
<P>
 Also on Friday, an expert witness brought in by the plaintiffs testified that 
King probably suffered permanent mental damage from the blows to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Dilworth Thomas Rogers, a neurosurgeon who examined King on Dec. 30, 
testified that the blows to King's head put him at increased risk of 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

HUNTINGTON PARK POLICE CHIEF EVALUATED AMID BIAS CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Huntington Park City Council is reviewing the performance of Police Chief 
Frank Sullivan amid allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination and 
favoritism within the Police Department, according to City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Although council members would not comment directly on the allegations, 
Sullivan's performance has been evaluated in at least two closed sessions, 
according to council agendas. Removing the chief is "an option in some (council 
members') minds," said Councilman Thomas Jackson, a supporter of Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you talk in closed session about a department head, the goal obviously is 
to talk about the job he's doing," Jackson said. "If he's not doing a good job, 
you fire him. I, and anyone close to the situation, think it's an absurdity 
that he would be removed. But I've seen stranger things happen."  
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the city settled an anti-Semitic harassment suit filed by 
Detective Alan Tavelman for $355,000. Tavelman, who said he was subjected to 
religious slurs and harassment during nine years on the force, named Sullivan 
in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 A female former officer has a wrongful termination suit pending against the 
chief and the city, and a second female officer has filed a sexual harassment 
complaint that asks for $95,000 and the termination of Sullivan and another 
officer, sources familiar with the cases said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan, a 27-year veteran of the department who has been chief for less than 
two years, would not comment on charges against him, but said that the council 
has asked him to present a plan April 4 addressing some concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council has said there appears to be some internal problems in the Police 
Department, and we have some concerns and I've said I will look at them," 
Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Memos written by factions within the Huntington Park Police Officers Assn. 
illuminate a deep division in the group over Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, according to one memo signed by two of the seven members of the 
association's board, the board agreed that the department needed an independent 
administrative audit to examine leadership problems, procedures for 
investigating discrimination and sexual harassment charges, and discipline and 
promotion practices. 
</P>
<P>
 A second memo signed by four other members of the board disputes the need for 
the audit and states that the board retains "overall respect and support" for 
Sullivan.

AFTER BRACING FOR WORST, SOUTHLAND ELUDES STORM'S WRATH; WEATHER: REPEATED 
WARNINGS OF MUDSLIDES HAD BEEN ISSUED BUT LITTLE DAMAGE WAS REPORTED. WEEKEND 
FORECAST CALLS FOR SUNNY SKIES.

 Leaving Southern California damp but largely undamaged, a powerful Alaskan 
storm departed for Arizona on Friday after dumping up to 1 1/3 inches of rain 
in the coastal valleys and more than a foot of snow at some resort areas in the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite repeated warnings from the National Weather Service about possible 
mudslides in areas stripped bare during last fall's destructive wildfires, most 
of the storm runoff was contained. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockslides did force temporary closure of Pacific Coast Highway and five 
canyon roads in the Malibu area, but the routes were reopened to residents 
Friday as Caltrans crews labored to clean up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain snarled traffic Thursday evening and apparently contributed to dozens 
of accidents on Los Angeles freeways and streets during the night. 
</P>
<P>
 In Van Nuys, a motorist apparently lost control of his car on a slippery 
roadway shortly after midnight Thursday and died when his vehicle struck a 
wall, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Luna, 26, was driving eastbound on Saticoy Street when he may have 
failed to notice that the street veers to the right as it approaches Van Nuys 
Airport, Sgt. Rod Grahek said.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said that when Luna tried to stop, his car skidded on the wet 
pavement, glanced off a sign, vaulted over a guide wire and slammed into the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before 11 a.m. Friday, the Coast Guard called off a search west of 
Santa Catalina Island for the source of an apparent distress signal first 
picked up about 9 a.m. Thursday as the storm system began moving into Southern 
California, generating heavy seas along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The signal, which seemed to be from the type of emergency radio signaling 
device carried by many small boats, faded out about two hours after it was 
first heard, Coast Guard Petty Officer Trent Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 An airborne search team spotted a light on what appeared to be a raft in the 
same general area late Thursday night, but another sweep at dawn Friday turned 
up nothing, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although forecasters had predicted that the storm would hang around much 
longer, most of the rain fell in heavy thundershowers Thursday night, with only 
a few light sprinkles reported in most areas on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 By nightfall Friday, the forecast was for clearing skies with plenty of sun 
today and Sunday, and high temperatures climbing into the mid-70s. 
</P>
<P>
 The high temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center on Friday was 62 degrees, 
after an overnight low of 48. As of 5 p.m., the Downtown rainfall total from 
the storm was .77 of an inch. The season's rainfall total was 7 inches, 
compared to a normal total of 13.13 inches.

CENTRAL LIBRARY OFFERS ITSELF AS A HIGH-TECH MAGNET SCHOOL; EDUCATION: PANEL 
PROPOSES THAT STUDENTS INTERESTED IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PLUG INTO THE 
'INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY' BY USING THE FACILITY'S VAST COMPUTER RESOURCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The refurbished Los Angeles Central Library could be host to the city's first 
"information superhighway" magnet high school next fall if Los Angeles school 
board members sign off on the recommendation made by the city Library 
Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the commission's proposal, made last week, students would use the 
library's vast computer resources to prepare for careers including 
telecommunications and database management. Students would take some classes at 
the Downtown Business Magnet School nearby, but would spend much of each day at 
the Central Library, using library computer labs and meeting rooms as 
classrooms and working with its vast 2.2-million volume collection. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be the first time the school district has based a campus at a city 
facility. Library commissioners hope that it would serve as a model for getting 
more use out of public resources at little cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Students would be linked to the Internet electronic network and assisted by 
students from UCLA's Graduate School of Education and Information Studies. City 
librarians would also help develop curriculum and help students do research.  
</P>
<P>
 Downtown businesses, including Arco, Arthur Andersen and First Interstate Bank 
have expressed interest in taking on students as interns in their information 
management sections, according to library commissioner Roberta Weintraub, a 
former school board member. The kinds of skills students learn could be useful 
in fields such as law, finance and entertainment, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It gets them into an adult atmosphere, which is very important," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Battaglia, who is in charge of developing magnet schools for the Los 
Angeles Unified School District, said parents who work Downtown might want to 
enroll their children so they can commute together. "(The library) is a safe, 
clean, wonderful environment" that appeals to adults and students, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Battaglia said the use of the showcase library would be a boon to the school 
district because it would not have to pay for new classrooms or computers for 
the magnet school. In its first year, the school would accommodate 60 
ninth-graders and 60 10th-graders, with more students added each year, he said.

GAINING INSIGHT INTO PASSOVER; CELEBRATIONS: MODEL SEDER AT HISTORIC WILSHIRE 
BOULEVARD TEMPLE TEACHES CATHOLIC STUDENTS THE JEWISH FAITH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So what was a nice Catholic boy like 15-year-old Eddie Fernandez doing at 
Wilshire Boulevard Temple? 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of fact, what were more than 1,500 Catholic elementary and high 
school students doing at the historic synagogue earlier this week? 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Rabbi Harvey J. Fields. Catholic youths such as Eddie have been coming to 
the temple every year about this time for the last 14 years to learn about the 
Jewish holiday of Passover -- and have a little fun in the process by sharing 
in a model Seder, or ceremonial family meal. Passover begins at sundown 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the opportunity of crossing over from their own tradition to 
another tradition and returning to their tradition enriched with new 
understanding that illuminates their own," Fields said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also a demonstration of the strides made in relations between Roman 
Catholics and Jews after centuries of Christian anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
 Gathering Catholic youths inside the historic synagogue -- a national landmark 
with an eight-story dome and heroic murals depicting the history of Judaism -- 
was an opportunity to dispel myths about Jews found among some Catholics, 
according to Father Vivian Ben Lima, director of the Office of Ecumenical and 
Interreligious Affairs for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you entered this sanctuary building, you felt like you were in a 
church," Lima told the students, who came from 29 Catholic elementary and high 
schools, before the Seder began. "I'd like to tell you that you are in a house 
of God. This is a place of worship and a place of prayer for our Jewish 
brothers and sisters." 
</P>
<P>
 The model Seder at Wilshire Boulevard Temple is one example of a larger 
movement toward reconciliation between Catholics and Jews worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, for example, the Vatican and Israel signed an accord that will 
lead to the exchange of ambassadors this year and full diplomatic recognition 
of Israel by the Roman Catholic Church. There have also been Catholic 
statements of repentance for anti-Semitism and a declaration that Jews "still 
remain most dear to God." In 1965, the Catholic Church officially absolved Jews 
of blame for the Crucifixion of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout this time, religious leaders in Los Angeles have been in the 
forefront of interfaith dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The model Seder program was inaugurated 14 years ago by Rabbi Emeritus Alfred 
Wolf and the Rev. Msgr. Royale Vadakin of the archdiocese. Since then, it has 
been adopted by synagogues throughout the United States, Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic youths participating in the model Seder were able to share in the 
rites and symbols commemorating the liberation of Jews from slavery in ancient 
Egypt.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time for me. It's quite an experience," said Fernandez, a 
freshman at Our Lady Queen of Angels High School seminary in Mission Hills. 
"It's something I don't see in my religion as a Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
 He and the other youths learned about the parts of the Seder, including the 
wine and an unleavened bread called matzo that reminds participants of the 
haste in which Jews left Egypt. Green herbs known as carpas are tokens of 
gratitude to God for the gifts of the earth. They are dipped in saltwater as a 
symbol of the miracle recounted in the book of Exodus in which the Jews crossed 
over the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also charoset , a mixture of finely chopped apples, nuts or almonds 
and raisins. Because of its appearance, it came to be regarded as representing 
the clay with which the Israelites made bricks or the mortar used in great 
buildings erected by the Jewish slaves in Egypt. There also is a bitter herb 
known as maror , representing the bitter life of slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 Also explained at the model Seder were the ritual of dropping one drop of wine 
for each of the 10 plagues visited upon Pharaoh by God for refusing to free the 
Israelites, and the Cup of Elijah symbolizing the expectation of his return. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity to look back into history and come forward and ask 
ourselves the question: How can this great moment of Jewish history be of 
significance to us here today?" Fields told the students. 
</P>
<P>
 He said they may also come to a deeper understanding of the Christian 
Eucharist and Christianity's roots in Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Seder) obviously has incredible parallels to the Lord's Supper (or 
Eucharist) for Christian kids," Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ritually speaking, it is a real learning experience, and an engagement of 
real values of Judaism and Christianity -- the sanctity of individual reverence 
for life and of the Spring and renewal, not only of the Earth but of 
ourselves," he added. "This is reflected in Passover and, in a way, in the 
deepest sense of Easter."  
</P>
<P>
 It was also an opportunity to dispel myths about Jews found among some 
Catholics, according to Lima. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Catholics, he said, incorrectly believe that the Passover Seder is 
incomplete without the Christian Eucharist. "I want to dispel that completely," 
the priest said. "It is an authentic, complete and wonderfully profound worship 
of God who involves himself in history." Lima noted that Pope John Paul II has 
said that "all of us are spiritual Semites." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the wild shoot grafted onto the olive tree (of Judaism)," he said. 
"This means the old tree still exists and the life-giving sap gives life to the 
wild shoot (Christianity)." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Lima reminded students, anti-Semitism has been defined as a sin by 
the Catholic Church.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the spiritual common denominators, there was no mistaking the great 
divide that separates Jews and Christians -- the nature of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 That overarching distinction was apparent when a young Catholic boy approached 
a microphone after the Seder during a question-and-answer session. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you believe in Jesus as being the Savior?" the boy asked the rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields smiled and deferred to his associate, Rabbi Steven Z. Leder. 
</P>
<P>
 Jews, said Leder, view Jesus as "a great and wise teacher," but not as the son 
of God. "I know this maybe is very difficult thing to understand," Leder told 
the boy. Nonetheless, he said, Jews respect the Christian belief that Jesus is 
the Messiah. 
</P>
<P>
 As the model Seder came to an end, Fields looked out across the faces of the 
assembled students and said, "Happy Easter." Moments later, Father Lima was at 
the podium wishing his Jewish hosts "a wonderful and holy Passover." 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that can save us," Fields said earlier, "is our sense of hope 
and decency -- and our own relationship with God."

LATINO, BLACK STUDENTS TO TRY LIFE ON ISRAELI KIBBUTZ; TRAVEL: TEN SENIORS FROM 
ROOSEVELT AND CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOLS ARE BEING SPONSORED BY NONPROFIT GROUP 
OPERATION UNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jesse Solano admits that when his probation officer suggested that he join a 
group of inner-city teen-agers who were planning to live on a kibbutz in Israel 
for two months, he was less than thrilled with the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was crazy," said the 18-year-old Roosevelt High senior, who 
spent time in juvenile camp for car theft and has been involved in gangs. "I 
figured since I was getting in trouble, he wanted to get rid of me. But now . . 
. I think this is cool. It'll be good to go somewhere else, learn about another 
culture. I'm looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Solano is one of 10 seniors -- five Latinos and five African Americans -- 
chosen from Roosevelt and Crenshaw high schools by the nonprofit group 
Operation Unity to make the trip to Israel and experience life as kibbutzniks 
-- residents of a communal village who share work and daily duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the shocking Feb. 25 massacre of 48 Muslims by a Jewish extremist in 
Hebron, students say they are looking forward to going, some even more so in 
the wake of the tragedy that triggered street riots and dramatically increased 
age-old tensions between Palestinians and Jews in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on a peace mission," said Christian Tavarez, 17, a Roosevelt student 
whose rapid speech reflected a characteristic intensity. "The murdering was an 
isolated incident. We've all been through tension here in L.A. We go through it 
every day. None of us are scared to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Students plan to leave April 4, despite the fact that Operation Unity Director 
Cookie Lommel says they are short $15,000. After the massacre, two donors who 
had agreed to help sponsor the trip withdrew their support. But Lommel, an 
African American journalist who fell in love in Israel on a visit two years 
ago, is determined to find additional funding to make up the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Lommel enlisted the aid of Los Angeles Councilman Richard Alatorre and Reps. 
Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles) and Howard Berman (D-Panorama City). 
</P>
<P>
 "They're definitely going," said Alatorre, who is optimistic about getting the 
money. "This is too important. The riots have already taught us that isolation 
and segregation, not knowing each other, creates problems. This trip will teach 
youngsters about another culture while also helping them to see the proud 
traditions of their own." 
</P>
<P>
 Lommel's inspiration for the kibbutz program began with her journey to Israel 
in 1991, when she decided to see for herself the relationship that had 
reportedly blossomed between Ethiopian Jews and the Israelis who had welcomed 
them. She returned to the United States impressed with what she saw. 
</P>
<P>
 She was further impressed when she saw a screening of "Black to the Promised 
Land," a documentary that charted the experiences of African American students 
from a tough New York High school sent to live on a kibbutz for three months. 
After dragging their feet in the beginning, the students became so attached to 
their Israeli hosts they didn't want to leave, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what really sparked me," Lommel said. "After seeing how Ethiopians and 
Israelis interacted in Israel, I started thinking to myself, 'What about 
African Americans and Jews here?' I became totally fascinated with the idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she started Operation Unity to address black-Jewish relations, Lommel 
said she opened up the kibbutz group to Latinos to broaden their cultural 
outlook.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of Latinos know practically nothing about Jewish life, and it's a 
history they can benefit from learning about," she said. "Just as minority 
groups who have endured oppression, blacks, Latinos and Jews have a lot in 
common."  
</P>
<P>
 Lommel contacted Mike Miller, a Los Angeles native who works as an emissary 
for an Israeli-based organization. Miller, 44, agreed to accommodate the 
students on his kibbutz, Beit Zera, located a mile from the Sea of Galilee. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program is very positive in that it addresses the misunderstandings and 
promotes better communication," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students will have to adjust to more than just cultural differences. They will 
be expected to rise at 6 a.m. daily to begin six-hour workdays in plastic 
factories, fruit orchards, kitchens and dining rooms, day-care centers and 
other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Wolfson, a Roosevelt counselor and history teacher, will supervise the 
students in their schoolwork, which they must continue to receive academic 
credits.  
</P>
<P>
 Rochelle Brown, 18, says she is going for something much more than a good 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be going on an archeological dig, unearthing a town. It's so 
interesting to learn about past cultures and civilizations," said the 
18-year-old Crenshaw student, who became interested in the Middle East during a 
class research assignment on the Dead Sea Scrolls. "Yeah, my parents had second 
thoughts about me going. But you can't prejudge a place based on things you've 
heard. You have to go with an open mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky de la Paz, also 18 and a fellow Crenshaw student, agreed. "I've always 
wanted to see different places, especially the place where Jesus was born," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But what do the students think about missing such monumental school events as 
the senior prom? 
</P>
<P>
 Tavarez shrugged. "It's no big deal," he said. "You can't compare a 
once-in-a-lifetime experience to a dance."

FACTS ON LIFE OF JESUS ARE ELUSIVE, BUT DEBATE REMAINS USEFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article on the Jesus Seminar ("Claims About 2 'Unofficial' Gospels Stir 
Controversy," Feb. 26) certainly elicited some virulent responses. As a 
professional archeologist specializing in the ancient Near East and especially 
Israel for almost 30 years, I would like to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 We can never know what actually happened. We have data from the Gospels, which 
do not always agree. We have other documents which were not accepted into the 
canon and were eliminated when the founders of Christianity were putting the 
New Testament together. Scholars have been studying these other sources for 
many years and they teach us much about the life and times of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 No archeological find has as yet proven any event in the life of Jesus, or for 
that matter Moses, or David, as much as we would like it. Archeology does, 
however, "put clothes" on them by showing us the material context of their 
lives, the events described in the Scriptures. It also enables us, sometimes, 
to connect events in the Bible with something happening elsewhere, so that we 
can put it into a particular time frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are people so afraid of having their views challenged? They would do 
better to use the opportunity to study their own view and either change them or 
reinforce them. These are exciting times for the study of biblical history, and 
we should be taking advantage of opportunities to put science and scholarship 
to work to our benefit.

 Re "Church of England to Ordain Women," March 12: 
</P>
<P>
 The response of the Roman Catholic Church to the recent ordination of 32 women 
by the Church of England was, sadly, predictable. With its feet firmly 
implanted in its own traditional stance against the ordination of women, the 
Catholic Church saw this action on the part of the Church of England as a new 
barrier toward an eventual reunion of the two Churches. 
</P>
<P>
 If the future of ecumenical dialogue is to be placed in grave peril due to the 
gender of the presbyters, then one may deduce that its future is grim. Rather 
than focusing on gender issues, ecumenical dialogue must focus on the religious 
denomination's ability to aid the individual in becoming truly human, as Jesus 
was truly human and its ability to build up, not tear down the Kingdom of God 
in our midst. The Roman Catholic Church must shift its focus to the major 
doctrinal similarities between itself and the Anglican community rather than 
the customs that still, shamefully, separate us.

SUPPORT FOR 'CHILDISH' COMPREHENSION OF GOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Childhood Image of God Prevails Among Adults, Authors Say" (March 5) laments 
the lack of religious growth from childhood to adulthood by most of the public. 
A few examples of childish comprehension of God are given, and are then 
followed by "smart ways to think of God."These "smart ways" include the belief 
that God is very smart, God has limitation in the extent that he can make our 
lives perfect, God says that we are immortal and other similar remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Try as I might, I do not find the "smart ways" superior to the childish ways. 
Both approaches use the anthropomorphic approach in discussing God in the same 
manner that children think of Superman. The only approach in describing God 
that can be acceptable to mature minds is when God is described on the 
supernatural level, possessing no human attributes. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach removes the human quality from God, bestows it upon a human 
being where it belongs, and at the same time elevates the quality to a Godly 
level. Thus anthropomorphism is eliminated and replaced by the supernatural.

NATIONAL CONFERENCE DEFINES ITS MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I saw the article on the results of our national survey "Poll of 
Minorities Finds Bias, Anger Toward Whites" in the Religion section (March 5) 
that depicted us an "ecumenical" organization, I thought maybe there was some 
confusion at the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 This confusion exists elsewhere as well.It was not the primary reason we 
truncated our name from "The National Conference of Christians and Jews" to 
"The National Conference," but it was one of the reasons. The former name must 
sound like a religious organization. 
</P>
<P>
 To quote our mission statement: "The National Conference of Christians and 
Jews, founded in 1927, is a human relations organization dedicated to fighting 
bias, bigotry and racism in America. The National Conference promotes 
understanding and respect among all races, religions and cultures through 
advocacy, conflict resolution and education." 
</P>
<P>
 Stated differently, the purpose of this organization is to honestly deal with 
any individual or group which is or feels estranged or hostile toward another 
group for whatever reason. The subjects with which we deal include all the 
"isms" which have kept us apart and consequently shortchange the potential of 
the whole. Our programs bring all races, genders, ethnic and religious groups 
together for honest and, at times, painful dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Our work does include, therefore, bringing members of different religious 
groups together for understanding and dialogue. The other programs are oriented 
toward youth (the majority of our work), the criminal justice system -- 
including the police and sheriff's departments, and other organizations -- both 
for-profit and not-for-profit.

INSURANCE WOES MAY HAVE A GOOD SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: "Insurers Adopting Hard-line Stance on Sex Abuse Coverage," March 19: 
</P>
<P>
 I am glad that insurance companies are now beginning to take a hard-line 
stance on clergy sex abuse coverage. It will force churches to change the way 
they deal with this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 If churches cannot get insurance to cover sexual abuse by their clergy, they 
will finally be forced to take a good hard look at just whom they are ordaining 
and make some much needed changes in their recruitment and screening processes. 
Clergy who molest children will increasingly be convicted and sent to prison 
rather than moved to new, unsuspecting parishes or sent to ineffective 
treatment centers. Also, it will be next to impossible for these men to get 
back into active ministry once they are released from prison because as 
convicted sex offenders, they will be such liabilities that no parish would 
take them.  
</P>
<P>
 If churches had dealt with this problem in a concerned, moral way to begin 
with, they wouldn't be in this mess today. Doesn't the Book of Job say 
something like, "Those who sow trouble reap the same"?

THE SUPERFLUOUS PEOPLE TEST; MOCA EXHIBIT RAISES AN EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE 
QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gaudily upholstered sofas on a public plaza. What do they mean? "Modern art," 
smiles a portly visitor to the Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown Los 
Angeles. "Comfortable, though," he adds, settling in. "I mean, considering." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering what? Considering, perhaps, the increasingly defensive character 
of public accommodation in the United States. In New York's Port Authority Bus 
Terminal, the benches in the lower-level waiting area have been replaced by 
cunning appliances designed to discourage sitting and altogether prevent 
reclining. Homeless New Yorkers have taken the point and gone elsewhere. 
Nationwide, the homeless have long since been barred from the larger, more 
obvious public spaces. Increasingly they are also denied the use of hitherto 
unnoticed corners of public land like freeway islands and under bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 The haggard wanderers who seem to appear in any unprotected public space are 
frightening less because they are threatening (they rarely are) than because 
they are a warning. "Where are we going to put these people?" is the visible, 
tangible form of a much broader, grimmer question: What, in the emerging world 
economy, are we going to do not just with "these people," the desperate 
homeless, but with all the people whom a high-productivity, high-efficiency 
economy no longer needs? 
</P>
<P>
 With or without Bill Clinton, the end of welfare as we know it may be in view. 
But so may be the end of the job as we know it. Midway in an open-throttle 
economic recovery, the United States eliminated 108,946 jobs in January, an 
all-time one-month record. In 1993, 615,000 jobs were eliminated, also a 
record, and that number is expected to go up again this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Franz West, the Austrian artist who set up the sofas outside MOCA's front 
door, calls his assemblage "Test." Just what test does he have in mind? Perhaps 
one we might call the superfluous people test. Will the nation that won the 
Cold War pass the superfluous people test? A sofa on a public plaza makes a 
comfortable place to face an extremely uncomfortable question.

DID THE STATE TELL US EVERYTHING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did the California Department of Health Services deliberately falsify -- or 
shield -- information in its licensing of a low-level radioactive waste dump at 
Ward Valley?  
</P>
<P>
 This is the question raised by the department's delivery of 144 pages of 
documentation "inadvertently omitted" from a copy of the administrative record 
released in connection with a legal challenge to the licensing. 
</P>
<P>
 The characterization of the mix of radioactive waste anticipated at the dump 
is dramatically different in the newly released pages from what was seen in the 
official environmental reports on the basis of which U.S. Ecology, a private 
firm, was licensed to operate the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, in particular, a vast discrepancy concerning the amount of 
radioactivity expected to come in the form of tritium, a relatively short-lived 
radioactive isotope used in medical research, and the amount expected to come 
in the form of longer-lived isotopes from nuclear power plants. The official 
reports appear to understate the amount of one extremely hazardous isotope, 
plutonium-239, by a remarkable factor of 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Health Services contends that it cannot be said to have 
mischaracterized the waste stream if the full record is taken into account. But 
the new information is undeniably disturbing, and Sen. Barbara Boxer has called 
on Gov. Pete Wilson to cancel the license in light of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club has gone a large step further, calling on Wilson to appoint a 
special prosecutor to investigate possible criminal activity; specifically, 
whether the Department of Health Services withheld or misrepresented 
information at the request of U.S. Ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 These are serious allegations. Without joining either Boxer or the Sierra Club 
in their specific recommendations, The Times endorses the interim action of 
California Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer in postponing, until this 
disquieting matter can be resolved, the confirmation of Russell Gould as state 
budget director. Gould headed the Department of Health Services during the key 
closing period of the Ward Valley licensing. 
</P>
<P>
 "(This) is a serious charge and ought to be resolved before we act on Gould's 
confirmation," Lockyer said. Gould may well prove to be an excellent budget 
director, but the people need answers to this mystery.

<P>
 It's a challenge for a church or religious group to dramatize the Easter story 
with artful music and staging, plus costumes that don't look like rummage sale 
bathrobes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Robert Schuller's Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove has been able to 
pull it off for years in its "Glory of Easter" production. The musical 
presentation is good enough to be offered on pay-per-view cable television 
systems, including the Van Nuys-based United Artists Cable with five Easter 
weekend showings. 
</P>
<P>
 Two newer productions in the Los Angeles area are trying. 
</P>
<P>
 The third annual "Passion Play" of Shepherd of the Hills Church in Porter 
Ranch, working with a $38,550 budget and the donated time of professionals, 
opened Friday night with the first of five presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Roger Hall, who recently landed a lead role in a science fiction movie, 
plays Jesus, and the play's director, the Rev. Patrick Moody, once an associate 
of actor Burt Reynolds, portrays the disciple Peter. Gail Bonine is Mary, 
Jesus' mother, and Jeff Tolar plays Judas. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-minute production, with a cast of nearly 90 people, continues with 
shows at 8 p.m. today, 3 p.m. Sunday, 8 p.m. Friday and 3 p.m. next Saturday. 
Tickets are $10 and $5, but are free for all elementary school students tonight 
and Sunday. Call (818) 831-9333 for information and ticket orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Another musical stage production, "The Third Day According to Peter," will 
begin a four-performance run in Hollywood on Thursday. The contemporary musical 
is by Tom Fenholt, who plays Peter, and is an effort of American Musical 
Ministries, based in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus is played by Jim Wootten, Mary Magdalene by Julie Prejean and Thomas by 
John Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical will play at 8 p.m. Thursday, Friday and next Saturday and at 3 
p.m. Easter Sunday at the Complex Theatre, 6478 Santa Monica Blvd. Admission is 
free but an offering will be taken. Valet parking is available. Call Theatrix 
(213) 466-1767 to reserve seats. PASSOVER 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-day Passover period, sometimes described as "the quintessential 
Jewish home celebration," begins tonight with Seders, or ritual meals, 
recounting the biblical story of the exodus of Jews from Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles made efforts to find 
homes where hosts would welcome recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union 
and Iran as well as people displaced by the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Second- and third-night Seders will be held Sunday and Monday at synagogues 
and other Jewish worship centers. "Chabad centers throughout the Southland will 
host public Seders on March 27 and 28," said Rabbi Shimon Raichik of Chabad of 
Hancock Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, however, advance registration was required. The Long Beach 
Jewish Community Center will host two Seders Sunday evening -- one for senior 
citizens and another for Russian families. A third Seder next Saturday is 
primarily for Jewish gays and lesbians and their families. Call (310) 426-7601 
for information. PALM SUNDAY 
</P>
<P>
 Palm Sunday, also known as Passion Sunday, will be observed by many churches 
with special music to usher in the week leading up to Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pasadena's Holliston United Methodist Church will open its Palm Sunday 
worship service at 10 a.m. with children bearing palm branches and singing 
ex-Beatle George Harrison's "My Sweet Lord," but leaving out the part where the 
Hare Krishna chant replaces the refrains of "Hallelujah" in the song. During 
the service, Johann Sebastian Bach's "O Sacred Head" will be performed by the 
Wight Boy's Band and the Chancel Choir. Holliston is at 1305 E. Colorado Blvd., 
(818) 793-0685. 
</P>
<P>
 * At the Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes, the 11 a.m. service will 
feature a portrayal of Jesus and his disciples having their last meal together. 
Those who attend the service will be served Communion as a part of the 
production. The chapel, an ecumenical ministry of the small Swedenborgian 
Church, will be open daily during the week for meditation and prayer. For 
information, call (310) 377-1650. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Orange County, the "Requiem" by Gabriel Faure will be performed by the 
choir, strings and organ at Mission Viejo's Shepherd of the Hills United 
Methodist Church, 26001 Muirlands Blvd., at the 8:30 a.m. and 10:15 a.m. 
services. At 7 p.m. Sunday in Newport Beach, John Rutter's "Requiem" will be 
performed at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, 600 St. Andrews Road, as part of 
a larger concert by choir and orchestra. GOOD FRIDAY 
</P>
<P>
 * John G. Ouellet, recently named president of the Weingart Foundation, will 
address the 36th annual YMCA Good Friday Breakfast at the Westin Bonaventure in 
Downtown Los Angeles. More than 800 people are expected to attend the 8 a.m. 
event. Mayor Richard Riordan will offer the invocation and the Rev. Lloyd J. 
Ogilvie of Hollywood Presbyterian Church will read the Gospel stories of the 
Crucifixion and Resurrection. Ouellet joined the charitable foundation in 
February after 31 years with the YMCA. Breakfast tickets are $14. Call (213) 
351-2224. 
</P>
<P>
 * Good Friday is also a traditional day of fasting for Christians. 
Participants in a "Walkathon Against Violence" next Saturday, sponsored 
principally by the large West Angeles Church of God in Christ, are urged to 
fast the day before from sunrise to 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastor, Bishop Charles Blake, said the walk will begin at 10:30 a.m. at 
First Church of God, 9550 Crenshaw Blvd., and proceed to West Angeles Church, 
3045 Crenshaw Blvd., where an hourlong worship service will be held. 
Refreshments will be served along the route of the walk, which will include 
participants from dozens of urban churches. To join the observance, call Calvin 
Brown at (213) 733-8300, Ext. 213. 
</P>
<P>
 * Three minister-students from the School of Theology at Claremont will join a 
roster of Los Angeles inner-city pastors for an interdenominational noon 
service on Good Friday at Zion Hill Baptist Church, 7860 10th Ave. Preaching on 
the words attributed to Jesus on the cross in the New Testament Gospels will be 
the Rev. Orlando Love of Zion Hill Baptist and six other ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among other special Good Friday services are "Mother of Sorrows," an 8 p.m. 
performance of poetry, dance and visual art by Jennifer Alexander set to music 
for the Pasadena Mennonite Church, which meets at the Church of the Brethren, 
1041 N. Altadena Drive.  
</P>
<P>
 More traditional works on Good Friday are Part II of George Frederich Handel's 
oratorio "Messiah," with choir and orchestra, at 7:30 p.m. at Holman United 
Methodist Church, 3320 W. Adams Blvd., Los Angeles, and a performance of "Let 
All Heaven Rejoice," by David Clydesdale, by choir and orchestra at 8 p.m. in 
the sanctuary of Culver-Palms United Methodist Church, 4464 Sepulveda Blvd., 
Culver City. The suggested donation at the latter concert is $10 for adults and 
$7 for students. NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 * Auxiliary Bishop Stephen Blaire of the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese will 
be the principal celebrant at 3 p.m. Sunday in a recently completed chapel in 
West Hollywood dedicated to those who have died of AIDS. The Mass will be 
celebrated in a chapel at St. Victor's Catholic Church, 8634 Holloway Drive. 
For information, call (310) 652-6477. 
</P>
<P>
 * The head of the Drikung Kagyu order of Tibetan Buddhism, Drikung Kyabgon 
Chetsang Rimpoche, will begin a U.S. visit with two weeks of ceremonies and 
teachings in Monterey Park, starting with an empowerment rite April 5. For

LAUGHTER IN THE PEWS; HUMOR: A NEW GENERATION OF CLERGY SEEKS TO RECAPTURE THE 
JOYFUL WORLD OF THE EARLY CHRISTIANS BY ADDING JOKES TO SERMONS AND CARTOONS TO 
RELIGIOUS BULLETINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly a decade ago, when Lutheran comic Merrilyn Belgum performed at a 
nursing home chapel, the altar was stripped of religious symbols. The unspoken 
message: "Now, we're going to have some fun and humor, but it has nothing to do 
with the church." 
</P>
<P>
 But today, when the "Queen Mother of Comedy" arrives with her trademark 
feathered boas, sequined dresses and oversize glasses, no one removes the cross 
and other trappings of faith. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, laughter is welcome on the pulpit and in the pews. Belgum is part of 
a new generation of clergy, theologians and, yes, comics, who seek converts to 
a faith that celebrates rather than endures life. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mission: to recapture what they envision as the joyful world of the 
early Christians, a world in which the resurrection was a living memory and 
centuries of church tradition had not relegated its celebration to one Sunday a 
year -- Easter -- and funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, there are a number of signs that serious Christians no longer worry 
-- as H.L. Mencken once wrote of Puritans -- that someone, somewhere, is having 
a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 Jokes and cartoons have become common in religious bulletins, and an 
increasing number of clergy loosen up their congregations with funny stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you disperse a threatening crowd?" asks the Joyful Noiseletter. "Take 
up a collection." And according to the Parish Chute, "Anybody who has ever used 
the expression, 'It was no Sunday school picnic' has obviously never been to a 
Sunday school picnic." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fellowship of Merry Christians, founded in 1986 with 250 members, now has 
10,000. And another new group, the Assn. of Battered Clergy, finds healing in 
humor for the pressures most ministers face daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement to a more celebratory faith focusing on joy and fueled by humor 
is not based solely on theological grounds. Fear of losing generations of baby 
boomers and baby busters who find the church boring -- along with research into 
the physical and mental benefits of laughter -- are also persuading religious 
leaders to lighten up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came from an almost puritanical type of attitude: If it's fun, it must be 
wrong," said George Goldtrap of Madison, Tenn., who left full-time ministry in 
the Churches of Christ to be a professional speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come almost 180 degrees," Goldtrap said, "to the point where a positive 
mental attitude and a positive, happy demeanor is critical to one's spiritual 
welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 "A cheerful heart is a good medicine, but a downcast spirit dries up the 
bones," says Proverbs 17:22. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gospel of John, Jesus tells his disciples not to let his death 
overshadow his resurrection: "So you sorrow now, but I will see you again and 
your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you." 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars say the earliest Christians, for whom Christ's death and resurrection 
were a recent memory, heeded that advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Those Christians would not have recognized all the fuss over Easter. For them, 
every Sunday was Easter in terms of celebrating their belief that Jesus rose 
from the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until the 4th Century, when Christians who once risked death to 
profess their faith suddenly were given social cachet by the Roman Emperor 
Constantine the Great, that the first Easter Christians began to show up in 
churches. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time of Gregory the Great early in the 7th Century, the focus of 
services shifted from celebrating the resurrection to commemorating Jesus' 
suffering on the cross, said Catherine Gonzalez, a professor of church history 
at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at hundreds of years of religious art and you'll find plenty of 
depictions of the passion and crucifixion of Jesus -- but few post-resurrection 
portrayals or even joyful scenes from his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Messiah whose message was "be of good cheer" is often depicted as "a 
tormented depressive," according to Cal Samra, editor of the Joyful 
Noiseletter. 
</P>
<P>
 In America, the Puritans and their descendants not only eschewed humor, but 
stripped churches of even the slightest ornamentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, many say that one of the great paradoxes of American Christianity 
is how a religion that proclaims joy, peace and everlasting life turned out to 
be so somber. 
</P>
<P>
 People will intone the Eucharistic prayer celebrating the most hopeful belief 
of their faith -- Christ is risen, Christ will come again -- then solemnly file 
up to receive the Host. 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost as if they believe a somber expression is necessary "to make it 
count," said the Rev. Paul Lintern, a Lutheran humorist from Mansfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Lintern is among a growing number of religious people who are teaching 
churchgoers how to play as well as pray together, in a variety of forums, from 
daylong "playshops" sponsored by the Fellowship of Merry Christians to social 
events for promoting fellowship. He started a "Saturday Night Alive" program at 
his old church in Doylestown, Ohio, in which prayer, skits, songs and David 
Letterman-like Top 10 lists are offered to an audience containing some who feel 
alienated from the church. Some of the Top 10 pickup lines at a Christian 
singles church: "What's a charismatic like you doing in a place like this?" and 
"Don't worry, I'm attracted to you purely in a spiritual way." 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Mary Christelle McAluso, a popular speaker known as "The Fun Nun" (not 
an oxymoron, she insists), contends that those who are unfamiliar with 
Christian services would never guess such activities were celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "To picture religion as such a somber, dry and heavy thing," she said, "it's 
pitiful." 
</P>
<P>
 McAluso earlier this month inducted 4,000 people into the so-called Order of 
the Fun Nun at a national conference of religious educators in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Their initiation was to recite "Mary Had a Little Lamb" with their right index 
fingers on the nose of the person to their right and their left index fingers 
on the nose of the person on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 In McAluso's theological world view, God is unfathomable love. When she helps 
another person feel better, she says, she receives a joy beyond human 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't matter if it's 60 people at a small church or 4,000 people at the 
national conference in Orange County, says McAluso, a Sister of Mercy at the 
College of St. Mary in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I've been able to make one other human being smile," she says, "my life on 
this Earth has been well-rewarded."

HOW BEST TO HONOR COLOSIO'S MEMORY; LET TRAGEDY LEAD TO MEXICAN POLITICAL 
REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can some good come of a tragedy? While utterly lamentable, the assassination 
of Mexico's leading presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, also offers 
that nation's most potent political force, the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party (PRI), an opportunity. PRI leaders, especially Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari, would honor their slain standard-bearer if they seized it. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio was respected as a capable public official, but the way he got the PRI 
nomination was controversial. He was handpicked by Salinas under an old 
political tradition that Mexicans refer to as el Dedazo, which means to be 
touched by a very large finger. The term refers to Mexican presidents 
personally selecting their successors, a practice that dates from the PRI's 
founding in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dedazo has been tantamount to being elected as Mexico's president: The PRI 
is the best-organized political party in Mexico, and the many government 
officials who are PRI members, including the sitting president, did not 
hesitate to use their power to help Colosio's campaign. That is why Colosio was 
conceded to be the front runner in the campaign for the Aug. 21 election. But 
it was a grudging concession among the many Mexicans who believe their nation 
is too modern and sophisticated to be burdened with hoary political traditions 
from the '20s. 
</P>
<P>
 Even official PRI candidate Colosio spoke of the need to make the electoral 
system more open and democratic. When he served as PRI president in the late 
1980s, he even experimented with primary elections in which PRI candidates ran 
against each other for party nominations. 
</P>
<P>
 That suggests an idea. Salinas is expected to wait until after Easter to pick 
a second PRI nominee. Before he does, he should heed the suggestions of Mexican 
intellectuals like writer Carlos Fuentes who are urging him to open up the 
nomination process. Precisely how that is done -- through a primary vote or 
open PRI convention -- is up to party leaders. It might require delaying the 
election, a move that would require approval by the Mexican Congress. But 
Salinas can get the process moving simply by lifting an eyebrow. He could 
create a wide-open presidential race in which several respected PRI members 
could contend for the nomination. Besides the often-mentioned former Mexico 
City Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis, Finance Minister Pedro Aspe and former 
Education Minister Ernesto Zedillo would be formidable candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt there are other, less well-known political leaders who would be 
worthy successors to Salinas. An open, democratic process leading to the 
election of any of them would be a fitting tribute to Colosio.

PASSOVER'S MESSAGE GETS A NEW READING; CEREMONIES: ACTIVIST'S ADAPTATION OF THE 
TRADITIONAL HAGGADA TEXT DRAWS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PLIGHT OF AMERICA'S 
HOMELESS AND THE JEWS OF BIBLICAL EGYPT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY FEINGOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The holiday of Passover calls upon Jews to recall their ancient passage from 
slavery to freedom, emphasizing that every generation must strive to understand 
the meaning of oppression and liberation. Yet for most Jews, Passover's story 
of bondage and deliverance remains a distant, if symbolically powerful, chapter 
in history. 
</P>
<P>
 For Len Doucette, however, the message of Passover is a contemporary clarion 
call to action. Doucette, a disabled Jewish man who has spent much of the past 
two decades living on the streets, sees a stark analogy between the plight of 
America's homeless and the Jews of biblical Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 To dramatize this connection, Doucette, a well-known activist on the Westside, 
has written an alternative text for Passover from the perspective of the 
homeless. This adaptation of the traditional story, or Haggada, will be used at 
a Passover service, or Seder, for homeless people to be held at 4 p.m. Sunday 
on the lawn of Santa Monica City Hall. Paper plates, empty styrofoam cups, 
rocks and sand will be substituted for the traditional meal. 
</P>
<P>
 The participants will read the Haggada, which incorporates commentary on the 
conditions that afflict the nation's homeless population, and poses a moral 
challenge to Jews and non-Jews alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biblical Jews, for all of their slavery, were at least sheltered and 
fed!" reads one section of the narrative. "We, America's homeless, have no door 
to open so that the Prophet Elijah may enter. Instead, we can only extend to 
him an empty Styrofoam cup that is overflowing with our bitter tears of misery 
and pray that he will open the door to a new world for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Doucette, who is currently living in an apartment in Santa Monica but expects 
to be homeless again by April 1, wrote the Haggada last year, during a hunger 
fast to protest Santa Monica's new restrictions on the homeless. "It seemed an 
appropriate time to think about hunger and poverty in America," said Doucette. 
"It was written really to raise peoples' consciousness, to make them think 
about hunger and homelessness, and to think there are answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Freehling, the rabbi at University Synagogue in West Los Angeles, 
recently read the "homeless Haggada" at Doucette's request and agreed to edit 
the text. He believes that this contemporary interpretation of Passover is a 
valid one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our tradition has us remind ourselves that while once we were enslaved, we 
have to be mindful of other people who are either physically or emotionally 
enslaved as well," said Freehling, who has often taken an active role in 
various social and political causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "From every point of view that I can think of, the homeless population within 
our community has been enslaved economically, as well as by prejudice, and as a 
result of that I think the parallels that he's drawing are very real." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey J. Fields, chief rabbi at Wilshire Boulevard Temple, agrees that the 
Passover-homelessness comparison makes sense. He points out that the 
traditional Passover matzo, or unleavened bread, represents the "bread of 
poverty," and that the Seder itself begins with an invocation for all those who 
are hungry to come and eat. 
</P>
<P>
 While Passover provides an opportunity to stress Jewish responsibility for 
those in need, Fields believes that in general the Jewish community has 
responded vigorously to the problem of homelessness. His temple, like others 
around the city, operates a weekly feeding program and is an active participant 
in HopeNet, through which 250,000 meals a year are supplied to the hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 Doucette's unique Haggada insists that history places a special burden on 
those of the Jewish faith to heed the suffering of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Judaism is, indeed, to be a Light Unto the Nations," his Haggada reads, 
"we must, by example, use our multitude of resources and talents to fight this 
evil disease that is threatening to destroy America."

HIGH-DEFINITION VIDEO FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am filled with dismay at the prospect of walking into a movie theater, 
viewing a film on high-definition video, and deciding how it will end ("PacBell 
to Test Movie Distribution by Phone," March 21). 
</P>
<P>
 In its current form, high-def is a poor substitute for the traditional 
approach of shining light through celluloid. It has a fall-off on either end of 
the black-white spectrum, so that a black-and-white picture like "Schindler's 
List" would look muddier and less distinct. Nor would colors be as bright and 
sharply defined in the medium. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as alarming is the cheerful prediction by PacBell's Bob Stewart: "A 
studio could have 10 or 15 different endings and the audience could vote when 
they come in on which one they want to see. Majority rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Has Stewart ever seen a movie, or ever met a film executive? On the basis of 
this statement, I doubt it. Can he name an executive prepared to authorize the 
cost of shooting 10 or 15 different endings for a film? Or even two or three? 
Does he know that audiences hate it when someone "gives away the ending?" Would 
he personally like to linger in the lobby before a film, reading a ballot with 
10 or 15 possible endings for a movie he has not yet seen?  
</P>
<P>
 A movie is not a democracy, and the majority should not rule. The director 
should rule. The average audience for "Casablanca," prior to seeing the film, 
would undoubtedly vote for Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman to live happily 
ever after. Joseph Cotten would get Alida Valli at the end of "The Third Man," 
Hannibal Lecter would be executed on death row. Tom Hanks would not die in 
"Philadelphia." The characters of Ike and Tina Turner, in "What's Love Got to 
Do With It," would go to a marriage counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactivity works just fine for computer games. The few times it has been 
tested with real audiences at real movies, it has failed dismally. A movie's 
purpose is for it to act upon me, not for me to act upon it. When Indiana Jones 
is running hellbent from that rolling boulder, do I want an opportunity to vote 
on whether he leaps aside? Not a chance. That would destroy the movie's 
headlong momentum, and break the suspension of disbelief necessary to almost 
every movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The exploitation pioneer William Castle once released a film in which the 
audience was given the "choice" of an ending, after seeing Castle, seated 
behind a desk, promise them that the projectionist was "standing by" with two 
alternate conclusions. Oddly enough, the audience always voted for the more 
violent and horrific ending. Just as well, since of course it was the only one 
Castle bothered to supply.

HAMAS AND KACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The editorial "The True Face of Insanity" (March 10) stated that peace is 
invariably the victim when the extremists are in a position to inflict their 
bitter and irrational pain. "That's certainly the case in the Middle East, 
whether the perpetrator is a hardened and trained Hamas operative or a 
fundamentalist Jewish settler who suddenly snaps."I have a major problem with 
the double standard underpinning that statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hamas operative is described as hardened and trained, but Baruch 
Goldstein, an army reservist in his military uniform who carried a machine gun, 
who was a member of Kach Party and a follower of Meir Kahane, was a 
fundamentalist who suddenly snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the Hamas operative, whoever he may be, is the desperate and oppressed 
one who may suddenly snap. But Goldstein was the hardened, predetermined, 
well-trained criminal who was a natural out-product of an imposed, unjust, 
illegal situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless we are willing to be fair and evenhanded, while spreading our bias, 
there will be no hope to find a place for sanity in our troubled world. The 
Bible says "the truth shall set you free," so let us say the truth to free our 
world from the grip of violence and terrorism. Or we at least should follow the 
sayings of the Prophet Mohammed: "Whoever speaks should either say what is good 
or else remain silent."

SINGAPORE FLOGGING CASE AND GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you are wondering why we have so many societal problems, just read your 
March 19 editorial "Travel Advisory -- When in Rome." 
</P>
<P>
 The editors seem to think that if people go around spray painting automobiles 
while committing other crimes in a foreign country and then make "restitution" 
they should not be subject to any sort of consequence or punishment -- 
especially not one of our current culture. Balderdash! Flogging is actually too 
nice a punishment for this vandal and many of our own problems stem from our 
inability to promote responsibility by exacting consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Our society allows killers to live, expecting others not to kill by this 
example. We have judges who don't judge, a legal system that inhibits justice, 
and no will to differentiate good from bad. When we constantly hear the silly 
calls for more police and more jails, this is a sure sign that people have lost 
the will to actually punish offenders for their crimes. It is the existence of 
consequences and the will to execute our laws to the fullest that speaks of our 
integrity and resolve for a good and healthy society. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on The Times for promoting such nonsense!

 This 18-year-old youth decided to litter a landscape with his disrespect and 
visual selfishness. In a land that has none of this visual clutter and is 
completely pristine. Everyone in Singapore is dealt with the exact same way 
when he breaks this law; this kid knew this. 
</P>
<P>
 If we, as Americans, would get out of this "let's give criminals a break" 
mentality, we too would have a population that would not be rewarded for 
breaking the law. We as a Western culture cannot force our perspectives of this 
punishment as barbaric, just because we don't have it here. In Singapore, if 
you commit this crime, caning is the punishment -- for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Take it from someone who battles graffiti personally in the City of Angels -- 
it's no bargain. I've had 12-year-old taggers pull guns on me as I removed 
their scrawls voluntarily. What if they should shoot me? Suddenly caning 
doesn't sound so bad!

</P>

 This clearly illustrates another example of the arrogance of a tiny, 
inconsequential nation slapping the world's most powerful democracy on the 
behind.

LARCENOUS SEA GULL SNATCHES MAN'S DIAMOND RING; RESCUE: BIRD DEPOSITS 'BIG 
MIKE' SIMPSON'S PINKY RING ATOP A LIGHT POLE. SHAKING IT DIDN'T WORK SO 
FIREFIGHTERS BRING A HOOK AND LADDER TO RETRIEVE THE JEWELRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Big Mike" Simpson -- the kind of man who can wear a one-carat diamond ring on 
his pinky finger and not get any static about it -- was getting kind of bored 
Friday morning as he waited for a friend in the parking lot on Warner Avenue 
near Magnolia Street. 
</P>
<P>
 To pass the time, the 6-foot, 300-pound chauffeur decided to feed some birds 
the stale pretzels he found in the trunk of his stretch limousine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was crunching the pretzels and slinging them with my right hand," he said. 
"Then, all of a sudden, (the ring) slid off." 
</P>
<P>
 To Simpson's alarm, a sea gull snatched it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started screaming all kinds of things at that bird," he said. "I started 
throwing pretzels at it to try to get him to drop the ring and eat the 
pretzels." 
</P>
<P>
 The sea gull didn't bite. Instead, it flew skyward with the ring, eventually 
landing on a 25-foot light pole. As Simpson watched in agony, the bird dropped 
the ring on a small flat spot atop the pole and flew off. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the 52-year-old Huntington Beach resident tried shaking the light pole. 
No good. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he thought about asking some kids to shinny up to get the ring. He 
decided they might run off with the jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was planning to camp underneath the lamppost all night, hoping it would 
rain hard enough and wash the ring down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Simpson, some Fountain Valley firefighters happened to be 
across the street, and Simpson persuaded them to radio in for a hook-and-ladder 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighter Jeff Shockey said that when he got the call, he thought it was a 
joke. 
</P>
<P>
 But a few minutes later, with the ladder in place, Shockey retrieved the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking how was I going to explain this to my wife," Simpson said 
later, adding that his wife, Karen, had given him the ring as an anniversary 
gift 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid to tell her," he said.

CAN JOHNSON APPLY MAGIC TOUCH TO LAKERS IN HIS NEW CHALLENGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Magic Johnson sure to give the current crop of Lakers a much-needed dose 
of enthusiasm, hopefully we'll finally be able to see their full talents.And 
now that the Magic's back, I hope the disappearing act of Danny Manning will be 
only a brief illusion and he'll soon reappear in L.A. wearing purple and gold.

 Coach Magic Johnson? Having no coaching experience, does he consider himself 
another John Lucas? Being an intolerable perfectionist is not the quality of a 
head coach. Sure, he can motivate players, but can he design defenses and 
offenses? By the way, with the current player roster, what was wrong with Randy 
Pfund?

HARRICK BASHERS ARE OUT IN FORCE

 Memo to Coach Jim Harrick: You would probably do best to avoid the Letters 
section this week.

 Jim Harrick's only response to those of us who have criticized his repeated 
failure to produce a team that is competitive for an NCAA championship has been 
to state: "It's hard, real hard to win an NCAA title." Correction, Jim. With 
you coaching, it's impossible.

<P>
 You have Ed O'Bannon, who played his heart out, sounding like a coach and 
apologizing for the way UCLA performed against Tulsa. Meanwhile, the coach, Jim 
Harrick, doesn't seem to be concerned. After all, it's just another game. 
</P>
<P>
 It's March Madness, all right. Madness to let Jim Harrick continue as coach. 
It's time for Chancellor Charles Young and Peter Dalis, the athletic director, 
to give Harrick the compensation he deserves, as coach of a Division II team 
that he may be able to coach. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Jim Harrick should feel ashamed. A coach's singular role should be to assist 
his or her athletes in achieving their highest potential. Through remarkable 
non-coaching, Harrick has denied his UCLA basketball players, some of the best 
athletes in the country, the chance to achieve their true potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody can deny that this UCLA team has the talent to beat any team in the 
nation on any given day. But to watch these great athletes game after game 
achieve astonishing mediocrity is as torturous to Bruin fans as it must be to 
the players themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick should either start coaching or get out of the way. Anything less just 
isn't fair to the players.

<P>
 How long will UCLA allow Jim Harrick to embarrass the university? How long 
will the coaching staff be allowed to cheat these talented but uninspired 
athletes? How long will sportswriters in this city make excuses for Harrick? 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that Harrick needs no one to make excuses for him. He is pretty 
good at it himself. Here are some of my favorites: 1) Most of my losses are on 
the road. 2) The referees have no guts. 3) Bill Walton hurt my feelings. 4) My 
back-up center hurt his back. 5) They won't pay me as much as Bob Knight. 6) I 
just can't seem to get my half-court offense to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of making excuses, why can't he just say, "I can't coach," and then 
utter those two magic words that all UCLA alums are dying to hear: "I quit." 
</P>

<P>
 I have never bad-mouthed Coach Jim Harrick. I have been patient with him and 
his team in hopes that the real Bruins would show up for March Madness. 
</P>
<P>
 However, after the loss to Tulsa, I find myself exacerbated. There is no doubt 
UCLA has the talent to play with any team in the nation. The question now is 
finding a coach to properly motivate that talent. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Please have your readers send donations to the Jim Harrick Fund, which will 
enable us to buy out his contract at UCLA. For some reason, Pete Dalis is 
reluctant to spend the money, and it is painfully obvious that UCLA needs a new 
basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 DAVID B. RADDEN 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The awful truth is now undeniable. As long as Harrick is at UCLA, the team 
will go nowhere. The great recruiting class coming up will be wasted on a 
program that is doomed to mediocrity before the first game is played. 
</P>

<P>
 The UCLA men's basketball team had many turnovers this season. Now that 
another unfulfilling season has passed, it's only appropriate that one more 
turnover occur -- that of the head coaching position. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to make room for Bill Walton, a man knowledgeable about basketball 
who is also a leader, a motivator, a winner and who has high expectations. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 It's astounding that UCLA fans are still living with the mythology of John 
Wooden. They have been duped by ludicrous publicity and irresponsible reporting 
into believing that John Wooden was a mystical Bruin god whose heroics will 
never be equaled. 
</P>
<P>
 The major tragedy is that UCLA people have abused their many good coaches in 
comparing each with the mythological god. Some of these were probably great 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA fan has always lacked integrity and has never known how to lose with 
class. Jim Harrick is a very good and certainly dedicated coach who will give 
his school many more winning seasons. He's a good man doing his best for a 
school that wants too much, a school that should spend more time educating its 
fans.

 There must be something in the water or air in Anaheim. Continuing their long

O.C. POP ALBUM REVIEWS; TRAVELIN' BANDS HIT POINTS OF INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Today's crop of local album reviews finds Rod Piazza & the Mighty Flyers 
visiting Memphis (not to see Graceland, but to play the blues for their new 
live album) and Barrelhouse drawing its inspiration from Memphis via the Stax 
soul sound. Fu Manchu goes cruising with a hard-rock album about fun on wheels, 
and Atomic Boy tunefully vents its frustration at not getting the desired chain 
reaction from big-label deal-makers. Ratings range from * (grounded into double 
play) to **** (knocked it 450 feet over the center field fence). Three stars 
denote a solid recommendation. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Rod Piazza & the Mighty Flyers 
</P>
<P>
 "Live at B.B. King's, Memphis" 
</P>
<P>
 Big Mo  
</P>
<P>
 Here's one for those nights when you want to get out of the house for some 
good-time blues but nothing good is playing in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside-based Piazza and his band don't push traditional blues in new 
directions, nor are they concerned with tapping the deepest emotional 
possibilities of their genre. What they do best is play the blues with a rare 
verve and pleasure, and exceptional skill. 
</P>
<P>
 This 72 1/2-minute CD, drawn from two Beale Street club gigs in December, is 
loaded with hot, interactive playing that achieves a live album's desired 
you-are-there effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza applies his wry, conversational voice mainly to humorous songs about 
bad women and worse luck; he'd do well to go for more of a thematic mix. 
Musically, though, the program is reasonably diverse. Such numbers as the tense 
"Murder in the 1st Degree," the sultry "Blue Hour," and a slow-burning guitar 
showcase, "Down So Long," balance lighter fare built on jumping rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza's harmonica playing is full of surprising twists, with the nervous 
leaps and slides of "Murder" a prime example. Guitarist Alex Shultz spins out 
solos that say something different and delightful with each chorus, while piano 
player Honey Piazza, the bandleader's wife, can boogie hard or trill nimbly as 
the situation requires. 
</P>
<P>
 These three soloists also function well as supporting players who can add 
interesting accents to a song even when the focus of attention is elsewhere. 
The hollow, pinging quality of the digital piano is a drawback, although it is 
understandable that a hard-touring band without deep pockets would go for the 
easy portability and low-maintenance of an electronic keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing mostly original material by both Piazzas, the band keeps things 
cooking until the final number, an anticlimactic, slow-grinding "Mannish Boy" 
knockoff called "They Want Money." 
</P>
<P>
 In it, Piazza grouchily brands all women as gold diggers. Some stereotypes 
just don't fly anymore, and even as traditional an outfit as the Mighty Flyers 
had best evolve beyond them.  
</P>
<P>
 (Available from Big Mo Records, (800) 647-4583, or RR1 Box 389C, Norwich, VT 
05055.) 
</P>
<P>
 ** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 Barrelhouse 
</P>
<P>
 "Blues on 10th 'n' Central" 
</P>
<P>
 The place name in the title of this self-financed cassette release refers to a 
band member's pad in Seal Beach, but Barrelhouse's sound issues straight from 
McLemore Avenue. That was the Memphis address of the Stax Records studio, 
birthplace of the gritty Southern soul music of Otis Redding and Wilson 
Pickett. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many singers are up to emulating the likes of Redding and Pickett, but 
Barrelhouse front man Steave Ascasio is the authentic item. He is a natural 
soul singer with a rich, grainy voice that has real presence, coupled with the 
sensitivity and nuance to burrow deeply into a lyric. 
</P>
<P>
 You wouldn't expect those qualities in a 25-year-old suburban kid from Laguna 
Niguel, but Ascasio joins blues man Robert Lucas and rockabilly Robert (Big 
Sandy) Williams as one of the best young roots-music singers on the local 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Barrelhouse writes songs good enough that Redding or Pickett 
might have wanted to record them. The lyrics are simple but heartfelt, the funk 
grooves on the fast tunes are pulsating, and the ballad melodies -- ballads 
being the cassette's particular strength -- are graceful. 
</P>
<P>
 The album is far from perfect. The arrangements cry out for the horns and 
keyboards of classic Southern soul; given the financial strictures of being a 
young, grass-roots band making a do-it-yourself recording, Barrelhouse sticks 
to a bare-bones, guitar-based sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Even within these limitations, the instrumental work could stand improvement. 
Guitarists Mark Cerneka and Dave Metzger do well with sparse, scratchy funk 
rhythms a la Stax stalwart Steve Cropper, but neither comes through with the 
confident, imaginative soloing that could have lifted several songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The band sounds most at home with "Mazy," the album's bluesiest track; 
elsewhere, the guitar solos are tentative, and the arrangements sometimes 
sputter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ascasio's husky voice doesn't have tremendous range; he periodically trots out 
a falsetto that is promising but still needs work. However, with a lot of 
sharpening and development, the potential is there for Barrelhouse to do 
something special with the Memphis soul sound. After the slick, bloated 
tributes of Michael Bolton and the mannered revivalism of the Black Crowes, 
it's about time somebody did it right. 
</P>

<P>
 Fu Manchu 
</P>
<P>
 "No One Rides for Free" 
</P>
<P>
 Bong Load  
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not, a band can go far these days by recycling sounds from the 
biggest, dumbest mastodons of '70s arena rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of today's twentysomething hard-rockers were not weaned on the Who, the 
Stones, Free and Mott the Hoople, bands for whom ideas and feelings on a 
personal scale actually mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 They were raised on Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, purveyors of mass 
sensation who were content to bash them around inside their cranial housings. 
</P>
<P>
 Enough of all that -- it's time for grunge to go through a fruitful mutation. 
Maybe Fu Manchu can be part of that evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the San Clemente band rides with the brutish beasts of the past on most 
of its first CD, an eight-song release that runs about 27 minutes. There are 
heavy riffs and tromping beats derived from Sabbath, the Zep, and such lesser 
'70s thunder lizards as Mountain, Grand Funk, Steppenwolf and Bachman-Turner 
Overdrive. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is skimming of the heaviest '60s Cream as guitarist Eddie Glass 
(last heard from a few years back as the drummer of the punk band, Olivelawn) 
steps hard on his wah-wah pedal in a seeming homage to "White Room" at the end 
of "Superbird." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fu Manchu also appears to have been listening to Sonic Youth, one of the 
smartest and most adventurous of the truly alternative bands of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Sonics, Fu Manchu takes a sense of hurtling motion, a darkly 
psychedelic ambience, and deadpan-cool vocal delivery. This is a case where 
limitation may be a strength: Singer Scott Hill is no titanic wailer like Kurt 
Cobain, Eddie Vedder or Chris Cornell, so he goes for an almost laid-back, 
sing-speak intonation that's just right for the band's songs about life on 
wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Like those automotive-rebels from the '50s, James Dean and Marlon Brando, Hill 
speaks softly (at least for a hard-rock front man) and lets his big engines do 
the vrooming. 
</P>
<P>
 In another parallel to Sonic Youth, Fu Manchu's is a music that probes 
restlessly, searching for some sort of release. Their chosen vehicle for 
thrills and escape is the van, that four-wheeled love nest/pot den/clubhouse 
where, as Hill sings in "Shine It On," you can "delight in a world of your 
own."  
</P>
<P>
 This sensibility isn't elevated (the collection's one quiet interlude is a 
soft-focus, hippie wet dream called "Free and Easy (Summer Girls)"). But it is 
magical and affirmative, and we could use more of that in today's mostly 
baleful hard rock. 
</P>

 Atomic Boy 
</P>
<P>
 "The Timebomb Tapes" 
</P>
<P>
 Hipnotic  
</P>
<P>
 Denny Lake, singer of this Orange County-Los Angeles band, does some of his 
most pointed writing in liner notes that chronicle how unnamed record companies 
treated Atomic Boy to the Hollywood runaround last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake comes to the positive conclusion that major labels are not necessarily 
the best judges of musical worth; hence Atomic Boy's decision to stop waiting 
for the big contract and get its wares out on a tiny independent label. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake also can be fairly pointed in politicized songs targeting violent police, 
abortion opponents and the military-industrial complex. The problem with these 
songs, and with others about romantic ups and downs, is that he has little feel 
for language and how to make it vivid. 
</P>
<P>
 The lyrics are bland declarations ending in blockish rhymes; you'll find 
cotton fields in Canada before you'll encounter a metaphor, a memorable 
description, or a deft bit of word play on Atomic Boy's 16-song cassette 
(included with new material are all five songs from the band's 1992 debut CD, 
produced by Chris Carter of Dramarama). 
</P>
<P>
 In other respects, Atomic Boy is a worthy band. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see how Carter would be drawn to their sound, which has some of 
the energetic, bash-it-out spirit of Dramarama. The guitars slash and bite in a 
dense, catchy, hard-riffing attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake has no trouble mustering passion that often compensates for the drabness 
of his lyrics. He sounds like a chestier version of Husker Du's Grant Hart on 
anthems such as "Time Bomb," "Writing on the Wall" and "Everywhere & Nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 A bit of a John Lydon snarl emerges when Atomic Boy gets mad, as it does to 
good effect with "In Your Face," a careening melodic-punk burner that rails at 
corrupt power and manages, if nothing else, to get some ya-yas out.

THEATER REVIEW; BUT FOR WHITMORE, 'DIRT' WOULD BE MUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Whitmore, the marvelous star of such one-man shows as "Will Rogers' USA" 
and "Give 'Em Hell, Harry" has carved himself another juicy part in "Dirt," 
which had its West Coast premiere at the Old Globe Theatre on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Whitmore's portrayal of an aging, ailing farmer in this 
three-character piece is the only one worth watching. Look past his passion and 
virtuosity and all you have is an "On Golden Pond" or "Foxfire" wanna-be -- a 
cliche-ridden play about intergenerational conflict, with stock characters and 
hit-you-over-the-head symbolism. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitmore plays Sonny Hardman (and he's a hard man -- get it?), a tough old 
bird whose memory has begun failing him since his wife died. His estranged son, 
Zac (John Dennis Johnston), comes to check on him. They fight and reconcile. In 
between, Eleanor, a waitress from the local diner (Annette Helde), brings the 
old man a cherry pie and becomes the convenient love interest for the son. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is about the changing of the guard. Sonny needs to pass on his love 
for the land before he can die peacefully. The son's growing adeptness with 
farming shows he's on the way to becoming the father with whom he fights so 
bitterly. The woman wants to become the new woman of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The play would be as neatly turned out as a bed with hospital corners if the 
conflicts didn't seem so trumped up. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is the father angry with the son? A grab bag of reasons is offered: The 
son served in the Vietnam War (turns out the father was against the war -- a 
rather unusual point of view for a man of his generation and background), Zac 
didn't fight the father for control of the farm, Zac is young and the father's 
old.  
</P>
<P>
 And why is the son in conflict with the waitress? Ostensibly because she 
thinks Zac's not being nice to his father; but really, it seems, just to make 
their attraction more exciting. In theory, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 What the play does offer is a showcase for Whitmore. And the veteran actor 
radiates a star quality that makes it hard to pay attention to anyone else. His 
bushy eyebrows stand out sharply like a challenge to all comers. His stooped, 
bowlegged walk suggests years of working the land. He speaks volumes with a 
look, a smile, a hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 A lucky thing, because the words could use a lot more work. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Andrew J. Traister has done more subtle work with other plays that 
have more fully realized characters, such as "Light Sensitive" and 
"Remembrance" at the Old Globe. But if his goal was to give Whitmore a chance 
to shine, he has accomplished that. 
</P>
<P>
 Odd that playwright Bruce Gooch, who grew up on a family farm, doesn't give us 
any sense of the troubles family farmers have had in recent years. He captures 
the flavor of day-to-day farming but doesn't make it clear what these people 
are living on until the crops come in -- the father's money? The son's? 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Funicello's set of weathered woods and hard-scrabble weeds pushing 
through the dirt works seamlessly with Robert Peterson's lush lighting and Jeff 
Ladman's sound. The worn, faded costumes by Deborah M. Dryden are similarly 
evocative. Composer Valerie Mackendenhances the romantic mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gooch captures the romance of an old man and his land, it's not 
enough. Perhaps because Whitmore was involved in this project even before it 
premiered at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Williamstown, Mass., last 
season, the show was skewed around his character. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gooch needs to create other compelling parts if he wants anything to bloom 
in this "Dirt."

BOWERS DEFENDS ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most of us here at the Bowers Museum are hardened to the unbroken string of 
excoriating reviews of our exhibitors by Times critic Cathy Curtis. We are 
accustomed to our work being called "ignorant, pedantic, absurd" and worse. But 
her most recent review of our exhibition "Seven Decades: Modern Mexican Art 
From the Bernard Lewin Collection" ("Selling Out at the Bowers," March 1) is so 
incorrect and mean-spirited as to be pernicious, and we must tender a reply. 
</P>
<P>
 The review is incorrect in its implication that it is somehow strange and 
disreputable to mount a show of works that are for sale. On the contrary, every 
great institution accepts exhibit items that can be purchased from their 
owners. Museums would be very hard pressed to obtain works of art from purely 
non-commercial sources. In fact, many museum loan agreements include commission 
arrangements should a work sell as a result of being shown in a particular 
exhibition. The collector, Mr. Lewin, quite publicly offered us such an 
arrangement. The Bowers declined, not because we think the sale of art is 
venal, but because we are not in that business. 
</P>
<P>
 It also is incorrect to denigrate the Lewin collection. A respected journal, 
Latin American Art, said "Bernard Lewin owns the largest and most important 
private collection of Mexican art in the world" (fall 1990). 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy's incessant vitriol complicates the already daunting task of raising 
enough private support to mount any sort of exhibition whatsoever. Fortunately, 
our "Seven Decades" show has attracted people of very different backgrounds and 
circumstance. It has instilled wonder and pride. Now really, isn't this more 
important than carping about why the collector loaned the artworks? 
</P>
<P>
 Lest there be any doubt that "Seven Decades" provides the viewer with more 
than his/her money's worth, here's a risk-free offer: We invite your readers to 
come to the Bowers on our upcoming free admission day (Sunday, April 24), made 
possible by the generosity of Wells Fargo Bank.

REACTIONS TO THE OSCARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The purported theme of this year's Oscar ceremony was to recognize 
professionals behind the scenes. They sought to honor the mostly anonymous 
artisans and technicians who contribute as much to the making of movies as the 
high-profile performers. So why were the technical and scientific awards given 
in an unheralded and untelevised ceremony? PARK BUCKER

 Whoever was responsible for hiring Whoopi Goldberg as emcee of the Oscar show 
should be banished from further involvement. She was smug, crude and deadly 
unfunny. Couldn't Hollywood present itself to the world with a little more 
dignity than this?

 Tom Hanks' impassioned, eloquent but ultimately overwrought acceptance speech 
crossed the line that separates genuine compassion from oppressive and absurd 
political correctness. It is one thing to recognize the plague that is AIDS and 
to mourn the toll that it has taken on the entertainment industry. It is quite 
another to imbue the AIDS-afflicted with a nobility that demands that we 
recognize them as "angels." 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS is a predominantly behavior-related disease. Why am I asked to feel not 
only compassion but some sort of responsibility for it? I feel sadness when a 
smoker dies from lung cancer but no responsibility for the choices he or she 
made. I mourn the waste of a life when a drug abuser dies, but I see no 
nobility in such a lifestyle and ultimate death. 
</P>
<P>
 It is painful to read of how the artistic community has been decimated by the 
AIDS epidemic, but why the entire nation should feel guilty or somehow 
responsible for choices by some is beyond me.

 I rather enjoyed reading your Calendar story regarding the differences between 
Oscar hosts Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg ("Welcome to Oskarcast 1994," 
March 21). I was especially amused to discover a reference to a review I wrote 
a couple of years back in Los Angeles magazine about Crystal's "Mr. Saturday 
Night" that "Los Angeles magazine's movie writer, apparently unaware of the 
works of Woody Allen and Jacques Tati, enthused, ' "Mr. Saturday Night" ' 
represents the best job of a comic directing himself since Chaplin in "City 
Lights," ' then admitted he plays poker with somebody from the film's 
production company." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a person supremely confident in his artistic taste could make the 
assumption that a film critic who does not share his enthusiasm for the same 
filmmakers, in this case Allen and Tati, must simply be ignorant of their work. 
If your writer had bothered to read my review rather than just the quotation 
lifted for use in the film's ad, he might have read the justification for my 
praise of Crystal's work. 
</P>
<P>
 As for playing poker with somebody from the film's production company, guess 
what? It was a joke. That also would have been clear to your writer had he 
bothered to read the review.

DANCE REVIEW; LA LA LA HUMAN STEPS BRINGS EXTRAVAGANZA TO WILTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sign in the Wiltern Theatre lobby on Thursday advised patrons coming to see 
La La La Human Steps that tickets dated Oct. 28 and Jan. 14 would be accepted 
for that evening's performance -- a reminder of the two postponements of the 
engagement caused by an injury to leading dancer Louise Lecavalier. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happened, Lecavalier's vulnerability proved central to "Infante -- C'est 
Destroy," the Montreal-based company's complex, engulfing 75-minute 
extravaganza, which combined iconoclastic films and choreography by company 
director Edouard Lock with assaultive rock music (mostly live) and an 
alternately stark and sensuous production design. 
</P>
<P>
 From the fakeout opening of the piece (a kind of live dance-clip of duets to 
come) through one of several fakeout endings, the tiny, blond Lecavalier 
embodied an extreme of ultra-liberated contemporary womanhood. Calling all the 
shots, dominating every partner (including other women), she initiated the 
moves that became the language of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Familiar from the company's performances at the 1987 L.A. Festival and its TV 
appearances, those moves included emblematic cannonball jumps into a partner's 
arms -- with horizontal air turns along the way -- that translated as desperate 
lunges for intimacy. Minutes later, however, after both partners dodged and 
jumped over one another in passages of dazzling speed and intricacy, Lecavalier 
would abruptly walk away -- usually into a new duet. 
</P>
<P>
 As sexual politics, "Infante -- C'est Destroy" made intriguing statements 
about empowerment, with even the characteristically submissive males gaining a 
new sense of freedom through Lecavalier's example -- notably in the spectacular 
trio where they adopted her vocabulary while successfully resisting the women's 
attempts to breach their solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lock literally superimposed another vision on the dancing -- one that 
deliberately undercut the image of Lecavalier as postmodern wonder woman: 
</P>
<P>
 At the front of the stage, columns of roses framed a semi-transparent 
projection screen on which the audience periodically viewed slo-mo film 
fantasies showing Lecavalier as a classic, doomed warrior a la Joan of Arc. The 
title of the work -- and those roses -- also linked Lecavalier to Velazquez's 
paintings of the tiny, blond Infanta Margarita three centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Images of a bleeding, dying Lecavalier alternated onscreen with displays of 
her dancing prowess, just as one false ending of the piece onstage showed her 
exhausted and unable to continue -- yet suddenly capable of lifting her man 
over her head and literally tossing him away. Through these extremes, Lock 
developed a high-Romantic portrait of Lecavalier that both unified the work and 
helped explain its lapses. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Lock used his men (Rick Gavin Tjia, Donald Weikert and Marito 
Olsson-Forsberg) as anonymous, interchangeable partners for Lecavalier while 
his women (Sarah Lawrey and Sarah Williams) became only slightly more 
individualized surrogates. The dancing was scarcely ever about them, only her . 
</P>
<P>
 This obsessive pattern, projected at titanic scale through the endless 
close-ups of her billowing hair and repeated panoramic scans of her naked body, 
could sometimes grow tedious. But, more often, the Lock/Lecavalier partnership 
proved exciting and inspiring: one of the few dance phenomenons of the moment, 
if not quite the timeless mystery the work aimed for. 
</P>
<P>
 If the overlapping grills and screens designed by Dussault/Lefebvre spatially 
extended Lock's emphasis on layers of myth and reality, the awesome immediacy 
of the dancing wouldn't have been possible without guitarist Sylvain Provost 
and, especially, drummer Jackie Gallant. The credited composers were 
Einsturzende Neubauten, David Van Tieghem, Skinny Puppy and Janitors Animated; 
the uncredited included Leonard Bernstein and Procol Harum.

TV REVIEWS; JEAN SMART MELTS HEARTS IN 'PRINCESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Yarn Princess" is, conservatively, a three-tissue movie. And that's for 
viewers who fight back tears through clenched teeth. Everyone else might stock 
up with a whole box of tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise is that the sentiment, invested on a developmentally slow mother 
fighting to save her kids from court-mandated foster homes, isn't the stacked 
deck it might seem. Credit the versatile Jean Smart for that and a good script 
by Dalene Young, who refuses to mollycoddle or overindulge her material. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by the experiences of a childlike woman (Smart) who nevertheless 
manages to marry and raise six boys, the production is a casebook study of the 
quintessential family network TV movie. Despite the burden of a slow-witted 
mother, a happy, larky blue-collar rural family thrives on love rather than 
rules. The kids are free to skateboard in the house, paint on the walls and 
joyously ambush their dad's battered station wagon with stones, but they are 
also curiously disciplined, likable and attend school. 
</P>
<P>
 But this idyll is shattered when their devoted machinist-father (Robert 
Pastorelli) is incapacitated with a wrenching disease (schizophrenia) and their 
uncomprehending mother, more Peter Pan-like than an adult, finds herself 
overwhelmed by child service authorities, lawyers and her increasingly confused 
children, whose lives are hurtled into disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Tom McLoughlin orchestrates all this with a steady hand, drawing 
strong performances from the two oldest brothers (teens Karl David-Djerf and 
Luke Edwards), a cliche-free, sympathetic social worker (Giuliana Santini) and 
a captivating portrait from Smart as the entitled heroine. 
</P>
<P>
 From Smart's bright character in "Designing Women" to her twisted, haunted 
serial killer in 1992's "Overkill: The Aileen Wuornos Story" to her slightly 
retarded mother in "Yarn Princess" (so called because of the woman's 
fascination with spinning yarn), Smart is as unpredictable an actress as 
gifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Her achievement here is physically centered on two techniques that convey the 
slap of reality and bring her role to endearing life: Primary is her speech 
patterns, her slightly dull, slow inflection, and next her subtly glazed-over 
eyes. Nothing is excessive. The result is that when her character breaks into a 
smile or lapses into frustration, it's genuine and can melt your heart. * "The 
Yarn Princess" airs Sunday, 9 p.m., on Channel 7. RAY LOYND

TV REVIEWS; UNFORGETTABLE PRISON DRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Intensely involving and socially trenchant, HBO's "Against the Wall" is the 
rare TV movie that contains the force and complexity of a quality feature film. 
</P>
<P>
 That this unflinching look at the 1971 Attica prison rebellion rises well 
above the general mediocrity of its made-for-TV competition isn't really 
surprising given the presence of noted filmmaker John Frankenheimer. The 
director of such enduring '60s feature films as "The Manchurian Candidate" 
offers a disturbing and unforgettable examination of the injustices and turmoil 
that brewed inside this unforgiving New York prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In this harsh environment, prisoners are treated with a haughty disrespect 
that turns them even more bitter and mean. Many of them are routinely 
mistreated by the prison's autocratic commander (Frederic Forrest), and their 
pleas for decent living conditions are routinely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 When the inmates do finally overrun the penitentiary, they thrash the Attica 
guards with a vengeance that's depicted in positively bone-chilling terms. Few 
films have captured the boiling frustration and rage of prisoners as well as 
"Against the Wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuck in the middle of this clash between the film's rebellious elements and 
domineering authorities is new guard Michael Smith (Kyle MacLachlan). After he 
and a number of other guards are taken hostage during the prison take-over, 
Smith refuses to close ranks with his co-workers or to cede to the authority of 
his captors, eventually winning the respect of rebel leader Jamaal (Samuel L. 
Jackson).  
</P>
<P>
 A universally well-acted film, "Against the Wall" -- written by Ron Hutchinson 
-- also smartly connects the uprising at Attica with the volatile political 
climate of Woodstock-era America. The prison authorities appear symbolic of the 
nation's ruling elite, which is also trying to stem the tide of anti-war and 
pro-liberation forces. Frankenheimer infuses his film with a palpable sense of 
a country deeply divided. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Against the Wall" airs at 8 tonight on HBO, with repeats Tuesday, April 3, 
7, 13, 17 and 22. JON MATSUMOTO

TV REVIEWS; LOOKING AT COMEDY, HISTORY 'SERIOUSLY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The makers of "but . . . seriously" have had the fine instinct to realize that 
stand-up comedians are the only class of artists with fast enough reflexes to 
match up with current events; the program also has the good sense to keep them 
at work and away from pontificating. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a kind of cumulative astonishment over what's been happening in 
American public life over the past few decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "but . . . seriously" shows us the panorama of American history, from the JFK 
assassination through Bill Clinton's presidential acceptance speech, and 
juxtaposes familiar (and still sobering) clips with what comedians were saying 
at the time. There's no authoritative narrative, no editorial comment, no 
earnest interviewer eliciting pat responses. Just history and comedy rubbing up 
against each other raw. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect is not just funny, but a bit unnerving. It would be enough of a 
pleasure hearing once again from virtually every major comedian of the past 40 
years, including Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Dick 
Gregory, Lily Tomlin, Jackie Mason, Dick Shawn, Robert Klein, Robin Williams, 
Whoopi Goldberg, Billy Crystal and Eddie Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 The older comedians are young and vibrant again -- they don't fail us, the way 
the revisited past often does. And the younger ones are right to the point. 
(Eric Bogosian as an apocalyptic street beggar: "I can't change my life. You 
can.") 
</P>
<P>
 But to see them reacting to riot, racial tension, social dislocation, war and 
presidential malfeasance is to realize how much anger and pain is buried in our 
collective laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 One could argue that telescoping all these events together is to take them out 
of the context of normality. But by the end of "but . . . seriously" you can't 
help feeling that too much of contemporary history has been a sorry mess, and 
that the comics have not only been constant in pointing to it, but also 
invaluable in helping us get through. 
</P>
<P>
 * "but . . . seriously" airs at 9:40 tonight on Showtime.

CALIFORNIA KING'S REIGN STOPS AT THE STATE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN HOGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Golden State -- home to the California Dream, the California Roll and . . 
. the California King mattress. Dimensions: 72 inches wide and 84 inches 
long.That's four inches longer and four inches narrower than king-size beds 
made and sold in the other 49 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Just why is a matter of some debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say it's because Californians are more freewheeling. Others say the 
Cal-King, as it is sometimes called, simply is built for tall, thin people. If 
you move your California King to, say, Cleveland, it's a headache: You must 
special-order sheets to fit your now odd-sized bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how a bed became king, according to bed manufacturing lore: 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after World War II, a Los Angeles mattress merchant decided that 
Californians, Angelenos in particular, had big enough houses and big enough 
lifestyles to warrant Big Beds. So he built a bed six feet wide by seven feet 
long, or 72 inches by 84 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 And he called it the California King. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers in other parts of the country thought the Big Bed was a great 
idea, but that the Californian was not. If you build the Big Bed 76 inches 
wide, they argued, all you have to do is double up two single box springs (38 
inches wide) underneath. If you make it 80 inches long, you just have to add an 
extra row of coils. 
</P>
<P>
 This King caught on. It was dubbed the "Eastern King" to distinguish it from 
its longer, narrower California counterpart, which Golden State manufacturers 
held to for reasons the rest of the world can only guess at. 
</P>
<P>
 As one mattress merchant says: "It's great for Michael Jordan, but I'm 5-8, so 
it doesn't do a thing for me." MARY ANN HOGAN

 If the aftershock that rocked the San Fernando Valley last Sunday had made 
itself felt around my house, I'd have learned right away how successful my 
efforts have been to make it quake-safe.  
</P>
<P>
 As it was, when I read about the 5.3 magnitude quake on Monday morning, I 
almost felt left out. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past few weekends I've been working to make our house better able to 
ride out a shaker. While Sunday's aftershock to the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake didn't give me a chance to see how well I've done -- for which I'm 
actually quite thankful -- it did reinforce my doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 The earth will keep moving in Southern California, and sooner or later it will 
move enough to rock and roll Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of feeling somehow above it all, I decided it would be better to 
be safe than lying under a toppled bookcase wondering why I hadn't bothered to 
bolt the silly thing down when I had the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier I wrote about the things I'd done -- securing knickknacks, adding 
latches to cabinets, securing boxes on shelves, attaching a tall cabinet to the 
wall, protecting the china and securing the refrigerator and home computer. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a few long-range jobs still to get to, but I finished the basic 
battening down last week, trimming tree branches away from phone lines to 
reduce the chance of losing telephone service, securing the water heater and 
double-checking that other safety preparations were up-to-date.  
</P>
<P>
 Reviewing my list of projects, I find that it hasn't been that difficult, or 
expensive, to increase the chances that our household will weather a big 
temblor without injury to the people inside or damage to some of the more 
significant of our possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how things went on my most recent efforts: Job: Fastening Water Heater 
</P>
<P>
 Fastening the water heater took about an hour, $8.46 worth of material and 
involved several skinned knuckles and a scorched forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 I installed steel strapping that encircles the water heater to keep it from 
toppling. I used straps at the top and bottom of the heater, cut from 10-foot 
lengths of 22-gauge strap that is typically found in the lumber section of home 
improvement stores (Simpson Strong Tie is the brand most lumber yards and home 
stores carry). Each strap is made of two pieces fastened together with bolts 
and wing nuts at the front of the heater. That makes it possible to unfasten 
each strap and remove the water heater without unbolting the straps from the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll need a pair of tin snips to cut steel strap, a power drill and assorted 
bits for pilot holes for the screws that fasten the straps to the wall and the 
appropriate screwdrivers or screwdriver bits for the power drill. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit, in addition to keeping the heater from spilling 30 or 40 gallons 
of hot water, is that it helps protect against the gas line ripping loose and 
igniting a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The drawback is that unfastening the straps is one more thing you've got to do 
when the heater goes bad and needs to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 If your heater is in a tight space, you might want to mark the position of the 
straps where they will be fastened to the wall studs, then remove the heater, 
install the straps to the wall and replace the heater; otherwise it's difficult 
working around the heater. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't anchor the straps to drywall or plaster with hollow wall fasteners -- 
there's not enough strength to hold several hundred pounds of bouncing water 
heater. Always screw directly into the studs. If they aren't conveniently 
located (and they weren't in my cabinet), attach a 2-by-3 or larger board 
horizontally across the wall studs in the heater cabinet wall and then fasten 
the straps to it in order to have a solid platform to anchor them to. 
</P>
<P>
 And remember, the hot water line leading out of the heater is hot enough to 
raise blisters on unprotected knuckles and forearms. Job: Tree Trimming 
</P>
<P>
 The tree trimming was relatively easy -- a tall pruning pole with a saw blade 
attachment allowed me to stand firmly on the ground under our front yard shade 
tree and remove several offending branches that had grown into the path of the 
phone lines. I cleared a path through the head of the tree so the lines won't 
be in danger of being torn down by branches whipping back and forth in the 
shock of a quake. Job: Attach Foundation 
</P>
<P>
 The big chore remaining is to fasten the 68-year-old house to its foundation. 
My house has about 180 linear feet of mudsill to secure to the raised 
foundation -- a job that would entail renting a powerful masonry drill and 
spending an uncomfortable day or two flat on my back in the three-foot crawl 
space under the house. I'm estimating the do-it-myself cost at $400. It will 
probably zoom to $2,000 or so if I hire a contractor to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Building codes since the 1933 Long Beach earthquake have required houses to be 
bolted down, so unless your abode predates that shaker, and not that many in 
Orange County do, this isn't a job you will have to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 As for me -- I figure the house has stayed on its foundation in all the nasty 
Southland quakes over the past six decades, so while I plan to get it done 
sometime this year, I'm not in a terrible hurry. Job: Review Other Preparations 
</P>
<P>
 I went back through the house one last time to look for potential problems and 
to make sure the few things I'd done before my latest push were still in place. 
</P>
<P>
 I checked to make sure that the special wrench attached to the outside gas 
meter was still there. It was. The wrench is used for turning off the gas. The 
tool cost $10.72, and it took two minutes and a penny's worth of wire to fasten 
it to the meter so that it doesn't get lost. You shouldn't turn off the gas 
unless there's a leak, but if there is one it can save precious time to have 
the right tool. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problems I spotted are a few pictures in the bedroom that should get 
their glass covers replaced with shatter-proof plastic; a bathroom cabinet that 
needs a new latch and a makeshift bookcase in my wife's office that is not too 
tall but is overloaded with papers and junk that will make a big mess in a big 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 We have kept several small earthquake emergency kits in the house for several 
years now, but I decided it might be smarter to keep one in the trunk of each 
car and leave just one in the house. If the house were severely damaged in a 
big quake, the stuff in the cars might be easier to get to.  
</P>
<P>
 Those kits, which cost $29.95 each, contain emergency water, food, medical 
supplies and a heat-retaining Mylar blanket, all of which will supposedly last 
one person at least two days. 
</P>
<P>
 I intend at some point to buy a special 55-gallon water drum and put it in the 
back yard, probably in a corner at the very back of the lot, far away from 
structures that could fall on it. That drum will be our emergency water supply. 
To keep it fresh without waste, I'll change the water every month or so, using 
the old stuff to irrigate the shrubbery and roses. 
</P>
<P>
 I still haven't decided what, if anything, to do about setting up an emergency 
food supply, but I know that water is more important, so that will be my 
priority job this spring. Finally: The Bottom Line 
</P>
<P>
 I've finished the earthquake safety projects I originally set out to do and 
now know what I'll be tackling down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Not counting the time I spent thinking about how to approach each project, the 
investment in work time was just under 11 hours, which I spread out over two 
Saturdays and a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of materials, including the gas meter wrench I bought earlier, was 
$188.12. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not much if it means that the good china or our entertainment cabinet 
and its contents escape damage. And it's nothing at all if it helps prevent an 
injury.

BED AND BORED; SEARCHING FOR THE RIGHT MATTRESS IN A (YAWN) SEA OF 'POCKETED 
COIL SYSTEMS' AND 'REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY' CAN BE TIRESOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN HOGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Can I help you?" asks Bea the department store saleswoman, dwarfed in a 
wall-to-wall sea of mattress technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a new bed," you say. 
</P>
<P>
 A big bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Big enough for two adults, one small-but-growing child, one baby who's just 
learned to roll, seven Dr. Seuss books, a laptop computer, two Sunday 
newspapers, a portable TV, a breakfast table and four pillows. 
</P>
<P>
 And a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite song of your small-but-growing child runs through your head: 
"There-were-four-in-the-bed, and-the-little-one-said, 'Roll over! Roll over!' 
So-they-all-rolled-over and one-fell-out. Plop. There-were-three-in-the-bed . . 
.' "  
</P>
<P>
 So it's not just a bed you're buying. It's a place to hang out for the next 
10.8 years. Fittingly, the $4 billion bedding industry agrees. They don't just 
sell you a mattress. It's a mattress and box spring, also known as a "sleep 
set." 
</P>
<P>
 Never go to buy one alone, unless, of course, you live that way. So says the 
Better Sleep Council of Alexandria, Va. So you drag along the growing child, 
the second adult and the rolling baby for a morning of bed browsing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take a look," says Bea, the sleep set saleswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an ocean of sleep sets stripped down to their pale stitched floral outer 
coverings, which top the piles of inner "comfort layers," pocketed coil systems 
and hundreds of coils in the "revolutionary technology" of the continuous-wire 
spring unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Whew. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the superpremium, the ultrapremium, the Correct Posture Maxipedic. The 
Beautyrest Superb. The Posturpedic Concerto. The Crown Jewel. The Correct 
Comfort Deluxe. 
</P>
<P>
 You can go firm-firm, plain firm, soft-soft, plain soft, super support, plain 
support, all with varying density, thickness and choices of filler material. 
</P>
<P>
 The rolling baby begins to cry. You sit down on a soft-soft. You sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bed. Inevitable, immutable. The place where you go every night, come rain 
or shine or PostureTech Coil with patented Sensory Arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the sine qua non ," says Alan Dundes, University of California, 
Berkeley, professor of anthropology. "It's basic. Bed and board. Bed and 
breakfast. You can do without a dining room table or you can set your books up 
with bricks and boards. But people need a place to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 A place to recuperate. To spend roughly 220,000 hours, or approximately 
one-third of the average lifetime, or more if you count the VCR, the Seuss 
books and the Sunday papers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 "King or queen?" Bea wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
 It is here, in the showroom, that it all happens. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where bed meets American marketing to plumb the singular psychology of 
the American mattress consumer. Think about it: The bed is the only piece of 
furniture that plays a pivotal role in every major life stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's where we play, create, love, conceive, convalesce and give birth," says 
Alecia Beldegreen, New York interior designer and author of "The Bed," a 1991 
coffee-table pictorial history. "It's where we dream and where we die. It's 
where the entire human drama is enacted." 
</P>
<P>
 Swell. All of a sudden, you're not just buying a mattress. You're choosing a 
stage and sound system for your life. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Rossini composed operas in bed, Beldegreen says. "Proust wrote 
'Remembrance of Things Past' in bed. Winston Churchill governed Britain from 
bed. French kings held court and issued edicts from bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Groucho Marx was right: Anything that can't be done in a bed isn't worth 
doing at all. 
</P>
<P>
 So let's see . . . if you hook up the laptop to the system at the office, sell 
the car, join the Internet, invest in an interactive phone system with fax 
machine and cappuccino maker, you'll never have to leave this 
comfort-option-laden corner of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The song crescendos. " . . . and-the-little-one - said, 'Roll over! Roll 
over!' "  
</P>
<P>
 Bea the sleep set saleswoman reels you back to the mission at hand: Joining 
the ranks of Americans who last year purchased nearly 30 million adult-size 
conventional mattresses and box springs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Bedding is a very promotion-driven business," says a marketing executive from 
one of the leading U.S. mattress manufacturers. "People don't walk around in 
their normal day thinking about their mattresses. But then there's some 
trigger, usually a life event, like a change in family structure, a marriage, a 
move, a backache. The trigger establishes a need. Then the consumer is open to 
advertising." 
</P>
<P>
 And then, suddenly, all the world's a bed. Every newspaper seems to carry a 
10% Bonus-Savings, Four-Days-Only! mattress sales (Plus Free Bed Frame!). Your 
friends don't just have beds, they have box spring dimensions. The freeway 
teems with Chevy Luvs transporting old ones to college-freshman apartment 
dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 You start wondering about practical things, such as, just where did Louis XIV 
keep his 400-plus beds? How did he wash the sheets? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, there were no choices. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only straw and animal hide. Later there were feathers and covers and 
pillows piled high -- the higher the pillows, the more important the bed's 
occupant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beds have always denoted status," Beldegreen says. Of course, there were 
variations along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlemagne and other medieval warriors slept on beds propped up at 45-degree 
angles so they could spring into battle at a second's notice. The Japanese 
favored the futon. Persian nomads, the water-filled goatskin and still others, 
the hammock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Industrial Revolution brought the spring, which made the bed bounce. Soon 
followed the ingenuity of the American bedding industry, which turned the 
Princess and the Pea into king- and queen-size "advanced mattress technology." 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last 30 years we've evolved with a lot of different techniques, many 
more types of filling materials and spring technologies," says Donald S. Simon, 
chairman of the Serta Mattress Co. in the Northern California town of 
Vacaville. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started in this business almost 50 years ago," says Simon, "there were 
two firmnesses, soft and firm, in two qualities. Today, it's like women's 
ready-to-wear. There's a new invention every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Like coil count. Coil gauge. Special construction to add support to the lumbar 
region. Posturized filler. Foam, fiber, wool padding. Comfort layers. Degrees 
of thickness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think of it as giving people more comfort options," says Andrea Herman of 
the Better Sleep Council. "Sleep is a very individualized comfort issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Add the finicky regional retailers who want their own particular color, 
design, stitching or quarter-inch adjustment here or there, and a mattress 
maker could end up with 10, 20 or 50 slight variations on a particular mattress 
theme, each with a different name. Masterpiece Grandeur. Masterpiece Marquis. 
Correct. Exquisite. Elite. Classic. Harder-Than-Nails. Softer-Than-Springtime. 
</P>
<P>
 You ask Bea the sleep set saleswoman what the names mean. "They're just 
names," she says. "Like Bob and Bill and Sue. You have to try them to see which 
one you like. Like Goldilocks." 
</P>
<P>
 You look around and see that it has already happened. In the corner of the 
showroom is a light blue king-size set where the second adult, the growing 
child and the rolling baby are happily recovering from the morning's ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take that one."

GARDENING; POPPY FAMILY BOASTS INTERNATIONAL COUSINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The poppy family (Papaveraceae) spans the globe from the Arctic to the 
tropics, but their flowers share a common quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The poppy is the most transparent and delicate of all blossoms. Other flowers 
rely on the texture of their surface for color. The poppy is painted glass; it 
never glows so brightly as when the sun shines through it," wrote John Ruskin 
100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The corn poppy ( Papaver rhoeas ) is aptly named, for it once dotted the 
cornfields of Europe with its brilliant red flowers. ("Corn" is any grain in 
the queen's English). 
</P>
<P>
 The translucent flowers of this annual are born on sprawling stalks two feet 
high. The variety, Flanders, is named for the poem, "Flander's Fields," in 
which the blood-red flowers symbolize lives lost in war. This is why red 
tissue-paper poppies are still distributed in memory of wars' victims on 
Veterans Day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 19th Century, the Rev. E. Wilks of the Shirley vicarage in England 
noticed a single corn poppy with a fine white line along the edges of its 
petals. From that one plant, Shirley poppies were developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Corn and Shirley poppies begin blooming shortly after spring-flowering bulbs 
have finished their show and continue blooming through July. 
</P>
<P>
 The California poppy ( Eschscholtzia californica) was named in honor of a 
Russian ship surgeon named Eschscholt, who admired these bright orange flowers 
blanketing California hillsides.  
</P>
<P>
 The three- to five-inch flowers of California poppies are borne above finely 
cut, bluish-green foliage and bloom from spring to fall. New varieties are 
available in a range of colors -- cream, orange, yellow and red. Plant these 
flowers in the sunniest parts of the garden, because bright light is needed to 
coax their petals to unfold. Every night the petals close, a cycle that 
continues even after you cut their flowers for bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
 Iceland poppies ( P. nudicaule ) bear their delicately ruffled and sweetly 
scented flowers on slender stalks above a whorl of deeply cut leaves. Like the 
California poppy, the Iceland poppy grows as a perennial in its native Arctic 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Over much of this country, though, summers are too mild for Iceland poppies, 
so they often lose their perennial character. Plants from early sowings bloom 
from midsummer into autumn of their first year. The second year the luxuriant 
blossoms unfold shortly after daffodils bloom, then continue throughout the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The old-fashioned Oriental poppy ( P. orientale ) is the only garden perennial 
among the poppies. Few perennials equal the dazzle of the Oriental poppy. The 
species has huge, flamboyant, brick-red flowers with a purplish-black splotch 
at the base of each petal. The blossoming period is relatively short, in early 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the blossoms fade, the leaves die back and the plant enters a 
period of dormancy until late summer. To mask the dying foliage and carry the 
succession of bloom, try planting flowers such as zinnias and calendulas among 
these poppies. 
</P>
<P>
 All poppies thrive on neglect. Sprinkle the seeds onto a flower bed where the 
soil is well-drained and forget about them. Poppies are a flower of cottage 
gardens and meadows rather than neatly groomed formal flower beds. Let poppies 
sprawl so that their flowers can flop about on the ends of their stalks, bright 
splashes of color against muted green foliage.

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: AMBER LENSES MAKE OUTDOOR LIGHTS GLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I have a set of 12-volt Malibu lights outside my house, and I 
haven't been able to find amber replacement bulbs. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
 T.H. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "It's not going to be easy," says Tom Becker of Harbor Lites in Costa 
Mesa. "It will probably be better for you to get new amber-toned lenses for the 
lights. Then you can have just a standard bulb in each fixture, and you'll be 
getting the amber look from the lens. Take one of the fixtures down to a place 
that sells the lights, and they should be able to find a lens that can work for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I put wallpaper in one of my bedrooms, and the fact that my walls were 
crooked made it a frustrating experience. Before I paper another room, is there 
anything I can do to improve the situation? 
</P>
<P>
 R.R. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Unfortunately, uneven walls affect nearly everyone, whether you have a 
mobile home or a mansion," says paperhanger Martin Sanchez of Santa Ana. "The 
problem, of course, is matching the pattern. If the gaps created by the uneven 
wall are significant, you can try to carefully patch a matching piece into the 
gap. You may also want to consider a paper with a simple pattern and stay away 
from complicated looks like plaids." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have kitchen cabinets with a dark, walnut finish. We'd like to paint 
them white. If we strip the wood down before painting, would an oil- or 
water-based paint be best for a kitchen, and should we sand between the coats 
of paint? 
</P>
<P>
 R.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 A: "First of all, it's not necessary to strip the cabinets," says Harold 
Brobst of Hal's Paint & Decorating in Fullerton. "What you'll want to do is 
sand them down enough to take off the sheen of the finish. Because they're dark 
and you'll be painting them a light color, you can try applying a good primer 
first.  
</P>
<P>
 "An oil- or alkyd-based paint can give you a long-lasting finish that dries 
very hard; however, these types of paints tend to yellow over time, which is a 
problem if you're planning on using a white paint. They're also more difficult 
to clean-up. The water-base paints may not have as tough a finish, but they 
hold their color and are easier to work with.  
</P>
<P>
 "It probably is a good idea to use very fine sandpaper to sand the paint 
finish between coats. This helps the new coat adhere and create a tougher 
finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I replaced some outlets in my house recently and found that the circuit 
breaker labeled for the room I was working in didn't control all of the 
outlets. Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
 C.N. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 A: "It's not uncommon for there to be multiple circuits in a room," says Kathy 
McNally of McNally Electric in Anaheim. "Generally, when a house is built 
several outlets are allotted per circuit, and usually a bedroom may have only 
two or three outlets, so a circuit may control the outlets and lights in other 
rooms or hallways as well. That's why it's always a good idea to test an outlet 
to see if still has power before working on it, even if you think you've turned 
off the right circuit breaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We recently bought a 19-year-old home. In one of the bathrooms, there is a 
fan as well as a separate heating fan on the ceiling. Both work fine, but the 
grills on both are nicked and discolored. How do I replace the grills? 
</P>
<P>
 D.W. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea 
</P>
<P>
 A: "The problem isn't replacing the grills; it's finding them," says Rich 
Haagsma of Faucets n' Fixtures in Orange. "The first task is determining who 
made the fans, then contact(ing) the manufacturer to see if they have a grill 
that will fit yours. The problem is that since yours is nearly 20 years old, it 
may be hard to find one to fit. And if you have an off-brand made by a small 
manufacturer, it could be impossible. If you can't find replacement grills, 
your next step would be to replace the fans themselves."

DO-IT-YOURSELF; NUTS AND BOLTS (AND NAILS) OF HANGING THINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How you hang an object depends on how heavy it is and the kind of wall you're 
hanging it on. 
</P>
<P>
 Most interior walls are plaster or wallboard over wood or metal studs, or some 
type of masonry. Hollow Walls: On the Stud 
</P>
<P>
 On a hollow wall, it's best to attach an object to a stud whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use a common nail or a wood screw long enough to go through the fixture and 
wall and well into the stud. For a screw, first drill a pilot hole slightly 
smaller than the screw's diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Secure a heavy object with a lag bolt -- a heavy-duty screw with a square 
head. Drive it in with a wrench. Or use a hanger bolt -- one end is threaded 
like a wood screw, the other accepts a nut. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use a sheet metal screw to fasten to a metal stud. Drill through the wall up 
to the stud. Dent the metal with a punch. Then drill a small pilot hole. Hollow 
Walls: Between Studs 
</P>
<P>
 For a hollow wall between studs, the more fasteners used, the better. For all 
but the lightest loads, use at least two fasteners. 
</P>
<P>
 * To determine what length hollow-wall fastener to use, you need to find the 
wall's thickness. Drill a small hole, insert a six-penny common nail headfirst. 
Pull the nailhead against the inside of the wall. Mark the nail where it comes 
out of the wall. Then pull out the nail and measure the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use plastic anchors only for very light loads. 
</P>
<P>
 * For medium loads, install hollow-wall anchors. Drill a hole the same size as 
an anchor, insert it and tighten the screw to flatten the end of the anchor 
against the inside of the wall. Then take out the screw and attach the object 
to the anchor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Toggle bolts will hold even more weight. Put a bolt through the fixture, 
screw the spring-loaded wings onto the bolt, then drill a hole and slip the 
wings through it. When the wings spring open, tighten the bolt to pull the open 
wings against the inside of the wall. Masonry Walls 
</P>
<P>
 * Attach boards that will carry light loads with masonry nails or cut nails. 
Because these nails tend to split wood, first drill a hole in the board for 
each nail. To protect your eyes, wear safety goggles when fastening to masonry 
walls. Drive out masonry or other hardened nails with a hardened steel hammer 
or light sledge. They snap easily when not struck properly and can chip a 
cast-iron hammer, causing flying metal particles.  
</P>
<P>
 * To attach an object to a solid masonry wall, drill a pilot hole the length 
and diameter of the anchor. Use a carbide-tipped bit in a variable-speed, 
half-inch electric drill. Clean out the hole before tapping in the anchor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use a plastic or fiber plug or a plastic anchor for a light load and a lead 
anchor for a heavier one. For heaviest loads, use an expansion shield. 
</P>
<P>
 * If a fastener is to carry a heavy load, don't install it in the mortar 
between masonry blocks.

U.S. BEEFS UP S. KOREA ARMS; THREAT MOUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration has begun moving to strengthen U.S. and South 
Korean forces in the face of mounting military threats from North Korea, and it 
will take added steps if the United Nations imposes sanctions against 
Pyongyang, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Washington is starting to transfer weapons and equipment to 
South Korea and making preparations to enable U.S. forces to launch 
missile-carrying warplanes more quickly if North Korean troops, stationed along 
the border, decide to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is also pressing Seoul to buy more artillery-locating radar, 
Apache attack helicopters and precision-guided antitank munitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment would help remedy shortcomings in the South Korean army's 
ability to defend itself against a massive ground attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry, speaking at a news conference, described 
the measures as "a prudent precaution." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he still sees "no sense of imminent military danger," despite the 
belligerent rhetoric from Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosures came as South Korea reported that North Korea has placed its 
troops on alert, banned all domestic travel and told its people that war 
appears inevitable, escalating the growing tensions between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea has still not acceded to U.S. and U.N. demands to allow 
international monitors to complete their inspection of an important nuclear 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Pyongyang repeated its warning that sanctions would trigger a 
full-scale war. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately Friday, members of the U.N. Security Council circulated a draft of 
a new resolution that would urge North Korea to allow the inspectors to 
complete their work but stops short of imposing formal sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The document, which officials said could be brought up for a vote sometime 
next week, also urges North and South Korea to resume talks on putting into 
effect a 1992 joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution is part of a final effort by the allies to give North Korea a 
chance to comply with the nuclear inspectors' demands before the Security 
Council begins consideration of a proposal to impose economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry took pains Friday to assert that Washington is moving "in a careful way" 
to bolster its forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not be intimidated either by actions or by statements from the North 
Korean government," he said, "but we are not being provocative." 
</P>
<P>
 But he warned that if the current round of diplomatic efforts does not 
persuade North Korea to accede to international inspection, "the next step has 
to be sanctions." He said the allies probably will make that decision in "a 
month to six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry also raised the possibility that the allies might eventually impose a 
naval embargo on North Korea if it becomes necessary to block movement of 
military equipment or components in or out of the country as part of a series 
of U.N.-ordered sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an undertaking, now, which is very close to war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said he plans to travel to South Korea in mid-April to meet with 
officials, review the situation and discuss proposals for bolstering U.S. and 
South Korean defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has already decided to ship Patriot air-defense missiles to 
South Korea and has begun considering a new request from Gen. Gary E. Luck, the 
senior U.S. commander on the Korean peninsula, for additional moves to bolster 
U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration generally believes that North Korea is only posturing in 
its warnings that sanctions will trigger a full-scale war, but U.S. 
policy-makers regard Pyongyang as so unpredictable that they are making 
contingency plans anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very limited knowledge of what drives the thinking of the 
leadership in the North Korean government," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the unknowns, he said, is "what is likely to cause them to respond in a 
positive way, what's likely to cause them to respond in a negative . . . way." 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate steps that Perry said the Pentagon is taking to strengthen U.S. 
and South Korean forces are modest. They include transferring more weapons to 
the South Koreans, providing their pilots with special training and 
pre-positioning more aircraft parts and munitions there. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of them is very dramatic," Perry said, "but the net effect is that we 
could get large quantities of tactical (aircraft) -- in particular with . . . 
anti-armor munitions -- to the field and in an operating mode in a matter of a 
few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry repeated the list of possible sanctions that the allies are considering, 
ranging from economic restrictions such as blocking financial flows or oil to 
North Korea to an attempt to cut off the import or export of military 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there are no plans now to increase the number of U.S. troops in South 
Korea. The United States has 37,000 soldiers in the country, while the South 
Korean army totals about 650,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said shortcomings in South Korean defenses are "a matter of concern to 
us," particularly in view of the North Korean force, which includes more than 1 
million soldiers, backed by massive numbers of tanks and artillery, within a 
few miles of the border.

COLUMN ONE; WHEN LAW, TRAGEDY INTERSECT; THE EMOTIONALLY CHARGED SETTLEMENT IN

AND COMPLEX LITIGATION AND STILL HAVE MONEY LEFT OVER FOR THE VICTIMS.

<P>
 It was 6:30 p.m. -- cocktail hour -- and some of the day's most important work 
was about to begin for U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 As a jazz combo played, the 24-year veteran of the federal bench purposefully 
roamed around a dimly lit reception room at a downtown Holiday Inn.  
</P>
<P>
 One moment, Pointer was chatting with a high-priced attorney representing 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Inc. Next, drink in hand, he acknowledged the greeting of 
an affluent Cincinnati lawyer who specializes in class-action cases. Later, 
Pointer, 59, listened intently to a Long Island woman who runs a foundation 
that is concerned about children affected by toxic substances. 
</P>
<P>
 All these people have one thing in common. They are enmeshed in some of the 
most complicated, emotionally charged and potentially expensive litigation in 
U.S. history -- the claims of thousands of women who say they were seriously 
injured by several major U.S. corporations that marketed silicone gel breast 
implants without adequate safety testing or health warnings. There are even 
contentions that children have become ill drinking the breast milk of women who 
had implants. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointer's "cocktail hour" was part of a strategy to find a way to resolve 
6,000 federal breast implant lawsuits that were consolidated here, and perhaps 
pave the way to clear many of the 6,000 cases pending in state courts. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year, Pointer has been meeting with all of the major 
participants for drinks before each month's formal status conference in court. 
He guided them, listened to them, calmed them.  
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, there was a major development. 
</P>
<P>
 Three major defendants -- Dow Corning, Baxter International and Bristol-Myers 
-- reached a record-breaking $3.75-billion settlement with a coalition of 
plaintiffs' lawyers. Several other companies have tentatively agreed to put in 
another $170 million, bringing the settlement pot to almost $4 billion. 
Negotiations are continuing with several other large companies, including 3M, 
which could enrich the settlement by hundreds of millions more. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement -- which will be the richest of its kind if it is approved by 
Pointer after a June hearing on its fairness -- may enable thousands of women 
to resolve their cases without a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, this development comes at a time when many experts question the 
ability of the American legal system to cope with such "mass torts," where law, 
science and human tragedy intersect on a Gargantuan scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "The processing and resolution of mass tort cases have been slow and 
expensive, and have produced results that have sometimes seemed capricious," a 
1991 study by RAND's Institute of Civil Justice noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Looming over the implant lawsuits is the specter of two decades of unconcluded 
asbestos litigation, which has driven 18 companies into bankruptcy and made 
millionaires of dozens of lawyers while sick people died without a trial. The 
crush of filings overwhelmed courts throughout the country.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our system didn't do a very good job of handling the asbestos cases," Pointer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Congress, other judges, lawyers on both sides, and thousands of 
women hope that Pointer, a specialist in complex litigation, can help prevent a 
repeat of that debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 A special panel of federal judges transferred all the federal breast implant 
cases to him in June, 1992, after a bitter conflict arose as to how the 
lawsuits should be handled. 
</P>
<P>
 If Pointer can oversee a broad-gauged settlement that works fairly and 
efficiently, it could help many women and their families, leave companies with 
more money to compensate the sick rather than lawyers, and be a great boon to a 
legal system that faces the prospect of becoming more clogged from the implant 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is his Sistine Chapel," said Tennessee trial lawyer David E. Waite, who 
represents more than 100 women who are suing implant manufacturers. "He's going 
to prove that the tort system can work." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge does not tend to speak in such grandiose terms. He simply said: 
"It's certainly the most challenging situation I've faced in terms of 
everything involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when the cases landed on Pointer's doorstep, the legal situation was 
far from a Sistine Chapel. It was more like a runaway train. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The government estimates that 1 million women in this country have gotten 
silicone gel breast implants, about 80% for cosmetic reasons and 20% during 
reconstructive surgery after mastectomies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the implants were initially marketed in the United States in 1962 and 
the first multimillion-dollar verdict came a decade ago, until recently there 
were few signs that the devices would generate an avalanche of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But just before Christmas, 1991, there was a critical turn of events. A San 
Francisco jury awarded a woman $7.5 million for injuries caused by her implants 
-- $6.5 million of it punitive damages against Dow. The case was the third 
multimillion-dollar verdict in a breast implant case in 1991; the others came 
in Alabama and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, one of the woman's lawyers, Dan C. Bolton, sent a letter to 
Dr. David A. Kessler, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, 
describing some of the company documents that had been revealed during the 
trial and accusing Dow of "engaging in a consistent pattern of corporate deceit 
and dishonesty related to the safety of implants." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter heightened Kessler's concerns about the safety of implants and on 
Jan. 6, 1992, he announced a moratorium on their manufacture until further 
studies could be performed.  
</P>
<P>
 Within a month, what had been a trickle of personal injury cases became a 
flood and lawyers for manufacturers of implants soon realized that their 
clients had a major problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became pretty obvious there would be mass filings of lawsuits," and 
rapidly escalating costs to defend them, said James R. Jenkins, Dow Corning's 
general counsel.  
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins maintained that Dow has a good defense to the lawsuits: "There has 
been no definitive link shown between implants" and various medical problems 
that women have developed -- including scleroderma, lupus, autoimmune diseases, 
neurological impairments, tremors, muscle inflammation, burning pain in the 
extremities and short-term memory loss. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jenkins acknowledged that some scientists would testify that there is a 
link between implants and medical problems. And he understood that their 
testimony, combined with troubling internal documents of the type used in the 
San Francisco case, would mean "a lot of these cases would end up going to a 
jury," where anything could happen. 
</P>
<P>
 So after consulting with Dow Chairman R. Keith McKennon, he called Kenneth R. 
Feinberg, a Washington lawyer who specializes in settling big cases, including 
one lodged by Vietnam veterans against Dow Chemical and other companies 
stemming from injuries believed to have been caused by the Vietnam-era 
defoliant Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agreed Ken would go out and talk confidentially to plaintiffs' lawyers, 
some of whom he knew from other cases," Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months later, officials of Deerfield, Ill.-based Baxter, the nation's 
largest hospital supply company, reached a similar conclusion. Baxter retained 
David I. Shapiro, a high-powered Washington lawyer who had built a reputation 
for hammering out major agreements between warring parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara-based implant manufacturer Mentor Corp., a considerably smaller 
company, also saw trouble on the horizon, according to its attorney, William B. 
Griffin of San Francisco's Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison. "They looked into the 
future and saw disaster. . . . They were being engulfed in the legal equivalent 
of war, and like Napoleon's Russian campaign, a war that can only be lost, even 
if all the battles are won." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin wanted peace, but before he could initiate talks he had to figure out 
who could negotiate for the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, Cincinnati attorney Stanley M. Chesley filed a federal 
class-action suit on behalf of women who had implants. Chesley had become a 
wealthy man during the last 20 years by filing early class-action suits after 
mass disasters such as the MGM Grand fire in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Many trial lawyers loathe Chesley because they think he settles cases too 
cheaply, depriving plaintiffs of the possibility of a larger recovery. 
Moreover, by moving the cases into the class-action arena, Chesley strips other 
attorneys of the chance to try cases individually and earn large fees 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chesley had very few breast implant clients, he was rapidly granted 
permission to proceed by U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin, a jurist before whom 
Chesley had appeared many times. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of plaintiffs' lawyers immediately challenged Rubin's ruling. They 
asked a special panel of federal judges to move the issue out of Cincinnati and 
consolidate all the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1992, the special panel sent the cases to the Birmingham 
courtroom of Pointer, who had written a manual for federal judges on how to 
handle complex litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointer, a 1970 appointee of President Richard Nixon, had a reputation as an 
incisive questioner and was widely viewed as the ideal candidate for a tough 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, Pointer made it clear that he would not permit the sort of 
scorched earth tactics -- such as costly, lengthy and pointless fights over 
turning over key documents -- that have come to dominate civil litigation in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 He commanded the defendants to turn over all potentially relevant documents 
and on one occasion roasted a defense lawyer who was vigorously resisting. By 
now, more than 6 million documents have been collected, indexed and placed on 
CD-ROMS. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointer also directed both sides to swiftly conduct depositions so that cases 
could be readied for trial. He told warring plaintiffs' lawyers that they would 
have to moderate their differences and function as a unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointer appointed a 17-member plaintiffs steering committee, chaired by 
Chesley and Ralph Knowles of Atlanta, one of the original leaders of the Breast 
Implant Litigation Group of the Assn. of Trial Lawyers of America. The 
committee has responsibility for the overall management of litigation for the 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 (In turn, Dow Corning hired three large law firms, Chicago's Kirkland & Ellis, 
Cincinnati's Dinsmore & Shohl and New York's Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & 
Flom, as well as smaller firms in virtually every state. Baxter's defense is 
spearheaded by Santa Monica's Dickson, Carlson & Campillo and Bristol-Myers by 
McCarter & English of Newark, N.J.) 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also urged lawyers on both sides, and other interested parties such 
as leaders of breast implant support groups, to attend the monthly cocktail 
parties. The social gatherings give Pointer an opportunity in an informal 
setting to hear what's on everyone's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The reception technique, virtually unheard of in legal circles, also is 
designed to foster civility among the most hostile of adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all the attorneys said the cocktail parties had helped create an 
atmosphere that enhanced the possibility of a massive settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "For lack of a better word, there have been no New York-style antics in the 
courtroom," said Frank Woodside of Cincinnati, one of three national counsels 
for Dow Corning. "The level of advocacy has not been reduced, but the level of 
animosity has." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge paid particular attention to the plaintiffs, whose voices sometimes 
get lost in the labyrinth of large litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Pointer . . . listens to our concerns," said Sybil Goldrich, a Beverly 
Hills woman who blames numerous illnesses on her implants and is co-founder of 
the Command Trust Network, a nationwide information clearinghouse for breast 
implant recipients. The judge also gave Goldrich and representatives of similar 
groups the opportunity to speak in court. In one instance, he went along with 
Goldrich's recommendation that hundreds of women -- who, without lawyers, had 
earlier settled cases for small amounts of money -- be allowed to participate 
in the large settlement anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the plaintiffs' lawyers gained momentum, borrowing several million 
dollars to finance their research efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bristol-Myers turned over 12 million documents from its Medical Engineering 
subsidiary in Racine, Wis. Gayle L. Troutwine, a Portland attorney, said a 
coalition of 20 plaintiffs' lawyers and paralegals went to Racine, where they 
"culled the documents down to 1 million" that appeared relevant and sent them 
off to a depository in Cincinnati for indexing and potential use later. 
(Troutwine said the documents helped her settle five cases against 
Bristol-Myers in 1993, including one for $900,000 and another for $400,000.) 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, concern mounted among the companies when a Houston jury awarded $25 
million, including $20 million in punitive damages, to a Texas woman for the 
damage caused to her body when her silicone gel implants ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict precipitated the filings of hundreds of more lawsuits during the 
next several weeks, making it necessary for the Harris County, Tex., District 
Court clerk to add a night shift so that her workers could process all the 
paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 A new adversary also popped up for the implant manufacturers -- their 
insurance carriers were starting to resist coverage of legal bills, which were 
mounting dramatically. Dow is reported to be spending $10 million a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next several months, Chesley and Knowles, joined by attorneys 
Margaret M. Branch of Albuquerque, Elizabeth J. Cabrasser of San Francisco and 
Arnold Levin of Philadelphia, forged a $25.8-million settlement with Mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, several plaintiffs lawyers said that was "chump change" compared to a 
deal that was being secretly negotiated between Chesley and Knowles for the 
plaintiffs and attorneys representing Dow and Baxter.  
</P>
<P>
 When word of the secret talks leaked out in spring, 1993, internecine warfare 
among the plaintiffs lawyers was reignited. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next three days were the worst 72 hours of my life," said Francis H. 
Hare, a genial Birmingham lawyer called "Brother" by just about everyone. Hare, 
a longtime leader of the Assn. of Trial Lawyers of America, had been brought 
into the secret negotiations as a consultant to the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got calls saying 'Brother, you won't believe what's happened. . . . They're 
trying to take my cases away," Hare said.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Hare was released from his pledge of confidentiality. "Then, I had to 
call my friends back and tell them I had been part of the secret negotiations," 
Hare said. Among the angriest were Margaret Branch and Houston trial lawyer 
Michael T. Gallagher, both of whom represent several hundred women with 
implants. 
</P>
<P>
 After another stormy hearing in Pointer's courtroom, Branch and Gallagher were 
added to the plaintiffs' negotiating team. So was Cabrasser of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The expanded team started meeting with the other side: Feinberg for Dow, 
Shapiro for Baxter and John L. McGoldrick, the Harvard-educated lawyer 
representing Bristol-Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 There was considerable sparring at the start, according to numerous sources. 
</P>
<P>
 At an early meeting at a New York hotel, McGoldrick declared that everything 
the negotiators agreed on would "have to be approved by people at 345 Park 
Ave.," a reference to Bristol-Myers' nearby corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "What city is that in?" retorted Gallagher, a wealthy Texas trial lawyer who 
takes his own jet to court hearings around the country and is unimpressed with 
East Coast locales and Ivy League pedigrees. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the defense negotiators had spirited arguments among themselves -- 
including several debates over how much each company's share of the deal would 
be. One session in a hot tub at the Canyon Ranch resort in the Berkshire 
Mountains in Massachusetts became so agitated that other exasperated bathers 
told Feinberg, Shapiro and McGoldrick they had to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most heated aspects of the bargaining between the defendants and 
plaintiffs were debates over definitions of diseases for which women could be 
compensated in the highly complex settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We argued over every word in those definitions," said Liz Dudley, a Wichita, 
Kan., registered nurse who has worked as a paralegal medical specialist for a 
decade and has compiled a database of 1,200 medical and scientific articles on 
implants for the plaintiffs. After months of haggling, Dudley said, Feinberg, 
Dow's lead negotiator, finally agreed to the definitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stormed into the meeting room at the Carlyle Hotel in New York at 2 a.m. 
He had the papers with the definitions rolled up in his hand. He was screaming: 
'We'll give you your damn disease definitions!' " (Dudley said that comment was 
tepid, compared to much of the language during negotiations. Feinberg declined 
comment.) 
</P>
<P>
 The true test of the accord is about to begin.  
</P>
<P>
 It is perhaps the most elaborate products liability settlement ever designed 
and contains so many escape hatches it could still fall apart months from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Women will be making decisions on whether to join the settlement, based on a 
host of factors. Among them are the nature of their injuries and their desire 
to avoid lengthy court battles, in which they would have to undergo questions 
about intimate details of their lives. (Women seeking details about the 
settlement can call a court information phone line at (800) 887-6828).  
</P>
<P>
 If the settlement attracts more participants than expected, it could drive 
down the individual shares, now estimated at $160,000 to $1.6 million per 
plaintiff, depending on the extent of her injuries. If other companies join the 
settlement, those amounts could go up to a range of $200,000 to $2 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Lower payouts could prompt women to drop out, and a smaller than anticipated 
class of plaintiffs could be grounds for the defendant corporations to walk 
away from the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big question now is whether there are sufficient funds" to cover all the 
claims women are expected to file, said Albuquerque, N.M., lawyer Branch, who 
was on the plaintiff's negotiating team. "If not, I certainly would hope the 
defendants would contribute more money so that the compensation amounts will 
not have to be reduced. For the companies to reduce these compensation amounts 
would produce a flood of 'opt-outs' that would jeopardize the entire 
settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 Some plaintiffs' attorneys have indicated that they believe their clients 
would fare better in a court trial, and hope to proceed with their cases this 
year. Breast Implant Lawsuit

PRI FACES A CHANGED NATION IN QUEST FOR NEW CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of this nation's ruling party struggled on Friday with a vastly 
changed political landscape as they sought to come up with a successor for 
their assassinated presidential hopeful, Luis Donaldo Colosio, who was buried 
in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other maneuvers, activists for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, or PRI, as it is known, appeared to be testing to see whether the 
planned Aug. 21 national election could be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 But their overtures were met with staunch resistance from opposition parties. 
</P>
<P>
 PRI strategists, analysts said, were likely seeking new flexibility on the 
election date so as to widen the field of possible presidential candidates; 
their options are now limited by a Mexican constitutional restriction. 
</P>
<P>
 It prohibits Cabinet members and other top-ranking government officials -- the 
sort of individuals from whose ranks a presidential aspirant might normally 
emerge -- from running for president within six months of leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
 But leaders of the PRI, which has governed this nation for 65 years, may want 
a range of presidential prospects to consider, especially since their candidate 
potentially will have to deal with a changed Mexico after Colosio's 
assassination Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, when Colosio was named the PRI candidate, Mexico was a country 
that had moved in a decade from disaster to partnership in the world's largest 
trading bloc. Despite its need for domestic political adjustments and its 
problems with drug trafficking, many analysts hailed this nation as an economic 
model for the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 The main duty for its next president, analysts said, once may have been simply 
to ensure the continuity of the present government's policies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Colosio's successor, experts said, will now be expected to prove that he 
can lead a nation with an Indian rebellion in its southern state of Chiapas and 
growing concerns about public safety -- fears that were brought home by 
Colosio's assassination at a campaign rally in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Colosio was buried in his hometown of Magdalena de Kino in northern Mexico 
after his family decided against his planned cremation. "Bullets of hate, 
rancor and cowardice interrupted the life of Luis Donaldo Colosio, abruptly 
ending his existence, but not the ideas for which he fought," said his widow, 
Diana Laura Riojas, at a graveside service. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Indian rebels shelved for now a draft peace agreement, charging that the 
government is poised to restart the war. The rebels said in a communique that 
the government is going to use the assassination as an excuse to attack them, 
the Associated Press reported. "We are on red alert," the statement said. There 
was no reaction from the government. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the first day of trading since the assassination, the Mexican Stock 
Exchange closed at 2,520.78, down 22.79 points -- less than 1%, compared to 
Wednesday's close. The peso held at 3.36 to the dollar at exchange houses. The 
market dropped just a little more than 4% early in the day, but it quickly 
recovered. Traders said they believed that this nation's financial crisis had 
probably passed, since trading is traditionally light during Holy Week, which 
starts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mario Aburto Martinez, the suspected assassin, was moved and arraigned in a 
court near the capital. He now formally stands accused of premeditated murder 
and carrying a gun without a permit. He was sent to a maximum-security prison 
near the capital, where he was surrounded by guards carrying submachine guns 
under the tightest security available. He was placed in a glass cage at 
Mexico's newest prison, where small groups of photographers were allowed to 
take pictures of him as he looked straight ahead, showing no emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 * President Carlos Salinas de Gortari appointed Supreme Court Justice Miguel 
Montes as special prosecutor to investigate Colosio's killing. A congressional 
commission also left for Tijuana to begin an independent investigation of 
Colosio's death. The Political Scramble 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of grieving, Mexicans returned to their national sport of reading 
political tea leaves, guessing who the new PRI candidate -- and, thus, the de 
facto next president of this country -- might be. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mexico City Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis, at first considered a favorite, 
appeared to have taken himself out of the running when he was strongly rejected 
Thursday by the crowds outside Colosio's wake. 
</P>
<P>
 That seemed to open the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main constraint for PRI strategists appeared to be finding a prominent 
party member who has not held a high government office in the last month so the 
individual could meet the constitutional requirement and would have been out of 
office for six months by the Aug. 21 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation in some circles was that, after having fielded a string of 
economists for Mexico's top job, the party might opt for a candidate with a law 
enforcement background. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are increasingly concerned about public safety," social commentator 
Homero Aridjis said. The assassination, combined with a series of high-profile 
kidnapings -- the most recent one this month -- has intensified Mexicans' 
general sense of insecurity, especially in cities where violence traditionally 
has been minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 That thinking is believed to favor former Interior Minister Fernando Gutierrez 
Barrios. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sergio Aguayo, a human rights activist, also cautioned that in Mexico, 
unlike in the United States, public safety is not identified with the police, 
who are often corrupt. "People concerned about law and order want more control 
of the police," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Mexican business community, it still favors a candidate with strong 
economic credentials. The most prominent PRI economist not in a top government 
post now is Ernesto Zedillo, Colosio's campaign manager. While his credentials 
as an economist are respected, Zedillo had a mixed record as head of the 
now-defunct Planning and Budget Ministry; he was enmeshed in a scandal over 
compulsory textbooks when he was education minister. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Fidel Velazquez, the curmudgeonly leader of the 
government-affiliated labor movement, cautioned that those handicapping the 
presidential race should not discount the real favorite of the business and 
financial community: Treasury Minister Pedro Aspe Armella. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspe appears to be ineligible, because he will have been in office too 
recently to meet the constitutional prohibitions. But, Velazquez argued, "laws 
can be interpreted." 
</P>
<P>
 The mood of the country, however, also appears increasingly to be turning 
against such re-interpretations. "We need a greater democratic opening," Aguayo 
said. "The proof of that will be clean elections this year." The Funeral 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of mourners gathered in Magdalena de Kino, a northern desert cattle 
town where Colosio was born, to say goodby to their beloved politician. 
</P>
<P>
 As his metal coffin -- draped in the red-white-and-green Mexican flag -- was 
lowered into the ground, men and women wept, Reuters news service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral ribbons fashioned from plastic bags were strung from road signs. 
Groups of schoolchildren were among the thousands who lined the highway from 
the Mexican border town of Nogales to Colosio's hometown, 50 miles to the 
south, the Associated Press said. Some held Mexican flags and Colosio campaign 
posters.

report.

WHITE HOUSE SEEKS WIDE SMOKING BAN; HEALTH: PLAN WOULD APPLY TO ALL WORKPLACES, 
AFFECTING 20 MILLION PEOPLE, LABOR SECRETARY SAYS. MEANWHILE, CONGRESS TAKES UP 
ISSUE OF LETTING FDA REGULATE TOBACCO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration unveiled a sweeping anti-smoking proposal Friday 
that would ban virtually all indoor smoking wherever people work -- from 
restaurants and bars to offices to factory canteens and nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented action would affect 6 million workplaces and protect "more 
than 20 million working men and women (who) face unnecessary health threats" 
from secondhand smoke, said Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lives will be saved, health care costs reduced and productivity increased," 
he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich's announcement was the latest in a series of setbacks for smokers and 
the tobacco industry. It came on a day that Congress began considering a 
request by the Food and Drug Administration for guidance on whether to regulate 
tobacco products as drugs, a move that Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) 
said could lead to nicotine-free cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-smoking rule will be published within the next 10 days by the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, with public hearings to follow 
that could lead to some alterations. The Administration does not need 
congressional approval of the rule, which might not take effect until 1996, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In buildings where smoking is not prohibited by employers or local laws, the 
rule would allow designated smoking areas, provided they are separate, enclosed 
rooms with direct ventilation to the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich's announcement was criticized by the tobacco industry but hailed by 
anti-smoking advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tobacco Institute said that it intends to challenge OSHA's authority to 
impose the no-smoking rule. Brennan Dawson, an institute spokeswoman, also said 
that the proposal may not be as revolutionary as it might seem because about 
80% of employers already restrict smoking in one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scott Ballin, vice president and legislative counsel for the American 
Heart Assn., said the organization is "very pleased that the Labor Department 
and OSHA have taken this initiative. It's clearly a major step."  
</P>
<P>
 While many cities, including Los Angeles, already have adopted measures to 
restrict public smoking, Ballin said, "this is saying that it's a national 
problem and it needs a national effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Webster of the National Restaurant Assn. said that most of the 
organization's 550,000 members believe decisions over whether smoking should be 
allowed in restaurants and bars belong to individual owners and their 
clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Harrington, the association's director of technical services, declined to 
comment specifically about the rule Friday afternoon, saying that he needs more 
time to study it. Still, he said he is troubled by what appears to be 
potentially onerous burdens on employers to develop indoor air-quality 
compliance programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This looks like it's another written compliance plan for another OSHA 
standard that, when you're all done, you still won't know if you're in 
compliance or not -- until you get a citation," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed regulation would require employers to develop programs to inspect 
and maintain their ventilation systems.  
</P>
<P>
 "This proposed rule on indoor air quality and environmental tobacco smoke is 
part of the most ambitious standard-setting agenda in OSHA history," said 
Reich, whose department oversees OSHA. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed federal regulation would have less impact in Los Angeles than in 
most other big cities because smoking has been banned in Los Angeles 
restaurants since 1993, although bars are exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 While many restaurant owners have blamed no-smoking bans for reducing income, 
Jeff Prince, senior director of the National Restaurant Assn. said there are no 
hard statistics to document the effects of such restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1993 association poll, 56% of Americans said that they would be more 
likely to go to a no-smoking restaurant while 26% said they would be less 
inclined to do so, Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, Waxman's Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the 
environment convened several panels of medical experts as well as tobacco 
industry officials and anti-smoking advocates to launch what clearly will be a 
long and contentious debate over whether the FDA should regulate cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler publicly asserted his agency's 
authority to classify nicotine as a drug -- a move that could lead to the 
regulation or even banning of virtually all cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Kessler all but accused the tobacco industry of stoking a public 
addiction, citing "accumulating" evidence that nicotine content in cigarettes 
is being manipulated by manufacturers for that very end -- thus making 
cigarettes for all practical purposes a drug that falls under FDA purview. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler also testified Friday, calling some cigarettes "high-technology 
nicotine delivery systems" that feed smokers the substance in "quantities that 
are more than sufficient to create and to sustain addiction" in most smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the hearing focused on the intricacies of cigarette-making, with 
industry representatives vociferously denying that manufacturers manipulate 
nicotine content. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kessler cited numerous patents obtained by cigarette makers for various 
processes that control nicotine levels. Such sophistication, he said, "more and 
more resembles the actions of a pharmaceutical manufacturer." 
</P>
<P>
 But Alexander W. Spears III, a North Carolina tobacco company executive, 
argued that the existence of patents does not mean that manufacturers are 
actually using the processes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.), a staunch tobacco foe, urged Congress to force 
cigarette makers to disclose all ingredients but said that banning all tobacco 
products would be "cruel and unusual punishment" to those who are addicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco industry advocates, including Sherwin Gardner, a former deputy FDA 
commissioner, said that the FDA should not be asked to regulate tobacco 
products because it is already overburdened and any new responsibilities would 
further slow its ability to approve new drugs. Cleaning the Air

<P>
 Some recent smoking restrictions and anti-smoking activities around the 
country: 
</P>
<P>
 * Labor Department: Announced Friday that it will propose a sweeping ban of 
smoking in all the nation's workplaces, including industrial plants, 
restaurants, offices and other commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defense Department: Announced on March 7 that it would ban smoking in all of 
its workplaces worldwide effective April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Food and Drug Administration: Commissioner David A. Kessler announced on 
Feb. 25 that he believes the agency has the statutory authority to regulate 
cigarettes as drugs, opening the way to curtail or ultimately remove cigarettes 
from the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 * Congress: Is considering legislation to ban smoking in all public places, 
including bars, restaurants, casinos, stores, bowling alleys, office buildings, 
and federal, state and local government buildings. It also is weighing a hefty 
increase in the cigarette tax to help finance health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 * Restaurants: McDonald's, Taco Bell and Jack in the Box have recently 
announced smoking bans for all employees and customers in their establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 * New York City: City Council leadership announced March 16 that it will seek 
to ban smoking in virtually all public places, including outdoor areas such as 
arenas and playgrounds as well as most restaurants and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maryland: The Licensing and Regulation Department on March 8 announced a 
smoking ban in enclosed public spaces, such as malls, bars, restaurants and 
stores, and all indoor public and private workplaces, except in specific 
smoking rooms, effective in May. 
</P>
<P>
 * Washington state: The Labor and Industries Department said on March 14 that 
it will prohibit smoking in all public and private offices except specially 
ventilated smoking rooms, effective Sept. 1.

NEW L.A. POLICY SETS OFF SCHOOL SHOPPING FRENZY; EDUCATION: OPEN ENROLLMENT 
PROMPTS FAMILIES TO PORE OVER OPTIONS. SOME TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT PUBLIC 
SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District, parents are buzzing: 
Finally, they can enroll their children anywhere in the system regardless of 
where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 School shopping has become a full-time job for some parents, who are 
interviewing principals, attending classes and orientation meetings and 
collecting test scores. Even parents who were considering private schools are 
rethinking their options. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is THE topic everywhere -- at the park, at PTA meetings, if you run into 
a friend who has a 4-year-old. There is no one who doesn't talk about this," 
said Maggie Scott, a parent in the Miracle Mile area who is shopping for an 
elementary school for her son. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education this week gave parents more freedom to choose a new 
school within the Los Angeles district -- as long as racial balances remain 
intact and classroom seats are available. Under the new guidelines, parents no 
longer have to receive the principal's permission before withdrawing children 
from their school and enrolling them elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the open enrollment policy leaves families with some obstacles -- 
especially the lack of space at many desirable schools -- a great number of 
parents view it as a new lease on school life. Many parents have complained 
about low test scores, bad teachers, bilingual education hindering the progress 
of other students and campus violence but have been unable to move because of 
district red tape and a policy encouraging parents to stay with neighborhood 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before school offices received the bulletin outlining the open enrollment 
rules, campuses began fielding calls from interested parents. Schools primarily 
on the Westside and in the west San Fernando Valley are drawing the most 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristi Thomas, office manager at Tarzana Elementary School, said: "The parents 
seem to know more about this than we at the schools know." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be because parents have made the open enrollment season their game, 
analyzing test scores, class sizes, even racial balances in search of an ideal, 
or at least acceptable, school. One parent attended a school play one night 
recently to check out the other parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm totally consumed by this whole thing right now," said Janet DiMartino, a 
Sherman Oaks parent who is looking at public and private schools for her son. 
"The range is just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Broadsky, a parent from Encino, said: "I've gone to a lot of meetings. 
I've talked to five different principals. I've gone through the phone book and 
every source that I can." 
</P>
<P>
 She has even put together her own comparative school guide highlighting the 
issues that are important to her: academic program, athletics and enrichment 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals say they are getting calls from parents whose children attend 
private schools and who are now considering enrolling them in public schools. 
DiMartino said she is treating public school as a more serious option now that 
open enrollment is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The maze of enrollment policies and admission permits -- and the dearth of 
guiding information from the school district -- has left many parents 
frustrated. Some parents say they rely mostly on neighborhood rumor mills for 
information about one of the most important decisions they will make for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are on your own and there is a great deal of confusion," said Scott, the 
Miracle Mile mother. "What I would like to see from the district -- although I 
am sure they will tell me there are a million reasons why it can't be done -- 
is a single document, a guide that outlines all the various ways you can go to 
a school, from day care permits to magnet schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent frustrations likely will grow as the school shopping frenzy reaches a 
peak after May 16, the day that schools will release their count of available 
slots and make applications available. Many of the schools that parents regard 
as most desirable will not have nearly enough space to satisfy demand. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say they have the solution. Rather than traditional waiting 
lists, principals will hold lotteries to draw names of parents who want their 
children to attend a particular school. The state-mandated random drawings, 
scheduled for June 14, will be monitored by a three-member committee: the 
principal, a teacher and a parent. 
</P>
<P>
 But some highly sought-after schools may not get to the lottery stage. 
Principals at schools with high parent interest -- Carpenter Avenue Elementary 
in Studio City, Third Street Elementary in Hancock Park and Welby Way in Canoga 
Park -- say they likely will not have much space to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 The state law that ordered school districts to allow open enrollment gives 
first priority for space to students who live in the neighborhood. Students who 
are bused for integration and to relieve overcrowding also have priority, along 
with students whose parents work or use day care in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling parents that the good news is there's open enrollment; the bad 
news is we don't have space," said Joan Marks, the principal at Carpenter, 
where hundreds of parents typically show up for orientation meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away, at Sherman Oaks Elementary School, principal Ed Krojansky 
said he expects to have room for about 75 students. "This school does have a 
reputation for having a high-quality program so I was not surprised by the 
level of interest," he said. "We welcome it and we're ready." 
</P>
<P>
 If the new enrollment policy is a boon to parents, it can also benefit 
schools. With more students, principals can hire more teachers, offer more 
classes and increase parent involvement. It also could improve morale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us a nice boost that people are appreciating what we do," said Linda 
Pacheco, principal at Germain Street School in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some school board members have hailed open enrollment as a major step 
in education reform, others have expressed reservations. Board President 
Leticia Quezada said parents' expectations have been raised too high and that 
excitement over the program could sour if parents are shut out of their first 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crux of this issue will be what schools are on the list and whether the 
available space matches the interest out in the parent community," Quezada 
said. "If they don't match, then we are going to have a lot of frustrated 
parents out there and I really want to minimize that." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the open enrollment policy does not guarantee bus transportation, 
Quezada and others said options for some parents could be limited. 
"Unfortunately, parents in my district find themselves working two jobs. Often 
they don't have cars to even transport them to work," said Quezada, who 
represents parts of the Eastside and the northeast Valley. "They really don't 
have a choice. Choice means nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although district officials have estimated 50,000 openings in 500 schools, 
parents say they are skeptical about where those openings will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real question is: Is there really going to be any spots for choice 
applications in the best schools, in the schools everyone cares about?" asked 
Susan Bernard, a Westside parent. "It seems there is going to be a lot of 
space, but where?" 
</P>
<P>
 As board member Julie Korenstein put it: "I think it's going to take at least 
a year before we see whether it was a real option or something on paper that 
just looked nice." 
</P>
<P>
 The state law, authored by Assemblywoman Dede Alpert (D-Coronado), directed 
all school districts to adopt similar open enrollment guidelines. The law was 
sparked by the school voucher movement that offered parents tax credits to help 
offset private school tuition. 
</P>
<P>

THE TIMES POLL; ROBERTI HOLDS WIDE LEAD IN RECALL ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) is holding a wide lead in his fight 
to beat back an April 12 recall election that has been largely organized by 
firearms rights advocates and is being closely watched nationally as a 
referendum on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times poll conducted March 19-24 found that among 1,151 potential voters in 
his San Fernando Valley district, Roberti holds a 40% to 22% advantage. And 
among those likely to vote in what is expected to be an election with a very 
low turnout, Roberti enjoys a commanding lead of 62% to 28% with only 10% 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's campaign message appears to be on target for 20th District voters, 
who are highly supportive of gun control laws and heavily Democratic, and who 
widely view the recall election as a waste of taxpayers' money. Three-quarters 
of the voters say gun control laws should be stricter. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti has portrayed the recall as the work of "assault weapons extremists" 
seeking revenge for his writing a 1989 state law banning the sale of 
military-style semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti calls the recall, which will cost an estimated $800,000, a waste 
because he must retire in December as a result of voter-imposed term limits. 
Two-thirds of those polled agreed that the election is a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roberti election is seen as a major test of strength between gun control 
advocates and opponents and has attracted a national audience, with prominent 
gun control advocate Sarah Brady making the fight a priority of her group, 
Handgun Control Inc. Brady is the wife of former presidential press secretary 
James Brady, who was shot and critically injured in a 1981 assassination 
attempt on then-President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the National Rifle Assn. is not officially involved in the recall 
effort, many gun rights groups have contributed money and time to the cause, 
including Gun Owners of California, a group founded by former state Sen. H. L. 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti is running for state treasurer, and his political handlers are hoping 
that the attention he has gained from the recall election will help him as he 
battles Phil Angelides in the June primary for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's opponents are just now preparing a direct-mail offensive. To date, 
their campaign has suffered from a lack of money and an inability to generate 
widespread publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti has said he expects to spend $750,000 to beat the recall attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The race looked different in January, when the Coalition to Restore Government 
Integritysurprised many political observers by collecting more than 20,000 
signatures on petitions and forcing Roberti into the recall election.  
</P>
<P>
 It is the first recall attempt against an elected state official in 80 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Roberti spent more than $2 million to win 43% of the vote and a 
narrow victory over four poorly funded challengers.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Times Poll Director John Brennan, "it looks like firearms rights 
advocates have picked the wrong time and place to make their case against gun 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 The 20th District, which includes Reseda, Van Nuys, North Hollywood, Panorama 
City, Pacoima and Sylmar, is Democratic by a 2-1 margin in voter registration, 
Brennan noted, and residents are preoccupied with concerns about crime, 
violence and gangs and are strongly disposed in favor of gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all voters, the Times poll found widespread support for gun control. A 
total of 74% of the voters said they believe stricter gun control measures are 
needed, while another 67% said the NRA wields too much influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all voters surveyed by The Times, 83% said they supported Roberti's 1989 
legislation to ban the sale of so-called assault weapons and require owners who 
purchased the weapons before the ban to register them. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-quarters of those surveyed put crime-related issues at the top of their 
list of community problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, voters who favored Roberti volunteered that the senator's position 
on gun control was their biggest reason for supporting him. Among his 
supporters, 31% are voting for Roberti because of his gun control position, 
while 14% said they were voting for the incumbent because the gun lobby was 
ganging up on him. A total of 17% said they were voting for him because they 
believe he was doing a good job; 15% said he did not deserve to be recalled, 
and 10% said the recall was a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not crazy about Roberti," said Reseda resident Lynne Walsh, who cited, 
for example, the senator's opposition to abortion. "But I'm voting for him to 
send a message to the NRA." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Harrison, a homemaker from North Hills, said she did not understand why 
Roberti should be recalled when his term is nearly up. "Why waste the money?" 
said Harrison, who also took a shot at the National Rifle Assn. "They are so 
one-sided that they can't see the possibility that gun control would help 
reduce violent crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is an NRA member, electronics engineer John Long said he would 
vote to keep Roberti in office. "He hasn't done anything wrong," Long said. 
"Besides, who needs to own those MAC-10 and AK-47 assault weapons?" 
</P>
<P>
 The recall proponents have also called Roberti corrupt, charging that the 
Senate's former president pro tempore shares responsibility for the political 
corruption that has rocked Sacramento in recent years and resulted in the 
conviction of half a dozen prominent Capitol figures, including former Sen. 
Alan Robbins, a Roberti ally. 
</P>
<P>
 But that tactic has also failed to make headway with most voters, the Times 
poll found. Asked if Roberti were to blame for the corruption, 57% said he was 
either not responsible at all or "not much" to blame. Only a quarter said he 
deserved a good amount of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun control was also the major issue animating voters opposed to Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times poll found that 22% of those who said they would vote to recall the 
senator cited Roberti's position on gun control as their reason. Another 17% 
said they believe Roberti is personally corrupt and 13% that he had been in 
office too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roberti's a gun-grabber," said Michael Pratt, a disabled videotape operator 
from North Hollywood. "I value my 2nd Amendment rights just as much as I do my 
1st Amendment rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert J. Scott, an aerospace worker from Reseda who is a member of the 
Libertarian Party, said he has been urged by his party to vote for Roberti's 
ouster. "I'm not a member of the NRA, but I think that gun control is 
ineffective as a means of preventing crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, an overwhelming number of voters have little or no knowledge of the 
five candidates who are running to succeed Roberti if he is recalled. If 
Roberti fails to get more than 50% of the vote, he will be instantly removed 
from office and the highest vote-getter among the five will take his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The five are Dolores White, a real estate broker and longtime Republican 
activist; Al Dib, a retired produce market owner and perennial candidate; 
systems analyst Bill Dominguez, the leader of the recall signature-gathering 
drive and the only Democrat among the challengers; Randy Linkmeyer, the owner 
of a Canoga Park gun store, and Larry Martz, a handyman and official with a 
Valley gun club.  
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than 20% of the voters had an opinion about each of the five. With 58% 
of likely voters undecided about whom they would pick among the five, the Times 
poll found that none of them had a significant advantage among voters willing 
to make a choice. How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,343 registered voters in the San Fernando 
Valley's 20th State Senate District, by telephone, from March 19 through 24. Of 
that group, 1,151 are potential voters in the April 12 special recall election 
and 280 are highly likely to vote. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of 
all exchanges in the district. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so 
that listed and non-listed numbers could be contacted. Interviewing was 
conducted in English and Spanish. Results were weighted slightly to conform 
with census figures for sex, race and age. The margin of sampling error for the 
registered and potential voters is plus or minus 3 percentage points; for 
likely voters it is 7 points. For certain other sub-groups the error margin may 
vary. Poll results can also be affected by other factors such as question 
wording and the order in which questions are presented. Roberti Holdings Off 
Recall Effort

U.S. GETS MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR, DELAYS OCEAN TESTS; RESEARCH: CRITICS SAY 
UNDERWATER SOUNDS TO GAUGE GLOBAL WARMING COULD HARM SEA LIFE. MORE HEARINGS 
SET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bowing to pressure from members of Congress and the public, the National 
Marine Fisheries Service announced Friday that it will delay approval of ocean 
sound tests that some whale experts fear could harm marine mammals off the 
coast of Big Sur and Kauai, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal agency, which has been besieged by faxes and phone calls since 
plans for the experiment became public Tuesday, also agreed to hold hearings in 
Monterey and Hawaii, near where loudspeakers would be placed on the ocean 
floor. A period for public comment on the project had been scheduled to end 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the tremendous amount of concern expressed by the public, 
environmental groups, scientific researchers and of course members of Congress, 
we have decided to extend the hearings," said Scott Smullen, a spokesman for 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego have proposed a 
novel experiment to take the temperature of the Pacific Ocean by transmitting 
underwater sounds so loud they could be detected near New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers need the approval of the Fisheries Service because the 
195-decibel noise -- a low rumble to be broadcast six times daily for as long 
as 10 years -- could affect up to 677,000 marine mammals in the ocean off Big 
Sur. Slightly more than 1,000 mammals in the waters off Kauai could be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's decision to extend Friday's deadline and hold hearings in 
California and Hawaii within three weeks slows the momentum of Scripps 
scientists, who had hoped to win approval of the project quickly and begin 
transmissions next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, project leaders said they welcomed the opportunity to make their 
case to the public. They contend that the experiment can proceed without 
harming marine mammals and that it would provide valuable information about 
global warming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We support the public hearings," said David Hyde, the oceanographer who is 
heading the experiment. "We believe a full airing of these issues will make it 
clear what this project is all about and its environmental impact." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's decision comes in response to a spontaneous grass-roots campaign 
by citizens and environmental groups who are worried that the high-volume tests 
could drive animals from their habitat and deafen some whales. Since Tuesday, 
the usually obscure Fisheries Service has received hundreds of faxed letters 
opposing the federally funded experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The response) is unprecedented, especially for a scientific research 
permit," Smullen said. "My phone has been ringing off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
 The public outcry also prompted elected officials to urge that the agency seek 
alternative sites for the experiment or delay a decision until the proposal 
could be studied further. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them were California's two Democratic senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne 
Feinstein, and several congressional leaders who could influence funding either 
for the experiment or the Fisheries Service: Natural Resources Committee 
Chairman George Miller (D-Martinez), Armed Services Committee Chairman Ron 
Dellums (D-Oakland) and Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee Chairman Gerry 
Studds (D-Mass.) 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, most officials withheld judgment on the validity of the 
experiment, noting that the attempt to measure global warming could be a 
worthwhile project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The extension is a huge victory," said Rep. Sam Farr (D-Monterey), who 
represents the district closest to the California test site and had joined in 
seeking the delay. "Given the size of the project and its sensitive location 
among some of our most precious marine life, we needed to take more time to 
study the potential impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Whales, a Los Angeles-based organization that opposes the experiment, 
also joined in applauding the agency's action. "This shows what public pressure 
can accomplish," said Maris Sidenstecker, a marine biologist with the group. 
"Now we need the public's support at the hearings to stop (the experiment), 
which would mean the destruction of so many marine mammals." 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the project was first mounted by Nova Scotia whale researcher 
Lindy Weilgart, who said the experiment could cause deafness in whales or 
disrupt their feeding and reproduction. She also questioned why one of the 
loudspeakers was being placed in the newly created Monterey Bay National Marine 
Sanctuary, about 25 miles west of Point Sur. 
</P>
<P>
 Scripps scientists, who had been slow to make their case to the public, sought 
to deflect criticism Friday, emphasizing again that the experiment will be 
halted if there is an indication it harms marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyde said researchers need the permit because some whales might be disturbed 
by the noise if they come within 20 miles of a speaker. But the noise can 
damage a whale's hearing only if it swims within a few yards of the noise 
source. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not out to harm a single animal and we will stop the project if there 
is any evidence of that," Hyde said. "There are many safeguards built into the 
program."

CLINTONS' TAX RETURNS SHOW BIG LOSSES, GAINS; PRESIDENCY: WHITE HOUSE RELEASES 
1977-79 RECORDS IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS ABOUT WHITEWATER DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House, in response to continuing questions about the personal 
finances of President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, on Friday 
released their tax returns for 1977-79, the President's early years in public 
life in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents paint a fascinating picture of a young, relatively low-paid 
couple dabbling in highly speculative commodity and real estate ventures that 
in one case paid spectacular returns and in another -- the ill-fated Whitewater 
deal -- resulted in sizable financial losses and incalculable political costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax returns also reveal that the Clintons were involved in an earlier real 
estate investment with their Whitewater partner, James B. McDougal, that made 
them a modest $2,150 profit and emboldened them to try their luck in the much 
larger Whitewater project. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax returns were made public by the Clintons' private attorney, David 
Kendall of the Washington law firm Williams & Connolly. Kendall, in a briefing 
for reporters at the White House, also provided additional documentation on the 
Clintons' losses in the Whitewater deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall said the Clintons were releasing the 1977-79 tax returns "in a spirit 
of full cooperation and openness," noting that the First Family has now made 
public 16 years of tax filings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall said all the material had been provided to special counsel Robert B. 
Fiske Jr., who is investigating Whitewater Development Corp. and related 
matters involving the Clintons' years in Arkansas and the Administration's 
handling of the aftermath of the collapse of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, a 
Little Rock, Ark., thrift owned by McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 The news came as the grand jury investigating the Whitewater matter issued a 
subpoena to another senior White House aide. The White House issued a brief 
statement saying that staff secretary John Podesta had been summoned to testify 
about his knowledge of contacts between the White House and the Treasury 
Department in relation to the investigation of Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons' tax returns for the years 1977-79 show a remarkable growth in 
income for the couple, from $41,731 in 1977 to $85,214 in 1978 and $158,495 in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Salary increases account for little of the growth. In 1977, Clinton's first 
year as Arkansas attorney general, he was paid $25,378.77 while his wife, who 
then used her maiden name, Hillary Rodham, was paid $14,800 as a first-year 
associate at the Little Rock law firm Rose, Nash, Williamson, Carroll, Clay & 
Giroir -- now known simply as the Rose Law Firm. 
</P>
<P>
 She started at the firm in March that year and was paid for only 10 months. 
The low salary also is an indication of the low wages paid lawyers in small 
towns. At the time, associates at law firms in New York or Los Angeles made at 
least twice as much. 
</P>
<P>
 That year, the Clintons reported virtually no additional outside or investment 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, their combined salaries grew to about $51,000, but they also reported 
income from two investments -- a land deal with McDougal known as Rolling Hill 
Manor, for which they claimed a capital gain of $2,150, and profits of $26,541 
from commodity trading. 
</P>
<P>
 That year also marked the establishment of Whitewater Development, a 50-50 
partnership with McDougal and his then-wife, Susan, to buy 230 acres of land 
along the White River in northern Arkansas. The two couples borrowed $203,000 
to buy the property and the Clintons claimed an interest deduction of $10,131 
for payments made on the loans in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton began trading in commodities in October, 1978, at the urging 
of the Clintons' close friend, Arkansas lawyer James B. Blair, now the general 
counsel of Tyson Foods Inc., the nation's largest poultry producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Her investment in the high-risk cattle futures market is surprising, given 
that the Clintons had relatively low incomes and very few assets. White House 
aides would not say how much of her own money Hillary Clinton put at risk or 
how much of the trading was done on credit. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Clinton took office as governor and earned a salary of $33,519.14, 
while Hillary Clinton became a partner at the Rose Law Firm and saw her income 
rise to $38,615.60. But her luck in the futures market continued and she 
reported profits of $72,996 before bailing out of commodities in October of 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons that year continued to pour money into the Whitewater project 
without reporting any income from the land deal, the returns show. They paid 
$11,990.02 in interest charges on the venture, as well as making a $500 capital 
contribution, about which officials could not provide any detail. 
</P>
<P>
 After they got out of the commodities market, the Clintons' income fell 
substantially. Previously released tax returns show that their adjusted gross 
income for 1980 was $87,175, almost all of it from their salaries. By 1992, 
their income had grown to $280,000, most of it from Hillary Clinton's law firm 
earnings and fees for serving on boards of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the new tax returns, the White House provided a new accounting 
of the Clintons' Whitewater investment. The Clintons now believe that they lost 
$46,635.75 on the land deal, rather than the $68,900 they had claimed for the 
last two years, Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said Thursday that he had assumed erroneously that $22,000 
he borrowed to help his late mother buy a home in Hot Springs, Ark., actually 
had been borrowed for the Whitewater project. Clinton told a news conference 
Thursday night that he discovered the mistake when he was proofreading his 
mother's autobiography, "Leading with My Heart," which refers to a loan that he 
took out to help pay for the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the discrepancy Friday, Clinton said: "Keep in mind all this 
happened in the heat of the '92 campaign. Keep in mind, when I was first asked 
about this back in '92, just off the top of my head, I said we lost money but I 
don't think it was a great deal." 
</P>
<P>
 James M. Lyons, a Denver attorney and Clinton friend who prepared an earlier 
analysis of the Whitewater deal, has now revised his estimate of the Clintons' 
losses to reflect the new information. But he still stands by his estimate that 
McDougal, who was purportedly the Clintons' equal partner, lost $92,200 on the 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter released Thursday, Lyons also offered his opinion that the 
Clintons owe no additional taxes as a result of the revision of the Whitewater 
account because they were entitled to deduct the interest payments on the 
$22,000 loan for the President's mother even though the money wasn't borrowed 
for the Whitewater venture. But White House aides have said it is possible that 
additional tax liability may be discovered and that the Clintons are prepared 
to pay any back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 A source familiar with the Clintons' finances who briefed reporters Friday 
could not account for the difference in losses between the two partners and 
would not comment on whether the discrepancy represented a gift from McDougal 
to the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax returns show that the Clintons in 1978 paid $10,130.58 in interest to 
Great Southern Land Co., an entity that officials said was a McDougal company 
that used the money to make payments on Whitewater loans.

POLITICS; MUD FLIES AS ITALIAN VOTE NEARS; NO HOLDS ARE BARRED ON WIDE-OPEN 
CAMPAIGN PRECEDING THIS WEEKEND'S NATIONAL ELECTIONS. NEW FACES ABOUND AMONG 
THE CANDIDATES.

<P>
 Beware the votes of March. Not since Caesar got bushwhacked on his way to the 
Forum can there have been this much venom in a Roman spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In scope and snarl, the name-calling and mudslinging are positively imperial. 
Et tu, Politico ! There are dirty tricks enough to make a gladiator blush. 
</P>
<P>
 The free-for-all campaign prefaces national elections beginning this weekend 
that are Italy's most traumatic in four decades. They are a break with a 
discredited and corrupt "old pals" system, and they chart a new, if uncertain, 
political future. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambitious wanna-bes of every political stripe have transformed this 
opportunity into an unprecedented descent into barbarism, sniffed Indro 
Montanelli, the conservative, octogenarian dean of Italian journalism, in his 
new newspaper La Voce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I urge everyone at this very delicate moment in our national life to avoid 
acts which may disrupt the electoral campaign," said Prime Minister Carlo 
Ciampi, a technocrat who is not a politician, is not running and was roundly 
ignored as competing parties climaxed their campaigns Friday night with fresh 
torrents of invective. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting Sunday and Monday is for a new 630-seat Chamber of Deputies and a 
315-seat Senate, with a coalition of winning parties to form Italy's 53rd 
postwar government. 
</P>
<P>
 This election is different from all others since World War II, because 
three-quarters of Parliament will be elected not proportionately but directly, 
in U.S.-style, winner-take-all showdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 And because Italians are so disgusted with political parties that have ruled 
since the war -- all of them tarred by the nation's worst corruption scandal -- 
they are receptive to new faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among those is Silvio Berlusconi, a billionaire media baron who has 
proved in a rookie grab for power that he may be as successful politically as 
he is commercially -- and that he is as thin-skinned as he is rich. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, who is loudly intolerant of criticism, heads a triumvirate of 
right-wing parties, including the formerly Fascist National Alliance and the 
secessionist Northern League. They are bedmates who do not speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Many voters were still undecided when pollsters unplugged their computers two 
weeks ago, but on balance, the right was narrowly ahead of an eight-party 
leftist alliance dominated by the former Communist Party, now called the Party 
of the Democratic Left and relaunched as social democratic under Achille 
Occhetto. 
</P>
<P>
 Centrists around the scandal-tarnished and renamed Christian Democrats, 
cornerstones of all 52 postwar governments, were a poor third when the polls 
stopped in obedience to a new law accompanying electoral reform. Since then, 
the campaign has generated considerably more heat than light, with issues 
overwhelmed by accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi's skyrocket political debut at the head of a 4-month-old movement 
called Forza Italia (Go Italy) has attracted concentrated fire from both the 
wounded centrists and the leftists who had confidently expected to become their 
successors in power. 
</P>
<P>
 Insults fly. Running as a virulent anti-Communist, Berlusconi accuses Occhetto 
of leading "Stalinist-Leninists . . . who have not cut their ties with their 
bloody past . . . including Stalin's purges, the Spanish Fascist extermination 
of anarchists, and the genocide of (Cambodian) Pol Pot." 
</P>
<P>
 Occhetto, a self-proclaimed fan of NATO, conservative economics and President 
Clinton, calls Berlusconi "arrogant and dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Times have changed, the Cold War is over, Occhetto taunted Berlusconi in a 
speech. "This is not 1948. People know us. We live on the same floor as they 
do. We administer big cities. Nobody believes you any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi complains that his companies have had 86 visits from the tax police 
in the last four months, compared to 10 in the previous 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the frantic last week of campaigning, the centrist minister of interior, 
the former Communist head of Parliament's anti-Mafia commission and the leftist 
anti-Mafia mayor of Palermo have all hurled organized crime accusations 
Berlusconi's way. 
</P>
<P>
 "A chain of lies," he charged. Sample Candidates 
</P>
<P>
 The race for Parliament in the tourist-beloved heart of Rome typifies the 
three-way division of Italy's landmark election that begins weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 On the left: Luigi Spaventa, 60, affable intellectual, budget minister in the 
technocrat government of Prime Minister Carlo Ciampi. Represents Democratic 
Alliance, a new small movement within eight-party Progressive group lead by 
former Communists. 
</P>
<P>
 In the center: Alberto Michelini, 52, journalist, former TV news anchor. A 
conservative, represents new reformist party Pact for Italy. Served in 
Parliament as Christian Democrat before bolting in wake of corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 On the right: Silvio Berlusconi, 57, one of Italy's richest men and founder of 
conservative Forza Italia movement. Owns three national TV stations, magazines 
and a newspaper. Favored to win seat, but Spaventi could surprise.

TECHNOLOGY; RUSSIA SPACE PROGRAM HOPING TO REGAIN ITS OLD 'CANAVERAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wouldn't it be a pity if Cape Canaveral suddenly belonged to another country? 
</P>
<P>
 That is just the sort of fix that Russia's space sector has found itself in 
since the Soviet Union's collapse in late 1991. When the former republic of 
Kazakhstan gained independence, it proceeded to announce that Baikonur, the 
main Soviet launch center that happened to be situated on its windy steppes, 
had become Kazakh property. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia inherited the Soviet Union's ambitions in space, but not its main 
launch pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after two years of negotiating with the Kazakhs, Russia hopes that 
President Boris N. Yeltsin will be able to sign a 30-year lease on Baikonur 
when he holds a meeting Monday with his Kazakh counterpart, Nursultan 
Nazarbayev. 
</P>
<P>
 If the deal falls through, however, as it has many times before, this time 
Russia is ready with an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the commander of Russia's military space force announced 
that Moscow plans to build a major new space center in the country's Far East, 
on the site of a strategic missile base north of Blagoveshchensk. The spot is 
called Svobodny, meaning Free. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan may be only a bluff, or a wildcat initiative by military officials 
fed up with the slow pace of negotiations and Kazakh demands that Russia pay 
billions of dollars in rent on Baikonur. 
</P>
<P>
 But it sounded convincing. Col. Gen. Vladimir Ivanov told the Itar-Tass news 
agency that the Svobodny base will be ready by the year 2000. Then he went even 
further and said the first launches could begin by 1996. "This is not a retreat 
-- on the contrary, it's an active attack," Ivanov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia already has another major space center, the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in the 
Far North. But space scientists say it is not suited for manned flights or for 
launching big loads into high orbits. 
</P>
<P>
 Svobodny reportedly offers launch sites meant for the heaviest of 
intercontinental missiles, as well as a ready-made road system and even a 
military staff that had been wondering what to do with itself now that the 
missiles it manned are hitting the scrapheap under Russian-American arms cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some civilian space experts do not appear to share all the military's 
enthusiasm for Svobodny, however. They note that the site's remoteness will 
make links with suppliers and scientific centers difficult and will add to 
operating costs. They also doubt that it can get up to speed so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever says it will be ready in two or three years is either bluffing or 
doesn't understand," said Boris Aleskin, head of the department at the Russian 
Space Agency that oversees liaison with other former republics. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, enthusiastic local officials say, Svobodny's location near 
the Chinese border puts it in a good position to break into the space services 
market for the dynamic economies of Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest obstacle to moving Russia's space center to Svobodny may be the 
price tag. "You need the manpower, the production and the money to invest in 
it," Aleskin said.  
</P>
<P>
 But military officials are claiming that it will cost little to convert 
Svobodny -- perhaps 30% of what it would cost to build a whole new site. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Baikonur is plagued with problems. It was hit by a fire this month, 
apparently caused by a heating-system malfunction. Baikonur's launch abilities 
were not affected, but scientists took the fire as a sign that the complex is 
deteriorating because it does not really belong to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry visited Baikonur last week and 
commented that it is far too big and expensive to run for Russia's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is still painful to Russian pride to contemplate letting Baikonur go, 
even if it will be replaced in the Far East.

NEW GENERATION OF NATIVE HAWAIIANS RISES UP OVER SLOW RETURN OF ANCESTRAL 
LANDS; RIGHTS: PREDECESSORS ACCEPTED SNAIL'S PACE OF STATE BUREAUCRACY. NOW 
PROTESTERS 'OCCUPY' LOTS ON MANY ISLANDS, SOVEREIGNTY GROUPS BAND TOGETHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, after failing for decades to improve 
appreciably the lives of native Hawaiians, had something to crow about when it 
developed a tract of houses near here with $1-a-year lot leases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panaewa Homes, 50 single-family dwellings opened to residents in 1991, 
were part of a "fast track" effort to help the estimated 14,000 native 
Hawaiians who have waited generations for a chance to move onto department land 
scattered across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't turn out that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the "quality homes at an affordable price" are 95% out of compliance 
with building codes and are ridden with termites. Concrete foundation slabs are 
badly cracked. Septic tanks are tilted. For a while, house keys opened 
neighboring front doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 46 Panaewa homeowners are locked in a costly and frustrating battle -- in 
court and in the state Legislature -- with officials who reject their demand 
that the homes be torn down and rebuilt, correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 And they might be considered lucky. At least they have house lots. Many other 
eligible Hawaiians, including relatives of some department employees, have died 
waiting for their homesteads. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panaewa homeowners join Hawaiians statewide in rising up against the 
department that was created to enable Hawaiians to return to lands taken from 
them at the turn of the century, become self-sufficient and preserve their 
values, traditions and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 People of at least 50% native ancestry are entitled to lease homestead lots 
for $1 a year for 99 years on close to 200,000 acres of land scattered across 
the islands of Hawaii, Maui, Molokai, Oahu and Kauai. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only 6,000 native Hawaiians have been homesteaded since 1921. And the 
number of applications has far outpaced the number of lots awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike their predecessors, who quietly accepted the snail's pace of department 
programs, a new generation of Hawaiians is taking its frustration to court and 
into the streets. And serious questions are being raised about the agency's 
ability to survive the onslaught of criticism and active resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's King Kong swatting at attacking planes," said state Rep. Virginia 
Isbell, a critic of the agency. "Perhaps the mission of the Department of 
Hawaiian Home Lands is obsolete, as well as the way it functions." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters who point to successful housing projects shepherded by the 
department call such assessments unfair. They say that the department, 
understaffed and poorly funded, is doing the best it can. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are making critical remarks because they only see the faults, not the 
good that has come about," said Clarence Kamai, 67, who lives on Hawaiian Home 
Lands on Maui. "Because of the department, I have a house." 
</P>
<P>
 But from one end of the islands to the other, Hawaiians are "occupying" 
Hawaiian Home Lands by erecting lava-rock shrines, ramshackle huts and 
permanent homes -- all in violation of department rules. 
</P>
<P>
 On a wind-battered spit of Hawaiian Home Lands at the remote southern tip of 
the island of Hawaii, Joseph Kauwe is among a handful of families defiantly 
living in abandoned Army structures. A life-size lava statue of a Hawaiian 
bound in heavy chains stands on his front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 On Kauai, a couple was jailed for 45 days for appropriating unused beachfront 
land at Anahola. Michael Grace and his wife have worked the land for several 
years, growing local crops and building a "cultural center" that was bulldozed 
by the state in 1991, but rebuilt last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've felt intimidated before. I don't feel intimidated now," he declared. 
"I've seen the movement growing. I see it coming faster and faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Hawaiians are risking trespassing charges by staging noisy 
demonstrations on Home Lands property leased to non-natives for commercial 
centers, airports and ranches. In October, 25 people were arrested while 
protesting the lease held by the 46-acre Prince Kuhio Plaza, the only regional 
shopping center on the island of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 These and other actions have tied the beleaguered department up in knots -- 
and energized a growing movement for sovereignty, or self determination and 
control of native lands. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began in 1921 when Congress passed the Hawaiian Home Lands Act to put a 
coda to the sad history of federal seizures of lands belonging to native 
Hawaiians and to preserve their dying culture. 
</P>
<P>
 But glaring problems were built into the department that still haunt it today. 
The federal government failed to fund the department, which came under local 
control as a condition of statehood in 1959. In addition, lobbyists for the 
then-powerful sugar plantations managed to have their vast fields exempted from 
the Hawaiian Home Lands. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the department's voluminous files, critical to resolving 
disputes, still are not computerized. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program was designed to fail," said Honolulu attorney Hayden Burgess, a 
Hawaiian sovereignty advocate, "and the state inherited the baggage." The 
department was left to dispense some of the steepest and least tillable acreage 
on the islands. Strapped for funding, it began leasing some of the choicest 
parcels to mostly non-natives for commercial purposes under contractual 
agreements that funneled a portion of their profits back into agency coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 In this way, the Army was able to lease 295 acres for its training center at 
Pohakuloa, on the island of Hawaii, for $1 for 65 years. The immense Parker 
Ranch here leased 7,512 acres of pasture in 1977 for $31,300. That lease 
expires in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree that's ridiculous," said Donald Pakele, district supervisor at the 
Hawaiian Home Lands office in Hilo. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pakele hastened to add that other so-called "general lease" agreements 
with non-natives have proved profitable for the department. For example, the 
lease given to the Prince Kuhio Plaza pumps about $500,000 a year back into the 
department and has helped pay for floating bonds used to buy 600 homes 
statewide over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Kahawaiola'a, a postal worker and Vietnam veteran involved in a 
yearlong battle against the department over the Kuhio Plaza lease and his use 
of beach land for a shrine, is not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the DHHL will continue to use these lands for parks, schools and 
shopping centers because economics controls the program," said Kahawaiola'a, 
who has practically memorized the department's confusing bylaws. "Here's why: 
These lands, since statehood, have become too valuable to allow Hawaiians to 
control them." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to signal a fresh start, the state last year began administrative 
hearings on financial compensation claims filed by Hawaiians who applied for 
homesteads between 1959 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three claims have been processed so far by the office, which is due to 
close in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very big job ahead of us," said Melody MacKenzie, the Hawaiian 
Claims Office's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we are looking at thousands of people on the homestead waiting list, 
we only have 280 claims pending," she added. "We believe that is partly because 
many native Hawaiians are suspicious of state programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Hawaiian sovereignty groups say that the hearings can't begin to 
rectify the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't much hope in the hearings process," said Mililani Trask, governor 
of Ka Lahui, Hawaii, (the Nation of Hawaii), which represents 20,000 Hawaiians. 
"The community is saying: 'We don't give a damn about the Department of 
Hawaiian Home Lands. Our parents lived and died waiting. It's time for us to 
take our land.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 200,000 people in this state with a drop of Hawaiian blood in 
their veins neither belong to sovereignty groups nor sympathize with their 
mission. But what's new is the fact that more mainstream Hawaiians are 
embracing the cause, and once-fractious groups are beginning to band together. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 groups have joined forces to educate people about sovereignty, 
which could range from nation-within-a-nation status -- similar to that 
accorded Native Americans -- to secession from the United States. The largest 
group, Ka Lahui, sees Hawaiian Home Lands and other trust lands as the 
foundation of the nation it is trying to establish. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also has come under fire from state officials concerned that it 
is far from fulfilling its purpose. Roughly 20% of the 6,000 leases awarded 
Hawaiians over the past 74 years remain unimproved raw land without 
infrastructure, according to a recent state audit. The agency has an operating 
budget of $5.9 million this year, with $13.9 million to spend on capital 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit criticized the department for its lack of written policies and for 
pursuing unrealistic goals. For example, in 1991 the department announced plans 
to build 14,000 homes within 10 years. In 1992, it built 529 homes. In 1993, it 
built 530. But given the department's historical record, such production 
represents remarkable progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoaliku Drake, a 72-year-old native Hawaiian who is chairwoman of the Hawaiian 
Homes Commission that governs the department, claimed that state investigators 
failed to obtain complete and accurate information in reaching conclusions that 
"cast the department in the most unfavorable light without justification." 
</P>
<P>
 Drake pointed out a number of significant achievements under her watch. More 
homestead lots are being developed than at any period in the department's 
history. Water reserves for Hawaiian Home Lands have been secured on Oahu and 
Molokai. The department has developed new mortgage loan financing sources. 
</P>
<P>
 An emotional Drake emphasized that she has pleaded for adequate funding: "If 
you have money, you can do many things. If the state and federal government 
would do their duty to us, we'd be able to get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 She also recoiled at suggestions that the department is hurting its own 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been a Hawaiian who practices her culture, and the basis of our 
culture is love; the love that emanates from a Hawaiian naturally," she said. 
"The Hawaiian would rather give than receive." 
</P>
<P>
 At Panaewa, that attitude is fading fast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panaewa homeowners, who stopped paying their mortgages in November after 
two years of fruitless efforts to negotiate, are suing the contractor and the 
Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. The lawsuit cites extensive termite damage, 
cracked foundations, faulty electrical work and defective roofs, windows and 
plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal battle is taking its toll on these families, whose lives are 
strained to the limit with new obligations: public hearings, massive 
documentation and fund-raisers. To help pay attorney fees that have reached 
$40,000, they stage fund-raising concerts -- and have been overwhelmed by 
Hawaiian entertainers wanting to donate their time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to give up -- and that's what's bugging the department," said 
Panaewa homeowner Florence Keliikoa, 60. "We've got nothing to lose but a 
defective house," added neighbor Gerrianne Perriera, a mother of four who 
waited 20 years on the agency list before her name was called. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, Hawaiian people were thankful for crumbs," she said, her eyes welling 
with tears. "But we're saying no more of that. It stops here, at Panaewa."

GERMAN SYNAGOGUE FIREBOMBED; NEO-NAZIS SUSPECTED; TERRORISM: GOVERNMENT, JEWISH 
AND CHURCH LEADERS DENOUNCE THE PRE-PASSOVER ATTACK. REWARD IS OFFERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Extremists threw two firebombs into Germany's oldest synagogue in the northern 
city of Luebeck on Friday, a day before worshipers were to celebrate Passover 
services there for the first time since the Nazi Kristallnacht pogrom in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish leaders said this was the worst attack on a synagogue since the Third 
Reich. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the 2 a.m. fire that destroyed a meeting room in the 
four-story building crowned by a Star of David. The main hall where the sacred 
scrolls of the Torah are kept was untouched, and 12 people living in apartments 
above the synagogue escaped unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Police in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, where Luebeck is located, said they 
believe that the attack was committed by rightist extremists but that they had 
no suspects and no leads. They offered a $30,000 reward for information leading 
to arrests for what they called attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't find words to describe what has happened," said Heinz Jaeckel, a 
leader of Luebeck's 27-member Jewish community. "This is really terrible. It is 
a day before Passover." 
</P>
<P>
 Bertold Katz, 78, a Holocaust survivor and cantor who fled to safety from his 
flat above the synagogue, told the Reuters news agency: "There are so few of us 
left. Are 27 too many?" 
</P>
<P>
 Katz lost his mother in a Nazi concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Government, Jewish and church leaders denounced the attack, and around midday 
about 200 Luebeckers marched to the synagogue with banners against racism. 
Luebeck's mayor called for a five-minute silence today.  
</P>
<P>
 "The German government is shocked by this attack and sharply condemns it," 
government spokesman Dieter Vogel said. "The government stands by the Jewish 
community in Luebeck and elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Also overnight, Molotov cocktails were thrown into a Turkish textile shop in 
the northern city of Bremen. Seven Germans living in apartments above the store 
escaped without injury, and police said they could not rule out a political 
motive in that attack either. Turkish businesses and residents have been the 
targets of both neo-Nazis and Kurdish separatist militants. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany has experienced an increase in neo-Nazi attacks on foreigners and Jews 
since unification in 1990. The incidents have left 30 people dead, most of them 
foreign workers. Such attacks, however, had decreased in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, German television showed the blackened walls and broken windows of 
the synagogue in Luebeck with flowers laid outside. Police said the firebombs 
were thrown into the synagogue through a garden window, but that damage was 
slight as one of them did not explode. The other ignited an office in front of 
the main prayer hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had been patrolling the synagogue frequently since the Hebron massacre 
in Israel, in which a Jewish settler killed about 30 praying Palestinians, 
television reported. But Jewish leaders signaled that they believed neo-Nazis 
were to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 The synagogue, founded in 1880, is the only one in the state and was being 
prepared for Passover services for about 140 Jews from across the state for the 
first time since it was vandalized during Kristallnacht. On Nov. 9, 1938, Nazi 
supporters attacked and looted more than 7,000 Jewish stores and burned 267 
synagogues throughout Germany, an event that became known as Crystal Night for 
the broken glass. Luebeck's temple was not burned because it was next to a 
museum with a valuable art collection.

 Michel Friedman, of Frankfurt's Jewish community, said the firebomb was the 
worst attack on a Jewish institution since the Jewish Community Center in 
Frankfurt was hit by vandals in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-Semitic attacks are not uncommon in Germany but are usually restricted to 
graffiti -- painting of swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans on Jewish graves and 
synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
 But last month, vandals twice attacked an old synagogue in the Ruhr valley 
city of Essen. One day, vandals threw stones at the temple, breaking 14 
windows, and two days later, a firebomb blackened its stone steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignatz Bubis, leader of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, blamed extreme 
right-wing parties for fomenting anti-Semitism and said they must be 
ostracized. 
</P>
<P>
 "How is it possible that things have come this far? And how far will it go?" 
Bubis asked German television. "Many (Jewish) people are worried whether their 
decision to live in Germany was a right decision." 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 40,000 Jews in Germany, compared to more than 500,000 before 
the Holocaust.

2 ANC RALLIES DRAW STRONG ZULU SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The African National Congress showed strong support among Zulus on Friday, 
drawing more than 100,000 people to two marches demanding free political 
activity in Natal province and the traditional Zulu homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 The marches in Durban and Stanger ended with little of the unrest that had 
been expected from holding ANC rallies in territory controlled by the Zulu 
nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party, the ANC's bitter rival. 
</P>
<P>
 A few store windows were broken in Durban, but there were no clashes or other 
damage. Witnesses said Inkatha supporters threw stones at buses transporting 
ANC marchers back to a nearby black township, but no injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses closed and hundreds of police lined the march route as the throng 
moved through the city center singing and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sign of Inkatha, whose leader, Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, is 
refusing to take part in South Africa's first all-race election April 26-28. 
</P>
<P>
 Political violence has increased in recent weeks in Natal and the KwaZulu 
homeland, and officials fear that the unrest will prevent free campaigning and 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
 The marchers demanded that South African troops and police move into KwaZulu 
and take over the homeland police and that residents in conflict areas be given 
extra time to vote so they can travel to safer areas to cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is going to stop us from voting," said Jacob Zuma, a Zulu who is an 
ANC deputy secretary general. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people have died in Natal in an ANC-Inkatha power struggle, and 
there are fears of more violence unless Buthelezi can be persuaded to endorse 
the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The marches were meant to disprove Buthelezi's claim that the ANC has little 
support in Natal. Police estimated more than 120,000 people took part in the 
two marches. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pretoria, meanwhile, President Frederik W. de Klerk said he planned a 
private meeting with Buthelezi soon to try to avert a government showdown with 
the Zulu leader. ANC leaders have called for tough action to force Buthelezi to 
guarantee the safety of voters and candidates in KwaZulu, a semiautonomous 
homeland where Buthelezi is chief minister. 
</P>
<P>
 KwaZulu police have been accused in two independent reports recently of 
operating hit squads against ANC supporters, and several ANC election workers 
have been killed in the region. In addition, Zulus have taken over two stadiums 
in recent weeks where ANC supporters had planned campaign rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of Inkatha's support comes from Zulus, the nation's largest tribe. 
But many ANC supporters also are Zulus. They accuse Buthelezi of using 
arguments of Zulu pride and culture to hide his desire to run a dictatorship in 
Natal. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi says the Zulus need an independent state to save them from an ANC 
government, which he claims would crush the Zulu culture.

LAST U.S. TROOPS LEAVE SOMALIA IN A SWIRL OF DUST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a cloud of dust, the last U.S. troops pulled out of Somalia on Friday, 
leaving behind piles of rubbish and a smaller U.N. force to deal with the 
troubled country's gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "See ya, we're outta here. We accomplished our mission," said Marine Lt. David 
Wolcott of New Town, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Six Cobra attack helicopters clattered overhead as "Operation Quickdraw" 
ending the controversial 15-month mission entered its final stage. 
</P>
<P>
 In a swirl of sand and dust, a convoy of 15 amphibious assault vehicles 
rumbled into the breaking surf of the deep-blue Indian Ocean, taking home the 
few dozen troops left from a force that at its height reached more than 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The troops left from the same beach they stormed in a Hollywood-style landing 
under the glare of television arc lights Dec. 9, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure was a low-key affair. There were no parades, no flag-furling 
ceremonies, no crowds of cheering Somalis -- only hordes of onlookers waiting 
to loot piles of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 At the main entrance to the airport, fistfights broke out as Egyptian 
peacekeepers tried to keep out crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Thomas Montgomery, the U.S. commander, somberly insisted that the 
operation was a success despite the deaths in combat of about 100 U.N. 
peacekeepers, 30 of them American, and hundreds of Somalis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very proud of what we have done; we know there are hundreds of 
thousands of Somalis alive because of what we did," Montgomery told reporters 
before boarding a military helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans, who came to end a famine that killed at least 300,000, leave 
behind a blighted country with no government, bedeviled by banditry and ravaged 
by cholera. 
</P>
<P>
 A 20,000-strong U.N. army, made up of African and Asian contingents, remains 
to deal with Somalia's turmoil and lawlessness. It will restrict its role to 
guarding food convoys and key sites.

ISRAEL TIGHTENS SECURITY TO PREVENT PASSOVER ATTACKS; MIDEAST: EXTRA FORCES 
DEPLOYED ON FEARS OF REVENGE FOR MOSQUE SLAYINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of police reinforcements were deployed throughout Israel and the 
occupied territories Friday, taking up positions at synagogues, vacation 
resorts, bus stations, markets and major highways as Israeli authorities girded 
during the weeklong Jewish holiday of Passover for possible revenge attacks for 
last month's mosque massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional security force was concentrated in and around Jerusalem, the 
disputed city that is the site of the ancient temple of King Herod, where Jews 
traditionally are commanded to pay pilgrimage on Passover, which begins at 
sunset today.  
</P>
<P>
 But as the holiday jitters deepened, many Jews throughout Israel expressed 
fears about praying this weekend at Jerusalem's Western Wall, the temple's only 
remnant and Judaism's holiest site, which abuts one of the holiest shrines of 
Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 "This period is filled with dangers and tensions, much more than usual," 
Israeli Police Chief Rafi Peled said, confirming that authorities and many 
Israelis are, as one put it, "waiting for the other shoe to drop." 
</P>
<P>
 "The feelings of fury among the Arabs in the wake of the massacre, and the 
religious and nationalist awakening that ensued, have not yet reached their 
peak," Peled said. 
</P>
<P>
 The police chief added that his force and the Israeli army have received 
specific warnings that armed Palestinian extremist groups intend to use the 
Jewish holiday to retaliate for the Feb. 25 massacre of about 30 Palestinians 
in a Muslim shrine in the occupied West Bank town of Hebron. The worshipers 
were gunned down by a Jewish extremist as they prayed on the holiest day of 
Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the month since the carnage, armed Palestinian groups have claimed 
responsibility for two revenge attacks on Jews -- this week's killing of a 
Jewish security guard near the Old City in Jerusalem and an attack on a bus 
that wounded three Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank earlier in the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 On both occasions, extremist parties claimed responsibility for the attacks, 
stressing that they were the "first acts of retaliation" for the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 The better-armed, well-organized underground Islamic groups, Hamas and Islamic 
Jihad, have yet to strike. Both vowed publicly to take revenge after the 
killings in the Ibrahim Mosque at Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 So tense is Jerusalem and so deep is the concern in the Israeli government at 
the onset of Passover that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Cabinet voted to 
extend the closure of Israel's borders with the occupied West Bank and Gaza 
Strip -- at least until after the holiday ends next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 This was a costly decision that will continue to deprive Israeli farmers of 
Palestinian labor at a critical time in the spring harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's 22-hour Israeli army assault on a suspected Hamas hide-out in 
Hebron was, in effect, another costly precaution for the coming holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference late Thursday, Maj. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, commanding officer 
of Israel's forces in the West Bank, indicated that the siege, in which at 
least 1,500 soldiers fired thousands of bullets and more than 100 antitank 
missiles into a home, was aimed at neutralizing the fundamentalist threat at a 
critical time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of weapons and ammunition found in the house after it was 
demolished indicates that it served as a base for Hamas activities," said 
Mofaz, who was slightly injured in the battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The four Palestinians killed in the firefight were known to be key members of 
Izzedine Kassim, Hamas' highly secretive armed wing, the general added. 
</P>
<P>
 With their deaths, Mofaz said, the list of Israel's most-wanted Hamas 
activists is now fewer than 10. But even a small number of armed "terrorists," 
he said, can present a significant threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli authorities clearly are also wary of a continuing threat from armed 
Jewish extremists during the Passover holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Passover marks the time, according to the Bible, when the angel of death 
passed over slave houses of Jews and, instead, killed the first-born of their 
Egyptian captors; there subsequently was a plague that enabled the exodus of 
the Jews from Egyptian slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 In the modern Jewish state, particular concern has arisen over the Hebron 
settler movement, which spawned Baruch Goldstein, the Brooklyn-born physician 
who fired more than 100 bullets from an automatic rifle into the crowded 
Ibrahim Mosque before he was beaten to death. Some of Goldstein's fellow 
settlers have applauded his attack as sacred and heroic. 
</P>
<P>
 The army Friday restricted all travel in and out of Kiryat Arba, the 
settlement near Hebron in the occupied West Bank where Goldstein lived. It is 
home to several prominent Jewish extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to place Kiryat Arba under curfew came as the settlers announced 
that they will launch a new campaign timed for the Passover holiday. They have 
put up posters throughout Jerusalem advertising a march next week, which a 
spokesman said would go from Kiryat Arba into Hebron, home to about 125,000 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 The curfew in Hebron was lifted Friday after 25 days, but more troops were 
deployed around Jewish settlements and the city to prevent clashes between 
Arabs and Jews and to quell Palestinian protests that have continued to leave 
dead and injured in and around the shellshocked town in the weeks since the 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Underscoring the tension, Zvi Katsover, head of Kiryat Arba's local council, 
said Friday on Israel Radio that the Israeli military curfew isolating his 
settlement indicates that the authorities "are preparing us . . . for a ghetto. 
And we are not expecting this to pass by peacefully. We will consider our next 
steps and prepare accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday forced a delay in formal efforts to make peace until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cairo, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators broke at dawn Friday after an 
exhausting all-night negotiating session that failed to produce a final 
agreement for providing more security guarantees for Palestinians in the West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Israel agreed to the principle of lightly armed international 
observers and Palestinian police patrols in Hebron, negotiators predicted that 
they could quickly reach an accord when talks resume Tuesday and move on 
immediately to talks on implementing Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides have agreed in principle on two of the most basic Palestinian 
security demands, but even after hours of haggling they remained split on how 
many Palestinian police and international observers would be deployed and how 
they would be armed. There is also a dispute over composition of the 
international force. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has refused to discuss the third key Palestinian demand, to relocate 
Jewish settlers out of the Hebron area. 
</P>

TENS OF THOUSANDS IN FRANCE PROTEST PAY CUTS FOR THE YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid a growing wave of spring social unrest, tens of thousands of French 
students, teachers and parents took to the streets of the capital and several 
provincial cities Friday in an intense new protest over government-decreed wage 
cuts for youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The student demonstrations, which began almost three weeks ago, have 
mushroomed into a major crisis for the year-old government of conservative 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who is battling to bring the country's 12.2% 
unemployment rate under control with a variety of controversial medicines. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 30,000 protesters joined the Paris march Friday, walking from the 
Left Bank across the Seine under the gaze of about 3,000 heavily armed riot 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they arrested 42 people after clashes between officers and some 
departing protesters at the end of the march; 48 officers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the previous protests have been peaceful, tension has been 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Friday, a clash between police and demonstrators hurling gasoline bombs, 
stones and bottles resulted in 30 injuries in the college towns of Nantes and 
Rennes in Brittany. And sporadic violence occurred during protests a day 
earlier as well, with 73 police and 90 demonstrators injured during a march in 
Lyons. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris, protesters carried signs reading, "Slaves of the Year 2000 -- No, 
Thank You" and "Dad, I've Found a Job -- Yours." Several people broke from the 
crowd at one point, using stones to break windows of stores, which had been 
closed along the protest route. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're showing that we're not ready to accept just anything from the 
government," said Pierre Francois, 21, a university student who joined the 
march. "We're ready to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The protests stem from a government decision to let employers cut the legal 
minimum wage by between 25% and 70% for unskilled workers under age 25 in 
return for on-the-job training. The idea is to encourage businesses to hire 
more workers, especially younger ones, about one in four of whom are 
unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Balladur did not count on the strong reaction of the youth, and older 
French people as well, to cutting the minimum wage, now about $1,000 a month 
for a 39-hour week. 
</P>
<P>
 To many French, Balladur's move set a dangerous precedent. And some students 
see it as a blunt warning that they will not be able to enjoy the same standard 
of living as their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, this is a choice between being able to live a normal life and not 
having to live in my parents' house," said Magalie Castillio, 19, who joined 
the march Friday. "If you earn this kind of wage, you can pay rent or food, but 
you can't pay both." 
</P>
<P>
 The government already has twice amended its minimum-wage plan, first by 
excluding youth with more than two years of higher education from the lower 
wage, then by adding a requirement that employers provide job training during 
working hours for lower-paid workers. The final version of the decree went into 
law this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But the changes have not weakened the resolve of the students, who are 
supported in their efforts by many French labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that resistance has surfaced in the provinces, where 230,000 people 
took to the streets a week ago. And a recent public opinion poll, conducted by 
the Paris daily InfoMatin, found that 55% of those surveyed opposed the lower 
minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Balladur's government, which has backed down in the face of protests by Air 
France workers, fishermen and others in recent months, has vowed to hold the 
line on its minimum-wage proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Balladur has suggested, though, that the government might remove the lower 
minimum wage in the fall, if it does not help stimulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But many in France, such as Claude Baudeau, 56, who joined the students in 
Paris on Friday, say the new decree will eventually result in lower salaries 
for all. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't live off the minimum wage, let alone live off less than the minimum 
wage," she said. "When I was young, I fought for this minimum wage, and now I'm 
fighting again for the right to a decent salary for our children." 
</P>
<P>
 For months now, the government and political analysts have been warning of a 
social explosion, resulting from growing tension in a country with a record 3.3 
million unemployed people and the highest rate in Western Europe. And they 
speak darkly of a repeat of the social upheaval after the May, 1968, student 
protests, which turned violent and eventually led to the retirement of Charles 
de Gaulle. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday, the French gave Balladur's government a vote of confidence in an 
initial round of local elections, with his center-right coalition winning 44.7% 
of the vote. But Socialists gained some support, mostly from the ecological 
movement. A runoff is set for this Sunday.

HOPEFUL JOURNEYS END IN TEARFUL REUNIONS IN CENTRAL BOSNIA AS REFUGEES HEAD 
HOME; BALKANS: HUNDREDS OF MUSLIMS, CROATS RUSH TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LOOSER 
TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 Fuad Secic stopped Friday for a rest and a drink of water from the 
swift-flowing Bosna River near the end of a 12-mile walk toward this Croat-held 
town that is still home to his wife and children. It was the first day of 
U.N.-supervised visits across the Muslim-Croatian boundaries that divide 
central Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a fugitive prisoner of war and a Muslim who had fought against Zepce's 
Croatian capture, Secic harbored little hope of being allowed into what, until 
recent days, was enemy territory. 
</P>
<P>
 As he caught his breath and chatted with fellow Muslims streaming by the 
hundreds toward long-lost loved ones, a woman's shriek of shock mixed with 
euphoria riveted his attention. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, having crossed the armed checkpoint from the other direction, had 
abandoned her wheelbarrow of food and presents at the first sight of him and 
broken into a run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the happiest man!" he told her and all who would listen, beaming and 
brushing away the tears from both of their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 They came by the hundreds, these displaced Bosnians seeking family reunions, 
pushing carts and wagons and airport baggage trolleys laden with the first load 
of belongings for the homes and relatives they hope to return to soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The shell-pocked road that threads 70 miles along the savagely contested 
territory of central Bosnia between Travnik and Maglaj was the scene of tearful 
reunions and hopeful journeys throughout the day as Muslims and Croats, sick to 
death of the last year of killing, jumped at the chance to forget it ever 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 As a first step toward restoring free movement and normal relations between 
the recently reconciled Croats and Muslims, the rival militias agreed to let as 
many as 100 people from each side cross each morning through six official 
checkpoints manned by U.N. troops and police from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stream of separated families was so strong and emotions so fiercely 
forgiving that authorities on both sides waved through the overflow at the 
busiest checkpoints rather than turn people away. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those crossing had to return back to the side they came from by the 6 
p.m. curfew imposed for the one-day family visits. 
</P>
<P>
 But even a glimpse was joyful reprieve from months of separation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went very well, everywhere," said a U.N. spokesman at the Vitez 
headquarters of the British Coldstream Guards, who are standing watch over the 
phased reconciliation. "We don't have full figures, but at some checkpoints 
they exceeded 100." 
</P>
<P>
 The ceiling had been suggested by both Muslim and Croatian authorities who 
feared a chaotic scene if travel restrictions were lifted completely in the 
patchwork of segregated enclaves that have been created by Muslim-Croatian 
fighting over the last year. Because almost all of Bosnia's 2 million displaced 
dream of going home again someday, even if their houses have been looted or 
burned to the ground by rival gunmen, authorities fear conflicts, if those 
returning discovered their homes destroyed or occupied by homeless strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the sight of determined civilians, such as sisters Sadija Morankic and 
Subija Malicbegovic, who trekked all morning toward Zepce in hopes of seeing 
their mother, father or another sister, police and the U.N. monitors turned a 
blind eye to the agreed-upon limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always gotten along with Croats. This past year was just some kind of 
madness," said 35-year-old Morankic, who fled Zepce with her children when the 
fighting swept over her home last June. "We don't know when we can go back, but 
we know we will one day." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few hundred yards ahead on the road, having just passed the Zepce 
checkpoint, her sister, Paskada Preljedzic, suddenly came into view. 
</P>
<P>
 After tears and kisses and news of the rest of the family, now spread from 
Serb-besieged Tesanj, to Croat-held Zepce to the government stronghold of 
Zenica, Preljedzic assured her sister that the senseless separations would soon 
be over. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Croats are good people. They didn't want this either," Preljedzic said. 
"It was just the extremists (in the Bosnian Croat army) that brought us to 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Blaming the few to forgive the many has been the mental ploy employed by both 
Muslims and Croats to prod along the peace process that had halted virtually 
all fighting and ethnic cleansing between the two peoples. Since a March 1 
agreement brokered in Washington and a U.N.-imposed deadline six days later for 
withdrawal of all heavy artillery from the central Bosnian battlefields, the 
two sides have rushed to take advantage of a chance to come to their senses. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslims and Croats, who together account for more than two-thirds of Bosnia's 
prewar population of 4.4 million, fought side-by-side when Serbian nationalists 
first rebelled against independence in March, 1992. But they fell to fighting 
each other for what territory was left after the Serbs conquered 70% of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and Russian officials continue to hold out hope that the Bosnian Serbs 
will also join an emerging new federation that has brought peace to the rest of 
Bosnia; the rebels have rejected all calls for retreat from some conquered 
territory and have shelled Croatian, Muslim and U.N. positions.

 But throughout central Bosnia, which saw some of the most vicious fighting of 
the 2-year-old war, the momentum for an end to the bloodshed has moved apace 
with the flood of homesick refugees back to their families, their shattered 
houses and their land.

CRIMEA VOTE SUNDAY COULD TRIGGER STRUGGLE FOR REGION; EUROPE: CITIZENS TO BE 
ASKED IF THEY WANT MORE AUTONOMY FROM UKRAINE. IT COULD PUSH EFFORTS TO REJOIN 
RUSSIA. 
</P>

<P>
 Great powers have tussled for control over the scenic, strategic Crimean 
peninsula ever since the Romans clashed with Greek city-states before the birth 
of Christ. The British, Russian and Turkish empires collided here in 1854, and 
a century later Adolf Hitler tried to make Crimea a German Gibraltar. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Crimea will hold a controversial vote that could launch a bid to 
secede from Ukraine and rejoin Russia. Some fear that the ensuing struggle 
could once again turn this Black Sea peninsula into a geopolitical tinderbox. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no cause for alarm; everything will be peaceful," Crimea's newly 
elected president, Yuri A. Meshkov, promised this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plebiscite has already triggered a war of words between Ukrainian 
authorities and Meshkov, who won 73% of the vote in January elections after 
promising to seek independence from Ukraine and reunification with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Students of history shudder at the prospect of Russia and Ukraine, two 
increasingly nationalistic nuclear powers already at odds over how to divide 
the Black Sea fleet, competing for hegemony over Crimea. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine has increased its troop strength in Crimea from 18,000 about two years 
ago to 51,000 today, according to the Russian military newspaper Red Star. 
Meshkov has demanded the "demilitarization" of the peninsula, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one expects armed strife soon, many see in Crimea the ingredients 
for another of the ethnic and political conflicts that have flamed up across 
the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Border disputes are bloody: Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, the Trans-Dnestr," 
warned Olexander P. Kulyk, editor-in-chief of Crimea's only Ukrainian language 
newspaper, the Crimean Chamber, who sits near a window punctured with a bullet 
hole left by an unknown ill-wisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Server Kerimov, a leader of the Crimean Tatar movement, which believes that 
Crimea should remain an autonomous republic inside Ukraine, agreed: "The danger 
of civil war here exists." 
</P>
<P>
 About 250,000 Tatars, deported from Crimea by Stalin in 1944, have returned 
from exile in Siberia and Uzbekistan in the last five years. Most remain 
impoverished, unemployed and mistrustful of Russia. But the indigenous Tatars 
are badly outnumbered in a population of 2.7 million. Russians make up 68% of 
Crimean residents, Ukrainians 28%. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-to-do Russians have been summering in the Crimea since the czars built a 
dacha here in the 19th Century, and the peninsula remained the favorite 
vacation spot of the Soviet elite. Whoever controls Crimea inherits not only a 
strategic military outpost in the Black Sea but some of the best real estate in 
the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikita S. Khrushchev, the former Soviet leader, gave Crimea to Ukraine in 1954 
as a token of Russian-Ukrainian friendship, a meaningless gesture until the 
Soviet Union dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive for Crimean independence started as soon as Russian residents 
realized that they had become Ukrainian subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 However dreadful the Russian economy, it looks positively rosy compared to 
that of Ukraine. Ukrainian inflation is running two to three times the Russian 
rate. Crimean production dropped 25% in the last year, employment fell by 6%, 
and living standards plunged for pensioners, who make up about a third of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 In his election campaign, Meshkov blamed Kiev for failing to conduct economic 
reform and promised to hold a referendum on Crimea's status. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian authorities, noting that Ukraine's existing borders are guaranteed 
by international law and by a Ukrainian-Russian treaty, declared such a 
referendum illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Meshkov promptly announced that the voting would be an "opinion poll," not a 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will be asked to approve broader autonomy for Crimea, more presidential 
powers and dual Ukrainian-Russian citizenship for residents -- all steps toward 
de facto Crimean independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk has urged Meshkov to back down, warning 
him not to be "too big for your boots." 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, the Crimean Election Commission announced Tuesday that the poll 
will proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the vote will not be legally binding, Meshkov is expected to win an 
overwhelming "yes" vote that will strengthen his bargaining position with Kiev 
as he seeks more autonomy for Crimea. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this show of brinkmanship, Meshkov is toning down his secessionist 
rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never a question of reuniting with Russia," the 47-year-old lawyer 
said. What Crimea seeks, he said, is an "economic union" with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 What Meshkov -- who symbolically put his peninsula Thursday in the same time 
zone as Moscow -- plans for Crimea sounds like Monaco on the Black Sea: a free 
trade zone, resort and tax haven that would attract foreign investors despite 
the obvious political risks. Also proposed is a free currency zone where the 
Ukrainian karbovanets, the Russian ruble and the U.S. dollar would all be 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Such proposals meet with skepticism from the Tatars, who say Meshkov is a 
Russian nationalist who has long been hostile to their drive for political 
equality, let alone compensation for their confiscated property. Tatars say 
they are forced to watch helplessly while houses they were dragged from at 
gunpoint are "privatized." 
</P>
<P>
 Meshkov "combines primitive demagogy with ignorance and a large measure of 
chauvinism," said Mustafa Jemiloglu, chairman of the Assembly of the Crimean 
Tatar People. The group is boycotting Sunday's opinion poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "To solve Crimea's economic problems, there is no need either to declare 
Crimea independent or to rejoin Russia," Jemiloglu said. 
</P>
<P>
 As if the politics of the opinion poll were not complicated enough, voters 
Sunday will also be asked to elect members of the Ukrainian Parliament. But 
separatist leaders are boycotting this contest, calling on voters to take their 
Ukrainian ballots home so the 51% voter turnout required to validate the 
election will not be met. It is unclear whether Crimea will send any lawmakers 
to Kiev. 
</P>
<P>
 Crimeans will also elect a 98-member local Parliament. Under a new quota 
system, 14 of the seats are reserved for Tatars, who had no representation in 
the old legislature, and four seats are designated for Armenians, Germans, 
Bulgarians and Greeks, who were also deported from Crimea. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the leading contenders for the remaining seats is the Russian Party of 
the Crimea, which favors eventual reunification with Russia by peaceful means. 
The party is led by Sergei I. Shuvainikov, 39, who has been endorsed by Russian 
ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuvainikov dreams of a great Slavic state that will one day unite Russia, 
Ukraine, Belarus and Crimea. But he calls himself a pacifist and warns that 
Meshkov's opinion poll will only increase tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Crimeans such as Yevdokia Gribasova will be voting not their 
passports but their pocketbooks. The 67-year-old Siberian-born retiree has an 
impressive-sounding monthly pension of 464,000 karbovanets. It's now worth 
about $12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got ill this winter, and I really would have liked to have eaten an 
orange," she said. "But you know, I couldn't afford it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gribasova is voting "Da" to Meshkov. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not against Kiev," she said. "I just want us to live better."

GUNMAN CLAIMS HE ONLY TRIED TO WOUND COLOSIO; MEXICO: ABURTO TELLS 
INVESTIGATORS HE WANTED TO CALL ATTENTION TO PACIFIST VIEWS. HE IMPLIES HE 
DIDN'T ACT ALONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mario Aburto Martinez, the accused assassin of Mexican presidential candidate 
Luis Donaldo Colosio, told investigators that he intended only to wound Colosio 
and call attention to his own pacifist views, said the gunman's lawyer and a 
human rights official on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Aburto refused to tell interrogators whether he had accomplices, 
he implied that he did not act alone, said Xavier Carvajal, a prominent Tijuana 
lawyer who represented Aburto during a three-hour interrogation after the 
assassination Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never said who, but he insinuated that others were involved," Carvajal 
said Friday. "However, he gave no reasons, no names, no places." 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto was arraigned Friday in a court near the capital, accused of 
premeditated murder and carrying a gun without a permit. He will face a minimum 
of 40 years in prison if convicted, said Hugo Morales, a spokesman for the 
attorney general's office in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also revealed that Aburto, who worked and lived on both sides of the 
border in recent years, was politically active in both Mexico and the United 
States. Although he was not a legal resident, Los Angeles County voter records 
indicate that he was a registered Democrat and may have voted in U.S. 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Carvajal and state human rights ombudsman Jose Luis Perez Canchola, who 
was also present during Aburto's questioning, said his confession gave them the 
impression that others were involved. They said Aburto also admitted to 
practicing for the attack at a Tijuana shooting range and wanted to draw press 
attention to his views, specifically mentioning his hopes for coverage by a 
Spanish-language television tabloid show. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities say Aburto emerged from a crowd and shot Colosio twice, 
once in the head at point-blank range, after a campaign rally at a Tijuana 
shantytown. Perez and Carvajal's accounts were the strongest indication so far 
that Aburto may not have acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mexican federal law enforcement officials say Aburto was the only 
gunman, they have not explicitly discussed a motive or ruled out a plot 
involving others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation is continuing, and we will not engage in speculation," 
Morales said. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosive case now proceeds to a trial phase. In Mexico, this involves 
exchanges of declarations and hearings before a judge and can last as long as a 
year. The suspect was flown Thursday from Tijuana to the Almoloya de Juarez 
prison outside Mexico City, a maximum-security facility where some of Mexico's 
most notorious drug traffickers are serving time. Aburto is being held without 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is being investigated by special federal prosecutor Miguel Montes 
Garcia, whom President Carlos Salinas de Gortari named to the job Thursday. 
Some of Colosio's supporters have openly accused his political rivals of 
masterminding the assassination. The newly contentious, uncertain climate of 
Mexican politics -- plagued earlier this year by an Indian uprising in the 
southern state of Chiapas and the kidnaping of a prominent banker -- has 
fostered doubts and conspiracy theories. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said he does not believe that the gunman acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt that he acted alone because of the circumstances of the crime," said 
Perez, a respected figure in Baja California. "For one, the fact that he 
practiced to shoot him. He needed information to get there and be there at the 
right spot. We are talking about a maquiladora worker. All of this makes me 
believe that he needed other people. This is the type of act that lends itself 
collective involvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto said he practiced at a Tijuana firing range during the weeks before the 
incident. He said he bought the gun from a person whose identity he refused to 
disclose, according to the accounts. Investigators still have not determined 
precisely where or when Aburto obtained the Brazilian-made, .38-caliber Taurus 
revolver allegedly used to kill the candidate, according to Mexican officials. 
</P>
<P>
 New details emerged Friday about the alleged assassin's life on both sides of 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
 A 23-year-old with a junior high school education, he reportedly belonged to 
the Assn. of Committees of the People, one of the many grass-roots political 
organizations that thrive in Tijuana's working-class neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 He possessed current voting credentials issued by the Mexican federal 
government and the Baja state government, according to Tijuana press reports 
Friday that included photos of the identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely, he was also registered to vote in California -- even though 
non-citizens are barred from voting. Though a citizen of Mexico, he may have 
voted in U.S. elections while residing in San Pedro, according to county voter 
registration records. The law prohibits non-citizens from participating in 
federal elections and most local elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario A. Martinez of San Pedro, born on Oct. 3, 1970 -- the suspect's birth 
date -- appears on current Los Angeles county voter registration rolls. He 
registered to vote as a Democrat on Sept. 1, 1990, the records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI has joined the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in an 
investigation in Southern California, where Aburto worked and lived 
intermittently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing an investigation with the Mexican government following up leads 
after the incident," an FBI spokeswoman said.

AMESES PRESSURED TO TRANSFER $2.2 MILLION IN ALLEGED PAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government sought Friday to have accused CIA turncoat Aldrich H. Ames and 
his wife held in contempt of court for failing to obey a court order to 
transfer to this country $2.2 million in alleged Russian payoffs.  
</P>
<P>
 The government also opposed a defense motion that a federal court allow them 
to spend up to $500 a month in now-frozen assets on expenses for their 
5-year-old son, Paul.But Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark Hulkower said the government 
would agree to releasing $300 a month for the child if the Ameses turn over to 
the court the $2.2 million believed stashed overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ameses are no more entitled to have their ill-gotten gains released than 
the incarcerated bank robber is entitled to claim that stolen bank funds should 
be released to support his family," Hulkower argued in papers filed in U.S. 
District Court in suburban Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 "If defendants' concern for the welfare of their child is genuine, they should 
make all their criminally derived funds available to the government, out of 
which their child will be supported." 
</P>
<P>
 Hulkower called it "an extraordinary display of audacity" for the defendants 
to defy the court's order to bring foreign assets here and at the same time ask 
the judge to modify his March 10 order barring them from spending any money in 
11 foreign and domestic bank and brokerage accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton has set a hearing for Tuesday for arguments 
on the motions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, a 31-year CIA veteran who once headed counterintelligence in the Soviet 
section, and his wife, Rosario, were arrested Feb. 21 on charges of spying for 
the Soviet Union and then Russia. They have been held without bail, and their 
son has been cared for by friends and relatives.

TOBACCO INDUSTRY FIGHTS SPIRALING EFFORTS TO SNUFF IT OUT; HEALTH: SMOKING 
BANS, CIGARETTE TAXES AND NICOTINE REGULATIONS THREATEN A ONCE-POWERFUL LOBBY. 
BUT THE HOSTILE CLIMATE IS NOT NEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the tobacco industry, these are not quite the worst of times. In the 
middle of the last century, people in some parts of the country could be fined 
or even hauled off to jail for lighting up in public. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his 18 years of defending the industry, Walker Merryman has never seen 
anything like the current blitzkrieg against cigarettes and people who smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happened in the last month is an extraordinary, probably unprecedented 
confluence of events," said Merryman, who is vice president of the Tobacco 
Institute. "There's never been a time when there have been so many things 
leveled against us." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, many states and cities have enacted laws banning or limiting 
smoking in public. Several fast-food chains, including McDonald's, Taco Bell 
and Jack in the Box, have banned smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 And even more remarkably, the federal government has eagerly thrown its full 
force behind the assault. For at least 30 years, even as federal health 
officials waged an unrelenting campaign against the perils of smoking, 
Congress, the White House and the regulatory agencies had regarded the tobacco 
industry as politically untouchable. 
</P>
<P>
 No more: 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the Food and Drug Administration says that it has the 
authority to regulate cigarettes as drugs and, ultimately, to remove them from 
the market.  
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Labor announced Friday that it will propose a sweeping 
prohibition of smoking in all workplaces, invoking its authority under 
occupational health and safety laws. The move is expected to affect more than 6 
million job sites, including industrial plants, restaurants, offices and other 
commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department, the nation's largest employer, recently announced that 
it would prohibit smoking in all of its workplaces worldwide, a move that will 
affect 3 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 To help finance his health care reform bill, President Clinton proposed a 
cigarette tax increase of 75 cents a pack. The first congressional subcommittee 
to vote on his plan upped the ante to $1.25. 
</P>
<P>
 And Congress is poised to consider legislation, sponsored by Rep. Henry A. 
Waxman (D-Los Angeles), to ban smoking in all public places. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congressman Waxman's bill would have been laughed at only a year or two ago, 
but today it is considered serious legislation," said Matt Myers, a Washington 
lawyer who has been involved in anti-smoking activities for many years. "And 
the very fact that the President proposed a tax increase of 75 cents and the 
first subcommittee to consider health care reform increased it by an additional 
50 cents would never have happened in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the anti-smoking steamroller appears to have gathered momentum in 
recent weeks, most observers agree that it has been several years coming and is 
the result of a complex set of pressures and events. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, President Clinton is friendly to the anti-smoking movement and has 
tied the habit into his health care reform plan.  
</P>
<P>
 For another, a growing body of scientific evidence on the dangers of so-called 
secondhand smoke has culminated with an influential Environmental Protection 
Agency report declaring environmental smoke a "Class A carcinogen," meaning 
that it is an indisputable cause of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA began looking at the issue seriously in 1991, after petitions from the 
Coalition on Smoking or Health had languished there for several years. The 
coalition had asked the agency, under its authority to regulate health claims, 
to act against cigarette companies that were pitching their brands as low in 
tar and nicotine, with the implication that they were healthier. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA, going even further than the coalition had asked, concluded that it 
could regulate cigarettes as it does drugs because nicotine is highly 
addictive. The FDA believes that gives it the authority to prohibit the sale of 
tobacco products that contain enough nicotine to cause or satisfy addiction, 
although it has asked Congress for direction before setting out on this course. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler signaled the agency's intentions in a Feb. 
25 letter to the coalition. Kessler, testifying before Waxman's subcommittee 
Friday, blasted the tobacco industry for seeking ways to add nicotine back into 
low-nicotine cigarettes, a charge that the industry has consistently denied. 
Kessler also attacked companies for insisting that nicotine is not addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when a smoker has his or her larynx removed, 40% try smoking again," he 
told Congress. "Most smokers are, in effect, deprived of the choice to stop 
smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Ballin, chairman of the Coalition on Smoking or Health, said that he 
doubts the FDA will pull all cigarettes off the marketplace but expects 
significant regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly wouldn't discourage a ban, but I don't think it's a practical 
alternative," he conceded. "Our view is the middle ground. If they remain 
legal, there is still far more the federal government could be doing to ensure 
consumer safety." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition favors banning cigarette advertising or at least limiting it to 
"tombstone" advertising (without pictures). "Without Joe Camel around every 
corner or the beautiful Virginia Slims woman, you'll see a significant decline" 
in smoking, Ballin declared. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also seeks increased information on cigarette packs, including full 
disclosure of additives -- "The industry should have to prove these additives 
are safe," Ballin said -- a warning that cigarettes are addictive and a 
beefed-up list of smoking-related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributing to the anti-smoking climate is a sudden turnaround in public 
attitudes toward smoking and smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think nonsmokers finally realize they just don't want to put up with other 
people's smoke in public places anymore," said Waxman, who chairs the House 
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment. "Before, it was 
just a nuisance and they felt that smokers should have their rights as well. 
But, now that you know you're going to be poisoned by somebody else's smoke, 
you feel there's no excuse for it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Art Caplan, a University of Minnesota medical ethicist, believes that 
nonsmokers no longer feel sorry for smokers' addiction and have come to resent 
and blame them instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "As people start to think about sharing the cost of health care with their 
neighbors, they start to wonder why they have to share that cost if their 
neighbor smokes," he said. "If their neighbor smokes, drinks, has multiple sex 
partners, is a fat couch potato, they begin to say: 'I don't want to pay the 
price of that person's lifestyle.' And smoking is at the head of this 
particular parade of vices because we know so much about its impact on health." 
</P>
<P>
 Caplan said that he finds a complete reversal of thinking about cigarettes in 
the last 25 years. "Once it was cool. Now it's suspect. Once it was a sign of 
being tough and manly. Now it's a sign of being flawed and addicted." 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry believes it has become a victim of elitism. "It is class 
war without mentioning class," Merryman said. "It's an excellent way to hate 
the white working class without going on record as hating the white working 
class." 
</P>
<P>
 The industry would rather fight than switch to any other strategy. As recently 
as Thursday, Philip Morris, the largest tobacco company, filed a $10-billion 
lawsuit against ABC-TV, which reported in a recent newsmagazine program that 
the tobacco company spiked its cigarettes with nicotine to increase the odds 
that smokers would become addicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Merryman promised legal challenges against the state actions to ban smoking in 
public places, as well as heavy lobbying in Congress. And the FDA will probably 
not be able to regulate nicotine as a drug without first facing a court battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one should underestimate the ability or willingness of this industry to 
very vigorously defend itself," Merryman said.

<P>
 The only nuclear power plant in Mexico was shaken slightly by an earthquake, 
but no damage or injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The national earthquake center in Mexico City said the quake, which measured 
4.3, was centered about 12 miles offshore from the Laguna Verde nuclear plant, 
which is on the Gulf of Mexico coast.

LETTER SHOWS OFFICIAL DOUBTS ON WHITEWATER PROSECUTION; PROBE: THEN-U.S. 
ATTORNEY WARNED FBI IN 1992 THAT CHARGES MIGHT NOT BE PROVABLE AND WOULD NOT BE 
FAIR IN LIGHT OF POLITICAL SITUATION. 
</P>

<P>
 As the 1992 presidential election approached, the U.S. attorney in Little Rock 
argued vehemently against bringing charges in the Whitewater controversy, 
contending that initiating prosecution at that time would constitute 
"prosecutorial misconduct," it was learned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Then-U.S. Atty. Charles A. Banks, a Republican appointee, warned in a letter 
to the FBI that taking federal action then would be unfair because it could 
give a sense of legitimacy to allegations affecting a candidate that might not 
be provable. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual October, 1992, letter from Banks to Don Pettus, then the special 
agent in charge of the FBI's Little Rock office, sheds light on a little-known 
struggle within the federal bureaucracy on what to do about the Whitewater case 
as Election Day approached. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode provides the basis for a central dispute that rages today on the 
matter: Was it a case of financial and political abuse that was long stifled 
and stalled for political reasons? Or was it a tangled financial mess that, 
while requiring delicate handling and attention to fairness, was of marginal 
importance compared with other savings and loan prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican critics of the Clinton Administration have moved toward the former 
interpretation. They released documents Thursday from investigator R. Jean 
Lewis, who worked for the Resolution Trust Corp., conveying her frustration and 
suspicions about delays in the case. The RTC is the federal agency set up to 
oversee failed S&Ls 
</P>
<P>
 Banks' letter, which he acknowledged writing but refused to discuss Friday, 
reflects the position held by some Justice Department officials who saw Lewis 
as overzealous and unfairly single-minded about a matter that could have had 
major electoral repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, the leading House Republican critic of 
the Administration on the Whitewater case, said Leach did not have a copy of 
Banks' letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach, releasing documents Thursday that shed new light on the controversy, 
charged that the Arkansas real estate venture was ultimately used "to skim, 
directly or indirectly, federally insured deposits" from a Little Rock savings 
and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, Banks noted that he had met with the FBI on a "referral" for 
possible criminal prosecution in the case involving Madison Guaranty Savings & 
Loan, which was owned by James B. McDougal, a partner with then-Gov. Bill 
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Whitewater Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks said that even after a second review of the case, he still had doubts 
that it could be successfully prosecuted against any of the witnesses in the 
case. The Clintons, as investors in the Whitewater project, one of the McDougal 
enterprises that investigators believe was used to skim money from Madison 
Guaranty, were among the witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter noted that Pettus had been ordered to conduct an immediate review 
of the case to determine if prosecution was warranted and to provide an answer 
later that week. He did not make clear who in the FBI was ordering Pettus to 
move quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI spokesman John Collingwood said Friday that he would have no comment. 
Banks, in declining to comment, said: "As (then-) U.S. attorney, I could not 
properly discuss reports and correspondence about cases, and I don't feel I 
have been relieved of that restriction today. And now that there is a (special 
counsel) assigned to the case, it is even more inappropriate for me to 
comment." 
</P>
<P>
 But in his letter to Pettus, Banks made it clear that he resented the pressure 
for action, without revealing its source. He said neither he nor anyone in the 
U.S. attorney's office would take part in the inquiry before the Nov. 3 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter said that moving further on the case at that point -- presumably to 
a federal grand jury -- would lead to press inquiries and give legitimacy to 
charges that might not be provable. This would be inappropriate and would 
amount to prosecutorial misconduct, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, Banks tried to remove himself from the case, but the 
Justice Department found no grounds for "recusal" and supported his view that 
no criminal action should be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 A second criminal referral eventually was made and the entire case is now 
being investigated by Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostrow reported from Washington and Rempel from Little Rock.

SENATE OKS $1.5-TRILLION BUDGET; REPUBLICANS CALL FOR MORE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate voted, 57 to 40, on Friday to approve the outlines of President 
Clinton's budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But the senators insisted on $26 billion more in deficit reduction over the 
next five years than either the President or the House has been willing to 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore presided over the Senate in the final hour of debate. 
The vote went roughly along party lines, with Republican Sens. Mark O. Hatfield 
of Oregon and James M. Jeffords of Vermont siding with Democrats in approving 
the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional spending cuts, which would likely fall most heavily on defense 
programs, withstood several challenges during a week of debate. However, the 
Administration has vowed to eliminate or significantly scale back the spending 
cuts when House and Senate conferees meet after the spring recess to resolve 
differences in their budget resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget resolution approved Friday provides for $1.5 trillion in spending 
during fiscal 1995, including about a third that would go for discretionary 
spending for domestic programs, defense and foreign aid. The remaining 
two-thirds of the budget would go for Social Security and other mandatory 
spending programs and interest on the federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense spending under the Senate plan would total $270.7 billion in 1995, or 
about $8 billion less than this year and about the same as Clinton and the 
House have proposed.

CLINTON AIDE MAY HAVE TRIED TO AFFECT PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A senior White House official inquired last month about removing a prominent 
Republican hired by the Resolution Trust Corp. to investigate claims arising 
from the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, according to sources 
familiar with the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said senior White House officials George Stephanopoulos and Harold 
M. Ickes were alarmed and outraged when they discovered in late February that 
the RTC, an independent regulatory agency, had hired Jay B. Stephens to handle 
possible civil suits growing out of the Madison Guaranty case. Stephens 
severely criticized the Clinton Administration after he was fired as U.S. 
attorney for the District of Columbia in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House apparently dropped the subject of reversing the hiring of 
Stephens after being told by Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman and 
Treasury Chief of Staff Joshua Steiner that there was nothing to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 But the efforts to find out whether Stephens could be replaced represents the 
first time the White House has been shown to have actively attempted to affect 
the handling of the politically sensitive investigation. One area of the RTC 
civil investigation concerns the potential liability of the Rose Law Firm, 
including former partner Hillary Rodham Clinton, for its representation of 
Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior White House officials raised the issue of Stephens' hiring in two 
conversations with the Treasury Department officials on Feb. 25, just after 
discovering Stephens had been retained. 
</P>
<P>
 Ickes, the deputy chief of staff, and Stephanopoulous, Clinton's senior 
adviser, called Altman, who was also serving as acting head of the RTC and had 
just announced he would recuse himself from the RTC's investigation of Madison 
Guaranty. Stephanopoulous also spoke with Steiner. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanopoulos said Friday he did not "remember exactly what was said" during 
his conversation with Steiner but that he "asked how Jay Stephens came to be 
retained by the RTC. I was puzzled and blew off steam over the unfairness of 
that decision. . . . Once I got the facts from Josh, that ended the matter as 
far as I was concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanopoulos said he did not remember asking Steiner whether the decision 
could be reversed or discussing the issue with Altman. Ickes declined to 
comment.

PRESS FOUND PUTTING STRESS ON POLITICS OF HEALTH REFORM; MEDIA: NEW STUDY ALSO 
REVEALS THAT PUBLIC SEEMS TO GROW MORE CONFUSED OVER ADMINISTRATION PLAN. 
INSURANCE INDUSTRY AD CAMPAIGN MAY BE A CAUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Press coverage of health care reform has been balanced but it has tended to 
emphasize the politics rather than the medical fallout of reform, a new study 
of the public and the press reveals. 
</P>
<P>
 As time has gone on, the study released Friday also asserts, the public 
appears more confused about what is contained in the Administration's health 
care proposal than it was when the proposal was first announced in September. 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the results of a "monitoring project" on health care by the 
Kaiser Family Foundation, the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press 
and the Columbia Journalism Review. The findings, the second installment of the 
monitoring project, are derived from a public opinion survey and a content 
analysis of 2,000 newspaper, magazine and television stories about health care 
published between Sept. 1 and Nov. 30, 1993. That roughly covers the period 
from the President's introduction of the health care plan to a joint session of 
Congress through Thanksgiving last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The content analysis found press coverage "overwhelmingly balanced or 
neutral," with 80% of the stories about policy disputes falling into this 
category, 73% of the stories about the prospects of passage in this category 
and 68% of the stories about President Clinton in this category. 
</P>
<P>
 Those stories that were not neutral tended to be critical of the 
Administration or its plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the survey was more critical of the focus of the press coverage. The 
largest single category of stories, 31% of the combined print and TV reports, 
focused on the political impact of health care, such as on the President's 
standing or those of other political figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The next largest focus of coverage, 21% of the stories, concerned the impact 
of reform on the health care system, such as the structure of health alliances 
or how they affected insurance companies.  
</P>
<P>
 Next, 17% of the coverage concerned the effect of reform on individuals and 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the coverage concerned "the broader nonpolitical impact of reform" 
(12%), the economic aspects of reform (12%) and the impact on doctors and 
nurses and medicine (6%). 
</P>
<P>
 The study found some differences by media. Television coverage was more driven 
by events -- a presidential speech, a press conference -- while print coverage 
provided more background of the plans and the economic aspects. Television 
coverage, however, was found to focus more than print on the consequences of 
reform on individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public opinion survey also found that public awareness of the health 
care plan has dropped in the months since Clinton proposed the plan in 
September. In December, for instance, 54% correctly answered that the Clinton 
plan would guarantee health care for all, down from 64% in September.  
</P>
<P>
 The number of people who thought they would have less freedom to choose a 
doctor grew, to 54% in December from 44% three months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Several factors may account for these changes in public knowledge: the 
tendency to focus over time on those criticizing the plan and the ad campaign 
from insurance companies denouncing the plan, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 The content survey included the evening newscasts of ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC, 
plus the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, USA Today 
and the Wall Street Journal. Time, Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report also 
were studied, as were four regional newspapers: the Dallas Morning News, Des 
Moines Register, Miami Herald and Seattle Times and 14 articles appearing in 
ethnic publications.

ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVIST FOUND GUILTY IN ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An anti-abortion activist who admitted that she shot a doctor who performs 
abortions and considered blowing up his clinic was convicted of attempted 
murder Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sedgwick County District Court jury also convicted Rachelle Shannon on one 
count of aggravated assault for pointing a gun at an employee of Dr. George 
Tiller, the physician wounded in the Aug. 19, 1993, attack outside his clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old Grants Pass, Ore., woman showed no emotion as the verdict was 
read. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Friday, Shannon had testified that she considered bombing Tiller's 
clinic after she learned he was back at work the day after she had wounded him 
in both arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about innocent, helpless babies being killed by other people 
who won't stop unless somebody stops them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing was set for April 29. She faces approximately seven years in prison 
if given the maximum sentence for both convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon said she never intended to kill Tiller, testifying that she had 
practiced with her gun and could have killed him if she had wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether she meant to kill Tiller was irrelevant, Shannon said, "because it 
would have been right either way to try to stop what he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody kills George Tiller, I would not assume they did the wrong 
thing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Nola Foulston argued that Shannon really was trying to kill 
Tiller. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I have to tell you, she's no Annie Oakley," Foulston said in closing 
arguments. "This is a woman who now wants to take advantage, perhaps, of the 
fact she's a lousy shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon fled the clinic after shooting Tiller and was arrested in Oklahoma 
City the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 She testified that she asked police about her possible bail and Wichita public 
transportation after her arrest because she was thinking about "doing more" to 
stop Tiller. 
</P>
<P>
 During cross-examination Foulston asked Shannon what she meant by "more." She 
replied that she wanted to close Tiller's clinic by bombing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "And how were you going to do that?" Foulston asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably would have had to go out there again and figure it out," she said.

CLINTON VISITS SOLDIERS INJURED IN N. CAROLINA PLANE COLLISION 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton surveyed the charred site of a devastating military plane 
crash Friday and visited with two dozen soldiers burned in the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very, very moving, and I'm very glad I came," Clinton said after his 
hospital visits. 
</P>
<P>
 The sky was overcast and the air heavy as Clinton's motorcade crawled by the 
burned, crumbled remains of the C-141 transport plane that exploded Wednesday 
after being hit by an F-16 that had collided with another plane in midair. 
</P>
<P>
 The President left his car to view the area where 500 paratroopers waiting to 
board the C-141 were engulfed by an inferno. The death total had climbed to 23 
by the time of Clinton's visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he made "small talk" with burn victims at the Womack Army Medical 
Center at adjacent Ft. Bragg. His first stop was the intensive care unit, where 
he spoke to two badly burned victims of the accident, according to White House 
spokesman Jeff Eller. 
</P>
<P>
 He also spoke individually with 26 less severely injured patients with burns 
on their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The morale of the people who have been burned and injured is high," the 
President reported. "Their pride in their work and their country is very 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Person after person said, 'You know, I just can't wait to get back to my 
work; I'm ready to serve again,' " Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said he was "profoundly grateful" to those who had been caring 
for the soldiers injured in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 After his visit to the base, Clinton flew to Dallas, where he, First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter, Chelsea, attended a wedding rehearsal 
dinner Friday night for Clinton's younger brother, Roger, and his bride-to-be, 
Molly Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Clinton, 37, and Martin, 25, are to be married today in the DeGolyer 
House at the Dallas Arboretum, with the President serving as best man. Martin 
is pregnant with Roger's child and is due in late April.

N.J. PIPELINE RECONSTRUCTED AS BLAST VICTIMS SEEK AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigators on Friday began painstakingly piecing together a natural gas 
pipeline that exploded a day earlier, leveling eight apartment buildings and 
leaving 300 people homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The last missing residents of the apartment complex were located Friday, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 80 people were injured by the fire that the blast touched off early 
Thursday, but only one death was blamed on the explosion, that of a 32-year-old 
woman who suffered a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 After touring the site, Small Business Administration officials said Friday 
that residents of the complex were eligible for federal disaster loans to 
offset an estimated $23 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston-based Panhandle Eastern Corp., owner of pipeline operator Texas 
Eastern Gas Pipeline Co., was providing money for homeless people to stay 
temporarily in hotels and to buy necessities. 
</P>
<P>
 Weary and scared residents whose apartments had been spared filtered back to 
the area throughout the day, hoping to retrieve belongings. But code 
enforcement officers first had to finish checking all apartments that were 
still standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor George Spadoro said most residents likely would be allowed back in their 
homes by today. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents who lost everything came to a command center set up by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm wiped out. I'm at a loss what to do," said Suman Sinha, who escaped the 
inferno with his wife and 5-year-old child. 
</P>
<P>
 SBA spokesman Erskine Bowles said nearly 500 units of the Durham Woods 
Apartments and five nearby businesses were significantly damaged. He said the 
agency hopes to set up a field office by Monday to begin taking applications 
for loans to homeowners, renters and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Christine Todd Whitman declared a state of emergency for the area Friday 
and ordered five natural gas suppliers to immediately reduce pressure in their 
transmission lines to 5% of the maximum level as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman's declaration will help residents qualify for federal aid and gives 
state police power to take any necessary action to protect residents. 
</P>
<P>
 National Transportation and Safety Board investigators spent the day at a 
60-foot-deep crater created by the blast. The jagged edges of the 36-inch 
diameter steel transmission pipe jutted from the gaping hole. About 80 feet of 
pipe was missing, scattered by the powerful blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers searched with metal detectors and by hand for pipe fragments and 
planned to reassemble them to examine the surface at the point of rupture. The 
break may have been caused by corrosion, faulty materials or a massive buildup 
of pressure.

FBI INVESTIGATING LEAKS IN UC TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The FBI is looking into reports that a computer hacker has found a way to 
penetrate and extract information from the University of California's private 
electronic communication system, FBI spokesman Rick Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials are concerned over breaches in the UC communications 
system, especially since the San Francisco Examiner's publication earlier this 
week of what it called a verbatim account of a private March 2 meeting between 
UC President Jack Peltason and university chancellors. 
</P>
<P>
 Peltason made derisive remarks about state legislators and a UC regent in the 
account of the meeting. He has rejected calls by several state senators that he 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
 UC officials also confirmed that there is an investigation into possible leaks 
in the communication system but declined to release any other details about the 
inquiry. The interceptions could include tapping phone lines and breaking into 
electronic systems, although evidence of that has not been found. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're not commenting on is the scope of the investigation," said Tom 
Debley, UC assistant news director. 
</P>
<P>
 State Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer, who was the target of Peltason's 
barbs during the March 2 meeting, said Thursday that a hacker called a radio 
talk show host and claimed to have broken into the UC communications system. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer refused to release any further information about the call, including 
the name of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oakland Tribune, citing an unidentified source close to the university, 
said that the interception of UC communications could have been going on for up 
to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear among UC officials is that the hacker may have had access to private 
lawyer-client discussions in addition to staff meetings. They have criticized 
the published account of the meeting as an invasion of privacy but have not 
disputed its accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This apparent illegal bugging is serious," Peltason said in a letter sent to 
Regent Frank Clark.

EPA WILL OPEN SAN DIEGO OFFICE TO FOCUS ON POLLUTION NEAR BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday that it would open 
an office in San Diego focusing on the problems of air, water and hazardous 
waste pollution along the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit, one of two the EPA is setting up to deal specifically with border 
issues, grows out of concern that increased trade with Mexico under NAFTA could 
cause increasing environmental headaches.EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner 
signaled last year that she wanted to direct more resources to the border 
region. The other EPA office will be in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps. Lynn Schenk and Bob Filner, both Democrats from San Diego, had pushed 
for the establishment of the office. Schenk said it would be located in her 
49th District. Schenk had lobbied President Clinton to bring the Border 
Environmental Cooperation Commission -- an outgrowth of NAFTA -- to the San 
Diego/Tijuana region, but Schenk conceded this week that the commission will 
most likely be situated in Juarez, Mexico.

WILSON ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT MOVE PAROLED RAPIST; PRISONS: OFFICIALS SAY 
MELVIN CARTER WILL BE UNDER SUCH TIGHT SUPERVISION THAT HE WILL BE UNABLE TO 
HARM ANYONE. MODOC COUNTY PROSECUTOR VOWS A NEW LEGAL BATTLE. 
</P>

<P>
 Despite an uproar from Modoc County residents and a plea from a woman who says 
she was one of serial rapist Melvin Carter's victims, the Pete Wilson 
Administration said Friday that it will not move the repeat sex offender from 
the remote northeast California prison camp where he is on parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections Department Director James Gomez said he is confident that Carter 
will be under such strict supervision that he will be unable to harm anyone in 
Modoc County, where he is to remain on parole for the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez, in a statement released Friday afternoon, said he was unable to verify 
the assertion of a woman living in Modoc County who says Carter raped her 16 
years ago in Hayward. 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, a victim or witnesses to a violent crime that has been 
proved in court may ask that a parolee not be placed within 35 miles of their 
homes, Gomez said. But this victim, he said, never reported the rape to the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 "Therefore, we were unable to verify the link between her and Melvin Carter, 
which would have triggered the 35-mile rule," Gomez said. "This does not mean 
one does not exist, just that there is no police report or law enforcement 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 The state could have moved Carter even without verification of the woman's 
story, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez also rejected the county's contention that placing a violent felon such 
as Carter at the minimum-security Devil's Garden conservation camp violates the 
terms of the state's permit with the U.S. Forest Service, which owns the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the permit contains no such assurance, state officials have 
acknowledged that they promised that no violent inmates would be sent to the 
camp. But the state contends that Carter, because he is on parole, is not an 
inmate at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez said Carter agreed in writing this week to an additional condition of 
his parole that will prevent him from going anywhere outside the camp limits 
without being escorted by a prison guard.  
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson spokeswoman said the governor was informed of the decision as it was 
being announced but played no role in the deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the job of his Corrections Department," said Leslie Goodman, the 
governor's communications director. 
</P>
<P>
 Modoc officials, who have charged that their county was selected as Carter's 
location because it is home to only a politically insignificant handful of 
registered voters, reacted angrily to the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wonder how they could review these issues and come up with that result," 
said Mike Maxwell, the county administrator. "We don't believe they've given 
either one of them due consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Modoc County Dist. Atty. Ruth Sorensen, who has led the 
legal battle to rid the county of Carter, said the prosecutor expected to be 
back in court Monday morning fighting the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, 49, was convicted in 1982 on 23 counts of rape, assault and burglary 
and confessed to raping dozens of women in an 11-year rampage through the Bay 
Area. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison and was released after serving 
half that time because of credits he earned for good behavior and for working 
while in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's release became an issue in Wilson's reelection campaign when the 
leading Democratic contender, Treasurer Kathleen Brown, charged that Wilson's 
Administration had bungled an opportunity to keep the notorious parolee behind 
bars for two more years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, however, presented documents to rebut Brown's charge and, supported by 
local prosecutors, said nothing more could have been done to prevent Carter's 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the furor died down, Wilson's predicament continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to protests by residents of Hayward, where Carter was originally to 
be paroled, Wilson instructed the Department of Corrections to put the rapist 
"in the wilderness somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 That turned out to be Modoc County, where Carter was spirited into the prison 
camp March 17 in the trunk of a car. Since then he has been living in a small 
bungalow, reportedly reading a novel a day and watching television.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY : OXNARD; EASTER BUNNY VISITS PUPILS AT BERRY HUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Easter bunny paid an early visit to a group of youngsters in Oxnard 
schools Friday, bringing them loads of fresh strawberries and a chance to play 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 youngsters lined up on a grassy knoll behind the Carl Dwire School in 
Oxnard before dashing off to find hidden strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long -- about 10 minutes -- for the kids to find all 750 
strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
 Susy Cueanas, 5, scrunched up her face every time she bit into a strawberry. 
It wasn't because they were sour, the Oxnard youth said, but "because they 
taste good." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Lostutter, 6, of Oxnard had to be content eating candy. Her name tag 
included the notation: "Allergic to strawberries." 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make sure she could participate, but she can't eat the fruit," 
said Dwire school secretary Karen Seropian.  
</P>
<P>
 The strawberry hunt is an annual event sponsored by the California Strawberry 
Festival as a community service, said Eileen Stein, a spokeswoman for the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman dressed as a giant strawberry was introduced to the kids as "Super 
Strawberry." And cartons of berries were stacked in piles around the grass hunt 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the strawberry hunters were kindergarten students from Christa 
McAuliffe School in Oxnard. About 20 were from Dwire school, a county-run 
school that specializes in education for children with mental and physical 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just wonderful to see the children's faces light up when the hunt 
begins," said Peggy Kenney, a teacher at Dwire school. "I love this event 
because our children are playing right along with the mainstream children. 
There is no emphasis on disabled or non-disabled." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third year that Strawberry Festival organizers have put on a berry 
hunt, Kenney said. And with forecasters originally calling for stormy weather, 
they were lucky to have clear skies, Kenney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody up there was looking out for us," she said. KAY SAILLANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY : VENTURA; CITY HELPING TO SPONSOR ART WALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Ventura is sponsoring an art walk today in conjunction with area 
coffeehouses and art galleries to promote the downtown area, which city leaders 
are trying to revitalize. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five galleries and seven coffeehouses in downtown are participating in 
the free, one-day event, scheduled from 5 to 9:30 p.m. Some coffeehouses plan 
to offer free samples during the "Java Jump," as the event is called. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a self-led tour," said Sonia Tower, the city's cultural affairs 
coordinator. "You pick up a map at any of the galleries." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who don't feel like walking, two courtesy shuttle vans will operate 
among art galleries, Tower said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9 p.m., drawings for prizes will be held at City Hall's first-floor atrium, 
and some refreshments and entertainment will be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower said only art galleries traditionally had participated in the walk that 
is held periodically, but this year city officials decided to add coffeehouses 
because several had recently opened downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a natural link between the coffeehouses and the galleries, because 
many of the coffeehouses have art exhibits up on an ongoing basis," Tower said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY : VENTURA; OFFICER AND CIVILIAN AMONG HONOREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A traffic officer who recovered $100,000 in overdue fines, a bystander who 
foiled a robbery attempt and a volunteer who compiled records on gang members 
were among those honored by the Ventura Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Cpl.John Turner, 35, was named the department's Officer of the Year in a 
lunchtime ceremony at Ventura City Hall Thursday. Turner, a 13-year veteran 
officer, investigates all traffic accidents in Ventura. Last year he also 
designed a new parking citation system and another program for recovering 
revenue from delinquent parking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "John is a problem-solver, not afraid to take on complicated or unpopular 
issues, and he develops innovative, thoughtful solutions," Police Chief Richard 
Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's Volunteer of the Year award went to Ralph Bonswor of Ventura, 
who has contributed his time the past four years to the department's Crime 
Analysis Unit. He is credited with single-handedly creating files on 1,400 gang 
members and their associates, which has been instrumental in obtaining 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Dittman, a 22-year-old employee of United Parcel Service, received a 
Certificate of Excellence for his intervention in an attempted robbery of a 
bank customer in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Also awarded a Certificate of Excellence were Dave Spooner and Brent Stronge 
of Motorola, who arrived at the Police/Fire Communications Center the morning 
of the Jan. 17 earthquake. The pair provided a generator for emergency 
telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 Among others honored Thursday were Communications Supervisor Mary Walker and 
Office Aide Matt Romo, who received Chief's Shirt Awards; Police Services 
Officer Lynette Lightfoot, the Support Employee of the Year; Sgt. George 
Morris, Supervisor of the Year, and Police Services Officer Graham Jeffrey, the 
Lightbulb Award. PATRICK McCARTNEY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY : OJAI; RADAR TOWER TO STAY, WEATHER SERVICE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Weather Service will not relocate a radar tower from Sulphur 
Mountain even if residents pay for the moving costs, a top Weather Service 
official has informed Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 But Gallegly questioned the statement by Assistant Administrator Elbert W. 
Friday Jr., accusing him of going back on an earlier promise to move the 
controversial radar tower if funds were found to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your letter only clouds this issue further, and further illustrates the 
reasons for the ongoing credibility problems that the residents of Ojai have 
with respect to the National Weather Service," Gallegly said in a letter 
released on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly referred to a March 7 conversation with Friday. In that conversation, 
Gallegly claimed the administrator said the Weather Service would relocate the 
tower "if J.R. or I mean Mr. Hagman wants to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Larry Hagman, who played J.R. Ewing on the television show "Dallas," has 
actively opposed the location of the radar tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said Friday estimated the cost of moving the tower at $500,000 during 
the conversation. Gallegly then promised to find the necessary money. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to Gallegly's office on Wednesday, though, Friday said the 
Weather Service would be unwilling to move the tower regardless of the 
estimated cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aside from the cost, which could run into millions of dollars by the time new 
land is acquired and improved," analysts determined the Sulphur Mountain site 
was the best of 32 possible locations, Friday stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday said tests have shown that area residents are not threatened by the 
installation, and that a federal district judge has ruled that the Weather 
Service has satisfied environmental safeguards. PATRICK McCARTNEY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY : OXNARD; LARGER POOL PROPOSED FOR NEW HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Oxnard High School under construction on Gonzales Road may have a 
25-yard-by-35-yard swimming pool that would be the first of its kind in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 At the suggestion of Oxnard High School's swim coach Larry Raffaelli, the 
Oxnard Union High School District board has agreed to consider building a 
rectangular-shaped pool at the new campus that would be longer than the 
existing L-shaped pool at the existing campus on 5th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing pool has a section of deep water divided into six lanes for 
competitive swimming and another, shallower part for students learning to swim. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with that type of pool, Raffaelli said, is that it has room for 
only two lanes in the shallow section, which are used for swimming instruction. 
And most students entering Oxnard High School need to stay in shallow water 
because they have never learned to swim, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How are you going to put someone in the deep water who can't swim?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raffaelli suggests following the example of Laguna Beach High School and other 
schools and colleges around the state that have built 25-yard-by-35-yard pools, 
which are big enough to have equal sections of shallow and deep water. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the pool's swimming lanes would stretch across the width of the pool 
instead of across its length, there would be room for six lanes in the deep 
water and six in the shallow part. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a pool would cost an estimated $590,000, about $140,000 more than the 
projected cost for a 25-yard-by-25-meter pool. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Steve Stocks said he favors spending the extra money to 
build the larger pool. "It should be good for athletics and also for the P. E. 
classes," he said. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY : OXNARD; POLICE INVESTIGATE GUNFIGHT THAT HURT 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard police are investigating an early morning gunfight outside a fast-food 
restaurant that left two men injured, one of them critically, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 3 a.m. Thursday at Del Taco in the 500 block of 
South Ventura Road, but both victims were found elsewhere, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Travon Lanell Netherly, 25, of Los Angeles was discovered bleeding in his car 
after his companion, 23-year-old Darrin Johnson of Los Angeles, hailed 
firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Netherly, who was shot in the chest, was listed in serious but stable 
condition Friday at St. John's Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The second victim, Eric Pantoja, 23, of Oxnard, was found bleeding at a 
relative's apartment near the restaurant. He was listed in fair condition at 
St. John's with a gunshot wound to the abdomen, but police said his wound was 
not life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Charles Dunham said police believe Pantoja was meeting with Johnson and 
Netherly when the men had a disagreement and shots were fired. Police found a 
.380-caliber handgun registered to Netherly in Netherly's car. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made, and Dunham said none of the three people involved 
is cooperating with investigators. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY : CAMARILLO; $400,000 EARMARKED FOR 17 ORGANIZATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Favoring programs that focus on the elderly, youth and low-cost housing, the 
Camarillo City Council plans to spend more than $400,000 in federal grant money 
on 17 social service providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Three organizations, the Ventura County Senior Nutrition Program, Foodshare 
and Interface Children and Family Services, had about $700 deducted from their 
1994-95 requests because each had carry-over balances from last year and were 
not present at Wednesday's City Council meeting to explain the balances. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chuck Watson, executive director of Interface Children and Family 
Services, said because the way the funds are distributed, the accounting 
paperwork had not yet "caught up" and the agency had already expended its 
1993-94 allocation of $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame we've been penalized," Watson said. "We've already spent the 
allocation. We don't have anything to carry over." J.E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY'S JEWISH COMMUNITY TO MARK PASSOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jews in Ventura County are invited to a community Seder Sunday evening in 
Ventura to celebrate Passover, the holiday commemorating the Israelites' 
freedom from Egyptian slavery about 4,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Jewish Council-Temple Beth Torah, one of the county's largest 
synagogues, is sponsoring the Seder at 5:15 p.m. at the Poinsettia Pavilion, 
3451 Foothill Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Passover begins at sundown today, most Jewish families celebrate the 
first night of Passover with a Seder at home, said Rabbi Michael Berk. 
</P>
<P>
 Seder is the traditional meal that celebrates the Jews' exodus and includes 
ceremonial foods, such as matzo bread, lamb and bitter herbs, which symbolize 
aspects of the Passover story. 
</P>
<P>
 The preschool at Temple Etz Chaim in Thousand Oaks celebrated Passover a day 
early Friday with a Seder lunch.  
</P>
<P>
 "The social hall was filled to capacity," said Eta Weinstein, office manager 
of the preschool, who counted about 400 kids and parents. "It was really 
delightful. We had all the special things on the plate -- they ate everything." 
</P>
<P>
 As told in the Bible, God sent the angel of death to claim the firstborn of 
every household in Egypt. But Jewish households, identified by a marking of 
lamb's blood on the doorway, were "passed over" and their children spared. 
After they were freed by the Pharaoh the Jews left Egypt for the promised land.

 "Passover is especially significant in a time of racial strife, such as now, 
because it is really a universal liberation holiday," Berk said.  
</P>
<P>
 Passover services will be held Sunday at 10 a.m. at the Temple Beth Torah in 
Ventura, and services at the Temple Etz Chaim in Thousand Oaks will run 
throughout the week. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; FIRST CARJACKING REPORTED AT THE OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A carjacking at gunpoint at The Oaks mall -- the first reported there -- left 
a department store worker temporarily without a car but unhurt, sheriff's 
deputies said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Wimer, 35, of Thousand Oaks, was walking to her car from her workplace at 
the mall at about 6:30 p.m. Thursday when a mustachioed man in his late 20s 
walked up from behind, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man jammed a dark semiautomatic pistol into Wimer's left side and demanded 
her car keys, which she gave to him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man then drove off in Wimer's silver 1985 Chrysler, and she ran inside to 
telephone police. 
</P>
<P>
 The car was found in another shopping center less than a mile away, but the 
carjacker was still at large, said Sgt. Kitty Hoberg. Detectives were searching 
the car for evidence Friday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the carjacking was apparently the first in the history of The Oaks, 
there have been about six others in Thousand Oaks in the past two years, Hoberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess people should be aware of it, but it doesn't happen all that often in 
Thousand Oaks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the mall's general manager declined to say whether security at The 
Oaks was tightened because of the carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would prefer not to comment on our security staffing," said General Manager 
Barbara Teuscher. "What they don't know, they don't need to know. (Such 
information) can be used as much by the criminal element as it can to reassure 
people that there is adequate security." MACK REED

LICENSED DRIVERS UP BY JUST 500 IN 1993 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of licensed drivers in Ventura County increased at the slowest rate 
in years in 1993, growing only half as fast as the rest of California, the 
state Department of Motor Vehicles reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County had 475,500 licensed drivers by the end of December, up only 
500 from a year before.That 0.1% increase compared to the 0.2% statewide 
figure, which was the lowest in California in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Both figures reflect the recession-driven slow growth of the 1990s and show 
that the county has been hit hard. 
</P>
<P>
 After annual increases of several thousand licensed drivers in the 1980s, 
Ventura County's increase in licensed drivers fell from 3,900 new drivers in 
1990 to 2,800 in 1991 and 800 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV figures bolster population estimates released recently by the state 
Department of Finance, which show the county grew last fiscal year at its 
slowest rate since annual record keeping began in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners said the county's 1992-93 growth of only 7,700 residents to 703,000 
may have been the slowest since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, five counties actually lost licensed drivers in 1993: Totals 
dropped by 100 each in Sierra and Yuba counties, 500 each in Santa Barbara and 
Monterey counties and 41,500 in Los Angeles County. DARYL KELLEY

</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a dozen Ventura County elected officials and dignitaries will 
compete today in the Punt, Pass and Kick for Charity at halftime of the 12th 
annual Pride Bowl football game in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebrity participants have contributed $1,300 to date for the privilege 
of seeing who can toss or kick the ball the farthest, said Oxnard Police 
Officer Bill Lewis II, Pride Bowl chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pride Bowl, which pits Ventura County law enforcement personnel in a 
football game against their counterparts from the South Bay area of Los Angeles 
County, will kick off at 6 p.m. at Channel Islands High School, 1400 Raiders 
Way, Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, the idea was to have fun and to provide entertainment at halftime," 
Lewis said. "But it is also a way to do some fund-raising." 
</P>
<P>
 Dignitaries have agreed to pay $50 to compete in each of the three events. The 
competition is still open for more entries, Lewis added. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those already scheduled to compete are Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley), Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard), Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, 
Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, Oxnard Councilmen Tom Holden and Andres Herrera, and 
county Supervisors John K. Flynn and Susan Lacey. 
</P>
<P>
 Game tickets are $5 at Johnson's TV in Oxnard, KVEN radio station in Ventura, 
or at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the Pride Bowl will go to the Make-A-Wish Foundation of the 
Tri-Counties, local D.A.R.E. programs and the Gang Alternative Program. PATRICK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SECURITY DISCUSSED FOR MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorneys for a Thousand Oaks teen-ager accused in a capital-punishment case 
met with a judge and other lawyers behind closed doors Friday to discuss 
courtroom security measures in the high-profile incident. 
</P>
<P>
 In about half a dozen hearings since his arrest, defendant Mark Scott Thornton 
has never taken a seat in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton, accused of slaying Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan in September and 
stealing her vehicle, usually stands in the doorway of the holding cell 
adjacent to the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Two public defenders representing Thornton requested Friday's meeting in the 
chambers of Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath. The judge did not issue a 
ruling on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The case gained widespread publicity because a 12-day search for O'Sullivan's 
body and outraged many people who learned of the incident, defense attorneys 
have acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the defense attorneys refused to specify why special security is 
needed or what measures are being sought. Prosecutors also would not disclose 
what was discussed in the judge's chambers. Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. 
Frawley said the defense team asked that the hearing be held outside the 
presence of the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher said it is not unusual for defense 
attorneys to talk with a judge about security concerns in a death-penalty case. 
He would not say whether there have been threats on Thornton's life. His trial 
is scheduled for Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that there are concerns about security is not unusual in 
high-profile, special-circumstances cases," he argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher's co-counsel, Deputy Public Defender Susan R. Olson, said part of the 
security debate centers around the heightened publicity the case has attracted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never go to court with (fewer) than four reporters there watching our 
every move, hanging on to our every word," said Olson. She said Thornton plans 
to file a motion for change of venue, which could result in the case being 
moved to another county. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; APPROVAL EXPECTED FOR NEW CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new contract that would save the Simi Valley Police Department more than 
$30,000 in service fees for the department's radios and other communication 
systems is expected to be approved Monday by the Simi Valley City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The city staff is recommending that the contract be awarded to Motorola, which 
underbid 17 other companies with an offer to do the service for about $125,000 
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris Communications, which has held the contract since 1988, said it was 
unable to compete with Motorola's bid.  
</P>
<P>
 As part of the contract, Motorola would respond to all emergency repairs 
within two hours, or risk losing the contract.  
</P>
<P>
 If the City Council approves the contract, the $30,000 in savings will be 
returned to the city's general fund. The contract will run from April 1, 1994, 
through March 31, 1996. SCOTT HADLY

VALLEY FEVER UNLEASHED ON 22 EAST COUNTY CANINES; HEALTH: THE DUST-BORNE VIRUS 
WAS SPREAD BY THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE, MEDICAL OFFICIALS BELIEVE. THERE'S NO 
MEDICARE FOR PETS, OWNERS LAMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 A month ago, Wolfie started acting strange. The 3-year-old dog developed a 
persistent, hacking cough and stopped eating. When her Simi Valley family took 
her to a nearby clinic, a veterinarian determined that the petite brown-haired 
shepherd mix had valley fever. 
</P>
<P>
 The outbreak of valley fever in the eastern part of Ventura County hasn't been 
restricted to the human population. At least 22 dogs have been infected by the 
respiratory illness since January and vets across the county are keeping a wary 
eye out for additional cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of this point, there were 16 lab-confirmed cases in dogs in the Simi 
Valley area and six in the Thousand Oaks area, and these numbers can always 
change," said Dr. Richard Spiegel, a veterinarian for the Atlanta-based Centers 
for Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel recently spent two weeks in Ventura County studying cases of valley 
fever in dogs and humans to determine what has caused the surge in infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, at least 170 people have contracted 
the illness. A Simi Valley man died from valley fever in early March. Medical 
experts speculate that the quake may have kicked up dust carrying the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical authorities have noted that the illness occasionally crops up in such 
creatures as cats, cattle, sheep, pigs and horses. But dogs are more 
susceptible, Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley veterinarian Dr. John Anderson, a former CDC physician who 
specializes in fungal illnesses, said dogs are especially at risk because they 
always have their noses in the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have found that the hunting dog, the sniffing dog, is more prone," Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was to Anderson's Simi Valley office that Ruth Morrill brought her dog, 
Wolfie, for treatment last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was real listless and having trouble breathing," Morrill said. "I thought 
she might have some sort of flu." 
</P>
<P>
 A blood test determined that the dog had valley fever, which surprised 
Wolfie's owner. "I though they were joking," Morrill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfie's symptoms were typical of a valley fever-infected canine: a dry, 
hacking cough, fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, veterinarians had diagnosed few dogs as having valley fever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here since 1984, I've seen probably four total," said Dr. Karen 
Martin, a veterinarian at the Conejo Valley Veterinary Clinic. The clinic has 
treated three dogs with valley fever since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Steve Watase, a veterinarian the Anza Animal Clinic in Westlake, is 
treating a dog that was infected with valley fever about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here in Westlake for a year, Ventura for three years, Agoura a year 
before that and that's the first case I've seen," Watase said. But until now, 
he said, vets in Ventura County typically don't look for valley fever in dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin expects to see such cases increase in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, we are looking more for it," she said. "When you see pneumonia, 
the first thing you think of is running a fungal screen." 
</P>
<P>
 Public-health officials are concerned that the heightened medical attention to 
the disease will drive up the number of reported cases and create unnecessary 
public concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to have a higher number of cases, but what does it mean? Nobody 
knows," said Dr. Shirley Fannin, director of the Los Angeles County Health 
Department. "It's their general impression, it's their gut feeling and they may 
be right, but they don't have any basis for saying so." 
</P>
<P>
 Fannin said the increase in valley fever cases has more to do with an increase 
in testing than an epidemic created by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You stir up the community so everybody who has had a cough in the last two 
months goes out and gets tested," she said. Humans and dogs can have valley 
fever and not know it because symptoms don't always develop, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anderson said there's no harm in being tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfie's owners are relieved that their dog was diagnosed before the illness 
could mature. Antibiotics and the expensive drug used to treat valley fever 
have eased Wolfie's discomfort, Morrill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's almost back to normal now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most uncomfortable aspects of the illness is the cost of treatment 
for pet owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the biggest problem is dogs don't have Medicare and it's very 
expensive to treat," Watase said. A blood test, which is the only way to 
determine if a dog has valley fever, runs between $35 and $70, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most expensive aspect of treatment is medication, Anderson said. 
Ketoconazole, an anti-fungal drug used to treat a wide spectrum of human 
illnesses, is prescribed to treat dogs with the virus. Individual pills cost 
about $4, and the prescribed treatment is usually two pills a day, Anderson 
said, depending on the dog's weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real shock to find it was $95 for 30 pills," Morrill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said treatment for an infected dog could run from six months to a 
year.

REAGAN PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY CONSIDERS BOOKING WEDDINGS; SIMI VALLEY: SIMILAR 
FACILITIES HAVE HOSTED SUCH CEREMONIES. BUT A BUSINESSWOMAN IS WORRIED ABOUT 
THE POSSIBLE IMPACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Banquet manager Mon-li at the Calamigos Ranch near Agoura Hills isn't pleased 
at the prospect that she may have some new competition soon when it comes to 
booking weddings and receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 What upsets her is the idea that the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library may be 
luring away brides, grooms and the income they bring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be happy," said Mon-li, whose 120-acre ranch has been a popular spot 
for Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks weddings for 10 years. "When the government 
starts competing with the private sector, it's tough." 
</P>
<P>
 The library is owned by the Ronald Reagan Foundation and leased to the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 For Calamigos, which stages everything from country-Western to 
Victorian-themed nuptials, weddings are big business. From May to October, it 
books as many as four weddings a day on the weekends. A reception with 200 
guests at Calamigos Ranch costs at least $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Reagan library officials saying there is a possibility that they may 
allow weddings, business conferences and parties, Mon-li and other potential 
competitors could lose some of those bookings. 
</P>
<P>
 Library spokeswoman Stephanie Salata said the library is only considering the 
possibility of booking weddings. "I'm interested," Salata said. "But I'm not 
actively pursuing it. . . .It's more like brainstorming at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Library Director Richard Norton Smith agreed. "It would be a mistake to say 
we're huddling here planning weddings," he said. "But we're thinking about 
weddings as part of our general plan to reach out to the community. It's just 
one of a number of possible ideas that have been floated internally." 
</P>
<P>
 Salata said requests from the public would speed up the decision-making 
process. No rates have been established, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Fawcett, assistant archivist for the presidential libraries at the 
National Archives, said weddings and funerals have occasionally been held at 
other libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, which is privately 
run and operates separately from the National Archives, weddings help cover 
operating costs. A weekend wedding at the facility starts at $1,500, with a 
$2.95 surcharge per guest.  
</P>
<P>
 The Nixon birthplace has been the site of more than 100 weddings in the past 
two years, said Dhari Balvin, coordinator for special events. Republicans and 
Democrats alike flock to the gardens and outdoor amphitheater to exchange vows 
just yards from the white farmhouse where the 37th President was born. 
</P>
<P>
 The gazebo where Tricia Nixon was married is on loan from the White House as 
an exhibit. No ceremonies are allowed in it, only in front. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Reagan library, there is no gazebo, only a 6,000-pound chunk of the 
Berlin Wall, adorned with a butterfly and the word FREE in spray paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that a couple approve of the wall as a backdrop, steady winds tugging 
at bridal veils could be a drawback. Another drawback, one critic said, might 
be the library's novice status in the complicated world of floral arrangements, 
12-foot trains, vows and wedding toasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably have a lot more experience," said wedding coordinator Victoria 
Binetti of the Calabasas Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 There aren't many places that specialize in weddings in Simi Valley. The park 
department offers informal facilities for weddings and receptions in several 
parks, while two hotels, the Radisson and the Clarion, book most of the more 
formal receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've pretty much got a captive audience now," said Deena Hildebrand, the 
Radisson's wedding coordinator. "More competition is fine. Competition is 
healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hildebrand, however, said federal regulations place restrictions on alcohol 
service on library premises, prohibiting cash bars. As a result, she said, "I 
can't see them really hurting me at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Some merchants said they didn't see the library, despite its attractive 
hillside setting, as competing directly with them. Bonnie Didomenico, the 
banquet manager at Charley Brown's restaurant in Thousand Oaks, said she 
thought the library would cater to those with more expensive tastes than her 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it would take away from the hotels' business," she said. "I don't think 
it would hurt mine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Moorpark, the Tierra Rejada Ranch is about to launch into the wedding and 
reception business, renting out a creek-side setting in one of its walnut 
groves. Owner Rick Brecunier said he expected his farm setting to appeal to 
couples who want something less formal than the presidential library. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are what we are, not a big fancy place," he said. "We're not trying to be 
anything more than a nice informal setting." 
</P>
<P>
 Several visitors to the library from Wyoming stopped while strolling on its 
rose-tinted stone patio last week to consider its possibilities as a wedding 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fine view," Harold Hunt said. "But it looks to me like that should be 
Ronald's decision to make." 
</P>
<P>
 His grandson, Barry Hunt, liked the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seems like the right thing for a good young Republican to do," he said.

IT'S NOT A WORK OF ART AS DUCKS LOSE TO BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Elbow grease has gotten the Mighty Ducks places they don't belong this season. 
</P>
<P>
 They have won 27 games and stayed in a playoff race with hard work and 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 But take away the work ethic and they're not much. So, Coach Ron Wilson ripped 
into his team for not competing Thursday after they gave up five goals in 11 
minutes during a second-period collapse in a 5-3 loss to the Boston Bruins at 
Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some guys who were just (awful) tonight. Plain and simple, that's 
probably why we have them," Wilson said. "I don't know, maybe the paint has 
come off the spots and the real leopard spots are starting to show." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss, coupled with San Jose's victory over Toronto, leaves the Ducks eight 
points behind the Sharks for the final Western Conference playoff spot with 10 
games left. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to play harder than that, especially at this point in the season. 
This is crunch time," Wilson said. "We just didn't want to compete. When that 
happens you're going to get run right out of the building, and that's what 
happened tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks led, 1-0, after the first on a goal by Stephan Lebeau -- probably 
the Ducks' only standout all night. He certainly isn't with the Montreal 
Canadiens anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Wesley scored the first of his two goals for Boston at 3:15 of the 
second, but the Ducks regained the lead on Terry Yake's 21st goal at 5:46. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine seconds later, Adam Oates got the second of his four assists when 
he found Ted Donato with a pass all the way across the neutral zone and a 
confused cluster of Ducks, who watched Donato tie the score, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two minutes later, Glen Murray scored by knocking in a puck that was 
drifting through the slot and Boston led, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson called a rare timeout, and tried to get the players back in the game 
with a speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't respond at all," he said, as the Bruins scored two more times by 
the 13:55 mark. "We weren't competing. We were just standing around. We were 
awestruck by the big bad Bruins. They weren't that big, and I don't think 
they're that bad. So we got intimidated by their tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't compete and didn't work hard, and normally that's a given for 
our team." 
</P>
<P>
 All this against a Bruin team playing without Cam Neely and Ray Bourque 
because of injuries, a team that had a seven-game winless streak, its longest 
in seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just started making one mistake after the other and we seemed to give up 
easily," Wilson said. "We just buckled under the pressure of the Bruins. I 
don't know what you can say, I'm just disappointed in the effort of a lot of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 The players had no illusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not blaming the forwards, I'm not blaming the defense. This is a 
collective loss. Everybody didn't play well tonight," said defenseman Bobby 
Dollas, who was on the ice for only one goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether we make the playoffs or don't make the playoffs, that's irrelevant to 
how we want to finish the year. We can't wait for teams to keep beating San 
Jose or beating L.A. It's eight points now. You have to come mentally and 
physically prepared. Sometimes you have to take an elbow to the head, take a 
hit. Tonight there was an overwhelming lack of effort, for probably the first 
time this year."

OWN UP, JERRY: YOU'RE THE LOSER IN COWBOYS' FAMILY FEUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILBON, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Switzer? Some guys never learn, do they? Has there been an owner in pro 
sports since George Steinbrenner who is so successful, yet so bent on 
self-destruction as the Cowboys' Jerry Jones? Six months ago it was his 
treatment of Emmitt Smith; now it's Jimmy Johnson. They are only the two most 
important members of the two-time Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones thinks he's The Man, the only man. If Smith isn't signed, just waltz 
in some guy named Derrick Lassic and give him the ball. A running back is a 
running back, right? Tired of Jimmy? Bring in Switzer, a man who hasn't coached 
anywhere in a few years and wasn't particularly good as a college coach his 
last couple of seasons. My favorite line so far comes from Cowboys defensive 
back Kevin Smith who said, "What are we going to do, run the wishbone next 
year?" Maybe Troy Aikman will transfer to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 You can go one of two ways on this latest Jimmy-Jerry feud. In Scenario A, 
this is just another case of a rich fat cat getting bored and needing to be in 
the paper during the offseason. This wouldn't be the first time an owner got a 
little loose in the bar during the NFL winter meetings and said a thing or two 
he regretted 12 hours later. And it's not the first time Jerry and Jimmy have 
been fed up with each other and it won't be the last. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Scenario B, Johnson gets just what he wants, which is to stay out of 
Dodge. He's been dropping hints since the end of the season that he'd rather be 
in Florida, with the new expansion franchise in Jacksonville -- near his boat 
and away from Jones. If Johnson gets fired in the offseason, Jones would have 
to honor the 10-year contract he and Johnson agreed to in 1989. Not only would 
Jones have to pay Johnson's salary, but Johnson would be free to look 
elsewhere, anywhere, for a gig. 
</P>
<P>
 You know how long Jimmy Johnson, the best coach in the NFL, would be 
unemployed? One second. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, without a whole lot of logical explanation, Jerry Jones went from 
making a toast at the league meeting in Florida, to roasting Johnson. It didn't 
take long for people to start comparing Jones-Johnson to Steinbrenner-Billy 
Martin. This, in fact, may even be the way Jerry Jones sees it. 
</P>
<P>
 Two problems: Jones isn't enough of a bully to be Steinbrenner, and Johnson, 
while Martin's equal if not superior as a leader of men, isn't the insecure and 
troubled man Martin was. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who saw Jones back down (and wisely so) during the Emmitt Smith 
negotiations last fall knows Jones is mostly a blowhard. And Johnson, a man who 
once said his wife "knows she's number two" -- with football being No. 1 -- 
obviously isn't intimidated by contracts of any kind. Jimmy Johnson is and 
always has been a mercenary, a coach for hire. But if you let him do his thing, 
you'll be wearing a championship ring before you know it. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his head got so big, Jones himself said Johnson was worth five Heisman 
Trophy winners and five No. 1 draft choices. Now, after two Super Bowl 
victories, Jones wants us to believe Johnson's value has dropped below that of 
Switzer, an unemployed man who used to coach the wishbone, a man who watched 
Aikman take his talents to UCLA rather than change his conservative system at 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst thing that can happen to a team is that an owner starts thinking 
he's more important to the success of a franchise than the best players and the 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Michael Jordan retired from the Chicago Bulls, the owner and GM 
were telling people they welcomed the challenge of trying to win a championship 
without him. This is why Jack Kent Cooke and San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie 
DeBartolo have stayed near the top of the NFL for so long. They asked tough 
questions, they meddled up to a point, they opened their wallets when needed, 
then they got out of the way and let the people they'd hired go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, on one hand, wants to be respected like Cooke and Eddie D., but his 
never-ending quest to be in the papers and on camera make him look more like 
Tom Benson, the Saints owner who boogies on the sideline when his team wins a 
home game. Jones, with each passing episode, is reminiscent of Al Haig, a man 
who keeps telling everybody he's in charge, perhaps because he needs to 
convince himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But we know who's in charge. Jones is a great businessman, period. Even the 
agents who have negotiated contracts against him say he's about the most savvy 
owner in the league. Owners enhance, they don't play or prepare players. That's 
what Emmitt Smith and Jimmy Johnson do better than anybody in the league right 
now. If you own a team, any team, and the coach or manager wins two consecutive 
championships, what more could you want? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Jerry Jones knows exactly what he's doing. A two-time champion could 
easily have trouble getting revved up for the next regular season, unless 
everybody in the locker room is united against the owner. But just as easily, 
Jones could be overplaying his hand. Johnson doesn't bleed Cowboy blue, he 
doesn't need to look at his chest and see pinstripes the way Martin did. He'd 
fit just as nicely as Don Shula's successor in Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium or 
anywhere else in the league for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Johnson has gone to his boat off the coast of Key Biscayne and Jones 
tries to control the damage. There wil be more toasts, more "off-the-record 
discussions." Johnson will tweak Jones, and Jones will fire back. With Tonya 
and Nancy gone, there's a lot of air time and news columns out there to be 
filled.

A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY FOR THE L.A. PHILHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROY TANABE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Tanabe is a violinist with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic traveling in Asia with the orchestra.

<P>
 "O-mi-age," a Japanese tradition that mandates the bearing of gifts on any 
visit.  
</P>
<P>
 When my father visited postwar Japan in the 1950s, he took bundles of used 
clothing as his formal o-mi-age from the family. Western classical music in 
Japan was a specialized commodity catering to the tastes of a fervent few. 
Veteran members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic recall that during their 1956 
tour the audiences here listened with rapt fascination and absolute silence. 
Japanese performers of that time (Michiko Sunahara, Nejiko Suwa, Yoichi 
Haraoka) were praised in their ability to copy the Western style. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965, I made the first of my continuing visits to Japan. My o-mi-age 
consisted of UCLA sweatshirts, Disneyland artifacts, Snoopy dolls, anything 
that hollered "American!" Legend has it that the British motion picture "The 
Red Shoes" was met with wild popularity here, and could have been the trigger 
for Japan's fascination with Western performance arts. I recall that the 
Philharmonic concerts were received with an almost voracious kind of 
enthusiasm, albeit arguably naive. 
</P>
<P>
 During one of these early tours in the late 1960s, the Philharmonic played a 
concert in Tokyo that began with a performance of Stravinksy's "Petrouchka." 
The applause was hesitant, self-conscious. Perhaps the audience was unfamiliar 
with the work and was puzzled by its tentative and quiet ending. Or perhaps the 
audience was merely following their own traditional protocol in reserving the 
ovation until after the final piece had been played. In any case, at the end of 
the concert the ovation finally occurred. And Zubin Mehta, somewhat 
condescendingly, turned to the audience and intoned a question that is to this 
day still quoted and re-quoted through the Philharmonic locker rooms: "Why you 
no like 'Petrouchka'?" 
</P>
<P>
 Today my suitcase is full of home-baked cookies. My mother and I can think of 
nothing I can bring as o-mi-age that cannot be easily found here. Similarly, 
the commodity that the Los Angeles Philharmonic is bringing (the music of 
Beethoven, Mozart, Sibelius, Bartok, Stravinsky, et al) represents nothing new 
or unfamiliar to the Japanese. Indeed, our performance of these works will be 
compared to concerts by the orchestras of New York, Philadelphia, Berlin, 
Vienna, etc., etc., all of whom have appeared here. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's own musical accomplishment is represented by such acknowledged and 
formidable voices as Midori, Mitsuko Uchida, the Tokyo String Quartet, et al. 
Relevant musical ideas are now originating here. 
</P>
<P>
 Our two-hour flight from Taipei into Osaka seems to have deposited us into 
another century. There is a palpable shift in travel attitude among the 
musicians. We are now confident enough to extend the radius of our food 
foraging quite far beyond the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences still listen with an almost frighteningly respectful silence -- that 
much has not changed in 30 years. I am challenged, sometimes intimidated, by 
their attentiveness. There is an absolute minimum of extraneous noise . . . 
must be those Japanese cough drops! And not a single composition played thus 
far has been violated by inappropriately timed applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Backstage, there is an aura of excited confidence. We are here because our 
ability has been defined as "world class"; our commodity has caught the 
curiosity and attention of a ticket-buying public not made up of our own 
community supporters, nor our friends, nor our relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The confidence to do this is not easily won. We have the advantage of 
Esa-Pekka Salonen's leadership. His musical choices and decisions are, and 
always will be, open to anyone's scrutiny. However, he presents his ideas to us 
with such intelligence, conviction and consistency that the orchestra willingly 
gives him complete musical autonomy. This unanimity of purpose defines the 
craft of what we do. 
</P>
<P>
 The clarity of his baton technique and the succinctness of his rehearsal 
strategy serve to help us know exactly when and how to play securely and 
without hesitation. He can undeniably be called "a friend of the player." And 
considering all of the variables we encounter under touring conditions, we can 
use all the friends we can get! 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes, inexplicably, once in a very rare while, something magical 
happens . . . a new level of excitement is reached . . . a different kind of 
discovery is made. This defines the art of what we do. The odds for this 
happening with Salonen seem to be in our favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, some 25 years later, we play "Petrouchka" again.

BATMAN SCALES THE MOUNTAIN; GOTHAM CITY AREA, ROLLER COASTER ARE LARGEST 
EXPANSION IN MAGIC MOUNTAIN'S 23-YEAR HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Six Flags Magic Mountain, Kevin Barbee has used his experience in urban 
design to construct a dark, decaying city. 
</P>
<P>
 The "city" Barbee designed is Gotham City Backlot, a Batman-themed area 
opening today that is highlighted by Batman the Ride, a suspended looping 
roller coaster. Owing more to the stark, futuristic aesthetic of the 1989 
"Batman" movie than the campy late-'60s television show, Gotham City is Magic 
Mountain's 10th themed area, a 6.2-acre set designed to immerse park guests in 
another reality.  
</P>
<P>
 So complete is the illusion that recently built structures have been carefully 
coated with spray-on urban grime, the juice stand has a "sci-fi, industrial 
look," and even the restrooms are tucked away in the Acme Atom Smasher Coolant 
Pump Facility, said Barbee. 
</P>
<P>
 Gotham City's pride and joy, as well as the inspiration for its creation, is 
the Batman ride. Riders sit four abreast on 32-seat cars that hang down from a 
steel track. With their legs waving free, passengers go through two loops -- on 
the outside . (This is the third Six Flags park to feature the coaster -- it 
opened in 1992 near Chicago and last year in New Jersey.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Seay, Magic Mountain's engineering manager who helped design the ride, 
compares the experience to taking a ride on a high-speed ski lift chair that 
spins upside-down. "It's startling to be on the outside of a loop," Seay said. 
"Your feet are just flying up in the air. You don't see the loop -- the track 
is above you." 
</P>
<P>
 The ride, co-developed by Six Flags and the Swiss firm Bolliger and Mabillard, 
is possible because of computer simulations and advanced technology. Seay, who 
worked for Hughes Aircraft before coming to Six Flags, calls it "the most 
technically sophisticated ride in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The ride itself lasts about two minutes, but the entire experience revolves 
around a story line set in motion as park visitors line up for their chance to 
brave the imposing steel coaster. The wait begins in Gotham City Park (donated, 
of course, by benevolent millionaire Bruce Wayne) where the sounds of chirping 
birds can be heard, then continues through the seedier side of Gotham, the 
Gotham Public Works Project. To "escape," guests must walk through a giant pipe 
and into the subterranean-looking "Batcave," where they board the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Once riders climb into the padded steel seats, the floor drops out, and their 
car begins the 10-story climb that will take it into the first loop. The 
coaster, which travels at speeds of up to 50 m.p.h. and reaches up to four 
times the force of gravity, or Gs, takes its passengers through two corkscrew 
turns and a 360-degree "heartline spin" that makes riders feel weightless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went so fast we had to go on three or four times just to remember it," 
said John Summy, a 27-year-old salesman who rode the coaster at Six Flags Great 
America in Illinois last year. "The thing that was neat about it was that your 
feet weren't hooked in." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who enjoy having a floor beneath their feet, two previously existing 
rides were refurbished and redecorated to fit the Gotham City theme. The ACME 
Atom Smasher sends its passengers around a circular sloping track at high 
speed, and Gordon Gearworks spins so quickly that riders are held to the wall 
by centrifugal force when it tilts. The Gearworks, Barbee said, is painted to 
look like "a bad office that has had cigar smokers in it forever."  
</P>
<P>
 Gotham City is the largest project in the park's 23-year history, and Tim 
O'Brien, an editor at Amusement Business magazine, estimates that the coaster 
alone cost at least $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbee has designed Gotham's food stands, Joker Juices, Butler's Pantry and 
Gotham Pizza Factory, and used a neon sign to give the Axis Department Store a 
futuristic Art Deco look. A replica of the Batmobile used in the 1989 movie 
also will be on display. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movie presents such a dark picture of a once-elegant and beautiful city 
that's been overrun by greed and industry," Barbee said, "we focused on the 
grimy, unkempt look." 
</P>
<P>
 Gotham City was previously the Hollywood Backlot area, but Barbee, 31, who has 
been at Magic Mountain for just over a year, had the idea of redesigning it to 
extend the Batman theme, which is available to Six Flags because both the 
character and the theme park are owned by Time Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a competitive market," Barbee said. "Batman is a popular Warner 
Bros. product that helps the synergy between our companies. But I also just 
thought it (Gotham City Backlot) would be darned neat." 
</P>
<P>
 * Magic Mountain, Valencia. Opens at 10 a.m. daily. Closing hours vary. $28 
for general admission, $18 for seniors, $15 for children under 48 inches tall. 
Free for children 2 and younger. Parking is $5. (818) 367-5965.

POP BEAT: COMING TOGETHER -- SORT OF; A 'NEW' BEATLES SINGLE, 'FREE AS A BIRD,' 
GREW OUT OF A TAPE JOHN LENNON RECORDED IN 1977 AT HOME IN NEW YORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ever since word leaked out that a "new" Beatles song -- an unreleased John 
Lennon home recording completed by the three remaining Beatles -- was in the 
works, fans have been trying to imagine what the song sounds like and whether 
it might lead to an entire album. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to what the song sounds like has been substantially answered by a 
source who has heard a version of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of whether recent recording sessions by Paul McCartney, George 
Harrison and Ringo Starr (working with original Beatles producer George Martin) 
will lead to a full album remains open, but it looks doubtful. There are no 
immediate indications that the three Beatles plan to reconvene for more 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The new song, recorded in February in England, is titled "Free as a Bird," 
according to William P. King, publisher of Beatlefan, an Atlanta-based magazine 
long relied upon by fans of the group for accurate information. 
</P>
<P>
 Recorded at McCartney's and Harrison's home studios, the song is reportedly a 
plaintive ballad celebrating the joys of home life. It features dual vocals by 
Lennon and McCartney, says King, as well as a new verse written and sung by 
McCartney, a guitar solo by Harrison and elaborate production scored by Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 According to information provided by producers of the long-running syndicated 
Westwood One radio series "The Lost Lennon Tapes," "Free as a Bird" was 
recorded by Lennon at home in New York in October, 1977. It was one of several 
unfinished tunes by the late Beatle apparently earmarked for use in a 
never-realized Lennon-Ono autobiographical Broadway show titled "The Ballad of 
John and Yoko." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent McCartney, Harrison and Starr recording sessions were originally 
meant only to produce incidental music for the upcoming, 10-part "Beatles 
Anthology" documentary video series being produced by the remaining Beatles and 
their company, Apple Corps Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 The series will first be aired on television in 60-minute segments beginning 
in late '94 or early '95, then offered for sale with each part expanded to 90 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the surviving Beatles reportedly asked Ono to supply them with tapes of 
unreleased songs composed and recorded by Lennon, for the purpose of finishing 
at least one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ono happily complied. "She knew there is a lot of public interest in a 
reunion," said Ono spokesman Michael Phillips. "A lot of people probably 
thought she'd be first to object. She just felt like well, she shouldn't be the 
one to say no . . . and thought it ought to be given a chance. And it was good 
karma." 
</P>
<P>
 Ono handed tapes of four partially completed songs to McCartney at her home in 
New York in January, after the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame dinner at which 
Lennon was posthumously honored. The remaining Beatles are said to have "worked 
on" all of the songs before settling on the one. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent sessions also yielded two instrumental tracks, both of which are 
expected to be used as incidental music for the video series, which consists 
largely of never-seen footage from the Beatles' own collection. 
</P>
<P>
 The anthology will be accompanied by the release of four to six CDs of mostly 
unreleased Beatles music -- BBC recordings, alternate versions of released 
songs, studio outtakes and recordings from the Beatles' private collection. 
"Free as a Bird" will be released to coincide with part one of "The Beatles 
Anthology," with a video that Harrison reportedly suggested Ono direct. 
</P>
<P>
 One home demo of the song, aired on "The Lost Lennon Tapes" several years ago 
and subsequently bootlegged, provides an idea of what "Free" might sound like. 
The demo begins with a simple, poignant piano introduction. It has a sweet, 
arching melody with chords somewhat reminiscent of Lennon's 1970 song "Love." 
</P>
<P>
 The phrasing and melodic twists of the vocal, however, are rather unlike any 
other Lennon composition. A sample of Lennon's incomplete lyrics: "Free as a 
bird / It's the next best thing to being / Free as a bird / Home, home and dry 
/ Like a homing bird, I'll fly / A bird on the wing . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 For the new sessions, Lennon's voice was reportedly heavily processed and 
enhanced by producer Martin to bring it up to studio quality, and McCartney 
added vocal harmonies to it throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 How will the song be released? Most likely, King says, on the Beatles' old 
Apple label, either as a single or as part of the new CDs. And what name will 
the electronically reunited group use? 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think, seeing that all four of them are on it, that they would use 
the Beatles," said King.

 Calling All Cans: Are you going to the Can Film Festival? No, that's not a 
typo. This is not the famed Cannes in the south of France. This festival is the 
one going on now at many of the AMC Theaters in the Los Angeles area. The 
concept is simple: In exchange for a can of food, you will receive a coupon 
good for one small popcorn. The festival benefits the Los Angeles Regional 
Foodbank and reinforces the recycling "CANpaign" being conducted by the Steel 
Recycling Institute this month. The festival continues through Sunday night at 
all 13 AMC locations in Los Angeles County, plus Fullerton and Main Place 
Theaters in Orange County and the Chino Town theaters in San Bernardino County.

 The Hills Are Alive . . . : Julie Andrews is putting the final touches on a 
new album of the best-loved Broadway hits by Richard Rodgers, including songs 
from Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II's "The Sound of Music." The film version 
of the stage musical, released 29 years ago this month, starred Andrews and won 
five Oscars, including best picture. The Phillips Classics recording will be 
released in September and features the title song to "The Sound of Music" as 
well as her first solo recording of that show's "Edelweiss."

 * One More for the Road: Frank Sinatra forgot some of the words but he showed 
his son who's boss in his first concert since he collapsed on a Richmond, Va., 
stage March 6. Sinatra, 78, appeared in good shape during an hourlong concert 
Thursday in Kansas City, but missed several lines to "New York, New York" and 
stumbled his way through "The Lady Is a Tramp" despite help from four large 
electronic prompters. The Chairman of the Board bantered with Frank Sinatra 
Jr., who directed his orchestra. "His mother said get him a job, get him out of 
the house," Sinatra wisecracked.

 * Move Over, Magic: Sunday's L.A. Lakers' game at the Forum will not only be 
notable for being the once-retired Magic Johnson's first as coach. Singer 
Melissa Etheridge's young nephew Josh Etheridge will be the game's honorary 
ballboy on Sunday when the Lakers play Milwaukee. Etheridge, who'll attend the

 Plaza to Lose Leader: Gema Sandoval, executive director of Plaza de la Raza in 
Los Angeles, will resign from her post effective July 1. Sandoval, who has 
headed the 20-year-old Latino cultural center for six years, said she is 
leaving to devote herself full time to her dance troupe, Danza Floricano, which 
performs folk dances of Mexico. Sandoval will leave the center during a period 
of turmoil, as its seven-member staff is negotiating to unionize. "People are 
worried about their jobs, but in a nonprofit organization, nobody's safe," 
Sandoval said. ART

 MOCA, San Diego, Gets Gift: The Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, has 
received a major new gift: 10 works by modern American master Joseph Cornell. 
Included are four boxes and six framed collages from the late 1940s through 
mid-'50s. The museum, which plans to display the works in the inaugural 
exhibition of its new La Jolla flagship location in 1996, is one of six 
American institutions to receive Cornell works from the Joseph and Robert 
Cornell Memorial Foundation. The other institutions are the Albright-Knox Art 
Gallery in Buffalo, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the Seattle Art 
Museum, the New Orleans Museum of Art and Atlanta's High Museum of Art.

 * Landseer Record: A private collector paid $1.2 million Friday for a painting 
by Sir Edwin Landseer, a new record for the Victorian artist, Christie's 
auctioneers in London said. The painting, "Scene in Braemar -- Highland Deer," 
was sold by the estate of Lord Moyne. Christie's said it was not known when the 
painting was done by Landseer, who lived from 1802 to 1873. The previous record 
for a Landseer was established in October, 1989, in New York when an American 
collector paid $577,500 at auction for "Neptune." SHORT TAKES

RICK DU BROW: TV THE GREAT COMMUNICATOR FOR A SKILLFUL PRESIDENT; CLINTON USES 
THE MEDIUM MORE DETERMINEDLY THAN MOST OF HIS PREDECESSORS. BUT HE COULD GET 
TOO MUCH VISIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Clinton, at 47 the nation's first TV-generation President, has used the 
home medium more determinedly and relentlessly than most of his predecessors in 
the electronic era. 
</P>
<P>
 Late this week, as the Whitewater case remained unresolved and the polls 
showed his job-approval rating declining, he held a televised evening news 
conference. Whatever the outcome of the case, the Thursday news gathering, 
which naturally was dominated by Whitewater questions, displayed his TV skills 
as he remained unflappable, even drawing several laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether his TV gifts benefit him in more than a public-relations sense in the 
Whitewater affair remains to be seen. Still, television is a major weapon in 
his personal campaign to retain public confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 In a different setting, Clinton also turned up in an interview Tuesday and 
Wednesday on television's top-rated evening news broadcast, ABC's "World News 
Tonight," in a lengthy, two-part piece focusing on his religious and spiritual 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC News spokesman Arnot Walker said that the interview, conducted by the 
network's religion correspondent, Peggy Wehmeyer, was suggested by anchor and 
senior editor Peter Jennings and conducted March 2 at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, the Tuesday newscast began with a story about the latest 
Whitewater developments. The Clinton interview ran toward the end. During the 
piece, which included pro and con opinions by evangelicals, centering on such 
matters as his views on abortion and gay rights, the President said: "Only God 
knows the truth of a person's heart." 
</P>
<P>
 After little more than a year as President, Clinton appears as comfortable on 
the home screen as he was during the election campaign, in which it was such a 
vital tool for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my guess," says Jack Hilton, a veteran TV consultant based in New York, 
"that he would be less popular in the polls if he wasn't so good on 
television." He ranked Clinton as "our third television President" behind John 
F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, "which isn't to say that I agree with him 
politically." 
</P>
<P>
 "If he has a weakness as a (TV) President," says Stuart Spencer, who advises 
Republicans and is headquartered in Orange County, "it's because he doesn't 
focus on a few things. He talks about the whole thing at once, all the 
ramifications of government -- foreign trade, Bosnia, deficits. He's putting 
all kinds of issues on the table all the time. People can't handle all of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, adds Spencer, "In certain formats, he's outstanding. He changed 
American politics to a degree by the way he campaigned -- Larry King, the 
forum, the panel, Donahue, all the things where questions are asked and they're 
not structured television appearances. That's where most people said they got 
their information from. Maybe I don't like him, but he handles those media very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has a tendency in speeches to run on too long. And Spencer doesn't 
think he's very good with "a speech and a TelePrompTer." 
</P>
<P>
 But Jody Powell, onetime press secretary to former President Jimmy Carter and 
now in public relations in Washington, where he says he has periodic contact 
with the White House, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in Powell's view, "is able to handle a text with a degree of 
personality that makes you forget that he's coming off a text. From what I 
hear, he moves in and out of the text, which is a tricky thing to do, to sort 
of ad-lib through a text." 
</P>
<P>
 In a phone interview last week, Powell said that what Clinton hasn't done "is 
come across as frustrated and down and not know which way to turn, because 
people don't want to see a President looking like he doesn't know what to do 
next. He's always had that sort of sense of a fellow that's an optimist. That 
was a strength for Reagan too." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Clinton's Thursday news conference, Jennings, anchoring the event for 
ABC, noted the President's slip in the polls. Clearly, it was an important TV 
outing for Clinton, who knew that Whitewater would be the focal point and that, 
while it might not influence the outcome of the case, was a key moment in his 
relationship with the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton and Spencer, also interviewed by phone last week, spoke of the 
President's chief weapons on TV. Said Hilton: "He is a first-class retail 
politician (and) salesman. The word for it in Hollywood is performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Spencer: "Stylistically, he's good. No matter what the question, he 
doesn't seem to get antagonistic about it, which is comfortable for people who 
are watching." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton recently showed a flash of anger in a speech excerpt that was shown 
widely on television, repeating the words "No, no, no, no, no." But he was on 
his best behavior at Thursday's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 A key question, according to Hilton and Spencer, is whether Clinton will wear 
well over the long run with his heavy exposure on TV that began with the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a short attention span and get tired of our stars in a hurry," says 
Hilton. "It's whether he has the legs for us to accept him with this frequency 
before we collectively say, 'Enough already.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to be careful with that," says Spencer. "He's got to have something 
to say or they're going to start tuning him out. The first year is the 
honeymoon year, but the second and third get tougher. The amount of exposure 
he's been getting, he could get overexposed. He should structure it so there's 
down time and not talk every time he sees a camera. They should pick their 
spots a little more." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the President's use of the major networks, Hilton thinks that Clinton 
has an affinity for alternative media because "the old-line press is probably 
more aggressive and astute. He has more of an opportunity on some of the 
alternative media to wax eloquently and set the agenda."

UNIVERSAL'S JURASSIC PARK TOUR FEATURES CREATURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At Universal Studios Hollywood, the movie lot tour is celebrating its 30th 
anniversary with Jurassic Park -- Behind the Scenes, an extensive peek at the 
making of the box-office hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Spielberg has donated his private collection of notes, models and 
visual gadgetry for the exhibit, which runs through May and serves as a 
precursor for yet another film-based attraction, a Flintstones stage show that 
opens in June. 
</P>
<P>
 As an opening act, Jurassic Park packs enough to entertain even industry-savvy 
locals. Housed in Soundstage 29, where much of the movie was filmed, it begins 
with the towering park gate. Smoky air and a rumbling score re-create the feel 
of the movie, while overhead lighting grids remind guests that this is a chance 
to look beyond the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked with Spielberg as far as which tricks he wanted to reveal," said 
Don Burgess, who produced the attraction. "Steven loaned us just about 
everything in his warehouse." 
</P>
<P>
 That includes storyboards and continuation scripts, the blueprints of 
filmmaking. Video monitors show everything from selected scenes -- with 
commentary -- to a discussion between the director and "Jurassic Park" author 
Michael Crichton. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more impressive are the creatures themselves. A full-size velociraptor 
stands overhead. A brachiosaur pokes its immense head through a wall of brush. 
A triceratops lies on its side, breathing slowly. Later we learn that Buster, a 
pet dog, provided the breathing for the film's soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a wardrobe display and a section on computer animation. In the 
control room, guests sit at interactive computer panels and pretend to check 
the dinosaur park's perimeter fences and weather forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to get a feel for this," Burgess said, "to understand how 
movies are made." 
</P>
<P>
 * Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal City Plaza, Universal City. Open 9 
a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. $29.95 for general admission, $23.95 for seniors and

NEW PROJECTS AT DISNEYLAND, KNOTT'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Six Flags Magic Mountain and Universal Studios Hollywood battle it out this 
spring with their new attractions, Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm also have 
new projects: 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's Berry Farm: On Memorial Day weekend, the Buena Park attraction plans 
to open Thunder Falls. The area will be highlighted by Mystery Lodge, a 
special-effects attraction that will tell a story based on the traditions of 
the Native American peoples of the Northwest Pacific Coast.Thunder Falls, which 
represents Knott's Berry Farm's largest expansion since 1988, will also include 
a plaza with street entertainment and a museum store that will sell authentic 
Native American crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland: The Anaheim park added Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin to the 
Mickey's Toontown area in January. A high-tech parade based on Disney's 
upcoming animated feature, "The Lion King," is expected to begin in July, and 
the theme park will introduce a thrill ride based on the Indiana Jones films 
early next year.

GARDENING; PLANTING FLOWERS ALREADY IN BLOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buying flowers already in bloom can be an expensive way to achieve quick 
results in the garden. Even worse, sometimes it works well and sometimes it 
doesn't. But certain precautions simplify the problems and shave the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 First, make sure it's the proper time for what you're planting (cool-season or 
warm-season types). 
</P>
<P>
 Second, check that the plants will do well in your climate. Wholesale growers 
are mass production specialists, so consult a reference for suitability before 
selecting, particularly if you are new to a region. 
</P>
<P>
 While many annuals now are bred to withstand transplanting in bloom, they 
usually will flower faster if existing flowers are pinched off before 
transplanting. 
</P>
<P>
 So look for compact, healthy plants that are just starting to show bud color. 
That way you can be sure the label's color description is reasonably close, and 
you avoid much of the transplant shock. 
</P>
<P>
 Look also for well-proportioned, uniform plants with stocky stems. Avoid those 
that are leggy or limp. Leaves should have a rich, green color. If the foliage 
is mottled or leaf edges curled, pests are likely to be present. 
</P>
<P>
 If lower leaves are yellow, it could be because the soil mix became too dry. 
In that case, the root system may be damaged and the plants may never flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure, too, that the retail nursery's staff is familiar with the care of 
seedlings. Seeing them watering wilted plants is a good tip to go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 It's usually not a good idea to buy plants kept in a sunny location, either. 
The amount of soil mix in small packs can heat up tremendously, damaging the 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
 To cut costs, watch for sales. Many garden centers offer weekly specials. 
Perhaps what you want will be discounted a week or two later. Be sure to follow 
selection guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeds, of course, are the most economical way to start flowers. They also 
provide the most possible choices. However, some degree of skill is needed. It 
also takes time, often many weeks. There is no instant gratification. 
</P>
<P>
 The same difficulties apply to cuttings. 
</P>
<P>
 So for the average home gardener, the nursery or garden center six-pack has 
become the most common route to floral displays, even with the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Some flowers are easier to care for than others because they don't require 
removal of fading blooms to stimulate new ones (dead-heading) and they don't 
need pruning to avoid becoming spindly. 
</P>
<P>
 Many flowers are low-water users. Where possible, it makes sense to opt for 
those that don't require regular watering. Don't plan to grow shade-lovers in 
sun or sun-lovers in shade. Group them by cultural needs. Do they like moist 
soil or dry conditions? Do they prefer regular fertilization or refuse to bloom 
where soil is too rich in nitrogen? 
</P>
<P>
 For instant color, many experts recommend buying four-to-six-inch pots rather 
than the more common six-packs. 
</P>
<P>
 Such pots are considerably more expensive, of course. But the larger size 
provides a better root system to help them adapt when transplanted in bloom.

FASTEN YOUR STUFF NOW: IT'S IN FOR A BUMPY RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Stuff falls down in an earthquake. That fact has been underscored in quake 
after quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the injuries treated in emergency rooms immediately after the Loma 
Prieta quake in 1989 were caused when people were hit on the head by pictures, 
curios, books and other things that fell from their walls and shelves. The 
injuries that didn't come from blows came from cuts when people stepped on 
broken glass from picture frames, dishes and shattered windows. 
</P>
<P>
 With that knowledge, it only makes sense to be sure anything heavy and above 
eye level is either fastened down or moved to a lower place on the shelves or 
in the cabinets. Pictures can be secured to the walls by clamping the hanger to 
the wire strap on the back of the frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Contents of cabinets can be kept inside by securing the doors with hidden 
child-safe latches or more expensive ornamental hardware that latches. Tall 
furniture -- bookcases, curio cabinets, entertainment centers and china closets 
-- can be bolted to the wall studs. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid a mess of broken glass -- especially in bedrooms, where bare feet are 
likely to be the rule when the earth shakes at 4 a.m. -- remove the glass in 
picture frames. If you must have something covering the photos or artwork, use 
scratch-resistant plastic; it costs more than glass, but is much lighter and 
won't shatter and turn your floor into a minefield. 
</P>
<P>
 Large picture windows and sliding doors -- the most likely glass expanses to 
explode into dagger-edged shards in a big quake -- can be made safer by 
applying clear or tinted plastic film. The product, available in many home 
improvement stores and some drapery shops, was designed to provide a shield 
from heat and light but also works to hold the glass together when it breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferation of closet organizing systems makes it relatively easy to 
arrange bedroom and hall closets so that heavy items are at the lower levels 
and the upper shelving is reserved for lightweight things -- linens and towels, 
sweaters in boxes, sleeping bags, kids games and such. 
</P>
<P>
 Plastic storage bins can be used to help secure cleaning supplies, loose 
cosmetics, medicines and other items that come in bottles. This not only keeps 
them from banging together and breaking in a quake, it keeps your shelves 
neater all year long. JOHN O'DELL

 Formula decorating may lack originality, but it gets high marks for ease and 
good results. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to make a room look as if a designer did it, there's a simple 
formula," says decorator Trudy Dujardin. "It involves choosing several 
coordinating fabrics." 
</P>
<P>
 Three, to be exact. And fabric books at your local upholstery shop are chock 
full of mix-and-match swatches. 
</P>
<P>
 The main fabric, she says, the one you'll use the most of, can be a solid, a 
print or a stripe. Many people pick a floral. Use it on the largest piece of 
upholstery, usually a sofa. Repeat the fabric as a window treatment and in one 
other place, a skirted table or an easy chair, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 If your focus is a floral, make the second fabric a stripe or a small 
geometric print in a color that goes well with the floral. Suitable colors are 
those on the color wheel that are next to or opposite the main color of the 
floral. For example, next to yellow are orange and red. Opposite it are blues 
and greens. Either would work. Use this second fabric on another piece of 
upholstery or on all the throw pillows. 
</P>
<P>
 Now select the third fabric. If you have used patterned materials up to now, 
choose a solid. Use it for an ottoman or a table cover, or if you want, another 
couple of pillows. If your main color is a solid, reverse the order, choosing a 
stripe and a floral as the second and third fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to emphasize objects in the room -- art, collectibles and 
ornamental rugs, for example -- stick to solid fabrics. Consider a sofa 
slipcovered in blue, and use the same solid at the windows. Upholstery welting 
and window covering trim could be a strong contrast such as yellow, red or 
white. A third element can be either a solid or a stripe or small print 
combining the two colors. Use it for throw cushions, table cover or to cover an 
accent chair. 
</P>
<P>
 For a luxurious result, select a heavy fabric such as velvet, damask or a 
heavyweight cotton for sofa and chairs. Also use a substantial fabric at the 
windows, Dujardin says. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking ideas from wallpaper collections is another option open to decorating 
duffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sample wallpaper books often contain wall covering and fabric that are color 
and design coordinated. The books have photos and illustrations of schemes 
combining several patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The easiest thing for a beginner to do is to choose an appealing room 
illustrated in a wallpaper book and copy it," says Barbara Brower, marketing 
product manager at Seabrook Wallcoverings of Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 She says not to worry that the room will look like the book. It won't. "All 
the accessories will be different, and the room is different," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't want to copy exactly what you see, choose the patterns in a 
different color scheme, or choose slightly different patterns. Or use one or 
more of the elements in a different way, such as putting the border at 
chair-rail height rather than at the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wallpaper books are organized by color rather than by pattern. These are 
the simplest for novices to glean for decorating ideas. Not only will the 
patterns pictured in a room setting work well, but almost all the patterns in 
that particular color group will work together. 
</P>
<P>
 When books are organized by design, quite often you can mix designs so long as 
they are all in the same color family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Color can really tie almost all unrelated elements together, provided the 
designs aren't from radically different periods," Brower says. 
</P>
<P>
 Stripes and small prints are safe, working with almost any room and almost any 
furnishings. But it's more interesting to take a bold approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Choose something to be the star of the show," Brower says. "This doesn't have 
to occupy the largest amount of space. It can be a border." 
</P>
<P>
 Borders can be especially adventurous. They're a small portion of the wall and 
can be easily taped up temporarily to judge the effect. 
</P>
<P>
 A final caveat: Brower says if you use a wallpaper book as your source for 
ideas, go an additional step. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buy a single roll or obtain a large sample of the main wallpapers and 
consider ordering a yard of the coordinating fabric," she says. "Bring them 
home and put them up and observe them at different times of the day and get the 
opinions of the others in the family."

GARDENING; WILDLIFE WILL MIGRATE TO A CLEAN, PROTECTED BACK-YARD WATERING HOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Build a back-yard water hole and you might see a screech owl bathing at 
midnight, baby robins taking their first baths and perhaps as many as 100 kinds 
of songbirds drinking and bathing regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do such ponds bring excitement to your back-yard, but they also can 
add to the value of your property. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the basics for a successful back-yard water hole are: 
</P>
<P>
 Moving water. It makes a sound that has a magnetic attraction for wildlife. By 
designing a pool with multiple tiers, so that water is pumped to the highest 
level and allowed to flow down, the pool will be attractive to wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Clean water. Pools and ponds tend to turn green or brown with algae, 
especially in warm weather. Design the pool with a drain so that the water can 
be easily changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Placement. Locate the pool close enough to the house, preferably near a 
window, so that it can be enjoyed from inside throughout the year. Don't worry 
about spooking the wild things -- they will adjust. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural cover. Like water, cover is essential to wildlife's survival. Plant 
the far side of your water hole with trees and shrubs that will give visitors 
an escape, should they be attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Aquatic plants and fish. A pool stocked with plants and fish becomes an 
aquatic community and will attract a wider range of wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Designs for wildlife water holes range from the simple to the sublime, and 
among them are the following favorites: 
</P>
<P>
 Birdbath. The simplest, least expensive and quickest to set up is the ceramic 
or plastic birdbath on a pedestal, available from lawn and garden centers. They 
may also sell a kind of "pool rock" that holds water. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do these birdbaths work, but they are attractive in a back-yard 
setting. Their disadvantage is the lack of water movement, requiring frequent 
water changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dripping bucket. By hanging a bucket with a hole in the bottom from a tree or 
post, and filling it several times a day with a hose, water can be dripped into 
a pot, a garbage-can lid or large bowl below that will be attractive to 
wildlife. A hose also can direct a stream or spray of water over rocks to form 
a pool. 
</P>
<P>
 In-ground pond. Any size, from many acres to a few square feet of water, can 
be made simply by digging a hole, lining it with polyethylene plastic and 
filling it with water. Attractive edgings, such as rocks, gravel and shrubs, 
will enhance the beauty of the pool, while aquatic plants will add color, 
beauty and natural cover for fish and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Above-ground pool. This is the most challenging of pond designs, but may also 
be the most attractive to both people and wildlife. Designed with mortar and 
stones, an above-ground pool may include spillways or cascades that send water 
to lower levels, where a pump forces it back to the top. Water pumps, available 
from lawn and garden centers, move water with an attractive sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement also aerates the water, making it more healthful for fish, plants 
and other wildlife.

HOME ELECTRONICS; CRACKING DOWN ON ILLEGALLY COPIED TAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How many illegal copies of videotapes do you have in your home? Come on now, 
'fess up. You're not alone. The average VCR-owning household is thought to have 
3.7. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the average number of illegal copies in 1991 was considerably higher 
-- 5.6 per household -- and the number seems to be continuing to decline. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is a system created by the Macrovision Corp. that thwarts attempts 
to duplicate prerecorded videos. A special pulse, encoded on about half of all 
movies on the video market, confuses the copying VCR and produces unstable and 
unwatchable dupes. 
</P>
<P>
 Macrovision estimates that its process has saved video stores more than $100 
million in sales and rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the system appears to be having the desired effect among casual 
copiers, professional pirates have had little trouble outsmarting it. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in many cases, they, too, are finding obstacles in their path. Around 
the country, officials are actively enforcing laws regarding illegal copies. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Kelleher is cracking 
down on video retailers who sell pirated tapes. He has ordered two L.A.-area 
video-store owners to sell their businesses to someone more reputable, or be 
closed down for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, New York City police are focusing their efforts on street vendors 
who sell unauthorized cassettes of hit movies just as they are being shown in 
theaters. Last year, the N.Y.P.D. Organized Crime Task Force raided a Brooklyn 
facility and found 74 VCRs strung together, along with master tapes for movies 
such as "Mrs. Doubtfire" and "Addams Family Values."

LANDMARK EDUCATION BILL NEARS PASSAGE; LEGISLATION: SENATE EXPECTED TO JOIN 
WITH HOUSE. ADMINISTRATION MEASURE SETS NATIONAL ACADEMIC STANDARDS, HELPS 
STATES TO ATTAIN THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clinton Administration legislation that would establish national academic 
standards moved toward final congressional approval Friday night, with the 
Senate expected to pass the measure before beginning a two-week Easter recess. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, known as Goals 2000, would establish a National Education Standards 
and Improvement Council to oversee the adoption of academic standards by the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the years ahead, Goals 2000 will be regarded as a turning point in 
American education," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), a chief sponsor of 
the legislation. "Parents and local communities will finally be able to know 
what every student should learn in core subjects like English, history, 
mathematics and science." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy and others pushed hard for congressional approval before the recess, 
which begins today. Delaying passage of the legislation until after April 1 
would mean sacrificing $100 million for the program in the 1994 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The final Senate vote was delayed by a filibuster by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) 
over wording on voluntary school prayer in the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate supporters and Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley expressed 
confidence that they had the 60 votes needed to end the filibuster and bring 
the measure to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The House approved the measure, 307 to 120, earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Goals 2000 would write into law the national education goals, which were first 
proposed in 1989 by the nation's governors and the George Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has asked for $700 million in fiscal 1995 to 
support the goals, and the legislation calls for expenditures of $1 billion in 
each of the following three years to help states establish standards and 
improve training for teachers so they can better assist students in reaching 
the standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goals 2000 will lead to the establishment of voluntary national standards," 
Riley said. "They will be guides for parents and teachers and communities to 
judge the quality of their schools. Now, we want our schools to be excellent 
but we don't know exactly what that means." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the nation, teachers, principals and school district officials voiced 
mixed opinions Friday about the major new role that the federal government 
would play under the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said the measure is unnecessary because their states and school districts 
are engaged in their own reforms. Others complained that such high standards 
are largely irrelevant to their pupils because most are poor or do not speak 
English and have a difficult time reaching minimum standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we need them to tell us we should comply with the standards," 
said Della Zaher, principal at Miami Shores Elementary School in Dade County, 
Fla. "Our state has its own goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley has said the measure is likely to erase "low expectations, which have 
too often held our children hostage and restrained our nation from achieving 
its full potential." 
</P>
<P>
 But Zaher said national academic standards will end up being largely 
irrelevant for schools like hers. Although Miami Shores Elementary has won many 
awards as an outstanding school, her students face great obstacles in learning, 
she said. The largest single group of students are Haitian immigrants, most of 
whom are very poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do have high expectations for every child," Zaher said. "But if you give 
our children a standardized test, they are not going to perform up to the 
national average." 
</P>
<P>
 But in many other school districts, the effort was received enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've become such a mobile society that it's really very important that goals 
from state to state be consistent," said Steve Van Zant, principal at Wilson 
Middle School in Exeter, Calif. "This legislation shows it's not just 50 states 
working in separate directions, but all of us working together to make our 
schools better." 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Lucero, principal at Griegos Elementary School in Albuquerque, said the 
new law "will make a difference because it gives us a common ground to start 
with. It will help us accept that we're a global society." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in some states that already are developing their own standards said 
they will benefit from a national framework. 
</P>
<P>
 "That saves you money if you don't have to start from scratch for every 
subject in every grade," said Barbara Ahrens an official with the Denver Public 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colorado, the Legislature has ordered school districts to adopt standards 
and assessments by 1997 but has not provided any money. Ahrens said she hopes 
that some of the money the federal government has earmarked for Goals 2000 will 
come Denver's way. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest challenges is in designing ways to judge the achievement 
levels of students who are disabled or speak a language other than English. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this going to be a three-tiered system or are we going to hold all the 
children to the same expectations?" Ahrens asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Developing the standards and methods of testing students as well as teacher 
training is all very expensive, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, federal funds are limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all wish that we could do more," Kennedy said. "But education is primarily 
a state and local responsibility.

NO CRIMINAL LIABILITY IS FOUND IN AMTRAK BAYOU DERAILMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A six-month investigation has turned up no evidence of criminal wrongdoing in 
the Amtrak derailment that killed 47 people after the train plunged into a 
foggy bayou. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line was that there was no criminal liability," Dist. Atty. Chris 
Galanos said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanos directed a task force that was deciding whether manslaughter or 
negligent homicide charges should be filed in Amtrak's worst disaster. His 
report did not address the issue of civil liability in the Sept. 22 crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous lawsuits have been filed by the families of victims in the wreck on a 
span across Bayou Canot, about 10 miles north of Mobile. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the prosecutor's Inter-Agency Task Force found that no state law 
was violated when barges pushed by a towboat rammed a bridge at the bayou only 
minutes before the Sunset Limited plunged from the span. 
</P>
<P>
 The towboat pilot, Willie Odom, surrendered his license last week rather than 
face a Coast Guard hearing, said Capt. Mike Perkins, commander of the Coast 
Guard's Marine Safety Office in Mobile. 
</P>
<P>
 In its conclusion, the county prosecutor's report states that "only acts 
rising to the level of 'recklessness' or 'criminal negligence' " as defined in 
the state code would warrant a criminal charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts, when analyzed in the context of the statute, do not support such a 
conclusion," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board's separate report on the derailment 
is not expected until this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Odom told the safety board he was attempting to tie up his barges because of 
the heavy fog and believed he was still on the Mobile River when he saw an 
object on his radar that he thought was another tug. Instead, it was the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety board investigators said Odom's barges hit the bridge, knocking the 
span out of line and causing the Sunset Limited to derail when it reached the 
crossing. Many of the 47 victims drowned in a submerged passenger car.

CELEBRATION OF PASSOVER; JEWS BEGIN 8-DAY CELEBRATION AT SUNSET WITH SEDER 
RITUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE and WILLSON CUMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gathered with friends at the Jewish Senior Center of Orange County for an 
early Passover Seder, Izak Kuncewiecki reminisced about his personal road to 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell me this story about Egypt," the 82-year-old Kuncewiecki said, but 
"I got my own story" to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Kuncewiecki's personal recollections of surviving 16 months in an 
Arctic Circle labor camp during World War II, where temperatures routinely fell 
well below zero, seemed particularly relevant to a holiday that commemorates 
freedom from slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning at sunset today , Jews will celebrate Passover, the eight-day 
festival that commemorates the story of Moses leading the Jewish people out of 
slavery in Egypt more than 3,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After wandering 40 years in the desert, biblical accounts say, the Jewish 
people arrived in the Promised Land and created the nation of Israel. Today 
Jews commemorate the event by conducting Seders, ceremonial meals during which 
the story is retold and certain foods are consumed in symbolic re-creation of 
the exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbis throughout Orange County say the holiday is especially significant this 
year in light of recent events from California to the Middle East. And many say 
they plan to expand congregational Seders tonight and Sunday to include 
discussions of some of the important modern-day issues upon which the holiday 
touches. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year feels extremely different from other years," said Rabbi Robert 
Baruch, spiritual leader of Temple Bat Yahm in Newport Beach. "We feel more 
vulnerable and frail than at any other time." 
</P>
<P>
 At his own temple, Baruch said, he intends to use a particular portion of the 
service to drive home his belief that the lessons of Passover are relevant to 
modern life. Traditionally, the portion enumerates the 10 plagues said to have 
been visited upon the Egyptians by God in His defense of the fleeing Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 But Baruch said he plans to encourage participants to enumerate the more 
recent plagues that have been visited upon residents of California itself: 
fire, earthquake and mudslides, as well as more enduring social ills such as 
poverty, AIDS and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm emphasizing," Baruch said, "is that we should rethink the plagues as 
not something that happens to our adversaries, the Egyptians, but as something 
that occurs to us. We should think of these things, not so much as things that 
are visited on us by God, but as opportunities to be co-workers with God in 
improving the world." 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's model Seder at the Costa Mesa Jewish Senior Center, Ziporah 
Prihar, 92, recalled how she made the decision to leave home in Poland in 1920 
with a group of young pioneers to build a Jewish community in the Palestine 
desert that would later become the modern state of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother said, 'All right, go. If it's too hard for you, you'll come back,' 
" Prihar remembered. "But I never went back." 
</P>
<P>
 Prihar said she worked to pull rocks out of fields and crush them with hammers 
to build roads. "I was sick so many times," Prihar said. "I had malaria. But I 
didn't want to go home because I knew my mother wouldn't let me go back." 
</P>
<P>
 Having built their own nation after experiencing persecution themselves, said 
Rabbi Bernie King of Harbor Reform Temple, Jews should be especially sensitive 
to such modern-day "slaveries" as the economic servitude imposed by inner-city 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The haves need to reach out to the have-nots," he said. "There needs to be 
more contact between the more affluent and less affluent aspects of our 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Many area rabbis said they plan to discuss developments in the Middle East, 
where recent efforts to reach a peace agreement were shattered when dozens of 
Muslims were massacred by a Jewish settler as they worshiped in a mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are enslaved by violence," said Rabbi Allen Krause of Temple Beth El 
in Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Krause said he plans to emphasize that point during a portion of the Seder 
during which Jews traditionally drip wine off their fingers as each of the 10 
plagues is recited, symbolically reducing the joy they take in the suffering of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the recent events in Hebron," he said, "we really have to reduce 
any joy we have at this time when we recall what's going on there and how many 
innocent people were killed." 
</P>
<P>
 "This year has special meaning for Jews because of the hope for the peace 
process in the Middle East," added Rabbi Marc Rubenstein of Temple Isaiah of 
Newport Beach, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary with a communal Seder. 
At the Seder, the traditional fifth cup of wine, which is normally set out for 
the Prophet Elijah, will be dedicated to the hope of peace in the Middle East, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all rabbis, however, said they will deliver a message of cooperation 
between Jews and Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened in Hebron is simply a repeat of history," said Rabbi Aron 
Berkowitz, the orthodox head of Congregation Adat Israel of Huntington Beach. 
"Jews and Arabs have had great difficulty living together. What it tells us is 
that the idea of having two independent countries next to each other is 
impossible. The Arabs and the Jews do not get along." The Seder Plate 
</P>
<P>
 Passover begins at sundown today with a ceremonial dinner called the Seder. A 
Seder plate is prepared with ceremonial foods, which are referred to at 
specific points during the reading of the Haggada, the story of the Jews' 
enslavement in Egypt 3,000 years ago and their escape to freedom under Moses' 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 * Roasted lamb shank bone: Symbolizes the sacrificial lamb, whose blood was 
smeared above the doors of Jewish homes in Egypt so the Angel of Death would 
know to "pass over" these homes when he killed the Egyptians' firstborn 
children. In the Bible, this the last and most terrible of the 10 plagues sent 
by God to persuade the Egyptians to free the enslaved Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 * Haroset: An apple-nut-cinnamon-wine mixture symbolizing the bricks and 
mortar Jewish slaves used to build the pyramids in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parsley and salt water: Parsley or celery is dipped in salt water to recall 
the tears shed by Jews under Egyptian bondage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Horseradish: Eaten to recall the bitterness of slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 * Roasted or hard-boiled eggs: Symbolize the free-will festival offering that 
accompanied the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb in the Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wine: Four cups are drunk by each person at specific moments during the 
meal. An extra cup is placed on the table for the prophet Elijah, who, it is 
believed, will pave the way for the coming of the Messiah. 
</P>
<P>
 * Matzo (unleavened bread): During the eight days of Passover, no leavened 
foods, such as bread, are eaten. Unleavened bread, such as matzo crackers or 
matzo meal, recalls the hasty flight to freedom of the Jews, who had no time to 
let their bread rise when the moment came for them to leave Egypt.

ACCIDENTAL TOSS TURNS RING INTO GULL'S PRIZE; MISHAP: FIREFIGHTERS RETRIEVE 
JEWELRY DEPOSITED ON POLE BY BIRD, WHO HAD SNATCHED IT AFTER IT SLID OFF 
OWNER'S FINGER.

 A chauffeur named "Big" Mike Simpson is going to think twice about feeding the 
birds after what happened to his $3,000 pinkie ring Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 As unbelievable as it sounds, the one-carat diamond ring slipped off Simpson's 
little finger as he was throwing stale pretzels to a flock of birds. A sea gull 
swooped by and picked it up, then deposited it on top of a light pole, where 
firefighters had to be called to retrieve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking how was I going to explain this to my wife," said Simpson, 52, 
of Huntington Beach, noting that his wife, Karen, had given him the ring as an 
anniversary gift 18 years ago. "I was afraid to tell her." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's tale began about 11:30 a.m. as he was waiting for a friend in the 
parking lot of Sportmart on Warner Avenue near Magnolia Street. 
</P>
<P>
 To pass the time, Simpson decided to feed the birds some pretzels he found in 
the trunk of his stretch limousine. 
</P>
<P>
 Then trouble swooped down upon him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I began feeding the birds like a nice guy," he said. "I was crunching the 
pretzels and slinging them with my right hand. Then, all of a sudden, (the 
ring) slid off and I went running after it." 
</P>
<P>
 To Simpson's alarm, a sea gull snatched it up. A chase ensued and harsh words 
were uttered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started screaming all kinds of things at that bird," he said. "I started 
throwing pretzels at it to try to get him to drop the ring and eat the 
pretzels." 
</P>
<P>
 The sea gull didn't bite. Instead it flew skyward with the ring and eventually 
landed on top of a 25-foot-high light pole, where it just dropped the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he tried shaking the light pole to see if he could shake the ring off, 
Simpson said. It did no good. Then, he thought about asking some children to 
shinny up the pole to get the ring, but decided they might run off with the 
piece of jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was planning to camp underneath the lamppost all night, hoping it would 
rain hard enough and wash the ring down," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, some Fountain Valley firefighters happened to be across the 
street, and Simpson persuaded them to radio in for a hook-and-ladder truck. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of the department's stranger requests. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when firefighter Jeff Shockey received the call, he thought it was a 
joke, he said. Now Shockey can add a diamond ring to the list of cats, dogs and 
even an iguana he has had to rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just sitting there," he said of the ring. "The bird had just dropped 
it there. I don't know what the bird was thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 How did the ring manage to slip off of Simpson's finger in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
 The six-foot, 300-plus-pound chauffeur explained it thus: "I'm one of those 
people who puts weight on and takes it off again." He has lost 40 pounds over 
the last six months, giving a looser fit not only to his clothes but his 
jewelry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to throw anymore food to birds with my right hand until I get 
this ring refitted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Simpson promised to provide firefighters with a steady supply 
of specialty pies. They were the only reward the firefighters would take. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fire Station 1 saved my marriage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as Simpson's wife is concerned, his anguish over the ring was 
misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story was so bizarre, it had to be true," Karen Simpson said. "You 
couldn't make up something like that."

2 BOYS START STRUCTURE FIRES IN ANAHEIM; SAFETY: THREE-YEAR-OLDS PLAYING WITH 
FIRE DAMAGE TWO APARTMENT COMPLEXES WITHIN NINE HOURS. NO ONE WAS HURT. 
</P>

 Small children playing with fire started two apartment blazes here within nine 
hours, fire officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries reported in either blaze but both fires caused 
significant property damage, said Fire Department spokesman Mike Doty. 
</P>
<P>
 The first blaze broke out Thursday just before midnight in an apartment in the 
600 block of East Avon Place. A 3-year-old boy at home with a baby-sitter found 
some matches and lit some clothes that were hanging in a bedroom closet, Doty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When firefighters arrived, the closet and two bedrooms were fully involved in 
a fire," Doty said. "But everyone got out safely." 
</P>
<P>
 It took 18 firefighters 10 minutes to bring the blaze under control. The fire 
caused an estimated $30,000 in damage to the apartment and its contents. No 
other units were burned but some were damaged by smoke, Doty said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:25 a.m., firefighters were called to the Tara Hill Apartments, 2130 
Crescent St., to battle a blaze that had been started in an upstairs unit in 
the sprawling complex. 
</P>
<P>
 A 3-year-old boy, home with his 23-year-old mother and two brothers, set his 
bed on fire with a cigarette lighter, Doty said. "The mother discovered the 
fire and poured water on it and thought she had put it out," Doty said. "She 
didn't realize that the fire was still cooking underneath the mattress and the 
fire ignited again." 
</P>
<P>
 The mother, Becky Deady, managed to escape with the 3-year-old and his 
brothers, ages 5 years and 6 months. Because she had no telephone, Deady fled 
to a fire station across the street and reported the fire in person. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials do not know exactly how much time passed since the mattress 
first ignited, but "there was quite a delay in reporting the fire," Doty said. 
"If she had called when she first discovered the mattress burning, it would 
have made a big difference. There was a delay and she lost everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Gary Gurrola, who lives downstairs from Deady, said he and his three 
roommates were sleeping when they heard the sound of breaking glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked out the window and saw the fire so we ran out," Gurrola said. "We 
didn't have time to grab anything. But, as long as no one got hurt, that's the 
main thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire caused $85,000 in damage to the apartments. The blaze destroyed 
Deady's apartment and caused smoke and water damage to adjoining units. It took 
25 firefighters 20 minutes to bring the blaze under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Doty said the fires underline the danger in leaving matches or cigarette 
lighters within the reach of children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents need to take responsibility to keep cigarette lighters and matches 
away from children," Doty said. "They can't leave these things out and expect 
kids to ignore them. Kids are curious about these things and they are going to 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had way too many fires like this started by young children." 
</P>
<P>
 The fires came at an unusually busy time for Anaheim firefighters, who also 
battled a blaze Thursday morning. That blaze was started by a transient in an 
abandoned warehouse in the 1800 block of Anaheim Street scheduled for 
demolition that day. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was reported at 9:50 a.m. and took 17 firefighters 20 minutes to 
bring it under control. There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our belief that the fire was caused by one of two transients living in 
the building," Doty said. "It was either started intentionally or by gross 
negligence." 
</P>
<P>
 All three fires remained under investigation.

SYMPOSIUM EXAMINES CRIME AND PUNISHMENT; VIOLENCE: SPEAKERS ENCOURAGE CITIZENS 
TO PRESSURE LAWMAKERS TO TOUGHEN PENALTIES. THE GOVERNOR IS EXPECTED AT 
MONDAY'S EVENT.

 In an emotional address to citizens and officials attending a South County 
symposium, San Juan Capistrano Mayor Collene Campbell on Friday called on 
Californians to wage an aggressive campaign against state legislators deemed 
"soft on crime."  
</P>
<P>
 "Zero tolerance on crime will prevail," Campbell said. "We must make the 
voters understand who receives money from the ACLU (American Civil Liberties 
Union), and groups like the trial lawyers associations, to defend the rights of 
these criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a threat, it is a promise," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, whose 27-year-old son, Scott, was murdered in 1982, and whose 
brother, millionaire racing promoter Mickey Thompson, was murdered in 1988 
along with his wife, has become an outspoken victims' rights activist.  
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's appeal for action was voiced at the second of a series of crime 
symposiums sponsored by the South Orange County Chambers of Commerce. On 
Monday, Gov. Pete Wilson is expected to speak at the third symposium at the 
Holiday Inn here. 
</P>
<P>
 An ACLU spokeswoman took exception to Campbell's remarks, saying they do not 
make political donations, and never have in the group's 74-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not endorse political candidates," said Ramona Ripston, executive 
director of the ACLU of Southern California in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This office is in the highest crime rate area in the city. We have drive-by 
shootings. Last week, the driver of a lunch truck (serving the area) was held 
up at gunpoint. We do know crime, and we don't advocate for criminals. We 
believe criminals should be punished, provided the punishment is proportional 
to the crime," Ripston added.  
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the symposium held in Laguna Hills said the goal was to bring 
together a diverse audience made up of people who want to take an active role 
in doing something about crime -- especially violent crime, which is on the 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that if we intervene we will not find ourselves to be the shooting 
gallery that Los Angeles has become," said Carolyn Wallace, a spokeswoman for 
the South Orange County Chambers of Commerce. "We also want to come up with 
programs to help change the directions of at-risk youth, and to lobby for 
tougher crime bills." 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing an audience of about 60 people, Campbell said that she was not 
speaking as mayor, but "as a victim of crime." 
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional outpouring, she told about the death of her son. And, when 
speaking about her brother, she paused, and took a deep breath before 
continuing. "My only sibling . . . my brother Mickey Thompson and his beautiful 
wife were murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the opportunity to talk with Mark Klaas, Polly Klaas' father," Campbell 
said, referring to a 12-year-old girl who was abducted late last year from a 
slumber party at her Petaluma home and subsequently murdered. "And we both came 
to the conclusion that our two kids were murdered because some legislator 
wanted to give a criminal another chance." 
</P>
<P>
 As Campbell sat down to loud applause, she was thanked for sharing her 
personal tragedies by Assemblyman Bill Jones (R-Fresno), the author of 
California's new "three strikes and you're out" sentencing law. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the signing of" that law, Jones said, "we have succeeded in enacting the 
toughest anti-crime measure in California in generations. We have now served 
notice that the citizens of this state have a right to live in safety and that 
we will take whatever steps are necessary to put criminals away for good." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Orange County prosecutors said that they would seek to make 
Mario Veliz Rodriguez, 30, of Santa Ana the first Orange County resident to be 
sentenced under the new law. Rodriguez, having been previously convicted of 
assault with intent to commit murder and second-degree robbery, already has two 
strikes against him, one as a juvenile offender.

HIGH DESERT JEWS A SMALL, CLOSE GROUP; JUDAISM: MEMBERSHIP IN THE ANTELOPE 
VALLEY IS BARELY 250 ADULTS. BUT MANY SAY THE TINY SIZE STRENGTHENS TIES TO THE 
FAITH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Passover holiday is a time for Jews to celebrate leavingthe desert. But 
some have gone back. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight in Los Angeles County's own high desert region, the Antelope Valley, 
the holiday will be celebrated at dozens of home Seders by a vibrant Jewish 
community that supports a Reform synagogue, several social action programs, a 
preschool, adult classes and even a small but active Orthodox Chabad chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 The community is not large -- the synagogue's membership is only about 250 
adults in an area with more than 300,000 residents. But with most Jews in this 
country concentrated in large urban areas and with the Antelope Valley's 
reputation as a bastion of fundamentalist Christian groups, it's surprising 
that a lively Jewish community exists there at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more surprising is that the temple, Beth Knesset Bamidbar, was founded 
more than 40 years ago, when Lancaster truly resembled the desert of the Jews' 
biblical wanderings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is Jewish life outside of Los Angeles!" declared Stella Nugent, one of 
the founding members of the temple, laughing as she took a breather from 
Passover cooking this week to talk about the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked so hard for what we have here." 
</P>
<P>
 The temple's rabbi, Alan Henkin, acknowledges that Jews sometimes feel like 
outsiders in the Antelope Valley. Prayers given at such public forums as City 
Council meetings often include references to Jesus and school concerts during 
the Christmas season feature devoutly Christian songs. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said a small community with only one temple is in many ways healthy for 
Jewish life. "In the San Fernando Valley, there is a synagogue on every 
corner," said Henkin, 44, who previously had a congregation in Arleta. "What 
appealed to me, here, is that this is the only synagogue in the area. It is the 
community in the way a synagogue in the San Fernando Valley is not." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as one of the newer members of the temple, Shelly Ditzhazy, put it, "If 
you're Jewish, it's the only game in town." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1951, when Stella Nugent and her husband arrived, there was no game at all. 
"It was a small, small town," said Nugent, 64, sifting through photographs and 
newspaper articles chronicling the history of the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as small as it was, it seems like there was a church everywhere you 
looked." 
</P>
<P>
 They had come as newlyweds from New York City so that Jack Nugent could take a 
job as a mechanical engineer for the National Committee for Aeronautics, which 
eventually became NASA. Although her family was devout, she said she did not 
think much about the fact that she would be leaving her Jewish community 
behind. "I didn't think in those terms," she said. "We were starting a new 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after arriving in the dusty outpost, they met the handful of other Jewish 
couples who had come to the area for similar reasons. Nine of the couples 
founded the temple, appointing one of the men a lay spiritual leader, and 
meeting in private homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fledgling congregation held its first High Holy Days service in Max 
Goldberg's den. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not unusual, Nugent said, for Lancaster neighbors to tell her she was 
the first Jew they had ever met. "We had the next-door neighbor over for dinner 
and served corned beef," she said. "He said, 'That was the best ham I've ever 
had.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The small Jewish community was low-key, but there were some run-ins with local 
institutions. "They would not allow our children to be excused from school for 
religious holidays," she said. "That was a long fight to get that changed." 
</P>
<P>
 As more Jews moved in, the congregation grew. In 1953, it moved into a small 
former church bought for $4,500. A building fund was begun and in 1963 the 
present home of Beth Knesset Bamidbar -- Hebrew for "congregation in the 
wilderness" -- was dedicated. Until 1987, however, the congregation was so 
small it could employ only a part-time rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
 Henkin heard about BKB, as the congregation refers to itself, in 1990 when 
they were seeking a new rabbi. "I liked the people immediately," said Henkin, 
44. "Very down to earth, very serious about Judaism." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he grew up in a small city outside Chicago, the size of the community 
did not daunt him, but the local politics did. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after he arrived, Henkin asked the Chamber of Commerce to rename the 
Lancaster Christmas Parade to include non-Christians. The chamber changed it to 
the Holiday parade, but then came the calls and letters of protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both the chamber and I were really taken aback by the reaction," he said. The 
parade is now known as the Lancaster Christmas/Holiday Parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Henkin said acts of outright anti-Semitism in the area are rare, but he 
continues to meet with city officials to work toward broader policies. "Our 
approach is not confrontational," he said. "We hope that just by being 
ourselves as Jews, people will come to know who we are." 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation's most successful annual fund-raiser is a pastrami booth at 
the Antelope Valley Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The most difficult problem faced by many in the community involves their 
children feeling out of place. "Kids don't want to stand out, they want to be 
like their friends," said Ditzhazy, 39, who has three small children. One of 
them once asked her not to let people know they were Jewish. Several parents in 
the congregation tell similar stories. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a concern they share with members of Chabad of the High Desert, a 
congregation of about 25 families that holds services in a mini-mall storefront 
between a Mexican/Cuban restaurant and a print shop. "The children see all the 
Christmas things and say they want to be part of this beautiful holiday, like 
their friends," said the group's rabbi, Yehudah Lazar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell them, 'Yes, they have a beautiful holiday with the lights and 
everything,' but we also teach them about the beauty and significance of our 
own holidays, so they will be proud of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other male members of the ultra-orthodox Chabad movement, headquartered 
in Brooklyn, Lazar, 32, has a full beard and in public always wears a yarmulke 
or other hat. He was assigned this post by the organization, which actively 
seeks to expand its membership among Jews. BKB and the Chabad have little 
contact with each other, but both rabbis say relations are friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar said if people stare at him because of his appearance, he doesn't 
notice. "I got used to standing out a long time ago," he said with a laugh, but 
he has been received cordially by the community for the most part, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was making a hospital visit once and a woman came up to me and said, 'I'm 
not Jewish, but I respect you people,' and she asked me to pray for the person 
she was visiting," he said. "So, of course I did. It was a nice thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Both congregations know the lure of assimilation is strong in an area where 
the vast majority of neighbors and business associates are not Jewish. But for 
some, it only strengthens their ties to Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditzhazy grew up in a mostly Jewish neighborhood in a Detroit suburb, but her 
parents were not devout and "the services I went to didn't mean much to me," 
she said, sitting in her kitchen in Palmdale.  
</P>
<P>
 She married a Catholic man and only joined the Jewish community center in 
Orlando, where they had settled, so that her children would have some contact 
with the religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon moving to Lancaster, she contacted BKB again for her children. But in the 
small-town atmosphere of the temple, she felt drawn to her religion as never 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditzhazy is now active in temple activities and heads its outreach program to 
those, like herself, who are in interfaith marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 She is looking forward to tonight when her daughter will for the first time 
recite the four questions at the family Seder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it is funny that I move out to the most non-Jewish place I can find 
and that's where I get involved," she said. "But it's one of the best things I 
ever did in my life."

ARMED MAN IS SOUGHT IN 2 DOZEN STORE ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHAU LAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man with a handgun has robbed about two dozen San Fernando Valley businesses 
since February, twice hitting three merchants in the same day, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has been injured by the robber, who told one victim he has "a terrible 
drug problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said he picks small merchants who do business in cash, enters the store 
around closing time, orders employees to lie on the floor and has never been 
spotted as he leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's obviously more sophisticated and more clever than most because of the 
type of businesses he's picking and he makes his getaway without anyone seeing 
him," said Detective Rick Jamieson of the Los Angeles Police Department's North 
Hollywood Division, where nine of the robberies occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Police described the suspect as a white male, 30 to 35 years old, 5-foot-8 or 
5-foot-9, weighing 175 pounds, with short, sandy blond hair. He wears baseball 
caps of different colors, blue jeans, a blue denim jacket and occasionally, 
sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy is so nondescript that he can be one of several thousand in the 
Valley," Jamieson said. "You couldn't believe how many calls we got after we 
passed out the composites. We stopped and detained suspects. But it's never 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the robberies were on Ventura Boulevard and half of the victims have 
been dry cleaners, which have no security cameras. He has also held up a pet 
shop, a flower shop, a candy store, a shoe store, a bicycle shop, a restaurant 
and several small gift shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "He likes the Ventura Boulevard corridor because it's easy picking. There are 
so many small businesses. He can jump on the freeway if he needs an exit or go 
up into the hills," said Detective Robert Johansen of the West Valley Division, 
where nine robberies have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though victims have supplied varying descriptions of the suspect, police 
believe it is the same man. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sure it's the same person. It's just that people describe people 
differently," Jamieson said. "Half of the victims said he looks like one 
composite, half said he looks like the other." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent crime was Thursday, when the man robbed a Woodland Hills dry 
cleaners of $500. The robber ordered the female clerk to strip, apparently to 
assure that she would not try to follow him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, clerk Luz Castaneda, who was working alone at a dry cleaning 
shop, said the man looked like a typical customer. At first, she thought he was 
joking when he announced the holdup. He promised not to hurt her if she 
cooperated, Castaneda said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see a car. I didn't hear anything. Then he was gone," Castaneda 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't make me feel scared at all," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview at the store, Castaneda lifted her T-shirt, revealing a small 
handgun tucked in her blue jeans.

FUGITIVE TIED TO ACCIDENT FRAUD SEIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major break for local prosecutors, authorities in Texas have arrested a 
fugitive alleged to be a key player in a fraud case involving staged accidents 
with big trucks that killed one man on the Golden State Freeway near Sun 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Max Huntsman described the capture of Filemon 
Santiago, 25, outside a Houston video store last week as significant, 
particularly because he is the suspected link between participants in the June, 
1992, crash and an attorney who has been charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is alleged to be the 'capper' who set up the accidents," Huntsman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cappers," or auto wreck stagers, work directly with attorneys to set up 
accidents aimed at collecting thousands of dollars in insurance claims on 
behalf of passengers. Cappers also recruit passengers to ride inside cars that 
purposely get into wrecks, often by stopping in front of other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities allege Santiago organized wrecks for attorney and Encino resident 
Gary Miller, described by prosecutors as the mastermind of the ring. The case 
gained widespread attention after a crash killed Jose Luis Lopez Perez, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago, Miller, the car's driver and two passengers face murder charges 
stemming from the crash. The incident was one of a chain of similar, staged 
wrecks involving trucks and gained nationwide attention as evidence of an 
escalation in the relatively common phenomenon of staged crashes on city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 After the wreck, a passenger in the car in which Perez died and the owner of 
the car both identified Santiago as the "capper," alleging he is a key link in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol investigators subsequently tied Miller to the crash 
when some of his business cards were found at Santiago's West Hollywood home, 
court records show. Santiago, however, had fled and was not found during that 
search. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight suspected fake accidents have been linked in court records to Miller. 
All of the cases appeared to involve Santiago and financial records documented 
frequent payments to Santiago from Miller's office -- at least $20,000 in a 
14-month period ending in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 1992 bail hearing for Miller, prosecutors and defense attorneys 
submitted into evidence what they identified as an extortion note from 
Santiago, discovered during a CHP search of Miller's house. 
</P>
<P>
 In it, Santiago asked for $20,000 to "get myself and my family out of here in 
order to start a new life." He said he knew authorities wanted "to get me in 
order to get Gary" and concluded with the postscript: "Please don't let me down 
because I won't let you down if you work with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators for the California Department of Insurance tracked Santiago down 
in Houston last week after receiving a tip that he was living under the alias 
Jonathan Mendez Ruiz and that he was driving a red Toyota Celica, authorities 
said. Two investigators followed Santiago from an apartment building to a video 
store where they detained him until Houston police arrived and arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntsman, of the Los Angeles district attorney's office, said Santiago is 
fighting extradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 30 defendants indicted in October, 1992, in connection with the ring, 
nine have been convicted, 14 -- including attorney Miller -- are headed for 
trial and seven face outstanding arrest warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Harland Braun, an attorney representing Miller, said the arrest of Santiago 
should help, not hinder, his client's case. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he tells the truth, they'll dismiss the case against Miller," Braun said. 
"The truth is that Gary had no idea they were setting up these big-rig 
accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Braun added that at the time of his death, Perez had in his wallet two other 
attorneys' business cards and not Miller's. 
</P>
<P>
 A pretrial hearing for three of those charged with murder -- Miller and crash 
passengers Rubidia Lopez and Isiais Antonio Aguilar Martinez -- has been set 
for April 11. A hearing for Jorge Sanchez, the driver in the accident who is 
also charged with murder, is set for April 7.

JURY FINDS WIFE-KILLER ACTED IN HEAT OF PASSION; TRIAL: MOOSA HANOUKAI FACES 
MAXIMUM 12-YEAR SENTENCE FOR BLUDGEONING SPOUSE TO DEATH. DEFENSE CALLS 
DECISION 'MAJOR VICTORY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who claimed he had been psychologically emasculated by an abusive wife 
for 25 years escaped a murder charge Friday when a jury found that he acted in 
the heat of passion when he bludgeoned her to death. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Van Nuys Superior Court verdict, Moosa Hanoukai, 55, faces a maximum 
sentence of 12 years, compared to life in prison for murder, as prosecutors had 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider it a major victory," lead defense attorney James E. Blatt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying in his own behalf, Hanoukai told a jury of six men and six women 
that he attacked his 45-year-old wife March 29, 1993, with a wrench after she 
wished death upon him and the couple's only child. Hanoukai said he hit his 
wife, Manijeh, dozens of times, stopping only when he grew tired. 
</P>
<P>
 Her body was found in the garage of the family home five days after the 
slaying. Hanoukai surrendered the next day after he had contacted an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyers will urge Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz place Hanoukai on probation at 
the April 29 sentencing for voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a threat to society," said defense attorney Alaleh Kamran. 
</P>
<P>
 Blatt presented an unusual "cultural defense," in which he attempted to show 
Hanoukai was prevented by his Persian Jewish background from obtaining a 
divorce. Hanoukai killed his wife on a day that was both the Jewish Sabbath and 
the Persian New Year's Eve, during which the family is traditionally 
celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Two experts testified Hanoukai was in a "dissociative" state during the 
slaying and had no idea what he was doing. The defense argued that the mental 
breakdown was triggered by a fight, one of many throughout the couple's stormy 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 But, according to Blatt, the most significant aspect of the defense was 
"role-reversal" -- attempting to show that a man who was "brutally and 
sadistically abused" can suffer just as much as a woman in the same situation. 
The jury in the case heard testimony that Hanoukai was forced to sleep on the 
floor and that his wife routinely referred to him as "stupid" and an "idiot." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't recall another case where the psychological abuse of a man was used 
as a mitigating factor to manslaughter," Blatt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen M. Cady focused on the brutality of the killing 
and the fact that Hanoukai cleaned up the death scene. Admitting that the truth 
of the killing may never be known, Cady said, Hanoukai may have been assisted 
by other family members, a possibility suggested by the fact that Hanoukai 
remembered to put pantyhose on his dead wife's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "She (Cady) didn't have much to go on to start with," said juror Richard Mann, 
who also criticized the prosecutor's preparation of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "They clearly dropped the ball because they had this confession and they 
didn't do their job," one female juror said, referring to the prosecutor and 
Los Angeles police investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Hanoukai called an acquaintance and admitted killing his wife, jurors 
felt detectives were overconfident and failed to collect fingerprints and 
potential murder weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors reported the panel was deadlocked 6-6 after two days of deliberation, 
but repeated viewing of the complicated jury instructions allowed them to break 
the impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 Blatt predicted that the case will lead others to try the unusual defense -- 
one he compared to the trials of Erik and Lyle Menendez.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we've done in this case is a step further than Menendez," Blatt 
said. "I think what this indicates now is this type of defense, if prepared 
adequately and thoroughly, will be taken seriously by jurors." 
</P>
<P>
 A mistrial was declared in January in the trials of the Beverly Hills brothers 
who admitted they shotgunned their parents to death. Two juries split between 
murder and manslaughter after hearing the brothers detailed years of emotional 
and psychological abuse from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Blatt said "times are changing" and suggested jurors are now more willing to 
listen to claims of abuse as part of the defense in cases of violent crime.

GIRL STRUGGLES TO KEEP CAMPAIGN FOR OTHER ABUSED CHILDREN ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Desiray Bartak has served as a national symbol for sexually abused children 
for the past year, but the Newbury Park teen-ager is running out of money to 
keep her effort going. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial drain on Desiray's struggling family has forced the determined 
13-year-old to organize a "make-or-break" fund-raiser today to keep alive her 
organization, Children Against Rape and Molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's put my family in debt, because we wanted to keep it going so badly," 
Desiray said in an interview at her family's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray and her mother will be accepting donations at a fund-raising table 
today in front of a local grocery store. The family hopes to raise nearly 
$4,000 to pay the costs of mailing newsletters and calling young victims from 
around the country who have written to Desiray after seeing her on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the family needs money to apply to the state for nonprofit status for 
Desiray's organization before an early April deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray's story of being sexually molested by her godfather at the age of 10 
and her groundbreaking lawsuit seeking damages against her attacker have been 
featured on television shows such as "20/20," "The Home Show" and "Hard Copy." 
She has been written about in People magazine, featured in a television 
documentary and will be the focus of an upcoming ABC "Afterschool Special." 
</P>
<P>
 With all of the exposure, Desiray receives four or five letters a day from 
other children who have been abused. She answers the letters and even 
telephones youngsters if asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like helping people, and knowing that I'm helping people gives me a good 
feeling in my heart," Desiray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Desiray contacted prominent Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred, 
who agreed to handle the first-of-its-kind lawsuit by a child against her 
abuser. In January, Desiray was awarded $2 million by a Los Angeles County 
jury. But she knew she would never get her attacker to pay the judgment, 
because he doesn't have any assets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't do it for the money," Desiray said. "I did it because I wanted to 
show other children that we do have power. A lot of kids don't know that." 
</P>
<P>
 When she was molested, Desiray was visiting overnight at the Palmdale home of 
Richard Streate, 30, her father's best friend and Desiray's godfather. Streate 
was sentenced in January, 1993, by a judge in Lancaster to three years in 
prison after pleading guilty to one felony count of committing a lewd act upon 
a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray's mother, Wayanne Kruger, said there are times when she and her 
husband -- Desiray's stepfather, currently unemployed from his manufacturing 
job -- want to give up on Desiray's organization and the $900 long-distance 
telephone bills that accompany it. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the telephone expense and the cost of producing and mailing 
Desiray's newsletter to 200 subscribers, the family needs $1,600 to trademark 
the organization's name and to apply for nonprofit status by April 8, the 
deadline for incorporating, Kruger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something always happens to keep us going," Kruger said. "It's definitely a 
higher power." 
</P>
<P>
 Kruger pointed to a pink paper cutout in the shape of a heart on which a poem 
was written for Desiray. The handprint of a small child served as a signature. 
"For now I know that someone else understands exactly how I feel," the card 
read. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what keeps us going," Kruger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray, an eighth-grader at Sequoia Intermediate School in Newbury Park, 
spends at least 10 hours a week answering mail and calling children who send 
their telephone numbers in search of someone besides an adult to talk with, she 
said. She speaks to groups across the country, always encouraging youngsters to 
"talk and tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray never imagined that her decision to go public with her story would 
command so much attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a bomb that exploded," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Desiray's forceful style, determination and insistence that abused children 
should empower themselves by suing their attackers have propelled the teen-ager 
to national prominence, her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruger recalled that attorney Allred told Desiray to expect a wave of media 
attention for a few days after going public. Then the glare of the spotlight 
would shift somewhere else. That hasn't happened, Desiray's mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Desiray is not a wave," her mother said. "She is the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Desiray says she plans to become an attorney and advocate 
for children. She and her mother will be holding the fund-raiser outside 
Albertson's on Reino Road in Newbury Park from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone interested can write to Desiray Bartak through her organization, 
Children Against Rape and Molestation, at 2060 Avenida de las Arboles, No. 348, 
Thousand Oaks 91362-1361.

PLAN ON COURT CONSOLIDATION WILL SHIFT JUDGES' ROLES; LAW: MORE JURISTS WILL 
HEAR CIVIL SUITS AND SERIOUS CRIMINAL CASES. SOME HAVE CALLED THE CHANGES 
UNNECESSARY AND ILLEGAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 More judges will be available to hear cases involving civil suits and serious 
criminal matters when a court-reorganization plan goes into effect next month, 
court officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the consolidation plan, scheduled to go into effect a week from Monday, 
a number of the county's 27 judges have received new assignments and the 
distinction between the Superior and Municipal courts has blurred.  
</P>
<P>
 Two Municipal Court judges will be transferred to the more prestigious 
Superior Court to handle felony cases, including capital-punishment trials. 
</P>
<P>
 The downside: fewer judges will hear misdemeanor cases. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials say the public will not be adversely affected by that because 
judges' assignments have been better organized to maximize efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the bottom line is we get more and better work out of the same number 
of people," said Superior Court Presiding Judge Melinda A. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, believe the changes to be unnecessary and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just happen to believe that this is an unlawful takeover of power that does 
not belong to the judges," said Superior Court Judge James McNally, who has 
criticized the consolidation from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson disagreed. "We think it's legal or we wouldn't be doing it," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the changes, McNally was transferred from hearing felony matters to 
presiding over cases involving child neglect and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 As it now stands, California law requires counties to operate with a 
two-tiered judicial system. Municipal Courts oversee relatively minor criminal 
and civil matters, and Superior Courts handle more serious cases. 
</P>
<P>
 McNally claimed that the consolidation is a step toward a single-tiered court 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Although proponents of the plan say it will help make the courts more 
efficient, McNally argued that "our business is not efficiency. Our business is 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to talk efficiency, the most efficient way is a lynch mob with a 
hundred feet of hemp rope," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Municipal Court Presiding Judge John R. Smiley and other jurists who 
designed the plan deny that they are trying to unify the Superior and Municipal 
courts. Instead, they contend they are only cross-assigning judges to give the 
court more flexibility in directing its resources to where they are needed 
most. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the flexibility is needed because of new legislation, such as the 
"three strikes" statute, which requires life sentences for some habitual 
offenders.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, nine judges will begin hearing major civil cases, compared to 
eight before the consolidation, Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every aspect of the courts' operations, with the exception of juvenile 
and family law, will be affected by the consolidation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Gonzalez, the Ventura County courts executive officer, told a noon 
gathering Friday that similar plans have been effective in San Bernardino, 
Napa, Yolo and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these counties are reporting wonderful success stories," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unveiling the changes to a crowded lunchtime meeting of court staff members 
and attorneys, Smiley smiled broadly after explaining the changes, which have 
been under discussion for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very proud of what we have done," he said.

ELECTIONS / AUDITOR-CONTROLLER; OPPONENT SUES TO DISQUALIFY SIMI MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A rival candidate filed a lawsuit Friday challenging Simi Valley Mayor Greg 
Stratton's qualifications to compete in the election for Ventura County 
auditor-controller. 
</P>
<P>
 William Baker, a certified public accountant, filed suit in Ventura County 
Superior Court to disqualify Stratton from running in the June 7 election for 
the job that pays $128,000 in annual salary and benefits. The 
auditor-controller manages the county's $836-million budget and scrutinizes 
spending practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very important position, and I don't want somebody unqualified in this 
position," Baker said after filing the lawsuit. A hearing on the matter is 
scheduled for April 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, who has his own CPA business in Ventura, contends that Stratton does 
not have the accounting experience to legally qualify him for the job. "You 
need to have somebody who has a solid background in accounting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stratton, director of the software department for Teledyne Systems in 
Chatsworth, said he believes his long government experience and his master's 
degree in business administration more than qualify him for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done extensive research on this -- I've talked to attorneys and CPAs 
about this -- and I believe I'm qualified," Stratton said. "Obviously, Mr. 
Baker feels if he wants a real shot at (the controller's job) he's got to get 
Mr. Stratton" out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for the auditor-controller's position, a candidate must either be a 
certified public accountant; have served as county auditor controller or deputy 
auditor for at least three years; or possess a certificate or diploma from a 
school of accountancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there are no schools of accountancy in California, Stratton said he 
believes his master's degree in business administration -- including 10 units 
in accounting -- from Cal Lutheran University qualifies him for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said he believes Stratton lacks the training to deal with complex 
financial matters. "They don't want a career politician in there," he said. 
"They want an accountant." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said he has a bachelor's degree from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 
business administration with an emphasis in accounting, which includes "at 
least 40 units" on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, who has been a licensed CPA since 1989, said he had also worked for the 
county as a financial analyst between 1985 and 1990, including one year in the 
auditor-controller's office. He said his job consisted mostly of performing 
audits. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said he believes the auditor-controller's job is more of a chief 
financial officer, and that "accounting is only part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the world of big chief financial officers, sometimes they're MBA's and 
sometimes they're CPA's," he said. "I think what the county needs is a chief 
financial officer interested in efficiency, and not just accounting." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said he was surprised that Baker filed the suit. "I talked to him 
after I filed (to run) and he strongly suggested that he would be willing to 
support me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said Stratton had called him after the March 12 deadline for candidates 
to file their nomination papers. Baker said Stratton wanted to discuss Baker's 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the one that suggested I back him if I don't make it past the 
primary," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates in the race have also raised questions and threatened similar 
legal action to challenge Stratton's qualifications. They include accountants 
Richard Morrisset of Ventura; Clifford Wigen of Simi Valley; Scott Weiss of 
Ventura; and, incumbent Thomas O. Mahon, who was appointed controller by the 
Board of Supervisors last year after serving 20 years as assistant controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton and Mahon are the only candidates in the race who are not certified 
public accountants. But Mahon meets the legal qualifications for the job 
because of his long experience as deputy auditor-controller.

VENTURA WATER, SEWAGE RATES MAY RISE 7%; UTILITIES: A COUNCIL COMMITTEE 
ENDORSES THE HIKE TO COVER INCREASED OPERATING COSTS AND TO FINANCE FUTURE 
PROJECTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Water and sanitation rates will rise 7% beginning July 1 for the average 
Ventura household, if the tentative recommendation of a Ventura City Council 
committee is approved in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Councilmen Steve Bennett and Jack Tingstrom, members of the city's 
Utilities Committee, approved a staff recommendation to hike sanitation and 
water fees next fiscal year to cover increased operating costs and to pay for 
future water and sewer projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford, who also sits on the three-member committee, was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is scheduled to take a final vote on the increased rates at its 
April 6 meeting. Its recommendation will go before the entire council in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Although rates would go up for water and sewer customers citywide, the biggest 
increases may target industrial and commercial users. City staff recommended 
hiking sanitation rates 12% to 18% for industrial customers. Commercial 
customers may see their sanitation bills jump as much as 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some customers have significantly reduced their (sewage) flow," utilities 
Manager Pam Cosby said. "There's less sewage coming in, but it's more 
concentrated and more costly to treat." 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom and Bennett were not happy with the proposed industrial increases 
and asked city staff to find other options by next month's committee meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're losing businesses because of this kind of operation," Tingstrom 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, however, noted that if industrial users are subsidized, it would be 
at the expense of other customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we lower their rates, someone else's rates will go up," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom and Bennett did not voice any major objections to the proposed 7% 
increase in water rates for commercial and residential users. The average 
family is now billed $75.25 bimonthly for sanitation and water. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff said they are recommending passing on increased operating costs 
from Casitas Municipal Water District and United Water Conservation District to 
consumers. Also, electrical costs have increased, adding to overall operating 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The income from rates would also go toward paying for future projects such as 
replacing reservoirs, drilling new wells and improving water quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The water projects will postpone the need for a desalination plant and save 
residents more money in the long run, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this increase, we're buying more time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a staff report, water rates are expected to rise an average of at 
least 24.5% during the next five years, based on 3.5% annual inflation, and the 
need to continue funding water projects. Sanitation rates are not expected to 
rise substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the council increased basic water rates by 3.5% and restructured 
water rates to give breaks to residents who use as much or slightly more water 
than the average household. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the council raised water and sanitation rates by 17%, making 
Ventura's rates among the highest in the county.

TEACHERS GET LESSONS ON KEEPING PEACE; SCHOOLS: VENTURA HIGH INSTRUCTORS ARE 
TOLD RACIAL TENSIONS HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN INCREASED VIOLENCE ON MANY CAMPUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hoping to put a stop to recent racial fights at Ventura High School, teachers 
at the school spent Friday learning how to help students appreciate racial and 
cultural diversity and to solve disputes peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 The daylong workshop was led by Judith Rubenstein, a Santa Barbara-based 
specialist in conflict-resolution techniques. Rubenstein told the 60 teachers 
that problems at Ventura High are not unique. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost every school in Southern California has experienced an increase in 
violence," she said. "And it is at least partially attributable to a rise in 
racial tensions and the use of racial slurs." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubenstein urged teachers to get involved in settling disputes on campus. To 
be effective, she suggested that an intervening teacher should stay cool and 
help teen-agers sort out why they are angry. 
</P>
<P>
 If the teacher adopts that posture, she said, the instructor will be seen as a 
neutral third party and can often help the two sides work out a mutually 
agreeable resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the next step is to train a corps of Ventura High students to mediate 
conflicts among classmates. About 30 students are scheduled for such mediation 
training next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits of mediation are many, Rubenstein said. Schools that have started 
such programs report declines in their suspension rate, she said. A handful of 
Ventura middle and elementary schools started student-mediation programs 
earlier this school year and they have been largely successful, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ventura's Anacapa Middle School, officials credit student mediators with 
dramatically reducing the number of fights this school year, leading to an 80% 
decline in suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing those results, district administrators decided to bring the 
program to Ventura High School. The district hopes to eventually train student 
mediators at all Ventura's schools, Supt. Joseph Spirito said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the morning session, the teachers broke into groups of 10 and talked 
about various ways they can intervene when disputes erupt in their classrooms. 
In one group session, counselor Bill Tice said teachers should make a point of 
telling students that teachers are offended when they hear a racial slur. 
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers suggested that repeat offenders could be referred for 
cultural-diversity training and the curriculum should include more information 
on the contributions of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Enterline, a biology teacher at Ventura High for 14 years, said it 
will be difficult for teachers to bring about any real change in students' 
attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can deal with the incidents, but we can't solve the problem of racism," 
Enterline said. "You can't change 15 to 18 years of indoctrination at home with 
a conflict-resolution meeting that lasts a half-hour," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Kochel, an English teacher, disagreed with Enterline. "You never know 
what kind of effect you're going to have on someone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Responded Enterline: "I'm not saying we shouldn't try. We should. But we have 
to be realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Spirito sought Rubenstein's help after conflicts between white and black 
students sparked clashes at two Ventura High basketball games earlier this 
year. Four teen-agers described by police as white supremacists were arrested 
during the confrontations. In those incidents, white students taunted the black 
students and made a threat to a black school guard, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Principal Helena Torrez-Reaves said she will sort through all of the 
suggestions made by teachers and issue a report to the school's multicultural 
committee in coming weeks. The school hopes to develop guidelines to help 
teachers mediate disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one teacher was satisfied with the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a lot of things out of it," Sue Andrews said. "I hope we can follow up 
on them."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; THIEF GETS AWAY WITH 3 LITTLE PIGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As their 300-pound mother lay patiently on her side, 10 squealing pink piglets 
nursed in a row Friday with abandon and glee, oblivious of the three siblings 
who had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 The three Yorkshire piglets were stolen from a pen at Westminster High School 
by an unknown thief earlier this week, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say that if the missing piglets, born 11 days ago, aren't 
reunited with their mother soon, they could die. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pigs normally stay with their mother for four weeks before they are weaned," 
teacher Norm Makanishi said. "If they were taken by someone who doesn't know 
what they are doing, they might end up with dead pigs." 
</P>
<P>
 When one of the piglets was gone from the pen Monday morning, Makanishi said 
he thought someone might have been pulling a prank. But then two more piglets 
had disappeared Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would someone take them?" asked Stirling Iverson, a 14-year-old freshman 
who cared for the sow through her 114-day pregnancy as part of a class project 
and now watches over her offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just no reason for it," he said. "You can't get much ham or bacon out 
of them at this point. You probably couldn't get even one strip." 
</P>
<P>
 The pigs were born on the school's five-acre farm where agriculture students 
raise livestock and crops as class projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Stirling said the piglets weigh about five pounds each and grow to more than 
200 pounds before they are auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Stirling's mother, Kathy Iverson, a science teacher at the school, said the 
family had spent several nights at the farm waiting for the mother to give 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are shocked and angry," she said. "All the kids out here are worried 
about the rest of the pigs. I think half of the school has been out here to see 
these piglets." 
</P>
<P>
 Other students in the program expressed their anger over the theft Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's crummy and stooping pretty low to come and steal pigs," said 
17-year-old Robert Evans, who is raising a steer as a class project. 
</P>
<P>
 Makanishi, who has run the school's agriculture department for 16 years, said 
that as a precaution, the pigpen is now enclosed with barbed wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Stirling Iverson, who plans to become a veterinarian, had this plea to the 
pig-naper: "If they are not doing so well, give them back so they can live."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; GROUP SEEKING TO REDEFINE THE CITY'S IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It takes some imagination to see Canoga Park as Bill Brady sees it. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady, an auto repairman, is chairman of Rebuild Canoga Park, a group that 
aims to channel earthquake aid money into creating a new image for the area. 
His vision for Canoga Park is of a popular pedestrian shopping mall and night 
hot spot complete with live theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to bring people back to small towns -- get them out of downtown and 
CityWalk," Brady said. "We need to take these small towns back and and use them 
as they were intended to be used." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuild Canoga Park drew about 30 people at its first meeting earlier this 
month, and has already won the backing of the Canoga Park Chamber of Commerce, 
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick and Rep. Anthony Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 A second meeting is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. April 7 in the Canoga Park 
Community Center, 7248 Owensmouth Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this support though, Brady's plan for redevelopment of the area is 
perched on pillars of optimism miles high. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, in recent years, Canoga Park has been anything but a desirable ZIP 
code.  
</P>
<P>
 The downward slide of the neighborhood has been underscored by a tendency for 
residents on its fringes to secede into other neighborhoods. Such a secession 
created West Hills a few years ago, and the anti-Canoga Park mood lingers to 
this day. In recent weeks, another residents' group at the Winnetka/Canoga Park 
border, eschewed either designation, and opted to try to become part of 
Woodland Hills instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there is the damage left by January's big quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every building in Canoga Park's quaint antique district on Sherman Way 
was rendered useless by the earthquake. Only a few have resumed operations. The 
result has been a devastating blow to an area with few other anchor businesses 
to attract visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brady has no problem looking past the graffiti, the run-down apartments, 
and most recently, the quake-shattered storefronts and rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine," he wrote in a letter to local property owners earlier this month, 
"Sherman Way being lined with two- or three-storied California-Spanish style 
structures with arched facades, the lower level a covered arcade, the second 
level offering patios, all linked by bridges and walkways that would lead to 
expanded city car parks." 
</P>
<P>
 Brady wants to focus on a two-block stretch of Sherman Way between Jordan and 
Alabama avenues. His plan is to meet with individual business owners and win 
their cooperation, apply for grants and foundation money and seek pro bono 
contracts with local architects to put the group's vision for the neighborhood 
on paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The odds may not be favorable, but there is no time like the present, Brady 
argues. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most receptive atmosphere for redevelopment we could have because 
of earthquake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And at least for now, many Canoga Park merchants seem at least willing to see 
what comes of the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be wonderful," said antique dealer Stan Goldman, who has been 
working to try to keep the antique merchants together while their buildings are 
being repaired. "It would be a wonderful thing to do if they can. But it takes 
a lot of money and a lot of planning. I don't know if I'd live to see it." JILL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CORONA DEL MAR; CIVIL WAR EXPERT HAS A DEVOTED FOLLOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Julian Scherer comes from a town in Illinois where you can start a fight by 
publicly disparaging the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Not President Clinton, but Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 Scherer, a 77-year-old retired university professor and Civil War buff, takes 
this partisanship into the weekly verbal shootouts at the OASIS Senior Center 
in Corona del Mar, where he leads about a dozen seniors through detailed and 
sometimes raised-voice discussions of the American Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do not always believe what I say," Scherer said of his seniors-only 
audience. "They are the foremost experts on the Civil War if they can ever 
agree on anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Scherer has led such sessions nearly every week since 1984. He started it as 
an accredited history course at Coastline College, but because the senior 
audience was so devoted, he decided to hold the sessions for free at the OASIS 
Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Scherer began with the discussion of the battle of Pea Ridge, Ark., 
by handing out a sketched map of northern Arkansas and southern Missouri and 
detailing the weather and soil conditions that affected troop movements in 
1862. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the men in the discussion have served in the military and were 
particularly interested in weaponry and siege tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have known Julian a long time," said Janusz Zaleski, a 71-year-old resident 
of Corona del Mar who fought in the Polish army and later under British command 
in World War II. "He is tremendously knowledgeable." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 10 years, he said, the group has discussed the battle of 
Gettysburg, Shiloh, Antietam and the siege of Vicksburg many times, but has yet 
to cover the entire war. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 6,200 battles to choose from," Scherer said, adding that typically 
one major battle requires two to three weeks for discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Props also are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 At his talk about Pea Ridge, Scherer brought a bag of hardtack, a common food 
for soldiers, and a Civil War-era rifle and pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the best I have ever heard," said Richard Preston. "If I had him in 
college, I'd have been a history major instead of an engineer." 
</P>
<P>
 Scherer said his class mushroomed in size in 1990 after the broadcast of Ken 
Burn's 11-hour documentary "The Civil War" on public television. Now that he 
has a captive audience, he keeps them coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't leave," he said, "or we'll talk about them."BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; REFORM PROPOSAL PROMPTS QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members raised questions this week about a series of proposed 
campaign finance reforms intended to close loopholes in Irvine laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The reform proposal, presented Tuesday by the League of Women Voters, will be 
reviewed by city staff members and the city attorney during the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to vote on the proposal in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1977, there has been a $190 limit for individuals contributing to 
candidates in an Irvine council election. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there is no such limit for political action committees and other 
independent groups that spend money to support candidates but have no official 
affiliation with them. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, league officials said, PACs representing city employee 
associations or other groups have been able to legally circumvent the 
contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The league reforms would apply the $190 cap to PACs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Michael Ward questioned whether such a move would give candidates who 
are willing to spend large sums of their own money an advantage over less 
wealthy candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 League officials said they would also like to place limits on the amount 
candidates can donate to their own campaigns but that such a rule would be 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward said he is wary about any major change to Irvine's campaign rules, which 
he described as among the toughest in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwomen Paula Werner and Christina L. Shea said they oppose the part of 
the reform proposal that calls for limiting to $190 the amount that couples 
with joint checking accounts may contribute to a candidate, saying that would 
discriminate against married couples. 
</P>
<P>
 League officials said that clause is designed to prevent candidates from 
pressuring couples into making more than one contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members expressed support for other proposed reforms, including one 
that would prohibit city employees from soliciting campaign contributions from 
people who do business with the city.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; DISTRICT DEFENDS SITE PURCHASING PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials for the Santa Ana Unified School District have defended the process 
of acquiring land for new schools, a procedure which critics have blasted as 
financially irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 An overflow crowd of 100 people packed the trustees' boardroom Tuesday to hear 
an explanation of how the district purchases land. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few weeks, district officials have received numerous questions 
from community members over the cost of two multimillion-dollar properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael G. Vail, the school district's senior director of facilities, disputed 
charges by critics that the district pays too much for school sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "We follow a process established by the state to ensure that real estate 
transactions of a school district are tamper-proof" and at fair market value, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As required by the state, which funds the district's school construction, the 
district does detailed studies of the property as well as investigation of 
similar sites to determine a fair market price. 
</P>
<P>
 Vail emphasized that state officials oversee each stage of a site acquisition 
and review the district's appraisal of properties before a purchase is 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The district followed those steps in the 1990 purchase of a property at Grand 
and Chestnut avenues and paid $18.5 million for the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the site sold for $12.6 million a few months earlier, Vail said the 
price the district paid was fair because of special circumstances that existed 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The original owner of the property needed to sell the property quickly because 
it needed cash and sold it at a low price. 
</P>
<P>
 The new owner increased the value of the property by obtaining city permission 
to develop the property, Vail said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also defended a current proposal to build a "space-saver" school on 11 
acres at the back of the Bristol Market Place. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is planning to spend about $22 million for that site, and state 
officials have given approval for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Vail discounted suggestions by real estate experts that the site appears to be 
worth less than half that amount, saying they probably had not examined the 
site firsthand or done a detailed analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost will also include relocating current tenants and factors apart from 
the cost of the land itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, he pointed out that the $22-million figure was only a rough 
estimate to enable state officials to set a preliminary budget for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, he said, "no one knows what the site is really going to cost." 
</P>
<P>
 The district is now getting three separate appraisals of the property, the 
first of which is expected to be completed within the next few weeks. JON

 Open-space preservation is the top priority in Calabasas' proposed general 
land-use plan -- a blueprint for future development that caps years of citizen 
activism in this newly incorporated city. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft plan, with its heavy emphasis on environmental preservation, 
attempts to address the very grievances that prompted residents here to fight 
for cityhood and local control in the late 1980s when Los Angeles County 
approved several large, controversial developments in the pristine hills of the 
Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The activists won that battle in 1991 when the city incorporated, and the 
draft general plan is the first broad statement of what their hard-won local 
control will mean for future growth in Calabasas, said Steven Harris, Calabasas 
director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft plan is more than 250 pages long and addresses everything from 
housing to energy management to disaster response. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the plan, a single message is clear: protecting the local 
environment and maintaining Calabasas' character as a semirural, bedroom 
community take priority over new development. 
</P>
<P>
 Bicycle paths, telecommuting, water conservation and recycling are all 
featured prominently in the plan, prepared by the Rancho Cucamonga-based 
planning firm, Planning Network. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft plan emphasizes that proposed buildings in town should not be 
evaluated as free-standing features, but as integrated parts of the whole 
community. Preserving of oak groves, ridges and hillsides, encouraging 
development of a pedestrian-oriented town center, and tailoring architecture to 
foster social interaction would be key considerations in approving new 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan depicts a future Calabasas that is not drastically more populated 
than the city is today. It estimates a target population for the city of 
31,800. Calabasas now has about 26,580 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The projected population, based on calculations of desired densities on the 
remaining land in town to be developed, leaves little room for growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Although nearly two-thirds of the city's land remains undeveloped, including 
many of the steep hillsides and oak groves, there are several large 
developments, including 3,000 proposed new homes, that have already received 
county approval, Harris said.  
</P>
<P>
 That leaves little room for new growth to be regulated by the general plan, 
Harris said. So, Calabasas officials are hoping the economic slump will prompt 
some of those with projects in the works to allow their county permits to 
expire, and start their permit process over with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed plan is scheduled to be reviewed over the next few months in a 
series of public hearings before the city Planning Commission and City Council. 
Harris estimates a final version will be approved early this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The next scheduled hearing before the Planning Commission is at 7:30 p.m. 
April 7 at City Hall, 26135 Mureau Road. JILL LEOVY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA; ANNUAL NATIVE PLANT SALE THIS WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of the Las Virgenes area can get free information about 
drought-busting plants and soil erosion this weekend at a native plant sale 
sponsored by the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource Conservation District. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the annual event is to spread the word that species native to 
desert climates are appropriate in this region, while thirsty plants that 
thrive in wetter zones are not. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in an area where we need to conserve water," said Melanie Beck, the 
district's assistant executive officer. "Rather than planting monkey 
philodendron or some other tropical plant, we want to encourage people to 
landscape with plants that use less water and fit in with the chaparral." 
</P>
<P>
 The Topanga-based district, a state agency set up to promote conservation 
efforts and education, will sell native plants and offer free consulting today 
and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at its headquarters, 122 N. Topanga Canyon 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,700 plants representing more than 200 species gathered from nurseries 
throughout Southern California will be offered at near cost, Beck said. Most 
plants will be sold in one-gallon containers and will cost $5, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the more popular plants include varieties of ceanothus, a dark green 
shrub with brilliant blue or purple spring blossoms, and manzanita, a ground 
cover or bush with pale green leaves and twisting red branches. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of native plants started about 10 years ago and has grown during the 
past several years because of the drought of the late 1980s and early 1990s, 
said Elizabeth Douphner, district executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts will be on hand to discuss landscaping possibilities, Douphner said, 
and the district will provide pamphlets about wildlife, erosion control and 
fire and flood prevention. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; RESIDENTIAL PARKING NEAR CSUN BANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Temporary parking privileges after the Northridge earthquake have been 
rescinded along two stretches of city streets near the Cal State Northridge 
campus because of safety concerns and complaints from some residents about rude 
student behavior, university officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking is no longer available on the north side of Superior Street between 
Lindley and Nestle avenues and on Halsted Street between Lindley and Etiwanda 
avenues, according to CSUN Police Lt. Michael Sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 The university last week asked the city of Los Angeles to suspend parking 
along Superior after a number of homeowners complained that some students had 
hemmed in their driveways, littered the streets or trampled their lawns. In one 
instance, a student's car blocked the exit of a gated circular driveway 
designed for a van specially equipped to carry disabled children, Sugar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It created enough of a disturbance in that particular neighborhood that we 
felt that the appropriate measure would be to remove the parking privilege," 
Sugar said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Halsted, officials abolished parking out of safety concerns because of 
buses traveling along the side of the road and the lack of sidewalks for 
students parking their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge temblor, the city eased parking restrictions on 25 
streets around CSUN, which lost 2,500 spaces with the spectacular collapse of a 
campus parking structure. Sugar said the city had agreed to waive the 
restrictions until the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few months, the university has worked to restore the 9,200 
parking spaces it had before the quake, securing about 7,600 by Feb. 14, when 
the campus finally reopened for the spring semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, CSUN hopes to pave a lot on the northern end of campus to create 
2,500 more spaces, pushing the total higher than what existed before, 
university spokesman Bruce Erickson said. HENRY CHU

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; DONATIONS HELP SAVE WOMAN'S CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With financial help from other women's clubs, members of the Van Nuys Woman's 
Club are back in action at their quake-damaged Van Nuys clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to stay here," said club President Neva Hines, 71, who feared 
repair bills would force members to leave their long-time Sylvan Street 
clubhouse. "What they have done is marvelous." 
</P>
<P>
 Two $1,000 donations from the Westlake Woman's Club and the San Fernando 
Woman's Club, a $2,000 donation from the California Federation of Woman's Clubs 
and a $15,000 short-term loan from a son of one of the club members will pay 
for repairs to the historic clubhouse. Club members also sold about $1,000 
worth of cookie recipe books. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake badly damaged the interior walls and fireplace of 
the 77-year-old building, which was named a city of Los Angeles 
historical-cultural monument in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Repair costs hit $30,050 without a word of help from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, to which the club had applied. After depleting the club's 
bank accounts, the 56 members were still about $2,000 short, forcing Hines to 
consider selling the property to keep the club solvent. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the telephone started ringing. Offers of aid came pouring in, 
restoring hope that monthly garden section meetings, card games, Bible readings 
and fund-raising meetings could again be held at the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday, the group had paid for enough repairs to safely hold their first 
post-earthquake meeting. Hines was reelected president because of her work 
preserving the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen the whole group so happy," said 85-year-old Dorothea M. Neel, 
a former club president who attended a luncheon Wednesday at the clubhouse. 
"We're home again." 
</P>
<P>
 There is still work to be done, however. The club needs a renter to replace 
the city of Los Angeles Planning Department, which left the clubhouse after the 
earthquake. The department had been paying $750 a month to conduct its hearings 
in the clubhouse auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 But the club's members, many of whom are in their 70s, say they are up to the 
challenge of finding a new tenant -- especially after surviving the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we took on a new attitude of togetherness," Neel said. "We're all 
very proud of what we have done to preserve our future." JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; DOCTOR WHO WAS SHOT TO RETURN HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN and SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The doctor who was shot outside his North Hollywood home in an apparent 
robbery attempt said Friday that he expects to return home today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm in pretty good condition, all things considered," Paul Hackmeyer, 
41, said from his hospital bed at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackmeyer was shot Sunday morning just minutes after he returned home from 
helping deliver a baby boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish all I'd have to do is move from Addison Street, move from North 
Hollywood, move from California, but I don't think life is that simple," he 
said. "I'm more saddened by the whole thing . . . It saddens me that society 
has deteriorated to such an extent that someone would try to take my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Well-wishers have sent hundreds of cards, calls and bouquets to Hackmeyer, who 
is clinical chief of obstetrics at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor's colleagues have created two funds to help his family cope with 
financial hardships since the Jan. 17 earthquake left the Hackmeyers' house in 
Sherman Oaks with considerable damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hackmeyers are living in a rented North Hollywood house until repairs are 
finished on their residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackmeyer said he had just pulled into his driveway early Sunday morning and 
was locking the gate in front of his house when he noticed two men. He heard 
someone shout, "Don't run!" before he was shot three times in his arm, leg and 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no new leads in the case. VIVIEN LOU CHEN and SCOTT HARRIS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; STATE SENATE LEADER TO ADDRESS BAR ASSN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California Senate majority leader Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) will give the 
keynote address tonight at the Hispanic Bar Assn. of Orange County's annual 
awards banquet, held to honor Latino community leaders for their advocacy work, 
raise money for aspiring Latino lawyers and welcome the group's incoming 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez will be honored for his role in 
pushing for the appointment of Latino attorneys to judicial positions, most 
notably for his recent role in the appointment of Municipal Judge Luis 
Rodriguez, incoming Bar President Ruben A. Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Palacio, an activist with the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Education Fund, will receive the first Cesar Chavez Community Service Award, to 
be granted yearly to people who emulate the ideals of Chavez's work on behalf 
of agricultural workers, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the proceeds from the event will be donated to the newly formed 
Hispanic Education Endowment Fund, which is headed by Vasquez and former 
baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth and is part of the Orange County 
Community Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino groups countywide have raised more than $100,000 for the fund over the 
past three months and hope to to raise $1 million during the next three years. 
At that time, interest from the fund will be used for educational scholarships, 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The legal community throughout the state has not been representative of the 
population," Smith said. "We as a bar association have made that a goal, to be 
mentors to more kids and help them in terms of their careers as lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 The awards banquet begins at 6 p.m. at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim and 
includes cocktails, dinner and dancing. It is open to the public, with a 
requested donation of $55. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets can be purchased at the door. LEE ROMNEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; TOUR WILL TAKE IN THE GARDEN SPOTS 
</P>

<P>
 A rose garden, a patio planted with tropical species and a drought-resistant 
landscape are among the horticultural displays that will be featured in the 
10th annual Open Gardens tour Sunday, sponsored by Fullerton Beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-guided tour will take in seven gardens, most planted by amateurs, and 
offer a chance for gardening buffs to compare notes on techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the homeowners love to talk about their gardens," said Louise Hyneman, 
tour chairwoman. The sights will range from landscaped estates to small organic 
gardens dedicated to vegetables and flowers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Beautiful is a nonprofit group dedicated to beautifying the city. 
Organizers hope to introduce participants to native species that require little 
water and to inspire people to experiment with new species and designs in their 
own yards. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the gardens on the tour spans two-thirds of an acre and has a cactus 
garden and fish ponds. It also makes use of the drought-resistant ceanothus 
shrub, which sports blue blooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really pretty, and it's so hardy," Hyneman said of ceanothus, a member 
of the lilac family. 
</P>
<P>
 Also featured on the tour will be a rose garden with more than 300 rose plants 
of 250 varieties, including the white French Lace, the multicolored Double 
Delight and the pink Royal Highness. 
</P>
<P>
 The only spot on the tour that was professionally designed is an estate 
planted with roses and palm, loquat, avocado, guava and pomegranate trees, 
among other species. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's tour attracted 400 to 600 people, organizers said. The group hopes 
for a similar turnout this year, they said, adding that the tour will go on 
unless there is a downpour. 
</P>
<P>
 Maps to the homes will be available Sunday morning at the farm building owned 
by Fullerton High School, at the southeast corner of Lemon Street and Berkeley 
Avenue. Touring hours are 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.; a $1 donation is suggested.MARY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; POLICE OFFER CLASSES ON LAW ENFORCEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents who want to know more about law enforcement now have a chance to 
meet Police Department employees and learn how they fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buena Park Police Department is launching a Citizen Police Academy next 
month for residents and people who work in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose is to let people know what we do, what police work is all about," 
said police spokesman Sgt. Robert R. Chaney Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The first session begins April 6 and will be held on Wednesdays for 10 weeks 
from 7 to 10 p.m. in the training room of the Police Department, 6650 Beach 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy, offered at no charge, is not designed to prepare people to become 
police officers but is intended to heighten understanding and awareness about 
the Police Department, said Police Chief Richard M. Tefank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important that the community understand what the Police 
Department does on a day-to-day basis and who the people are who provide the 
service to them," Tefank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaney said often people know police work only from what they watch on 
television. "But there are a lot of things that go on that people aren't aware 
of," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, the academy will help the Police Department get a better 
understanding of how residents feel about police, Chaney said. The exchange 
will assist the department in making improvements to enhance public safety and 
service, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaney said the department will offer three academy sessions a year. Each 
10-week session will be limited to 30 participants, 21 years and older. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis. The second 
session is scheduled to start in September. 
</P>
<P>
 For security reasons, participants will be fingerprinted and must agree to a 
background check. Those with outstanding warrants or pending court cases are 
not eligible for the academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Academy teachers will be personnel from the department, including patrol 
officers, detectives and dispatchers. Among areas that will be discussed are 
narcotics, traffic patrol, dispatch operations, weapons used by police, crime 
lab, SWAT and K-9 teams. Participants will also go on a ride-along with 
officers. 
</P>
<P>

community relations bureau at (714) 562-3993.DEBRA CANO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; TEDDY BEARS HELP POLICE CALM CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A teddy bear can soothe many fears and speak many languages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children need to hold onto something to make them feel safe and secure," said 
Burbank Police Sgt. Bob Brode, who keeps a box full of teddy bears tucked away 
in a corner of the juvenile division. 
</P>
<P>
 Brode pulls one out when a small child who must be interviewed comes in after 
being abused, witnessing a crime or having some other frightening experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The child may not speak English, but police often connect with the child 
because of the bear, Brode said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take away the pain, but it does help them to refocus on 
themselves," he said. "It shows them that we are not always the bad guys." 
</P>
<P>
 About six or seven bears are given to children each month, Brode said. They 
are donated by civic organizations -- such as the Burbank Emblem Club, which 
recently donated about 75 teddy bears.  
</P>
<P>
 Many are handmade by the Telephone Pioneers of America in Glendale, which 
distributes what they call "Hug-A-Bears" to the Burbank and Glendale Police, 
the Crescenta Valley Sheriff's office and the juvenile court system. 
</P>
<P>
 The stuffed animals come in especially handy, Brode said, when both parents of 
a child have been arrested. The police officer may take the child aside and use 
the bear as a distraction, so that they do not have to watch as their parents 
are handcuffed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to let them know that their whole world has not been destroyed," 
Brode said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brode recalled a case in which two family members were killed in a double 
homicide. Juvenile officers used the bears to help ease the trauma as police 
questioned children about the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, a 3-year-old boy who had wandered away from home spent a couple of 
hours at the Burbank police station playing with a teddy bear on top of a desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a good little boy," said Officer Kitty McDonald, who brought the boy 
into the station after he was found by a resident. His mother later claimed 
him, after she came home to find out from a baby-sitter that he was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald said the teddy bears are especially useful when beginning an 
interview with a small child. "It helps to break the ice and let them relax a 
little bit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A basket in Brode's office is full of other stuffed animals that came from a 
special donor -- his 19-year-old daughter, Heather, who has cystic fibrosis and 
has been in and out of hospitals for most of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've probably given her 100 stuffed animals over the last 19 years," said 
Brode, who would buy her the animals when he made hospital visits. "Her bedroom 
is stuffed with them." ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: MISSION HILLS; BERMAN MOVES OUT OF POLICE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Howard Berman has been freed from the San Fernando police station. 
</P>
<P>
 No criminal charges. No trial. No new lease on life. Just a lease for a new 
office in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The interim office in the old police station has been the congressman's San 
Fernando Valley headquarters since his Panorama City office was condemned 
because of damage from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Free at last from the old jail," Berman quipped Friday during his first day 
at the new office, Suite 130, 10200 Sepulveda Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman had not sat down in his fifth-story Panorama City office since the 
Roscoe Boulevard building was condemned after the quake. His staff managed to 
enter the building to retrieve constituents' files and computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last two months, the congressman and his staff of seven operated 
out of the old police station along with lawyers from the district attorney's 
office and Superior Court judges' staff. Many of the temporary inhabitants 
stored their files in jail cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman said his staff is up and running at the new Mission Hills location. He 
thanked the city of San Fernando for its hospitality, but could not contain a 
sigh of relief at being in his own office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was grateful for the use, but it's a little bit easier to conduct business 
here," Berman said. "What I really want is my constituents to know as soon as 
possible that we have a new office and it's open." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman said his office is providing the same services it did before the 
earthquake. In fact, it is doing more than ever by helping constituents fill 
out applications for Federal Emergency Management Agency aid.  
</P>
<P>
 Berman's San Fernando Valley field office telephone numbers remain 891-0543 
and 764-1206. 
</P>
<P>
 And although he still represents the 26th Congressional District, including 
Panorama City and much of the eastern San Fernando Valley, he is no longer 
Congressman Howard L. Berman, (D-Panorama City). 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess now I'm a Democrat from Mission Hills," he said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; PLAZA SWAP MEET TO HOLD OPEN HOUSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fiesta Plaza swap meet in Pacoima will hold an open house April 7 to 
welcome two community organizations now working out of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will introduce the Northeast Valley Health Corp.'s Substance Abuse 
Division, and Woman, Infant and Children (WIC), a nutrition program.Both moved 
into the plaza at 12800 Foothill Blvd. on March 1, spokesman Joe Ortiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Steve Brown, who has owned the 60,000-square-foot plaza for two 
years, actively recruited government and social service organizations to move 
into the plaza last year as part of his one-stop shopping plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of Brown's plan is to lure shoppers into the plaza by making it a 
center for social services. Brown has invested more than $1 million in the 
struggling plaza, and much of its space is still unoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also is trying to persuade English as a Second Language centers, food 
stamp and employment offices to lease space in the plaza, which he says he 
wants to turn into the "Olvera Street of the San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon and a host of community leaders are expected to 
attend the April 7 event, scheduled from 10 a.m. to noon, Ortiz said. MIGUEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA YORBA LINDA; SCHOOL DISTRICT, UNION REACH PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District and the California School 
Employees Assn. Chapter 293 this week reached a contract agreement following 
two years of often bitter negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 But negotiations on a new contract may be only a few months away. 
</P>
<P>
 An offer by the district was recently upheld in an arbitration process, but 
district officials conceded several points to get the union to accept the 
two-year pact. 
</P>
<P>
 The district agreed to continue paying salary "steps," which increase 
employees' salaries based on years of service, raise mileage reimbursements to 
29 cents a mile, increase meal reimbursements for bus drivers and adopt the 
federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid 
leave for a variety of family-related reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract does not include a cost-of-living increase, and it does not allow 
the union to reopen negotiations if the district's financial situation 
improves. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Tim Van Eck said he was pleased to end the negotiation 
process, which included picketing by union employees. Because the contract 
expires at the end of this school year on June 30, the district and the union 
will likely start the process over again. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; ANTI-YOUTH-VIOLENCE MEASURES PROMISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of a recent drive-by shooting attempt, the City Council promised 
this week to take strong measures to help curb gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special meeting that played out like a community discussion, with several 
audience members stepping forward to express their frustration over youth 
violence, the council agreed to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Distribute information containing anti-gang hot-line numbers to children and 
parents at local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make serious efforts to open a youth recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increase participation in the Neighborhood Watch program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask young people about their needs at an informal discussion meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assist the Green Ribbon anti-youth-violence program with funding and other 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gather support from Orange County cities to pressure the state Legislature 
for tougher laws against crime by youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years ago, we thought this problem was all in Santa Ana and Garden 
Grove," Councilman Tim Link said. "We've been very spoiled in not having to 
deal with (youth violence). But now it's here." 
</P>
<P>
 Still shocked and angry over an incident last week in which several shots were 
fired by teen-agers in a passing car, several Tama Lane residents at the 
meeting agreed that gangs had found their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 They described daily gatherings of up to 15 teen-age boys in front of houses 
on their blocks, telling the council that residents felt like prisoners in 
their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Green Ribbon campaign founder Karen Lott, whose son was wounded in a Lake 
Forest drive-by shooting last year, offered her support to the Tama Road 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is any more important issue at hand than the safety of 
our children," Lott said. "We've got to admit we have a problem. We hear a lot 
of talk about gang members coming from out of town, but people need to realize 
that it's our own kids" committing acts of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Tama Lane residents urged the council to take direct action to ease problems 
in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the drive-by shooting was a random act, but assured 
residents that sheriff's deputies would break up any large groups of teen-agers 
gathering in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Robert Nesmith said investigators were following 
leads on youths in the car from which several shots were fired, missing two 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, deputies still don't have a full description of those involved, 
Nesmith said. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; PARADE TO CELEBRATE SWALLOWS, ROMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Romance of San Juan Capistrano" will be the theme of the 36th annual 
Fiesta de las Golondrinas Parade today, but "bigger and better" also will 
describe this year's celebration of the swallows, say parade organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 With the naming of Teeter Romero, a lifelong resident of San Juan Capistrano 
and a member of the Juaneno Native American tribe, as parade grand marshal, 
organizers say the tribe will be turning out in large numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be 214 entries in the parade, the largest number of participants in 
the 36-year history of the country's biggest non-motorized parade, parade 
Chairman Mike Rosenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen marching bands will be joining the vast collection of horses, 
vaqueros, wagons and carts, also a parade record. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade starts at 11 a.m. and runs along Camino Capistrano from Del Obispo 
Street, past the Mission San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade turns at La Zanja Street and heads back along El Camino Real to 
Ortega Highway and splits off a final time on Del Obispo Street, heading back 
to Camino Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking can be difficult to find near parade time, so those planning to attend 
should go early, parade organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 People who show up before the parade can attend the Mercado, the street fair 
that is also an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mercado is held in front of the Mission San Juan Capistrano on Ortega 
Highway and runs from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be several food and crafts booths, many featuring Old West-style 
art. The Mercado food booths are known for serving barbecue beef and tri-tip 
sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 Live country-Western music will be played from a large truck bed, and people 
will be able to line dance on the streets of San Juan Capistrano near the 
mission.FRANK MESSINA

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; DISTRICT OKS SHOWING CANCELED AIDS PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A play on AIDS awareness for high school students that was canceled by the 
Glendale Unified School District last month will be performed April 6 at 
Burbank High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The play has been reviewed by Burbank Unified School District officials and a 
special video screening of the play was offered to parents last month. So far, 
only five parents have objected to the play, filing a form with the school 
excusing their children from the performance of "Secrets," a play produced by 
the Oakland-based Kaiser Permanante hospital care organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did have one recommendation from a parent group (the Burbank High PTA) 
that one scene be removed," said Caroline Brumm, acting principal at Burbank 
High.  
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser Permanante agreed to remove that scene, which was so humorous in nature 
that Brumm said it distracted from the serious issue of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so funny that it was hard to get the audience back," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Canady, the Burbank school district's director of curriculum 
instruction, said the play has already been performed twice at John Burroughs 
High School and has been shown at Burbank High in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale school district officials said they canceled the play because it 
conflicted with their policy. The play was later performed at a local library 
and the Glendale school board is scheduled to consider a new set of guidelines 
Tuesday. Those new guidelines may be the basis for reconsidering whether to 
allow the play to be performed at Hoover High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Brumm said parents have until March 31 to file a form with the school saying 
that they will not allow their children to attend the performance. State law 
prohibits schools from forcing parents to send children to presentations 
involving sex education, Brumm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Canady said parents are allowed to review all materials involving sex 
education for their children twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-minute performance is the story of a high school senior, Eddie, and his 
girlfriend, Monica. Eddie learns he has become HIV-positive from sharing an 
intravenous needle. But even before that discovery, his girlfriend has already 
has told her friends that she does not plan to have sex with Eddie. 
</P>
<P>
 The play has been shown to 700,000 high school students in Southern California 
during the past eight years. ED BOND

SLOW REPORT KEEPS NOLAN FREE AN EXTRA WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) has an extra week of freedom before 
reporting to prison for his 33-month sentence on political corruption charges, 
thanks to a paperwork delay at the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. attorney's office spokeswoman Linda Wodarski said Friday that federal 
prison officials failed to complete Nolan's probation report in time for him to 
begin serving his sentence on Monday, the date ordered by U.S. District Judge 
Edward J. Garcia in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's anything for the U.S. attorney's office to be alarmed 
about," said Wodarski. "The paperwork just didn't happen in time." 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan, 43, pleaded guilty in February to one count of racketeering after a 
six-year legal battle with federal authorities investigating influence-peddling 
in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Nolan had accepted two checks totaling $10,000 from an undercover FBI 
agent in a transaction that was secretly captured on videotape and audio 
recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nolan faced six counts in a federal grand jury indictment, he agreed 
to plead guilty to just one, admitting in court that he used his office "as a 
racketeering enterprise" to extort campaign contributions from those who sought 
legislative favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan could not be reached for comment Friday, but was said by a family friend 
to be relieved he could spend Easter with his wife, Gail, and three small 
children before reporting to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 He is now scheduled to turn himself in April 4.

STORM FRONT EXITS SOGGY SOUTHLAND; WEATHER: LAGUNA BEACH WAS SPARED MAJOR 
DAMAGE. THERE IS STILL A CHANCE OF SCATTERED SHOWERS TODAY.

 Leaving Southern California damp but largely undamaged, a powerful Alaskan 
storm departed for Arizona on Friday after dumping up to 1 1/3 inches of rain 
in the coastal valleys and more than a foot of snow at some resort areas in the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The chances of more rainstorms for today are decreasing, although there is 
still a chance of scattered showers, according to Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist 
for WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite repeated warnings from the National Weather Service about possible 
mudslides in areas stripped bare during last fall's destructive wildfires, most 
of the storm runoff was contained. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm dumped 0.87 inches of rain in Laguna Beach, but the city was spared 
any major damage, firefighter Knox Tiernan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mud and water closed three lanes of Laguna Canyon Road for about three hours 
Thursday night. Mud up to two feet deep also surrounded Canyon Auto on Laguna 
Canyon Road, but did not do any damage inside the business, Tiernan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Beach, sandbags, hay bales and concrete highway "K-rail" barriers 
set up along flood-prone hillsides and neighborhoods did their job for the most 
part and held back mud and water, Tiernan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, firefighters kept a 24-hour watch Friday in an emergency command 
post off Laguna Canyon Road at Canyon Acres Drive, tracking the progress of a 
second storm system on a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 City public works crews, emergency personnel and equipment were stationed in 
flood-prone areas, and county workers were on standby, waiting for more rain, 
Tiernan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiernan said the emergency center would likely stay open until the National 
Weather Service says the weather front has passed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, approximately 600 PacBell customers lost service throughout the 
day when water from the storm poured into a cable splice box near the 
intersection of Bristol Street and Sunflower Avenue.

MAN HELD AFTER DEATH OF BABY BOY 
</P>

<P>
 A 22-month-old boy died Friday at Hoag Hospital, where he had been admitted 
with injuries for the second time in a weeks. His mother's boyfriend was 
arrested, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Laudenback, 32, of Newport Beach was booked on suspicion of corporal 
punishment or injury to a child, according to Sgt. Andy Gonis, and held on 
$10,000 bail. More serious charges may be filed following an autopsy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The child, Tyler Jaeger, had been admitted to Hoag Hospital March 18 with a 
fractured skull, according to Gonis. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials were told at the time that the infant's head injury was 
caused by an accidental fall, Gonis said, and because the injuries were 
consistent with such an injury, the baby was released two days later to the 
custody of his mother, Karey Jaeger. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby was returned to the Hoag emergency room at 10.45 a.m. Friday by 
Laudenback, but could not be revived and was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of bruising on the child, police were called and both Laudenback and 
Jaeger, who live together, were questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Karey Jaeger was released without charge, Gonis said.

SKULL BEING EXAMINED BY CORONER

<P>
 A human skull that was discovered last weekend near Aliso Creek is being 
examined by the coroner's office to determine if it is part of other bones 
found in the area in the past, sheriff's officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since February, 1993, passersby have discovered human bones in the area on 
three separate occasions.The remains found previously include what is believed 
to be a left thigh, a shoulder blade, a leg bone, and a foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes it four times that someone has found human bone material," said 
Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini. "All the bones have been found in close proximity, 
but whether or not they belong to the same person, we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest discovery was made on Saturday by a boy who was riding his bike in 
the area north of Via Lomas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went home and told his mother, she contacted us and led us back to the 
area," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forensics tests will be conducted by the coroner's office to try to determine 
the age and sex of the skull, which showed no signs of trauma, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department is also planning to conduct an extensive search of 
the area to look for more clues or any additional remains, Martini said.

 The City Council has approved variances allowing construction of a church on 
Pomona Street but has warned its owners that the church will be closed if 
parking in the immediate area became a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 6 to 1 this week to approve several variances required for 
the project at 112 E. Pomona St. Councilwoman Patricia McGuigan opposed the 
motion, saying that when the council previously approved similar plans for a 
church, the building led to parking and traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The variances were required in part because the site has several dozen fewer 
parking spaces than city regulations require. Although the council approved the 
plan, members emphasized that church officials must ensure that nearby 
residents do not suffer a parking crunch because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert L. Richardson told church supporters "to recognize that 
we're trying to fit more on the site than should legally be allowed. I hope you 
will take to heart very seriously the (council's concerns) . . . and follow 
through on your part of the bargain."

NEW FRIENDS TAKE $20,000 FROM TRUSTING WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Valencia woman left her purse containing $20,000 in the care of a couple she 
had just met, who promptly vanished with it, Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanca Califato, 34, told deputies that she was shopping in a K mart in 
Valencia on Friday, carrying a large amount of cash in her purse because she 
was planning to buy cars for her husband's San Fernando Valley auto-repair 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
 She struck up a conversation with a man, who offered to help carry her 
purchases to her car, where they were joined by the man's female companion. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, both Latinos, spoke to Califato in Spanish, the man saying he was 
new to the United States and lonely. The man is about 5-foot-6 with black hair 
and brown eyes, deputies said, and the woman, who also has black hair and brown 
eyes, weighs about 130 pounds and appeared to be in her mid-30s. 
</P>
<P>
 They joined Califato at a nearby McDonald's, where the other woman offered to 
watch Califato's purse while she used the restroom. When Califato returned, the 
couple had fled with the purse. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no indication that this was a stalking crime," said Sgt. Rick Doan 
of the Santa Clarita Sheriff's Station.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are all scratching our heads around here," Doan said. "Why would you trust 
someone with $20,000? I don't know. She just said they looked trustworthy."

HUNTINGTON BEACH TEEN WHO KILLED FRIEND SENTENCED TO 20 YEARS TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Huntington Beach teen-ager was sentenced Friday to 20 years to life in 
prison for shooting his 14-year-old friend between the eyes, tying a plastic 
bag around the youth's head and then dumping the body in a trash bin. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Richard Villa, 19, was convicted last month of second-degree murder for 
the Dec. 26, 1992, slaying of Nicholas Smith, described by his friends as a 
"gentle giant" who looked older than his age since he stood over six feet tall 
and weighed more than 200 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Jean M. Rheinheimer sentenced Villa to the 
maximum prison term after listening to an emotional plea from Smith's mother, 
Linda, who said her life has been shattered since losing her son one day after 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances of Smith's murder remain somewhat of a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa was 18 and worked as an unarmed security guard in Anaheim at the time of 
the shooting. He originally told police that Smith died during a game of 
Russian roulette. 
</P>
<P>
 But Villa, who was smaller in stature than his younger friend, also told 
police that he grabbed a gun after Smith broke into his home and refused to 
leave, according to the sentencing report. Villa said he believed Smith was 
lunging at him when he shot the teen-ager between the eyes, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa told authorities he could not recall how he managed to move Smith's body 
from his Huntington Beach home to a Santa Ana trash bin where the corpse was 
discovered by a sanitation worker. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the sentencing report prepared by the Orange County Probation 
Department, however, there were rumors that Villa paid Smith several hundred 
dollars for weapons that were never delivered.

COUNTY GETS $1.2-MILLION AIDS GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County has received a $1.2-million federal grant earmarked for services 
to people with AIDS, including home health care and services for women and 
African Americans, the head of the county HIV Planning Advisory Council said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala announced the awards 
on Thursday. They totaled $322.6 million nationwide; of that, $160 million went 
to 34 cities and counties hardest hit by acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
Orange County last May reported 2,725 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can always use more, but I think that what we've done is made plans to 
put the money to use in the best way possible and make sure that it's used in 
the most cost-effective manner," said Pearl Jemison-Smith, chairwoman of the 
40-member HIV Planning Advisory Council. HIV is the human immunodeficiency 
virus, which causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds stem from the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act 
of 1990, named after the youth whose struggle with AIDS discrimination captured 
national attention. In December, 34 cities and counties were granted money 
based on their numbers of AIDS cases; Orange County received $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County became eligible for the program in 1992, when it recorded its 
2,000th AIDS case. The Board of Supervisors set up the HIV Planning Advisory 
Council to advise the county health officer on HIV and AIDS issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has started to reach out to Latinos and to inform people with AIDS 
of available services, Jemison-Smith said. The new money will be used to start 
a similar program for African Americans. A portion of it will go toward a 
contract with UC Irvine for primary care services for all AIDS patients and 
gynecological services for women. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is seeing more Latinos, African Americans, women and intravenous 
drug users with the disease, she said, and the grant should help to serve those 
people better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely are looking at where the needs are and trying to be culturally 
sensitive and gender sensitive," she said. "It is changing. It continues to be 
a disease affecting gay men, although we're seeing more gay men of color. We're 
certainly seeing more Latinos." 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla Munro, executive director of the AIDS Service Foundation of Orange 
County, said the Ryan White money is crucial to the county's services for 
people with AIDS. Munro's agency is the single largest recipient in the county 
of the Ryan White funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency will receive $100,000 of the $1.2 million awarded Thursday, and 
that money will go toward home care for people with AIDS, Munro said.

POLICE ARREST MAN IN 20 AREA BURGLARIES 
</P>

<P>
 After two days of surveillance, Orange County sheriff's undercover deputies 
arrested an armed, 23-year-old salesman Thursday suspected of 20 area 
burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Duncan Gaw was arrested on suspicion of residential burglary as he crawled 
out of an unoccupied house, according to deputies contracted to patrol Lake 
Forest.Gaw is being held in the Orange County Jail on $250,000 bail, Lt. Dan 
Martini said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, police said Gaw was observed at a house on Via Del Rio, leaving 
after someone answered the door. Gaw then went to a house on Camino Villa and, 
when there was no answer, climbed through a window on the side of the house, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Gaw spotted the undercover deputies outside the house and left the 
residence. As Gaw approached his car, he was taken into custody, and police 
found he had a loaded semiautomatic pistol.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; GROUPS DEBATE CLINTON HEALTH PLAN; POLITICS: CHRISTIAN 
COALITION IN STUDIO CITY CALLS PROPOSAL ANTI-FAMILY. CLERGY NETWORK LUNCHEON IN 
RESEDA SAYS 'EVERYBODY SHOULD BE COVERED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Religious groups are lining up on both sides of the fight over President 
Clinton's health plan, with supporters and opponents both holding events in the 
San Fernando Valley recently. 
</P>
<P>
 How much difference they'll make is as imponderable as what legislation might 
land eventually on President Clinton's desk. But it won't be for lack of 
trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal bodies are calling for support of the Administration proposals and 
conservatives oppose any move to provide abortions or other facets they view as 
anti-family, with the Catholics straddling both camps. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian Coalition, the conservative political action movement founded by 
religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, brought Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of 
Texas and other speakers to the Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City last Saturday 
to lambast Clinton's health care plans as socialized medicine and anti-family. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which organizers said 500 people attended, was one of five held 
nationwide as part of the Christian Coalition's $1.4-million publicity 
campaign, which includes mailing postcards to 60,000 churches in hopes of 
getting them to write to members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the ideological aisle, Scott Anderson, associate director of the 
Sacramento-based California Council of Churches, told nearly 70 people 
attending the Clergy Network luncheon March 16 in Reseda that a broad coalition 
of Protestant, Episcopal, Unitarian and Jewish groups support the principle 
that "everybody should be covered" by any federal health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anderson plans to come back and help congregations to run workshops to 
acquaint members with the health care issues," said Barry Smedberg, executive 
director of the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council, which co-sponsored the 
recent luncheon. The three-hour training session in the Valley will be held 
April 30, but no location has been selected, Smedberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 55-million-member Catholic Church, the nation's largest nonprofit provider 
of health care through a large network of hospitals, stands in some ways 
between the two largely Protestant poles -- saying "yes" to universal coverage 
and "no" to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the essence of a letter earlier this month from Los Angeles Cardinal 
Roger M. Mahony, who chairs the U.S. bishops' committee for pro-life 
activities, joined by Archbishop William H. Keeler, president of the Catholic 
bishops, and Baltimore Auxiliary Bishop John Riccard, chairman of the committee 
on domestic social policy. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a Catholic spokesman has since indicated that the church -- if forced 
to choose between the two principles -- would not support a broad-coverage bill 
that includes payments for abortion, according to Religious News Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter from Father Francis Maniscalco, who heads the bishops' media 
relations office, reflected the earlier stated desire for universal coverage 
but put more emphasis on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The insistence on making abortion an integral part of reform and coercing 
millions of Americans to pay for the destruction of human life would bring not 
only the church's opposition, but the defeat of the much-needed reform," 
Maniscalco wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Evangelicals, like Catholic leaders, urged Congress to 
"seek to make health care accessible to all" in a resolution adopted at its 
52nd annual convention in Texas earlier this month. But the evangelicals also 
put even stronger emphasis on rejecting coverage for abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 The evangelicals' resolution also urged "health care provisions which will 
maximize the creativity of the private sector while minimizing governmental 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Gramm and the politically active Christian Coalition took stances a bit 
further to the right at the meeting in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 "The debate is not over whether or not we need to reform health care," Gramm 
said. "The debate is about letting government take over and run the entire 
health care system -- which is socialized medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Businesswoman Sara DiVito Hardman of Encino, state director of the Christian 
Coalition of California, declared the Clinton proposals to have small 
businesses pay for nearly 80% of the health care premiums would result in 
companies either reducing wages or laying off workers to cover the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "This socialized health care plan will create the largest government 
bureaucracy in the history of the United States, costing taxpayers $143 
billion," Hardman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A House subcommittee Wednesday narrowly approved a bill that embraces many of 
Clinton's package of medical benefits. Ways and Means health subcommittee 
Chairman Pete Stark (D-Hayward) sought to scale back some of the costly 
features of the Clinton plan, including long-term care, but now the fight moves 
to the full Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term care, as well as mental health and substance-dependency treatment, 
are among the comprehensive medical coverages sought by the National Council of 
Churches and a close ally, the Washington-based Interreligious Health Care 
Access Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important bottom line is that it covers everybody," said Scott 
Anderson, a former Presbyterian minister who is a part of the interreligious 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must ask how each proposal impacts low-income people," Anderson said in an 
interview. "Under the Clinton plan, a welfare mother or a disabled person 
receiving federal assistance would have to pay $2 each time to see a doctor. A 
minimum-wage worker who cooks at Burger King would have to pay $10 to see a 
physician. That may be a barrier to a lot of people," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ecumenical strategists that Anderson represents also advocate "cost 
control mechanisms to bring expenditures somewhat in line with the rate of 
inflation" and a choice of health care provider, such as Kaiser or Aetna, but 
not the choice of doctor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is going to have to be a swelling up of grass-roots support for reform 
to overcome all of the well-heeled institutional interests that want nothing to 
happen," Anderson said.

 Frustrated by a 10-month labor dispute, the International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers has called for a boycott of all Anaheim businesses, 
including Disneyland and the city's sports franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to use financial pressure to get the city's attention," Willie R. 
Stewart, spokesman for IBEW Local 47 and its 187 members said Friday. "Our 
patience is running out." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James D. Ruth acknowledged that the negotiations with the city 
employees are deadlocked, but said the union's boycott is "unprofessional and 
not practical. . . . Anything that hurts the city hurts the union as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Union members perform a variety of tasks for the city, including maintaining 
high-voltage utility lines and poles. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said the union sent letters to other labor unions throughout the state 
earlier this month asking their members to "refrain from traveling to, 
visiting, or spending money in the city of Anaheim." He said the request is 
being honored by hundreds of union members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's having an impact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan B. Hughes, executive director of the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce, said 
none of his members have "seemed to be hurt by the boycott." He added that he 
thought the union's protest was "stupid" and "blackmail." 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything they do to hurt the city puts them in a worse position," Hughes 
said. "It's counterproductive. I can't imagine why they are using this as a 
bargaining tool. It doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 John McClintock, a Disneyland spokesman, said the company was unaware of the 
union's action. He declined to comment about the situation other than to say 
Disneyland "welcomes everyone" into the park. 
</P>
<P>
 If the wage dispute continues, Stewart said the electrical workers in Anaheim 
may consider a strike. "It's something that we don't want to have to do," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The IBEW members have been working without a contract since July, 1993, and 
have not had a raise since July, 1991, union officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The electrical workers have asked for a 3.25% raise this July, with a 3.5% 
raise the following year. Additionally, they have asked for a "job security 
provision" that would prohibit the city from contracting out work that would 
lead to layoffs of electrical workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's last proposal, the union was offered a one-time signing bonus 
of 5.5% of a worker's salary this year and a 3% raise in July, 1995. No job 
security provision was offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said the city's offer was "very, very fair" and noted that the electrical 
workers in Anaheim are better paid than their colleagues in surrounding areas. 
The union, however, disputes the notion that they are paid more than other 
electrical workers.

UCI STARTS SCIENCE TEACHING PROJECT 
</P>

 Chemists, physicists and engineers will work with Orange County teachers in 
the classrooms of the future to make science more intriguing to students, as 
part of a $1.5-million project begun by UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Science Foundation recently awarded the university the five-year 
grant to enlist technical wizards from local companies who can help develop 
course work that youngsters may find more relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major accomplishment in education because no one in the county has 
gotten corporate people together with university faculty and teachers to come 
up with a high school curriculum," project director Mare Taagepera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten focus groups, with two teachers, two students and two technical 
professionals in each, will anchor the Science, Technology and Society Network 
project, Taagepera said. They will review journals and books to find effective 
materials to teach science.  
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers recruited for focus groups are unlikely to be class valedictorians 
or straight-A students. They generally will be "unusual students who may not be 
high achievers but may have a lot of creativity and find the regular stuff too 
boring," network co-director George Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups will examine such subjects as energy, the environment and artificial 
intelligence and robotics.  
</P>
<P>
 In turn, groups will present their findings to 30 high school and middle 
school teachers gathered at UCI's three-week Summer Science Institute in 
August. Those teachers will take what they have learned about science back to 
students in the coming school year, Miller said. Another 30 scientists will 
help the teachers expose their students to practical science. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers intend to reach 110 teachers in the county by 1999 and link them 
with 110 professionals in the communities where they work or live. 
Participating companies will pay employees for their time, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers wil try to relate science to students' interests. "Perhaps people 
will look at new plastics that make better skateboard wheels, for example," 
Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
 Fluor Daniel engineers will talk to students at Santa Ana High School and 
Serrano Intermediate School in Lake Forest. Chevron will work with La Habra 
High School and Imperial Middle School in La Habra. Beckman Instruments Inc. 
will pair with Saddleback High School in Santa Ana. Allergan Inc. will also 
participate, but the company has not yet been paired with a school.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; ROOM MATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When one law enforcement agency investigates another law enforcement agency 
there can be questions of fairness and independence, especially when they work 
together frequently and need each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates seemed alert to that problem of perceptions 
of fairness after one of his deputies, Darryn Leroy Robins, was shot to death 
by another deputy, Brian P. Scanlan, during a December training exercise.Gates 
stressed that his office had no part in the probe conducted by the Orange 
County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But now it turns out that a Sheriff's Department investigator sat in on nearly 
all the interviews that district attorney's investigators conducted. That was a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no reason to assume that having the Sheriff's Department 
representative at the interviews skewed the results of the investigation. 
Indeed, the district attorney recommended that involuntary manslaughter charges 
be brought against Scanlan, a recommendation the grand jury rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is easy to understand how someone could worry that a Sheriff's 
Department employee might be less than candid if another department employee 
was sitting in on the questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 African American leaders were especially concerned by the fairness of the 
investigation because it was a black deputy who was killed by a white one. In 
such a high-profile case, both the sheriff and the D.A. should have been more 
sensitive to public perceptions and kept the sheriff's investigator out of the 
room.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HART DISTRICT TRUSTEE RESIGNS AFTER 105 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Warren has resigned from the William S. Hart Union High School District 
105 days after taking office, ending one of the shortest trustee tenures in the 
district's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, a civil engineer, told fellow trustees he plans to work for a year as 
a consultant to a development company in Canada.He notified district officials 
of his resignation at the end of their regular meeting Wednesday, but did not 
make a public announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees have 60 days to fill the vacancy by either special election or 
appointment. School boards often appoint a new member to avoid the expense of a 
special election, and whoever fills the post will serve through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, 36, was elected to the second of three open seats in November, winning 
20.2% of the vote. He was the only candidate to support the defeated school 
voucher initiative. Warren credited his success to anti-incumbent sentiment and 
voter perception of him as an independent thinker. 
</P>
<P>
 During his brief tenure, the district settled the controversial issue of 
drawing new attendance boundaries to accommodate an additional high school and 
junior high school this fall.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; METROLINK'S SANTA CLARITA LINE IS ROLLING IN 
GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bright green and white passenger cars and locomotives were put into operation 
on Metrolink's Santa Clarita line Friday, supplementing the traditional blue 
and white trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink has leased 25 passenger cars and five locomotive power units from 
the government of Ontario, Canada, to help handle the 9,000 daily commuters who 
now use the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Santa Clarita line is seeing the highest ridership so that's where we 
need the additional equipment," said Peter Hidalgo, Metrolink spokesman. "The 
striking difference to the passenger will be that the (new) cars are a bright 
green and white." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita ridership is eight to nine times what it was before the Jan. 17 
earthquake damaged area highways and clogged commutes into Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink is paying $300 per passenger car per day and $200 per locomotive per 
day under the lease agreement, which is expected to end in about 18 months, 
when previously ordered equipment arrives, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The leased trains are older but compatible with existing Metrolink equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This 15-year-old Canadian equipment . . . was made by the same company that 
built our modern Metrolink coaches," said Larry Walker, Metrolink chairman.

PAROLEE SHOT AFTER CHASE AS DEPUTY ESCAPES HARM; CRIME: THE PURSUIT ENDS WHEN 
THE PALMDALE MAN CRASHES HIS VEHICLE INTO A PATROL CAR. THE SUSPECT IS IN 
SERIOUS CONDITION. 
</P>

 A parolee was shot several times by a sheriff's deputy late Thursday after a 
brief car chase that ended when the man drove onto an embankment, put his car 
in reverse and nearly hit a deputy, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parolee, Steven Blade Jackson, 24, of Palmdale, was reported in serious 
condition Friday at Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center. No officers were 
injured in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 An arrest warrant had been issued for Jackson last month after he tested 
positive for methamphetamine use and moved to a new address without notifying 
his parole officer, said Ron Breeden, acting supervisor of the Antelope Valley 
Parole Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 He was released from state prison in January after serving almost a year for 
burglary, according to state records. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's arrest on Thursday night, however, stemmed from an apparent traffic 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plainclothes deputies in an unmarked car tried to stop Jackson's pickup 
truck at 11:09 p.m. after they saw it speeding south on 20th Street East with 
its headlights off, Deputy Patrick Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
 A third deputy, Dave Moore, wearing a uniform and driving a marked patrol car, 
joined in the pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson tried to pull his truck into a driveway at an apartment complex, but 
turned too quickly and stopped on a grassy embankment, Hauser said. Moore 
pulled his patrol car behind the pickup and got out, along with the 
plainclothes deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspect put his car in reverse and accelerated," Hauser said. Moore then 
"jumped back into his radio car and barely escaped injury as the suspect's 
truck slammed into the (driver's side) door of the radio car." 
</P>
<P>
 As the truck was moving backward, one of the plainclothes deputies, 11-year 
veteran Brian Schoonmaker, fired at Jackson, striking him several times in the 
upper body, Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson told deputies and paramedics that he fled because he was wanted for 
parole violation, Hauser said. A sheriff's spokesman added that deputies 
recovered what appeared to be two packets of methamphetamine that Jackson tried 
to discard during the chase. 
</P>
<P>
 After undergoing treatment for his wounds, Jackson will be held without bail 
on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, deputies 
said.

 Striking transit workers and their employer made no progress toward ending the 
5-month-old walkout during a lengthy meeting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80 bus drivers and mechanics working for DAVE Transportation 
Services Inc. went on strike Oct. 25.The employees, who last May voted to join 
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 572, felt progress was not 
being made in contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides met with a federal mediator several times after the strike 
began, although Friday's meeting was the first overseen by the mediator since 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Mackey, a striking bus driver, said that during the session Friday both 
the union and the bus company presented proposals, but neither side accepted 
the other's offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mackey and other pickets on Thursday had expressed optimism about the latest 
meeting. Nonetheless, Mackey said he was not discouraged with the lack of 
progress during the session. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully there will be more negotiations," Mackey said. "If not, we'll wait 
to see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he said, "we continue to picket." SHARON MOESER

AN UNCLEAR WORLD; SERVICE HELPS IMMIGRANT ENTREPRENEURS MEET POLLUTION RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a small Downtown Los Angeles firm knew he needed a sewer permit 
but was terrified of government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 A small South Bay plastics-forming company thought it was breaking 
environmental bookkeeping rules but was afraid to ask what penalties it faced. 
</P>
<P>
 The new owner of a Pasadena dry cleaners needed an air-pollution permit but 
didn't know where to go, or how to apply for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting small businesses to comply with environmental regulations is hard 
enough. But it's doubly difficult when the sometimes complex rules are imposed 
-- as these were -- on owners who speak little or no English. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is particularly widespread in Southern California, where large 
numbers of immigrants start or buy small businesses. Many newcomers also bring 
a profound cultural distrust of government and regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators and business groups have long struggled with the problem. Now one 
group is coming to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 A nonprofit organization called the Environmental Compliance Support Assn. of 
California, or Ecosa, on Friday began to offer the latest wrinkle in efforts to 
spur compliance: practical advice, kept confidential from regulators, in 140 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners can call Ecosa, ask for a translator fluent in anything from 
Greek to Urdu to Hausa -- provided by AT&T's "Language Line" service -- and ask 
what they need to do to meet air, water, waste and other environmental 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We offer a safe haven for people," says Noel Kurai, Ecosa's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows just how many small businesses need help. But most agencies 
believe that the numbers are substantial. The South Coast Air Quality 
Management District estimates that among auto body repair shops -- their 
biggest challenge -- more than 40% are still breaking the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 How language compounds that problem is even less well known. But the latest 
U.S. Census found that a third of all self-employed business people in Los 
Angeles in small metal-forging and stamping companies do not speak English 
well. And last fall, when a Long Beach environmental consulting firm conducted 
a telephone poll for the Orange County Fire Department, quizzing small 
companies that create hazardous waste, some refused to talk, others hung up, 
but fully 12% of the interviews couldn't even be started because of the 
language barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecosa's own polling of small businesses, completed last September, found the 
"virtually unanimous" opinion that all environmental information should be 
given in the appropriate language. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Monte-based association, in operation about a year, is based on similar 
models set up beginning in 1990 by the Dutch Ministry of Environment. The idea 
-- which Ecosa compares to what the American Automobile Assn. provides drivers 
-- is to offer, at a reasonable price, the sophisticated environmental reviews 
and planning that larger companies now routinely get from in-house executives 
or consulting firms. The association is sponsored by Southern California Gas 
Co., AT&T, Southern California Edison and Bank of America, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're set up to help these companies without turning them in to the 
environmental regulators," Kurai says. Though some governmental agencies have 
staffers assigned to give free help to small businesses trying to comply with 
their rules, "when you go to the agencies, most of them are required to put you 
on a schedule to correct whatever the violation is, and possibly fine you," 
Kurai says. "Ecosa acts as a buffer." 
</P>
<P>
 Ecosa also offers help for the full range of a company's environmental 
liabilities -- from air pollution to hazardous waste violations -- not just 
those within a single agency's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some government agencies and business groups, which offer help in English or 
Spanish, have been fighting the fight for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 One that has been helping small businesses for the past three years is the 
Business Environmental Assistance Center, in Anaheim, which is affiliated with 
Fullerton College and is sponsored primarily by California Trade and Commerce 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Such business organizations may become increasingly valuable as 
budget-squeezed public agencies cut back their own efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of need out there," says Nola Oriola-Brown, an air-quality 
analysis and compliance supervisor in charge of the AQMD's Small Business 
Assistance Office. For the past five years, her office has offered small 
businesses loan guarantees to buy new low-emission equipment, extended 
deadlines, no-fault inspections and other help dealing with the district's 
rules -- in English or Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will walk with them all the way through the process," Oriola-Brown says. 
For Help Some organizations, agencies offering help with environmental 
regulations:

</P>
<P>
 Substantial numbers of small business owners in Southern California face not 
only the difficulty of understanding sometimes complex environmental 
regulations but the task of doing so with little or no ability to speak 
English. Following are the percentages of self-employed people in Los Angeles 
County in major small business sectors who say they do not speak English well.

EUROPE MAY EASE BARRIERS TO U.S. ENTERTAINMENT; TRADE: A EUROPEAN UNION 
OFFICIAL'S COMMENTS ARE WELL RECEIVED BY A U.S. FILM INDUSTRY OFFICIAL. 
</P>

 In a sign that Europe could ease barriers limiting Hollywood's access to the 
Continent's entertainment market, a senior European Union official Friday 
declared that the union plans to move away from protectionist measures that 
prop up its struggling audiovisual sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Colette Flesch, director general of the EU Executive Commission's cultural 
affairs department, indicated that only a new, aggressive global strategy to 
promote its own entertainment products can guarantee the sector's long-term 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Europe has no alternative but to develop a coherent global strategy if it 
wants its industry to survive and develop," she told a seminar on the media 
here. "It is in this context that the Commission . . . aims at presenting both 
governments and professionals with options not to increase protectionism, but 
to give a new dynamic perspective to the European audiovisual sector." 
</P>
<P>
 Flesch's remarks reflected a growing realization on this side of the Atlantic 
that protectionist measures, aimed mainly at restricting the access of U.S. 
films to Europe, had not just failed to protect Europe's film industry but also 
seriously weakened it. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin Tonini, vice president of the Motion Picture Export Assn. of 
America's European office here, applauded the general direction of Flesch's 
comments. "We warmly endorse what she said," he said. "We in the United States 
are prepared to cooperate with the Europeans." 
</P>
<P>
 The tone and content of Flesch's speech mark a dramatic shift of thinking in a 
region that has come to see generous state subsidies for local films, as well 
as quotas and other restrictions on foreign productions, as essential for the 
industry's survival.

 In 1992, European films were supported by government subsidies totaling more 
than $700 million. Despite these subsidies, those movies have failed to gain 
much audience support, with attendance figures declining at a time when 
attendance for U.S. films in Europe is stable. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for the proposed strategy shift, EU officials admit, is that 
advances in audiovisual technology are increasingly likely to undermine 
protectionist measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "European directors need to start making films for people, not just for 
themselves," said Ivan Hodac, vice president of Time Warner Europe. He claimed 
that about half of Europe's subsidized films never reach the theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Flesch's comments carry added significance because they come as the EU starts 
an in-depth review of the region's audiovisual sector. A formal discussion 
paper carrying much of the flavor of Flesch's remarks is scheduled to be 
approved by the commission within the next few weeks. The paper will probably 
then become the focus of an industry conference, to be held here in May and 
called by Joao de Deus Pinheiro, EU cultural affairs commissioner.

HOME SALES DIP 3.6% IN STATE, 9.9% IN NATION; HOUSING: DESPITE SLIDE, FIGURES 
ARE CHEERED AS EVIDENCE THAT THE CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE MARKET IS ON THE 
REBOUND. 
</P>

<P>
 Home sales in California eased just 3.6% last month, while unusually harsh 
weather in other parts of the country sent sales nationwide skidding 9.9%, 
according to surveys released Friday by two realty groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the slight dip, the reports provided more evidence that California has 
joined the rally in the nation's housing market after the worst downturn in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Assn. of Realtors' report that sales dropped only slightly in 
February from January was cheered by local real estate experts, many of whom 
were worried that the Jan. 17 quake and slight increases in mortgage rates 
would push buyers to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales around the quake's epicenter and across the rest of Los Angeles county 
dipped only 2.5% in February from January, and were up a strong 41% from 
February, 1993. Statewide, sales climbed 22.4% from a year ago to a seasonally 
adjusted annualized rate of 502,730. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those people who were saying that the earthquake was going to make the 
real estate market collapse have a little egg on their face right now," said 
Pat Neal, president of the California realty trade group and a broker in Orange 
County. "It looks like we're headed into a healthy spring home-buying season." 
</P>
<P>
 The price of a typical home in the state dipped 0.7% last month, to $180,380 
from $181,690 in January, the report said. The median price of a home in Los 
Angeles County dropped a steeper 2.6% to $184,250 -- a decline attributed to 
lower prices for homes that were severely damaged by the quake and a pickup in 
the sales of low-priced houses to first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The median price of a home in Orange County fell 1% from January to $204,740, 
and sales dropped 11%, the realtors said. Sales fell nearly 12% in San Diego 
County, but jumped 32% in Ventura County and rose 2% in the Riverside/San 
Bernardino area. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts blamed the 9.9% month-to-month drop in nationwide sales on the 
unusually heavy snow that blanketed much of the Midwest and East Coast in 
January and February. 
</P>
<P>
 A slight rise in interest rates may also have hurt sales, the report by the 
National Assn. of Realtors said. Rates on fixed 30-year loans averaged 7.15% in 
February, compared to 7.07% the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates have continued to climb in March, but many analysts believe that the 
nation's housing market will remain strong for several more months.

BOND YIELDS BREAK 7% LEVEL, FORCING DOW TO 3-MONTH LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a potentially damaging blow to investor psychology, Treasury bond yields on 
Friday closed above the important 7% level for the first time since last May, 
while blue-chip stocks fell to near three-month lows. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Mexico City, stocks closed with only small losses after a deep selloff 
at the start of trading. 
</P>
<P>
 While many investors were focused on the potential for a meltdown in Mexico 
after Wednesday's assassination of presidential hopeful Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
the surprise was that U.S. markets went into a free fall late in the day: 
</P>
<P>
 * A surge of concern over simmering political and economic issues sent the 
yield on 30-year Treasury bonds to 7.01% from 6.95% on Thursday, pulling 
shorter-term yields up as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow Jones industrials, cuing off the bond market, tumbled 46.36 points 
to 3,774.73, the lowest close since the index was at 3,756.60 on Jan. 3. The 
broader market also was lower, though trading was slow and smaller stocks were 
hit much less. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the vortex for market fears on Friday was in Chicago futures 
markets, where speculators use futures and options contracts to bet on or hedge 
against market moves in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 A wave of selling in Treasury bond futures undercut prices of the securities 
in New York, in turn tripping the stock market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year T-bond yield's close above 7% -- for the first time since last May 
25 -- was viewed as psychologically damaging to markets, because breaking below 
that yield last year was a major triumph for Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seven percent was an important barrier, and if you break through it you cause 
even more pessimism," warned David Jones, economist at bond dealer Aubrey G. 
Lanston & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The T-bond yield had reached a 21-year low of 5.79% last fall, on 
extraordinary optimism about a shrinking federal budget deficit and the 
likelihood of continuing low inflation in a moderate-growth economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, interest rates have surged as the economy's surprisingly robust 
growth has fueled renewed inflation concerns, causing the Federal Reserve Board 
to tighten credit twice over the past two months -- most recently this week. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Fed's goal in boosting short-term interest rates is ultimately to 
fight inflation, bond traders have bid long-term interest rates higher as well, 
in what some economists describe as a knee-jerk reaction. The T-bond yield had 
flirted with 7% for several weeks, before finally breaking through that level 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said mounting concerns over political issues -- from the Clinton 
Administration's Whitewater affair to Mexico's assassination to North Korean 
nuclear secrecy -- finally toppled market sentiment on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every kind of unexpected event that you could imagine has hit us on the 
political side," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond traders also noted that the market's failure to sustain its Tuesday rally 
-- when long-term yields dropped sharply after the Fed officially announced its 
second quarter-point boost in short-term rates this year -- had disheartened 
many investors. Long-term yields began to rise again on Wednesday, suggesting 
that the market was unwilling to give the Fed the benefit of the doubt in the 
fight against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, rising interest rates and growing political worries combined have 
unnerved the stock market. Some Wall Streeters fear that consumer and business 
confidence could be upended if President Clinton is further implicated in the 
Whitewater scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow, which had tumbled 48.37 points on Thursday in reaction to the Mexican 
assassination, held up for much of Friday before sinking late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow's loss for the week was 120.92 points, the largest weekly point 
decline since the index fell 216.26 points in the week ended Oct. 13, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, most key indexes closed with much smaller losses on 
Friday after plummeting on Thursday. The Russell 2,000 index of smaller stocks 
eased just 0.62 point to 266.45 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, losers topped winners by 12 to 8 on Friday, 
while winners edged losers on the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, analysts said the selling of many industrial issues on Friday was a bad 
sign, because those stocks have been the market leaders over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler, for example, dropped 2 5/8 to 53 1/2 on Friday. Deere slumped 2 3/8 
to 84 3/8, Bethlehem Steel lost 1 1/2 to 20 7/8 and Alcoa fell 2 to 76 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the urge to take profits in those leading stocks could indicate 
that many investors are throwing in the towel, unwilling to stick with the 
market in the face of higher interest rates and mounting political risks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, meanwhile, the Bolsa index closed with a loss of just 22.79 
points, to 2,520.78, after plunging more than 100 points, or 4%, early in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican peso was also dragged down in early trading, though it stabilized 
to close 2.76 centavos lower at 3.353 pesos to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The market had been closed on Thursday in mourning for Colosio. Despite the 
heavy selling at the opening on Friday, buyers returned and the market's tone 
improved through the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said many investors believe Mexico's ruling party, the PRI, will be 
able to field a strong candidate to replace Colosio, and will go on to win the 
August presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But some experts also noted Friday that the Mexican government itself was 
helping to stabilize stock prices through Nafinsa, the country's major economic 
development bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Galle, analyst with D.A. Campbell Co. in Los Angeles, said Nafinsa 
appeared to be placing bids to buy stocks just under their market prices 
Friday, effectively providing a floor for the stocks and helping to restore 
investor confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S.-traded Mexican stocks, Telmex gained 2 3/8 to 62 1/2, Grupo Tribasa 
surged 1 5/8 to 29 and Empresas ICA rose 1 1/8 to 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Latin American stock markets in general were higher. Argentina's major 
stock index rose 2.2%, Brazil's jumped 6% and Chile's was up 0.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Other market highlights Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Other industrial issues falling included Rockwell, off 1 3/8 to 40; ITT, 
down 2 1/8 to 82; GM, off 1 1/2 to 56 7/8; and Varity, down 2 1/4 to 45 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks followed industrials lower. Apple dropped 1 3/4 to 32 3/4, 
IBM plunged 2 3/8 to 54, Compaq sank 3 1/8 to 99 1/2, Motorola tumbled 3 3/8 to 
101 3/4 and Lotus slumped 4 1/2 to 76 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold and silver were mixed. Near-term gold futures eased 60 cents to $391 on 
the Comex, while silver added 5.6 cents to $5.78. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar ended little changed, stabilizing after Thursday's heavy selling 
linked to the Clinton Whitewater scandal and the murder of Mexico's top 
presidential candidate.

 A petroleum engineer has his eyes on five miles of dark, damp tunnels, where 
scientists had once contemplated smashing atoms. 
</P>
<P>
 But Naresh Vashisht doesn't want it for science. He wants to harvest white 
button mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Vashisht, president of a Texas firm that owns a Colorado mushroom farm, says 
the underground remnants of the uncompleted Superconducting Super Collider 
south of Dallas are prime turf for fungus, if not for physics. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-mile stretch of tunnel is 200 feet underground and sealed with 
concrete. The Energy Department is considering abandoning the tunnels and 
letting them fill with water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that is probably a waste of resources," Vashisht said, "if something 
can be done economically like I'm thinking can be done."

 Ameritech to Cut 6,000 Jobs: The telecommunications company said it will slash 
the non-management jobs by the end of 1995. The job cuts, along with 
improvements in the pension plan, will result in a one-time after-tax charge of 
$335 million in the first quarter, the company said. Chicago-based Ameritech 
Corp. said that in determining pensions, it will add three years to the service 
of eligible non-management employees who leave their jobs by mid-1995.

 OPEC Works on Stabilizing Prices: The oil cartel's ministers met to map out a 
strategy for stabilizing oil prices amid new warnings that prices could plunge 
several more dollars if the cartel fails to act against overproduction. An 
internal OPEC report estimates that prices will rebound only if the 12 nations 
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries slash oil output by nearly 
1.5 million barrels a day.Analysts doubted that support could be mustered 
within OPEC for a sizable cut that would mop up excess crude on the market. Oil 
prices have been about $5 a barrel below levels of a year ago. Near-term crude 
oil futures added 5 cents to $15.13 a barrel on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange Friday.

 ARB Approves Tosco Fuel: The California Air Resources Board has approved a 
formula for cleaner-burning diesel devised by Tosco Corp., a Concord, 
Calif.-based independent oil refiner.Low-emission diesel, required by the ARB, 
is already being produced by other refiners around the state. But Tosco has 
been granted extra time to conform to the rule, an ARB move that other 
companies have protested. On March 7, Chevron Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co., 
Texaco Inc. and Unocal Corp. petitioned the Sacramento Superior Court to set 
aside the ARB's exception. Chevron spokesman Mark Nelson said the litigation 
will continue. "The issue is not the fuel itself -- it's what we consider to be 
the improper procedures that the ARB took," Nelson said, "and to make sure that 
proper procedures are followed in the future."

SINGAPORE AIRLINES PLANS 52-JET PURCHASE; AVIATION: BOEING AND AIRBUS WOULD BE 
MAIN BENEFICIARIES OF $6 BILLION IN ORDERS. OTHER SOUTHLAND FIRMS WOULD ALSO 
BENEFIT.

 Singapore Airlines is prepared to buy up to 52 wide-body jetliners worth $6 
billion from Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie, an airline spokeswoman said 
Friday, in what would be another welcome boost for Southern California's 
beleaguered aircraft industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The carrier's order would particularly benefit Northrop Corp., which builds 
the fuselages for Boeing's 747 jumbo jet in Hawthorne, and several dozen other 
747 suppliers in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore Airlines, whose 63-plane fleet is already dominated by 44 747s, has 
invited proposals from manufacturers to supply additional 747s, along with 
A340s built by Airbus, the European aircraft consortium, airline spokeswoman 
Agnes Huff said in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The A340 entered service a year ago, and Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific 
Airways and Air Canada are among the carriers that have ordered the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Huff said Singapore Airlines hopes to formally place its order within the next 
few months. 
</P>
<P>
 A third major manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Douglas Aircraft unit in 
Long Beach, is also welcome to submit a proposal to Singapore, Huff said. But 
she said Boeing and Airbus were invited because those are the two makes of jets 
the airline flies. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline's expected order follows the February announcement of a $6-billion 
order planned by Saudi Arabia's national carrier, Saudia. Boeing and Douglas 
are negotiating with the Saudis about sharing that order.

NISSAN TO HIKE PURCHASE OF U.S., FOREIGN PARTS

 Nissan Motor Co. announced Friday that it would sharply increase the amount of 
foreign- and U.S.-made auto parts it buys, becoming the first Japanese auto 
maker to announce goals for such purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan said it will purchase about $4.3 billion in foreign-made auto parts 
over the next four years, Japan's Jiji Press reported. U.S.-made auto parts 
will account for $3.4 billion of the total, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan, the world's fourth largest auto maker, said the plan is conditional 
upon the ability of its American production affiliates to run at full capacity 
and increased efficiency, Jiji said. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has urged Japanese auto 
makers to import a greater share of their auto components from abroad to dampen 
trade friction. U.S. officials have criticized Japan for its relatively low 
level of imported auto parts.

 SBA Announces Changes in Venture Capital Program: The Small Business 
Administration will make as much as $9 billion in investment funds available 
over the next three years.The changes are designed to remove structural 
problems in its Small Business Investment Co. program. SBICs are privately 
owned and managed firms that use their own capital and funds secured through 
SBA guarantees to make investments in small businesses. SBICs have invested 
almost $10 billion of public and private venture capital in more than 70,000 
small businesses. The changes result from the Small Business Equity Enhancement 
Act, which Congress passed in 1992.

 Grumman Neutral on Northrop Bid: In a filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, Grumman Corp., which has agreed to hold merger discussions with 
Northrop Corp., said it would take no position yet on Northrop's hostile bid 
for the company.Northrop, the Los Angeles-based aircraft builder, has offered 
to buy Grumman for $60 a share, or $2.04 billion. The hostile offer came 
shortly after Grumman agreed to be purchased by Martin Marietta Corp., of 
Bethesda, Md., for $55 a share, or $1.93 billion. Grumman closed Friday at 
$63.25, up 25 cents a share, Martin Marietta closed at $45.25, up 25 cents and 
Northrop was off $1.25 at $44.125, all on the New York Stock Exchange.

STATE FARM INCREASES ITS ESTIMATE OF NORTHRIDGE QUAKE COST TO $1 BILLION; 
DAMAGE: THE UPWARD REVISION MEANS THE COST OF INSURED LOSS WILL FAR EXCEED THE 
INDUSTRY'S INITIAL GUESS OF $2.5 BILLION.

 State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., California's largest homeowner 
insurer, on Friday raised its estimate of insurance losses from the Northridge 
earthquake to $1 billion from an initial estimate of $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm's announcement, the latest in a series of sharp upward revisions of 
loss projections, assures that the final total of insured damage from the Jan. 
17 quake will far exceed the insurance industry's initial estimate of $2.5 
billion.In fact, the latest estimates of just four companies -- State Farm, 
Allstate, Farmers and 20th Century -- now total $2.525 billion alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Some insurance analysts say the total may reach $4 billion, making the quake 
the third-most costly disaster in U.S. history for insurance companies -- 
behind 1992's Hurricane Andrew, at $18 billion insured losses, and 1989's 
Hurricane Hugo, at $4.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Farm estimate leaped upward not because the insurer is receiving 
more claims than expected but because individual claims "are coming in a lot 
more severe than anticipated," spokesman Bill Sirola said. State Farm said it 
had received 100,000 claims as of Friday and expected that number to level off 
at 103,000 claims. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Allstate raised its estimate of claims payments to $600 million 
from $350 million. Last week, 20th Century raised its estimate to $325 million 
from $160 million. Farmers Group has projected payments of $600 million.

WANNA SEE STREISAND? GET IN LINE

<P>
 Orange County has suddenly found itself the site of two of the hottest 
concerts in some time -- Barbra Streisand, May 25, 27 and 29 at the Anaheim 
Arena, and the reconstituted Eagles, May 27-29 and 31 at the Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither act is scheduled to perform in Los Angeles (although the Eagles will 
do one show at the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion in San Bernardino County), 
making the demand for these Orange County dates all the greater. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagles tickets won't be sold until April 2, but the coveted Babs ducats go on 
sale Sunday morning. Here's a brief ticket guide for Streisand fans, many of 
whom presumably are a bit out of practice at standing in line for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 How much?: Streisand tickets will cost -- are you sitting down? -- $350, $125 
and $50. Fees will be added at TicketMaster outlets and on phone charges. 
(Exact amounts had not been determined as of Friday morning, according to a 
TicketMaster spokesman.) For those who choose to buy through a broker, a Times 
survey of ticket agencies indicated that prices will top out around $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 When?: Tickets go on sale at 9 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 How many?: There is a limit of six tickets per purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to buy?: There are three ways to get tickets: over the phone, at the 
Anaheim Arena box office and at selected TicketMaster outlets. All tickets will 
be sold from the same computer pool, so when the three shows sell out (13,000 
tickets are available for each performance), they will be sold out everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Arena: Tickets will be sold at the box office, 2695 E. Katella Ave. 
There will be no lineups allowed before 5 a.m.; the parking lot will open at 7 
a.m. and random priority wristbands to determine your place in line will not be 
issued until 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The arena will accept cash, Visa, MasterCard and American Express. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Season holders of luxury suites at the arena will be issued tickets for 
all three nights. However, an arena spokesman pointed out that suite holders 
are contractually barred from selling their tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 TicketMaster: Outlets at all Music Plus and Tower Records stores will sell 
tickets (TicketMaster outlets at Robinsons/May stores will not). As at Anaheim 
Arena, early lineups will be discouraged, and random priority wristbands will 
be issued at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Outlets accept cash only. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone charge: Tickets may also be purchased by phone at (714) 740-2000 and 
(213) 480-3232. But don't expect to get through on the first try, or even 
necessarily on the 100th -- getting through by phone for a big concert is a 
tricky proposition.

 WANTED MAN: Authorities trying to prosecute an Encino attorney on murder 
charges in connection with deliberate traffic accidents got a big break: 
Houston police nabbed a man sought as the suspected "capper," the long-sought 
link between the attorney and ring members who positioned their cars to be hit 
by trucks on the Golden State Freeway for insurance payments (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 BAD BREAKS: Valley business owners have had a run of bad luck lately.First the 
quake, and now a rash of armed robberies -- more than half of them aimed at dry 
cleaners (B1). . . . Still, it's not all that unusual for criminals to target a 
specific type of store. In past years, serial arsonists have struck at Valley 
nail salons and barbershops. 
</P>
<P>
 SMALL BUT STRONG: Well known for its large Christian population, the Antelope 
Valley is also home to an active Jewish community. Temple Beth Knesset 
Bamidbar, founded 43 years ago in Lancaster, may draw far fewer people than 
other places of worship, but for many Jews it is the center of the area's 
religious life (B1). . . . "If you're Jewish, it's the only game in town," said 
one member. David E. Brady

GAINING INSIGHT INTO PASSOVER; CELEBRATIONS: MODEL SEDER AT HISTORIC WILSHIRE 
BOULEVARD TEMPLE TEACHES CATHOLIC STUDENTS THE JEWISH FAITH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So what was a nice Catholic boy like 15-year-old Eddie Fernandez doing at 
Wilshire Boulevard Temple? 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of fact, what were more than 1,500 Catholic elementary and high 
school students doing at the historic synagogue earlier this week? 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Rabbi Harvey J. Fields. Catholic youths such as Eddie have been coming to 
the temple every year about this time for the last 14 years to learn about the 
Jewish holiday of Passover -- and have a little fun in the process by sharing 
in a model Seder, or ceremonial family meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the opportunity of crossing over from their own tradition to 
another tradition and returning to their tradition enriched with new 
understanding that illuminates their own," Fields said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also a demonstration of the strides made in relations between Roman 
Catholics and Jews after centuries of Christian anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
 Gathering Catholic youths inside the historic synagogue -- a national landmark 
with an eight-story dome and heroic murals depicting the history of Judaism -- 
was an opportunity to dispel myths about Jews found among some Catholics, 
according to Father Vivian Ben Lima, director of the Office of Ecumenical and 
Interreligious Affairs for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you entered this sanctuary building, you felt like you were in a 
church," Lima told the students, who came from 29 Catholic elementary and high 
schools, before the Seder began. "I'd like to tell you that you are in a house 
of God. This is a place of worship and a place of prayer for our Jewish 
brothers and sisters." 
</P>
<P>
 The model Seder at Wilshire Boulevard Temple is one example of a larger 
movement toward reconciliation between Catholics and Jews worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, for example, the Vatican and Israel signed an accord that will 
lead to the exchange of ambassadors this year and full diplomatic recognition 
of Israel by the Roman Catholic Church. There have also been Catholic 
statements of repentance for anti-Semitism and a declaration that Jews "still 
remain most dear to God." In 1965, the Catholic Church officially absolved Jews 
of blame for the Crucifixion of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout this time, religious leaders in Los Angeles have been in the 
forefront of interfaith dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The model Seder program was inaugurated 14 years ago by Rabbi Emeritus Alfred 
Wolf and the Rev. Msgr. Royale Vadakin of the archdiocese. Since then, it has 
been adopted by synagogues throughout the United States, Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic youths participating in the model Seder were able to share in the 
rites and symbols commemorating the liberation of Jews from slavery in ancient 
Egypt. Passover begins at sundown tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time for me. It's quite an experience," said Fernandez, a 
freshman at Our Lady Queen of Angels High School seminary in Mission Hills. 
"It's something I don't see in my religion as a Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
 He and the other youths learned about the parts of the Seder, including the 
wine and an unleavened bread called matzo that reminds participants of the 
haste in which Jews left Egypt. Green herbs known as carpas are tokens of 
gratitude to God for the gifts of the earth. They are dipped in saltwater as a 
symbol of the miracle recounted in the book of Exodus in which the Jews crossed 
over the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also charoset , a mixture of finely chopped apples, nuts or almonds 
and raisins. Because of its appearance, it came to be regarded as representing 
the clay with which the Israelites made bricks or the mortar used in great 
buildings erected by the Jewish slaves in Egypt. There also is a bitter herb 
known as maror , representing the bitter life of slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 Also explained at the model Seder were the ritual of dropping one drop of wine 
for each of the 10 plagues visited upon Pharaoh by God for refusing to free the 
Israelites, and the Cup of Elijah symbolizing the expectation of his return. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity to look back into history and come forward and ask 
ourselves the question: How can this great moment of Jewish history be of 
significance to us here today?" Fields told the students. 
</P>
<P>
 He said they may also come to a deeper understanding of the Christian 
Eucharist and Christianity's roots in Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Seder) obviously has incredible parallels to the Lord's Supper (or 
Eucharist) for Christian kids," Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ritually speaking, it is a real learning experience, and an engagement of 
real values of Judaism and Christianity -- the sanctity of individual reverence 
for life and of the Spring and renewal, not only of the Earth but of 
ourselves," he added. "This is reflected in Passover and, in a way, in the 
deepest sense of Easter."  
</P>
<P>
 It was also an opportunity to dispel myths about Jews found among some 
Catholics, according to Lima. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Catholics, he said, incorrectly believe that the Passover Seder is 
incomplete without the Christian Eucharist. "I want to dispel that completely," 
the priest said. "It is an authentic, complete and wonderfully profound worship 
of God who involves himself in history." Lima noted that Pope John Paul II has 
said that "all of us are spiritual Semites." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the wild shoot grafted onto the olive tree (of Judaism)," he said. 
"This means the old tree still exists and the life-giving sap gives life to the 
wild shoot (Christianity)." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Lima reminded students, anti-Semitism has been defined as a sin by 
the Catholic Church.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the spiritual common denominators, there was no mistaking the great 
divide that separates Jews and Christians -- the nature of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 That overarching distinction was apparent when a young Catholic boy approached 
a microphone after the Seder during a question-and-answer session. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you believe in Jesus as being the Savior?" the boy asked the rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields smiled and deferred to his associate, Rabbi Steven Z. Leder. 
</P>
<P>
 Jews, said Leder, view Jesus as "a great and wise teacher," but not as the son 
of God. "I know this maybe is very difficult thing to understand," Leder told 
the boy. Nonetheless, he said, Jews respect the Christian belief that Jesus is 
the Messiah. 
</P>
<P>
 As the model Seder came to an end, Fields looked out across the faces of the 
assembled students and said, "Happy Easter." Moments later, Father Lima was at 
the podium wishing his Jewish hosts "a wonderful and holy Passover." 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that can save us," Fields said earlier, "is our sense of hope 
and decency -- and our own relationship with God."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA TOURNAMENTS; FLORIDA'S PRAYERS ANSWERED; EAST 
REGIONAL: CONNECTICUT'S MARSHALL MISSES TWO FREE THROWS AND GATORS WIN IN 
OVERTIME, 69-60.

<P>
 If there was a worse sight than Connecticut All-American Donyell Marshall 
standing at the free-throw line, the score tied and only 3.4 seconds left to 
play in regulation, Dan Cross couldn't think of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was praying he would miss it," said Cross, star guard for Florida. "There 
was a lot of pressure on him at the time. They were probably the two biggest 
free throws of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, supposedly used to the pressure, promptly missed not one, but both 
of the free throws, allowing the Gators to push the game into overtime, where 
they eventually won, 69-60. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he saved his worst for last, only Marshall knows for sure. The junior 
forward, who has yet to decide if he will forgo his final season of eligibility 
for the NBA draft, could do little right Friday evening in the second game of 
the East Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, a 75.8% free-throw shooter who earlier this season made 20 of 20 
attempts against St. John's, converted only six of 10 Friday night. He was five 
of 13 from the field, missing all five three-point attempts. He finished with 
16 points, nearly 10 below his season average. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, everything else would have been forgiven had Marshall been able to 
make one ofthose final free throws. Instead, both attempts bounced against the 
back of the rim and then popped in and out of the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida, which trailed by 10 points during the second half, had survived, and 
went on to outscore the Huskies, 12-3. Connecticut, the No. 2 seed, was left 
wondering what if. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very confident about the shots," Marshall said. "Nothing you can do 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rewarded with a second chance, the Gators took a one-point lead, 59-58, with 
2:40 left in overtime. Connecticut would get no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida, the No. 3 seed, will play Boston College Sunday afternoon. For the 
Gators, it is their first-ever trip to the final eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of Florida's games, the victory was light on aesthetics. Cross and 
Craig Brown, one of the best backcourts in the country, accounted for 34 of the 
Gators' 69 points. It was Brown's three-pointer that put Florida ahead by four 
with 1:16 to play in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Demetri Hill, the 290-pound forward who helped shut down Marshall, added 15 
points.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA TOURNAMENTS; NO CHEERS IN INDIANA AS BOSTON COLLEGE 
WINS; EAST REGIONAL: QUICKNESS, THREE-POINT SHOOTING, HEART ARE KEY TO EAGLES' 
77-68 VICTORY OVER HOOSIERS.

 Do you believe in mira- . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ah, never mind. Boston College passed miracle status six days ago and is now 
headed directly to impossible dream territory. In short, another day, another 
upset for the once little-regarded Eagles, who seem to be getting the hang of 
this NCAA tournament stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday evening at the East Regional semifinal, ninth-seeded Boston College 
surprised Indiana, 77-68, in front of 15,217 at the Miami Arena. That now makes 
two coaching legends beaten by the Eagles in six days -- Bob Knight here, North 
Carolina's Dean Smith at the Landover, Md., subregional. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hell of a week for us," said Boston College Coach Jim O'Brien, whose 
team becomes the first No. 9 seed in a 64-team field to advance this far. 
</P>
<P>
 And who knows the last time someone recorded consecutive victories over the 
likes of Knight (three national championships) and Smith (two NCAA titles). 
Last week, as the Eagles prepared for the tournament, O'Brien made fun of his 
place in the East Regional coaching pecking order. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Knight. There was Smith. There was Temple's John Chaney. And then 
there was O'Brien, who had one tournament victory compared to the combined 106 
of the other three. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put Bobby Knight, Dean Smith, John Chaney and Jim O'Brien on the same 
list, you say, 'What's wrong with that screen?"' O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing wrong with it now. Of course, don't mention that to O'Brien, 
who said he hasn't proved a thing -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still the same thing," he said. "When you start thinking about how many 
wins those guys have. I've got three wins in the NCAA. Nothing's really 
changed. We've been lucky this week." 
</P>
<P>
 Is that so? According to Eagle forward Malcolm Huckaby, luck didn't have a 
thing to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it was another excellent ballgame by us," said Huckaby, who seems to 
be repeating himself these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the Eagles took advantage of their quickness, their three-point 
shooters and their heart. Knight knew it early on. With three minutes gone and 
Boston College already up by six points, he turned to someone on the Hoosier 
bench and said, "This is as tough a bunch of kids as we've played all year." 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana's plan was simple: Stop Boston College star center Bill Curley, make 
the Eagles convert three-pointers, confuse them with the Hoosiers' renowned 
motion offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for fifth-seeded Indiana, one out of three won't do it. Curley, 
who made only three of 11 shots, finished with 11 points, and power forward 
Danya Abrams converted only two of 10 from the field. But Curley compensated 
for his offensive struggles by grabbing 13 rebounds and holding Hoosier leading 
scorer Alan Henderson to a little-noticed 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Eagle guard Howard Eisley led everyone with 18 points (four of six 
on three-point shots), and Gerrod Abram and Huckaby each added 15 points. 
Boston College made 10 of 16 three pointers, seven of 10 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have helped off (on Curley) too much," said Hoosier forward Pat 
Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by as many as 14 points in the first half, Indiana eventually 
overtook the Eagles early in the second and held a 64-59 lead with 6:55 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Abrams hit a shot, followed shortly by an Eisley three-pointer. There 
were four more lead changes until 2:05, when Boston College pulled away for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody said they beat North Carolina and it was a fluke," said Indiana 
guard Damon Bailey, whose career ended Friday evening. "Some say beating 
Indiana was a fluke. I don't know that." 
</P>
<P>
 This much is sure: The Eagles remain in Miami, the Hoosiers head home to 
Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't come here just to win one game," Curley said. "We want to go 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 They are. To the final eight.

THERE'S STILL A FLICKER OF HOPE FOR KINGS; HOCKEY: LOS ANGELES REMAINS EIGHT 
POINTS BEHIND SAN JOSE AFTER BEATING EDMONTON, 4-3, IN OVERTIME.

 Living on the edge took on a new meaning for the Kings, who were 2:02 away 
from falling 10 points behind the San Jose Sharks in the race for the final 
playoff spot in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 And King Coach Barry Melrose knew what a loss would have meant with 10 games 
remaining in the season. "You guys would be writing our obituary if we lose," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold the presses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings remained eight points out of a playoff spot, and it took a bit of 
high drama and some luck to defeat the Edmonton Oilers, 4-3, in overtime here 
on Friday night before a sellout crowd of 17,503 at Northlands Coliseum. King 
left wing Mike Donnelly redeemed himself when he forced overtime with his goal 
on a breakaway at 17:58 of the third period and then won it at 2:24 of overtime 
with a blast from just inside the left circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked pretty bleak," said Donnelly, whose goals were his 19th and 20th of 
the season. "For us, we knew we had to win. It was a huge game." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Edmonton Coach Glen Sather: "We had them on the ropes." 
</P>
<P>
 What helped the Kings escape, actually, were two outstanding saves by 
goaltender Kelly Hrudey on Jason Arnott and Scott Thornton with the Oilers on 
the power play. It was Donnelly who had taken an untimely hooking penalty at 
15:43 of the third. 
</P>
<P>
 A depressed Donnelly sat in the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was he thinking? 
</P>
<P>
 "Please don't score," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Hrudey made the two saves, and Donnelly came out of the penalty box 
and was set up on the breakaway by defenseman Alexei Zhitnik. Donnelly has had 
problems scoring on the breakaway all season. But he used his superior speed 
and finished it off by sticking a back-hander under Oiler goaltender Fred 
Brathwaite's glove. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, Brathwaite, who is now 0-9-1, said: "I'd like to make sure 
they don't make the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe it won't matter what the Kings (25-38-11) do in their final 10 
games. After the Sharks struggled with two losses (Ottawa, Kings) and a tie 
against the Kings, they seemed to turn into a new team this week. On what had 
been considered a formidable road trip, San Jose tied Pittsburgh, beat Toronto 
on Thursday and defeated Winnipeg on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In five days, the Sharks' lead went from five points to eight points over the 
ninth-place Kings, who lead the Mighty Ducks by two points. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Kings could have trailed the Sharks by 10 points. Luck seemed to be on 
the Kings' side in more ways than one on Friday. There was a scary moment 
midway through the second period when King right wing John Druce suffered a 
sprained neck, mild concussion and a cut above his right eye after Oiler 
defenseman Gord Mark smashed him into the boards with a check from behind at 
9:33. 
</P>
<P>
 Druce crumpled to the ice and was attended to by King trainer Pete Demers. He 
did not return and will be re-evaluated today. "It's all right," Druce said. 
"I'm a little dizzy and my neck is a little stiff. It's like I jammed my neck." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark received a five-minute major for checking from behind and an automatic 
game misconduct. But the Kings could not capitalize on the five-minute major, 
which finished off a stretch in which they were on the power play for 6:53. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings took a 2-1 lead after first-period goals from Tony Granato (seventh 
of the season) only 38 seconds into the period and Darryl Sydor at 17:21. 
Sydor's goal broke a 1-1 tie. For Granato, it was his first goal on the road, 
and he had not scored since Jan. 25 against Winnipeg. King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers honored Wayne Gretzky with a special pregame ceremony, giving him a 
bronzed plaque of the score sheet from the night he scored his first NHL goal 
in 1979. The crowd gave him a long standing ovation. . . . The theme seemed to 
be Friday Bloody Friday when referee Terry Gregson and King defenseman Alexei 
Zhitnik suffered bloody noses in the first three minutes of the second period. 
The game was delayed for about five minutes when Gregson went down with a 
bloody nose in the left corner in the Kings' zone after Oiler right wing Scott 
Thornton accidentally high-sticked him in the face 1:39 into the period. 
Thornton was going to make a check and his stick clipped Gregson, who started 
bleeding profusely. After the delay, Zhitnik got hit in the face with a puck at 
the three-minute mark, but he made it to the bench before he started bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Left wing Warren Rychel returned to the lineup after missing one game with a 
broken nose. Rychel wore a face shield to protect his nose and left eye. He 
suffered the broken nose on Sunday in a fight against Shark enforcer Jeff 
Odgers. . . . The best way not to break into the Kings' lineup? Get traded to 
Los Angeles. Among the scratches were three players who were traded to the 
Kings this season -- defensemen Doug Houda and Jim Paek and forward Dixon Ward.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA TOURNAMENTS; MISSOURI AND ARIZONA: DESTINY IS FINAL 
FOUR; WEST: BOTH HAVE SPECIAL INCENTIVE FOR WINNING REGIONAL FINAL AT THE 
SPORTS ARENA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Missouri and Arizona run into each other today at the Sports Arena to decide 
which, as the best in the West, will be going to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not going to be easy for either of them. The West Regional final features 
a No. 1-seeded Missouri team that prides itself on doing the dirty work. If 
somebody mentions one more time how hard the Tigers work in the trenches, 
change those uniforms to overalls. 
</P>
<P>
 After handing out assorted bumps and bruises while touring the Big Eight 
undefeated, Missouri is 28-3 and contemplating the large issues of our time: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Do they dislike reporters as much as it seems? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Where does Norm Stewart get his sense of humor? 
</P>
<P>
 -- And most important, are they a team of destiny? 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure hope so," said forward Jevon Crudup. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it's a faith Missouri shares with Arizona. The Wildcats are 28-5 and 
looking for some sort of atonement after getting knocked out of the NCAA 
tournament in the first round the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 If Missouri busily plumbs the depths of disdain for the media for allegedly 
slighting the Tigers this season, it probably can't touch how Lute Olson reacts 
when the subject is Arizona's recent tournament failings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got people in here just waiting for us to fall and start shooting 
arrows again," Olson said at a news conference Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheap shots are part of this whole thing. I don't even want to respond to 
that. There are people who are not successful who hate to see people be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson's Arizona teams have lost five first-round games since 1985, but the 
fact that this group is one victory away from the Final Four has not eluded 
center Joseph Blair or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair knew something was up when Olson brought former Arizona star Sean 
Elliott to a practice to talk about how great it was to be in the 1988 Final 
Four. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair said he was totally underwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blahdy, blah, blah," he said. "I didn't want to hear about it, I want to be 
in it. I guess it was supposed to be some kind of motivational speech or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 The motivation for both teams is plenty, not the least being a degree of 
respect they say has been missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Melvin Booker, one of eight seniors playing for Stewart, said it's been 
a habit for people to forget about anything happening in Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been overlooked all season," Booker said. "That's cool with me. I'll 
take it. Keep picking us to lose. I'll take it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take the underdog's role," he said. "Who's this Missouri team? They're 
still trying to figure out. I'll take that, to the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 The respect issue stems not only from questions about Missouri's No. 1 
seeding, but also from a couple of troubling defeats, one by Notre Dame and the 
other when Arkansas won by 52 points. 
</P>
<P>
 So what? 
</P>
<P>
 "People got too wrapped up with that," Crudup said of Arkansas' 120-68 
victory. "You're going to have nights like that." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a positive slant. Looking at it that way, Missouri fell only 18 
three-pointers short of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Arizona is trying to keep its own skeletons in the closet, like 
losing to Washington. But the Wildcats won their Notre Dame game by 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to the matchup is how well Arizona hangs with Missouri's active front 
line and how each team's guards play on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Booker, Julian Winfield and Paul O'Liney are the Tiger trio, and they go up 
against Arizona's three-deep backcourt of Khalid Reeves, Damon Stoudamire and 
Reggie Geary. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri needs to play Arizona's backcourt a lot better than it did 
Syracuse's. Missouri won in overtime, 98-88, but Adrian Autry had 31 points and 
Lawrence Moten 29 for Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said he expects to equal the effort against Reeves and Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can do as well, we ought to hold them somewhere in the 60s," Stewart 
deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Arizona is invigorated by its 82-70 victory over Louisville 
when Reeves dropped 29 points on the Cardinals and Blair made life miserable 
for Clifford Rozier by bumping him around. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair said he was glad it was a tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If those had been Pac-10 officials, our whole team would have fouled out," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 How well Blair bumps with Crudup and Kelly Thames is going to be important, 
but the big scene will be in the backcourt once again with Booker, Reeves and 
Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
 Booker has been getting a lot of mileage out of the cap he has been wearing 
this week, the one with "Final Four" stitched on the front. 
</P>
<P>
 But why wear it? Is it for inspiration? Is he looking too far ahead? Is his 
head cold? 
</P>
<P>
 "I just need a haircut," Booker said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to grooming, though, there is only one king and it is 
Stoudamire. A self-proclaimed neatnik, Stoudamire broke his teammates up when 
he took a full-sized iron with him on a team trip to Australia last off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 The time was right to give Stoudamire a nickname. It was entirely appropriate, 
Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Iron man," Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair, himself, is story waiting to be told. Just don't call him Joe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe is a car mechanic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Joseph? 
</P>
<P>
 "Joseph is a tall, handsome, basketball player," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-9, 240-pound sophomore from Houston has three tattoos. "Baby Blair," to 
distinguish him from his older brother, "Big Blair," is tattooed on his 
shoulder. The initials JB are tattooed just above his navel. And a tattoo of a 
basketball zipping through a hoop is on his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 That one may be his favorite. Blair likes to stand in front of the mirror and 
look at the ball-and- hoop tattoo. "If that doesn't inspire you, what can?" 
Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
 What indeed? Somebody may get tattooed today, but even it's a close game, one 
thing is certain. No matter what the score, the winner is going to the Final 
Four.

A SEASON TO FORGET; THE '93 METS WERE SO BAD, EVEN DWIGHT GOODEN WAS READY TO 
GIVE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1993 New York Mets lost a major league-high 103 games, but they did it 
with style. 
</P>
<P>
 They lost with sprays of bleach bursting in air and bombs blasting on 
clubhouse floors and outside players' car doors. 
</P>
<P>
 They began the season with rape allegations hanging overhead and a boycott of 
the media, watched Vince Coleman outrage both coasts with an explosive-device 
incident that injured a child outside Dodger Stadium, and had to go on a 
six-game winning streak merely to finish the season with 59 victories -- their 
fewest since Casey Stengel was their manager and was moved to say, "Can't 
anybody here play this game?" 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe most telling of all, the 1993 New York Mets had their proudest, most 
popular player wondering if he shouldn't get out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't lie to you, it did cross my mind," Dwight Gooden said the other day. 
"I never thought it would get to that point. But last year -- especially when 
you come into the ballpark and you see guys where you don't know if they really 
care or if they even have any pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just say, 'Man, I don't know if I want to go through this again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The list of high-profile players -- from Bobby Bonilla to Darryl Strawberry to 
Gregg Jefferies -- who have found playing in New York too much to bear is long 
and continually growing. 
</P>
<P>
 But it had never included Gooden, not during his drug-rehabilitation stint in 
1987, not during his shoulder problems, not even when his good friend 
Strawberry was allowed to sign with the Dodgers after the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden arrived in New York in 1984 as a 20-year-old and has maintained a 
degree of dignity that has kept him free from the harshest criticism and 
allowed him to experience the best of playing for the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have never imagined the things that took place (last season)," he 
said. "Something happened and you'd say, 'Well, it can't get any worse.' Then 
the next week, something else. It went on and on like that." 
</P>
<P>
 After Coleman's incident in L.A., a firecracker was thrown near a group of 
reporters in the Met clubhouse. And after that, bleach was sprayed onto a 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Bret Saberhagen, who has been injured for most of his two years with 
the Mets, later acknowledged responsibility for both incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day I averted a controversy in the locker room, I was ahead of the 
game," said Jay Horowitz, longtime Met public relations director. "It was an 
embarrassment for everybody. I was embarrassed, Fred (Wilpon, the team 
president) was embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilpon was embarrassed enough to denounce Coleman, who was eventually traded 
to the Kansas City Royals for Kevin McReynolds, and Saberhagen, and to declare 
that the Mets would not tolerate any more such behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the season, Wilpon rehired Joe McIlvaine, who most recently had run 
the San Diego Padres, to clean house. McIlvaine let Howard Johnson, Eddie 
Murray and Sid Fernandez go as free agents last winter, tried unsuccessfully to 
trade Bonilla and Saberhagen, and has assembled a group of young, unproven 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden is the last remaining Met from the 108-victory, championship season in 
1986, or even the National League East title season of 1988. He says that, 
since a talk with McIlvaine last winter, he no longer is wondering whether it 
would be better to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is wistful for the old days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you, it happened quickly," Gooden said. "I remember after the 
season was over in '86, I was talking with my father. I figured we'd be one of 
the top teams like in the days where Oakland had those great teams in 
consecutive seasons, like the Yankees." 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden, 29, says he recognizes that, as an elder statesman among no-names, he 
has a responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be somebody here to let them know that it's better than the last 
couple of years, somebody that's been there through the good times as well as 
the not-so-good times," Gooden said. "Just to be that shoulder that they can 
lean on and let them know that New York isn't all bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The loud, talented team of Keith Hernandez, Ron Darling, Gary Carter, 
Strawberry and Lenny Dykstra now is a quiet team of Jeremy Burnitz, Jeff Kent, 
Todd Hundley and Ryan Thompson. And they will misbehave at their own risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilpon, who had been a very low-profile president, reiterated the front 
office's resolve with a speech to the team on the first day of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 "He basically sat down and told us, 'Hey, no more screwing around,' " 
Saberhagen said. " 'When you guys are at the ballpark, your butts are mine. If 
you guys are going to act out of line, there's going to be some serious 
consequences in the future.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'If I'd have taken this stand last year, your butt would have been 
in a sling.' He pretty much used me as an example, but rightfully so." 
</P>
<P>
 Saberhagen, who had never had major problems before last year, says he is kind 
of surprised to still be with the team, but hopes to have a better relationship 
with sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incidents with the firecrackers and stuff, I was just trying to loosen up 
the guys," Saberhagen said. "When things are going bad, you try to keep 
everybody loose. . . . You try to make things go a little smoother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, a couple of practical jokes didn't go over too well. This year, 
there's been a couple of chances where I've had an opportunity to pull a couple 
of practical jokes -- I'm trying to stay away from them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something where you've got to learn from your mistakes, especially when 
they backfire in a big way. A lot of people were upset with me, I was upset 
with myself. But for them, they can go home and go to sleep and forget about 
it. I've got to go home and I've got to live with it for the rest of my 
career." 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign of how serious the issue is being taken, Wilpon suspended Saberhagen 
for the first six games of this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden said Saberhagen's actions were magnified by the sour mood of the 
clubhouse and media reports -- and were not the signs of a malcontent. If the 
team had been winning, Gooden said, Saberhagen's jokes would have been 
laughable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing with Vince Coleman, I think, was uncalled for and there's no excuse 
for that," Gooden said. "But Bret's incident with the bleach thing, I think it 
was more of a joke. I remember when we had Roger McDowell, he used to do stuff 
that was 10 times worse than that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gooden cannot explain the losing so easily. The Mets started the 1993 
season under then-Manger Jeff Torborg excited about their potential, believing 
that the 90 losses in 1992 were an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had a good chance," Gooden said. "I figured if myself, 
Saberhagen and Fernandez were healthy, and we had Murray, Coleman, Hojo, Bobby 
Bonilla . . . just on paper, we should have been right there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things just happened. We got out of the box bad, and you could say we had 
some injuries, but we were playing bad before the injuries occurred. I guess it 
was just a bad mix and it definitely was time for changes. So hopefully now, 
being picked to finish at the bottom, maybe we can reverse it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Said McIlvaine: "It seemed like Pandora opened her box last year and 
everything that could have gone wrong went wrong. Both on and off the field. 
You forget the Dodgers had one a couple of years ago like that, too, where 
everything went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just hope that was the bottom of the abyss and hope you can climb back 
out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Torborg was fired last May and disciplinarian Dallas Green was hired. As the 
team unraveled before his eyes, Green watched who handled the pressure well, 
who did not, and planned for this year -- and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a head and heart guy -- I don't think you can survive in this game unless 
you've got that, unless you're just a great, great talent," Green said. "And 
unfortunately, baseball has come to the point where there's not a lot of those 
great talents. There's a lot of people playing this game who really haven't 
earned the right to play it in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a group of people that didn't mix well together, and unfortunately, 
the frustrations kept building and building and they got away from individuals 
and they got away from the team. And we've tried to eliminate that in the 
winter time and also in our preparation work this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you lose 103 games, it's easy to throw your hands up and say everybody's 
a loser. But everybody on the 1993 Mets weren't losers, and they cared very 
much about winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gooden: "Dallas said, 'Well, if we can finish .500, that's great.' But 
when you've been winning your whole career, (winning is) the only thing you 
want to do."

FIGURE SKATING / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; KWAN 11TH AFTER TECHNICAL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michelle Kwan fell out of contention Friday in the women's competition and for 
the second consecutive year, the United States will leave figure skating's 
World Championships without a medal. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest skater ever to represent the United States in the World 
Championships, Kwan, 13, of Torrance, finished a disappointing 11th in the 
technical program at Chiba, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt good, but I could have done better," she said. "It just didn't 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The first three positions are held by Japan's Yuka Sato, France's Surya Bonaly 
and Canada's Josee Chouinard, with today's freestyle program accounting for 
two-thirds of the final score. 
</P>
<P>
 The three medalists from last month's Winter Olympics -- Ukraine's Oksana 
Baiul, the United States' Nancy Kerrigan and China's Chen Lu, are not competing 
in Chiba. 
</P>
<P>
 The ice dance competition also was diminished when the silver and bronze 
medalists from the Winter Olympics -- Russia's Maia Usova and Alexander Zhulin 
and Great Britain's Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean -- withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a fall by Russia's Evgeni Platov in Friday's free dance, he and 
partner Oksana Gritschuk were not pressed. They won all four phases of the 
competition in adding the gold medal from the World Championships to the one 
they won in the Winter Olympics at Hamar, Norway.  
</P>
<P>
 France's Sophie Moniotte and Pascal Lavanchy finished second, and Finland's 
Susanna Rahkamo and Patri Kokko were third. The United States' Elizabeth 
Punsalan and Jerod Swallow were 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 With competition in three of the four disciplines completed, the United States 
has had only two top-10 finishes, a sixth by Jenni Meno and Todd Sand of Costa 
Mesa in pairs and a seventh by Scott Davis of Great Falls, Ida., in men's 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwan, competing in Chiba as a replacement for Kerrigan, could move into the 
top 10, but she will have to skate better in her freestyle program than she did 
in the technical program Friday, when she fell on a triple lutz and failed to 
complete a required combination. 
</P>
<P>
 She appeared awe-struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really exciting to be out there skating with the people I saw in the 
Olympics," said Kwan, who went to Norway as an alternate but did not compete. 
"It's just a great experience being here. But it's hard. The competition is 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the United States figure skating team failed to win medals in 
consecutive World Championships was in 1963 and '64, when it was still 
rebuilding after a 1961 plane crash killed the entire team. RANDY HARVEY

 Cleveland outfielder Albert Belle, 27, who led the American League in runs 
batted in last year, says he knows what he is going to do with his life: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to retire at 40, practice for 10 years, then join the senior golf 
tour when I turn 50."  
</P>
<P>
 Belle, who has been playing golf for only three years, has a 22 handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of luck.

 Trivia time: Denny Crum, Steve Fisher, Bob Knight, Mike Krzyzewski, Rollie 
Massimino, Dean Smith and John Thompson are active Division I basketball 
coaches who have won NCAA championships. Who are the remaining two?  
</P>

 All-world: John Steigerwald in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: "So far, the best 
name of the year has to go to the basketball player for Monsignor Rice High 
School in New York: Scientific Mapp.

 Ho hum: C.W. Nevius in the San Francisco Chronicle: "(Jason) Kidd's 
announcement that he was leaving Cal for the NBA had all the suspense of a 
layup."

 Panic time: Talk-show host Arsenio Hall: 
</P>
<P>
 "Magic's announcement has left me with a bittersweet feeling. Sweet because 
nothing makes him happier than involvement with the Lakers. Bitter because Dyan 
Cannon has my floor seats, and I sold my parking pass to Kurt Rambis."

 Ball four: He has a hit on the charts, but Tim McGraw, son of former 
Philadelphia Phillie pitcher Tug McGraw, is in a tight jam. The country-western

</P>
<P>
 The Minneapolis-based National Coalition of Racism in Sports and the Media, 
which has been active in protesting the Atlanta Braves' tomahawk chop, has 
targeted McGraw and his newly released album, "Not a Moment Too Soon." It 
complains that the lyrics and melodies are nothing more than stereotypes of

NHL ROUNDUP; SHARKS BEAT JETS, MOVE CLOSER TO A PLAYOFF BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Igor Larionov scored three times to lead the San Jose Sharks to an 8-3 victory 
over the Winnipeg Jets Friday night at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory leaves the Sharks with 69 points in the Pacific Division and moves 
them closer to a playoff berth. They have an eight-point lead over the Kings, 
who beat Edmonton, and a 10-point lead over the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended a three-game winning streak for the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Larionov scored in the first minute on a shot that appeared to bounce off 
goalie Tim Cheveldae's skate. His second goal came on a hard shot from about 10 
feet, and his third was scored on a shot that bounced off Cheveldae's shoulder 
as he tried to block it. The puck dribbled into the net to give the Sharks a 
4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Larionov was expecting more from the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read in the newspaper this morning that the Jets had three good games and I 
thought that it was going to be tougher," the 33-year-old center said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a crucial game to us and everybody was prepared to put in their best 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets were coming off Wednesday's 3-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens, 
but Coach John Paddock was calmly philosophical about Friday's loss to the 
expansion club, a result that dashed Winnipeg's hopes for a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hockey is a humbling game at certain times," said Paddock, who is also 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 6, Hartford 3 -- Jason Dawe and Wayne Presley scored twice at Buffalo 
as the Sabres eliminated the Whalers from playoff contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Fuhr stopped 29 shots to pull Buffalo to within one point of Boston for 
fifth place in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whalers have 56 points -- 19 fewer than eighth-place Florida with nine 
games to play. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 5, Dallas 3 -- Brett Hull's 50th goal put the Blues ahead to stay, 
and he finished with three goals at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Hull, who has 51 goals, reached the 50-goal mark for the fifth consecutive 
season. Last season, he finished with 54. The hat trick was his third this 
season and the 21st of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Hull came close to his first four-goal game when he scored into an empty net 
with 1:19 to play, but Kevin Miller was offside. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 2, Washington 2 -- Keith Primeau scored with 1:32 left to help the Red 
Wings gain a tie at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 After Washington scored on its first two shots of the game, by Sylvain Cote 
and Kelly Miller, the Red Wings appeared headed for their fourth loss in five 
games at the Joe Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers 5, Vancouver 2 -- The Rangers extended their Atlantic 
Division lead over New Jersey to four points with the victory at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Leetch and Brian Noonam each scored twice for the Rangers.

MCNALL ORDERED TO PAY BANK $2.1 MILLION; HOCKEY: KING OWNER DEFAULTED ON 
PERSONAL LOAN RECEIVED FROM A TORRANCE BANK, JUDGE RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 King owner Bruce McNall has been ordered by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge 
to pay a Torrance bank $2.1 million for defaulting on a personal loan, court 
documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 The judgment is the latest setback for the sports mogul in what has become a 
growing list of business-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Court papers show Judge John P. Shook's judgment was entered last week in 
favor of Republic Bank, which sued McNall in October. The bank alleged that 
McNall defaulted on the unsecured promissory note when he failed to pay $1.875 
million last May as required. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall officials have previously said a settlement with the bank was in the 
works. Court documents show that the bank received a judgment for the entire 
amount it was seeking, along with court costs, fees and interest that 
accumulates from March 15 until the judgment is paid. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, a McNall spokesman said: "The matter has been concluded 
amicably, and we will address the satisfaction of the judgment shortly." 
</P>
<P>
 Documents filed by Republic last fall included a sworn statement from Republic 
Vice President Lee Marzahl, who referred to McNall's lack of ability to quickly 
convert assets into cash. In interviews, McNall officials have denied he is 
experiencing liquidity problems. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall was sued last week in federal court in New York by Dutch-owned European 
American Bank for allegedly defaulting on a separate loan. 
</P>
<P>
 European American is alleging McNall owes $27.8 million in principal on a 
loan, and at least $442,864 in interest. McNall officials say the European 
American lawsuit is without merit, adding that McNall disputes that the debt 
even exists. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall is trying to wrap up a $60-million deal to sell 65% of the Kings to 
telecommunications executive Jeffrey Sudikoff and partner Joseph Cohen. The 
sale is largely to help McNall rid himself of a loan with Bank of America, 
which extended his businesses $90 million in loans and credit. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall has consistently denied that he is experiencing financial problems. 
Those familiar with his finances say he has been especially hard hit by such 
factors as a decline in the rare coin business, a high debt level and losses 
from his ownership in the Toronto Argonauts football team.

NHL TO INVESTIGATE SIX WHALERS AFTER BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six Hartford Whalers -- including captain Pat Verbeek and star rookie Chris 
Pronger -- were suspended Friday for their involvement in a barroom brawl near 
Buffalo, N.Y., but the NHL promptly reversed the decision of team owner Richard 
Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman rescinded the suspensions, pending the outcome 
of an investigation that he ordered into the incident.His decision came hours 
after Gordon announced the suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reaction of the club was inappropriate and it was dealt with," said Bob 
Goodenow, the NHL Players Assn. executive director who was in Buffalo Friday 
night to talk to the players. 
</P>
<P>
 The six players and two assistant coaches were involved in the brawl early 
Thursday -- more than three hours after the team's midnight curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goodenow said there was no curfew on Wednesday night, "notwithstanding 
what the team said." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon called their actions embarrassing and repugnant when he announced their 
suspensions. He suspended Pronger for the rest of the season. Verbeek, Geoffrey 
Sanderson, Marc Potvin, Mark Janssen and Todd Harkins were to be suspended from 
Friday night's game in Buffalo against the Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant coaches Kevin McCarthy and Paul Gillis were suspended indefinitely. 
Their suspensions remained in effect, a spokesman for the Whalers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The six players and McCarthy were arrested at 3:55 a.m. after they got into a 
dispute with bouncers at Kelly's Network, a bar owned by Buffalo Bill 
quarterback Jim Kelly. Gillis was not arrested, but he was present during the 
dispute.

GOLF ROUNDUP; ZOELLER LEADS AS RAIN DELAY STRANDS TPC GOLFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fuzzy Zoeller finished off a 67 after a lengthy rain delay and was the leader 
in the clubhouse Friday in the uncompleted second round of the Players 
Championship at Ponte Vedra, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no assurance, however, that Zoeller's advantage would stand up when 
Greg Norman and 71 others complete second-round play this morning. They were 
stranded by darkness on the TPC at Sawgrass after an early-morning squall 
stopped play for almost three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 After the second round is completed, the field will be cut to the low 70 
scorers and the third round will begin at 8:30 a.m. PST. 
</P>
<P>
 This event was already completed, however, by John Daly and defending champion 
Nick Price. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly struggled to an 80 and completed two rounds at 154, 10 over par. Price, 
who used a victory here last season as the springboard to player-of-the-year 
honors and had finished first and second in his last two starts, shot 76-149 
and went home, confident he failed to qualify for the final two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoeller reached the tournament halfway point at 133, 11 under par. 
</P>
<P>
 When darkness fell, Norman had caught him and at least two others had a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman, the British Open champion who opened with a 63, was two under for the 
round and 11 under for the tournament with eight holes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who completed the second round, Hale Irwin and Gary Hallberg were 
next at 137. Irwin, 48, a three-time U.S. Open winner now in his 27th season on 
the tour, had a 70. Hallberg shot 69. 
</P>
<P>
 The current U.S. Open champion, Lee Janzen, shot a 75, 10 shots higher than 
his opening round, and was at 140. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Isao Aoki, making his first start of the year on the Senior PGA Tour, 
and Larry Gilbert each shot four-under 68 for a one-stroke lead over three 
other golfers in the opening round of the Doug Sanders Celebrity Classic at 
Kingwood, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibby Gilbert, Chi Chi Rodriguez and Tommy Aaron were one shot back, followed 
by Jim Albus, a winner two weeks ago at San Antonio, Jim O'Hern, and defending 
champion Bob Charles, all at 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Gilbert, a career club pro who joined the senior tour last year, played 
bogey-free golf and converted four birdies to tie Aoki.

GOLF / DINAH SHORE TOURNAMENT; TWO LONG HITTERS SHARE LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as Jan Stephenson was in the '70s and '80s, Michelle McGann is the 
glamour star of women's golf in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Her trademark is a colorful ensemble with a coordinated wide-brim hat. She is 
easily recognizable from the distance of a Laura Davies drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is more to McGann -- just as there is to Stephenson -- than glamour. 
At 24, the long-hitting Floridian is a budding star on the LPGA. Although she 
has failed to win in six years, McGann has shown steady improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 And on a cloudy, but rainless, Friday here, McGann shot a 68, four under par, 
at Mission Hills Country Club that put her into a tie with England's 
long-hitting Davies at the halfway point of the $700,000 Nabisco Dinah Shore. 
Both are six under par with identical 70-68 -- 138 cards for 36 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just one shot behind are Donna Andrews, Alice Miller and Stephenson. 
Stephenson, slowly returning to form after a mugging nearly ended her career in 
1990, shot a 69 in the second round. Nancy Lopez, tied for the first-round 
lead, is at 140, two shots back, after shooting a 72. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dinah Shore Course at Mission Hills is 6,446 yards, one of the longest on 
the tour, so it is not surprising that last year's two longest hitters are tied 
for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies averaged 253.9 yards, McGann 251.3. That's a bit deceptive, though. 
McGann uses a driver most of the time, whereas the powerful Davies usually hits 
a two-iron. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the women players are in awe of Davies. She played the first two 
rounds with Lopez, who marvels at her ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to watch her hit the ball," Lopez said. "I'm a pretty long driver, 
compared to the other girls, but I'm not close to Laura. If she started hitting 
her driver all the time and kept it in the fairway, we would be in real 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "After making two bogeys in a row, Laura pulled out her driver on the 16th. I 
hit a good drive and she outdrove me 85 yards. She plays a different game." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies explained why she hasn't used her driver more than four times a round 
here.  
</P>
<P>
 "This, like most of the courses, is designed for the back tees," she said. 
"I'm not complaining, but our courses are set up for the average hitter. I've 
noticed that if I hit my driver, I face much more trouble unless I hit it 
absolutely straight. The fairways narrow at that point and traps are a problem. 
Maybe my game is better because I think these things out now." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies had seven birdies, but she had some problems from the tees and also had 
three bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
 McGann, in the first group of the day off No. 10, went out in 33, had her only 
bogey on No. 3, her 12th hole, and missed several other birdie chances. 
</P>
<P>
 McGann, who went directly from high school to the tour, has shown improvement 
each year. She was No. 12 on the money list, earning $315,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 She credits Dave Stockton, the player of the year on the Senior PGA Tour, for 
part of her improvement. She met him several years ago when she was a classmate 
of Dave Jr., now on the regular tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been very helpful," she said. "He is such a great putter. While 
everyone has their own style, he has stressed following through and I feel I'm 
getting better as a putter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He also has helped my mental game after I told him about my troubles getting 
started. He told me I should start out thinking I was three shots behind. And, 
you know, (although) I bogeyed the first three holes yesterday, I can still win 
it. I know I'll win soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson, 42, was advised that it was a good time to retire after a mugger 
in Miami severely injured her left hand.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was determined that I would be back," she said. "I really worked to get 
myself in condition. I am approaching a peak that will make me better than I 
ever was." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson said she had given some advice to McGann. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her not to get upset because some of the players resent all the 
attention she gets," Stephenson said. "She'll be a great star because she's 
more mature than I was at her age."

NBA ROUNDUP; JOHNSON TAKES CHARGE AND SUNS BEAT MAVERICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Phoenix Suns needed a lift, and Kevin Johnson obliged. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took over the game," Danny Ainge said Friday night after watching the 
speedy point guard score 14 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter, rallying 
the Suns to a 99-94 victory over the Dallas Mavericks at Phoenix. "He made 
jumper after jumper, he distributed the ball. He just took over." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson twice rallied the Suns from six-point deficits in the last quarter, 
and Charles Barkley blocked a shot by Jim Jackson in the final seconds, handing 
the Mavericks their 13th consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 After Barkley's block, Ainge made two free throws, giving Phoenix a 97-92 lead 
with 15 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who made four free throws in the final 27 seconds, made two with 10 
seconds to go after Doug Smith's basket for the Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson had 22 of his 31 points in the second half, but wasn't able to prevent 
the Mavericks' 59th loss in 67 games. 
</P>
<P>
 One more Phoenix victory, or a loss by the Lakers, will clinch a playoff spot 
for the Suns, the second-place team in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 85, Indiana 82 -- Derek Harper's layup with 35 seconds left gave the 
Knicks the lead for good as they survived a late 13-0 run by the Pacers at 
Indianapolis to extend their longest winning streak in 21 years to 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 With Atlanta's loss to the Clippers, New York took over first place in the 
Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 105, Philadelphia 88 -- The Cavaliers shot 51% from the field as 
they handed the 76ers their ninth consecutive home defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss also was the 76ers' 21st in 22 games overall and 13th consecutive 
defeat against the Cavaliers, who haven't lost to Philadelphia since March 31, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 110, Chicago 87 -- The Nets made the most of Scottie Pippen's 
ejection at East Rutherford, N.J., to snap a string of 12 consecutive losses to 
the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls trailed, 61-54, at 7:47 of the third quarter after two free throws 
by Pippen. But 3:18 later, Pippen was called for an offensive foul and got into 
a shoving match with the Nets' Rick Mahorn. Both players were ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 103, Milwaukee 96 -- Karl Malone scored 27 points and John Stockton had 
17 points and 14 assists at Salt Lake City to help the Jazz end a five-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz had lost six of seven after winning 10 straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 106, Detroit 92 -- Frank Brickowski snapped out of a scoring slump 
to help the Hornets win at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Brickowski was scoreless in Wednesday's loss to Atlanta and had failed to 
reach double figures in five of his previous seven games. He scored 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 100, Sacramento 91 -- Tracy Murray scored nine of his 13 points in 
the fourth quarter, helping the Trail Blazers to their 11th consecutive home 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings have lost 28 of 35 road games this season. The Trail Blazers held 
Mitch Richmond to 10 points, 14 under his average.

RETURNING WILKINS GIVES ATLANTA A SHOW; PRO BASKETBALL: GIVEN A ROUSING WELCOME 
BY FANS, HIS 36 POINTS LEAD CLIPPERS TO 97-94 UPSET OF HAWKS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins came back to his old NBA home Friday night and put up the 
kind of numbers Atlanta fans frequently saw during his dozen seasons with the 
Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time he was on the other side, scoring 36 points as the Clippers 
ended Atlanta's four-game winning streak with a 97-94 upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rank this with all the thrills I've had in the game," Wilkins said. "It 
may be No. 1, in fact." 
</P>
<P>
 "You play harder against your friends than your enemies," Clipper Coach Bob 
Weiss said. "When you get traded, there is nobody you would rather beat than 
your buddies who you used to play with. This is special for me, too." 
</P>
<P>
 It also was Weiss' first time back to Atlanta since he was fired after last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins gave the Clippers a 93-92 lead on a rebound layup with one minute 
remaining, and Ron Harper hit an 18-footer and two free throws in the final 13 
seconds as the two sparked a fourth-quarter comeback from a 74-67 deficit. 
Harper finished with 25 points, 12 in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Willis scored 23 points and Stacy Augmon 22 for the Hawks, who went into 
the game with the best home record in the NBA. The loss dropped them out of a 
tie with New York for first place in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Wilkins' first trip to Atlanta since the Hawks traded him to the 
Clippers on Feb. 24 for Danny Manning, who was in foul trouble and scored only 
six points on three-for-10 shooting. Wilkins drew a pregame standing ovation 
that lasted for 1 minute 40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans got me going with a wonderful ovation," Wilkins said. "It just shows 
you that they are genuine people. They are really behind me, even now. I was a 
little choked up, but it was wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawk Coach Lenny Wilkens wasn't at all pleased with his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think we played with the kind of smarts that we have been 
playing with," Wilkens said. "It was just not a very good game for us. It's 
tough because we're in first place and we want to maintain first place. The's 
the whole thing we're playing for. And I was upset because of that." 
</P>
<P>
 A three-pointer from the corner by Randy Woods tied the score, 76-76, with 
9:30 to play before the Hawks appeared to regain control, eventually building 
an 88-81 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper's three-pointer highlighted a 7-0 run that got the Clippers even. 
Mookie Blaylock's tip-in broke the tie before Wilkins converted a three-point 
play for a 91-90 lead. Jon Koncak gave Atlanta the lead again with a 16-footer 
before Wilkins put the Clippers ahead to stay on a rebound layup with one 
minute to play.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; MIDWEST REGIONAL; HOGS SHOW TULSA 
WHO'S BOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, cue the Boss Hog. 
</P>
<P>
 The beefy Razorbacks of Arkansas squashed little Tulsa, 103-84, Friday night 
to advance to the Midwest Regional final against Michigan. The Hogs' foremost 
fan, President Clinton, is expected to attend so the Fab Four just picked some 
Republican backing. 
</P>
<P>
 No announcement was made of the President's intentions, but tournament 
organizers said the doors to Reunion Arena will open an hour earlier than 
scheduled because of extra security and metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe he will be here on Sunday," said Arkansas Coach Nolan 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
 There were rumors the President would turn up for Friday's second half, but 
they were wrong and he was fortunate, the game having begun winding down midway 
through the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the barest promise of anything closer, the teams having met before, 
at Tulsa, with the Golden Hurricane carrying the Hogs into overtime before 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, both of Arkansas' 6-foot-11 freshmen centers were out along with 
No. 2 scorer Scotty Thurman and it was the night before spring break. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of our guys," said Richardson, "took spring break that game." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Tulsa got the full show. For the Golden Hurricane, it was the night 
before the basketball season ended. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th-seeded Golden Hurricane, slayers of fifth-seeded UCLA and 
fourth-seeded Oklahoma State, left its red-hot shooting irons home, leaving it 
all but defenseless in the face of Richardson's thundering-herd front line of 
6-11, 260-pound Darnell Robinson, 6-9, 260-pound Dwight Stewart and 6-7, 
245-pound Corliss Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to double-team Corliss down low," said Tulsa swing man Lou Dawkins. 
"We were just undersized or undermanned," 
</P>
<P>
 Soon they were overwhelmed. Tulsa missed six of its first seven three-point 
shots and found itself down, 21-9. By halftime, it was three for 16 on 
three-pointers and trailed, 44-29. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson, a portrait of Wes Unseld as a young man, finished with 21 points 
and nine rebounds in the 30 minutes Richardson allotted him. Richardson went 
nine-deep while the game was close to competitive and called his Hogs off later 
or it could have been ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played about as hard as we could play," said Tulsa Coach Tubby Smith. "I 
think Arkansas played about as well as they could play." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't flatter yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nahh," said Richardson, "we're way better than we played. We're a young 
basketball team. Some of our young kids haven't scratched the surface." 
</P>
<P>
 When they do, those Tulsa kids better not be closer than their television 
sets.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; MIDWEST REGIONAL; MICHIGAN TEACHES 
MARYLAND'S KIDS A LESSON IN WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kids. 
</P>
<P>
 You know how they are today, you can't tell them a thing, so Michigan's 
Wolverines, less than enchanted at the suggestion they had passed any torch, 
showed Maryland's precocious Terrapins what real pressure was. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fab Four, who reached the last two NCAA finals as freshmen and sophomores, 
finally have some of that experience they've always heard people say they were 
missing, and it's not half bad. 
</P>
<P>
 They held the Terrapins, who started all freshmen and sophomores, to one field 
goal in their last 13 shots in the first half, took a 21-point lead and held on 
to win, 78-71, Friday night to advance to the Midwest Regional final against 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Razorbacks start two sophomores and a freshman, themselves, so the 
Wolverines willsee if they're up to another spanking. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballyhooed duel of centers went the same way, Michigan junior Juwan Howard 
outscoring Maryland's freshman of the year Joe Smith, 24-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Howard, the nice Wolverine, consoled Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me I had three more years of this," Smith said, "not to put my head 
down, keep working hard in the off-season." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Terrapins, the off-season is here after an improbable tournament run. 
The young team, coming off a four-year NCAA probation and a two-year tournament 
ban, finished the season with eight losses in 12 games, then surprised St. 
Louis and No. 2 seeded-Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Terrapins came from 10 points behind to overturn Massachusetts and set 
about another rally Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A gritty second half of pressing cut the Michigan lead to 75-69, but Jimmy 
King's steal and layup with 1:33 left cut it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came back," said Maryland Coach Gary Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was typical of the way we played this year. Nobody blew us away this 
year. If we could have gotten a little closer, it would have been interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 The winner, Michigan Coach Steve Fisher, made a subdued appearance at the 
postgame press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not play well (at the end)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That may be an understatement. . . . We're going to have to play better on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were going to win big tonight. We didn't. That might be a lot to 
the credit of Maryland. It's hard. It's harder than it looks to some of you to 
do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I'm going to say Maryland did a nice job of fighting and coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 And Michigan did a good enough job of hanging on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michigan makes great decisions with the basketball," said Williams. "When 
they get in the open court, they usually score. I think that's their experience 
at this level. I don't know how you take that away from a team."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; SOUTHEAST REGIONAL; DUKE FINDS 
ITSELF IN PURDUE'S DOGHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember Duke? Used to be the big name in this tournament. Used to win games 
in this tournament by sheer force of reputation, like that time Christian 
Laettner got the ball against Kentucky and five Wildcats recoiled in awe, 
allowing Laettner to sink the basket that sent Duke to its fifth consecutive 
Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh those vaunted Blue Devils, where have they gone? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, they are here, reportedly set to vie for their sixth regional 
championship in seven years, although you would never know it from all the 
barking and yapping going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, it's Big Dog this, Big Dog that. Glenn (Big Dog) Robinson took a hefty 
bite out of Kansas on Thursday night, scoring 30 points in 20 minutes, 44 for 
the game, and the basketball-watching world can't wait to see more. 
</P>
<P>
 So Duke, two years removed from the NCAA championship, has seen its role 
reduced to Milk Bone in tonight's Southeast Regional final against Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Devil forward Grant Hill has been through this sort of thing before -- he 
was a freshman starter on the Duke team that beat unbeatable Nevada Las Vegas 
in 1991 -- but that didn't prevent him from playing second fiddle on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I am matched up with him," Hill deadpanned, "I guess the thing to do is 
pray. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was talking to Tony (Lang) earlier and we were saying that maybe we can go 
down to the Knoxville dog pound and pick him up before the game, I don't know," 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill called the first half of Purdue's 83-78 victory over Kansas "the Glenn 
Robinson Show." He said he was "just amazed, like everybody else in the 
building." He claimed that when Robinson dunked over Kansas' 7-foot-1 center 
Greg Ostertag, "I gave a high-five to Cherokee (Parks). That was exciting to 
watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski: "One of the keys for us is that whoever goes 
up against Robinson -- because different people will probably be on him -- is 
not to be discouraged or disheartened by him scoring. He's going to score 
points. You don't stop Glenn Robinson, you only hope to contain him." 
</P>
<P>
 Krzyzewski paused to allow the cliche to sink in. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's never been said before," Krzyzewski joked. "That's an original. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill began the week bemoaning the lack of customary pomp surrounding Duke's 
arrival in Knoxville, counting the headlines stolen away by Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tickled by Grant Hill's comments in the paper," Purdue Coach Gene Keady 
said. "If he thinks he's tired about getting no respect, he ought to come to 
West Lafayette. Or go and travel with me around the world. I go on a damn 
mountaintop, and there's some guy wearing a Duke T-shirt. I go out to the 
desert, play some golf in Palm Springs, and there's another guy wearing a Duke 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thinks he's tired of it, he ought to get in our shoes. I can relate to 
what he's saying, because I'm really tired of it, I can tell you that." 
</P>
<P>
 Keady has never been to a Final Four, Purdue hasn't gone since 1980 and once 
this run is done, so is Big Dog's. Robinson is headed for the NBA draft, top of 
his class. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatigue could be a factor because, according to Krzyzewski's calculations, 
Robinson has taken "300 more shots than anybody else on the team" and Robinson 
launched the ball another 33 times Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of got tired," Robinson conceded. "That's why I took myself out of the 
game a couple of times. I didn't want to wear myself down by scoring all those 
points." 
</P>
<P>
 Because not shooting was never an option. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the shots I took, they were just falling," Robinson said. "So I kept 
shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 This is fine by Keady. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sitting there last night saying, 'Man, that was a great shot,' " Keady 
said. "And, 'I don't see how he does it.' And, 'I'm sure glad he's playing for 
us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, a first-team All-American himself, played along as best he could until 
someone asked him, "When's the last time you played a game when you weren't the 
best player on the court?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hill arched an eyebrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I played the Dream Team," he shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was because I was playing against guys I kind of idolized growing up. 
Jordan, Magic -- everybody knows them. When I stepped on the court that night, 
I didn't think I was the best player out there for probably the first time in 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
 And tonight? 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're competing, you have to have confidence in yourself, and I have 
confidence in my game. I'm sure that when I step on that court, I will think 
I'm the best player on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Every dog has its day, Hill was saying. Even that rarest of breeds, the 
underdog from Duke.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; APPROACHING THE ZONE; ARIZONA'S 
HOT-SHOOTING REEVES SAYS HE MERELY IS WARMING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It would be understandable if Khalid Reeves of Arizona had a big smile at 
tipoff of today's NCAA West Regional final against Missouri at the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 In three tournament games, Reeves has been on a scoring spree, averaging 30 
points. He had a game-high 29 in the Wildcats' 82-70 victory over Louisville on 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 And Reeves believes his best tournament games are yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think that I've been in a zone (the last three games)," said 
Reeves, a senior guard from New York City. "I've been in a zone before, and I 
haven't been in one so far. When I'm in a zone, I make at least 85% of my shots 
and we (Arizona) have a big lead and are playing well." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves began the tournament by making 11 of 25 shots for 32 points in 
Arizona's 81-55 first-round rout of Loyola of Maryland. He then followed with a 
10-for-20 effort and 30 points in the Wildcats' 71-58 victory over Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Two great games for most, but not for Reeves, who critically points to his 
three-for-13 shooting from behind the three-point line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first indication for me to tell whether I'm going to have a good game is 
if I shoot my first three-pointer and it goes swoosh, " said Reeves, who led 
Arizona in scoring with a 24.2-point regular-season average. "If that first one 
goes down like that, I know at least three more will follow." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is what happened against Louisville. Reeves made his first 
three-pointer, then went on to make five of 10. He and backcourt mate Damon 
Stoudamire combined for 40 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious that Arizona has a great, talented team with an outstanding 
backcourt," Missouri Coach Norm Stewart said during Friday's news conference. 
"I just hope that we do as well in stopping them like we did against Syracuse. 
Maybe we'll keep them in the 60-point range." 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri will have its defensive stopper, Lamont Frazier, on Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Syracuse, Frazier was able to slow guard Lawrence Moten at key points 
during the overtime, finishing with 17 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a couple of ways we can approach guarding him," Frazier said. 
"It'll be the coaches' decision on whether I guard him everywhere he goes or if 
we try to concentrate and play a team defense on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves has scored 12 or more points in all 33 games for Arizona this season 
and the bigger the nonconference opponent, the better he has played. In the 
Wildcats' early-season games against Michigan, Notre Dame and Kentucky, Reeves 
averaged 34.3 points and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona Coach Lute Olson has watched Reeves' game improve every season since 
he averaged nine points as a freshman reserve in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Khalid's first year, details weren't as important to him as they've become 
now," Olson said. "I think that the reason why he has had such a great year 
this season is that he has become detail conscious. In past years, he just kind 
of floated in and out." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves, who had thought about transferring after his freshman season, blames 
much of his early trouble on a lack of communication with Olson. Instead of 
being a focal point for the team as a point guard, Reeves struggled to fit in 
as a shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a confusion with what my role was," Reeves said. "I didn't know 
what Olson or what the team expected of me. Our roles weren't defined then. I 
wanted to do what I'm doing now, but our team was not structured in that way 
then."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; WOMEN'S WEST REGIONAL; STANFORD 
HAS THE EDGE AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Will the Stanford women's basketball team really have an advantage playing on 
its home court in the NCAA West Regional final against Purdue tonight at 9? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer depends on who is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowd can't score for you and it can't play defense for you," said Rachel 
Hemmer, Stanford's 6-foot-3 junior forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemmer's view is supported by Tara VanDerveer, Stanford's coach, who has 
maintained throughout the tournament that there is nothing magic about Maples 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 VanDerveer said Friday that while she is glad Stanford is playing at home, the 
Cardinal often feels added pressure here and this can work against the team. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lin Dunn, Purdue's coach, isn't buying it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she really believes that, then we ought see if we can change the game over 
to San Jose State," Dunn said. "I've already called over there. The facility is 
available." 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers justify opposing coaches' fear of Maples Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford has won 108 of its last 111 games at home. Its only home losses were 
to UCLA in the 1987-88 season, to Washington in the 1990-1991 season, and to 
Tennessee this season. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Stanford, seeded second in the West, draws large, supportive 
crowds. A sellout crowd of 7,000 attended its 78-62 victory over third-seeded 
Colorado (27-5) in the regional semifinals Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday afternoon, all but 500 tickets had been sold for tonight's final, 
which will be televised live on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford (25-5) is led by Anita Kaplan, a 6-5 junior center who averages 16.8 
points per game. Kaplan was virtually unstoppable in Stanford's regional 
semifinal victory, when she scored 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey Lovelace, a 6-4 sophomore center for Purdue, will be assigned to guard 
Kaplan. What will she do? 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever works," Lovelace said. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Purdue (28-4) defeated 13th-seeded Texas A&M, 82-56, in Thursday's 
other West Region semifinal. The Boilermakers are led by Leslie Johnson, a 6-1 
freshman forward who averages 18.7 points and 9.4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 VanDerveer recently described Johnson as "a female version of Charles 
Barkley." 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue is making its first appearance among the NCAA tournament's final eight 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford won NCAA championships in 1990 and 1992 and advanced to the Final 
Four in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the home court and the home crowd that could be the big difference 
today.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / POSTSEASON TOURNAMENTS; TENNIS / DAVIS CUP; COURIER, 
MARTIN GIVE U.S. 2-0 LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Courier cruised to an easy victory, but Todd Martin needed some big serves 
and strong nerves to give the United States a 2-0 lead over India Friday at New 
Delhi in its bid to reclaim the Davis Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin beat Leander Paes, 6-3, 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-1), after Courier had defeated 
Zeeshan Ali, 6-1, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team can win the best-of-five, first-round World Group series today, 
when Patrick McEnroe and Richey Reneberg meet Paes and Gaurav Natekar in 
doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Paes, ranked 324th in the world, mixed lobs, passes, drop shots and tumbles on 
the grass court to stretch Martin to a fourth-set tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ninth-ranked Martin rifled four service winners, including a 
second-serve ace that kicked up chalk and skidded out of Paes' reach, to win 
the tiebreaker. He closed it out with a forehand service return down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing his first Davis Cup match, Martin said the Indian crowd unnerved him 
in the second set. "It rattled me a little, and that's all it takes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a few words from non-playing captain Tom Gullikson and the other 
players, he said he regained his composure in the third set. 
</P>
<P>
 Paes lost his rhythm in the third set, but he thought he had a mental edge in 
the second and again in the fourth. Martin "pulled out of that situation every 
time," Paes said, and saved a break with another ace on his second serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Martin) is very solid. He comes at you every point, especially the big 
points," Paes said. "Every time you feel you are getting on top of him, he 
comes up with big serves, solid returns, good volleys." 
</P>
<P>
 Courier had no trouble with Ali after Ali won his first service game with four 
straight points. Then Courier romped through the next nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get so far ahead, it's easy to have a letdown," he said. "Having the 
crowd still making noise the whole time kept me in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good start. I'm happy the way the team got off. Hopefully, we'll wrap 
this thing up in the first couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the United States, then the defending champion, was knocked out of 
the first round by Australia. India, led by an inspired Paes, reached the 
semifinals before losing to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has won the Davis Cup 30 times and has been a finalist 27 
other times. India has been in the final three times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Germany and Austria were tied 1-1 after two singles 
matches, played before an uproariously patriotic crowd of 11,000 at Graz, 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Stich, ranked No. 2 in the world, won the first singles against 
Austria's Horst Skoff, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. Thomas Muster, ranked No. 11 in the 
world, then beat No. 28 Marc-Kevin Goellner of Germany, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheered by the Austrian fans, many sporting the national red-white-red flags 
and facial makeup to match, Skoff, ranked No. 80, started strong but tired in 
the third and fourth sets.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PARK LEARNS THAT IT ISN'T NICE TO OFFEND JOE 
WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In his fifth start of the spring, Chan Ho Park bowed often, but was not 
broken. Park, the Korean rookie, struggled some at West Palm Beach, Fla., 
against the Montreal Expos, but he learned a key major league lesson along the 
way -- don't show up the home plate umpire, especially if it's Joe West. 
</P>
<P>
 With the bases loaded in the fifth inning -- Park's last -- Park's body 
language showed that he was upset when West called a borderline pitch a ball to 
Larry Walker, who had doubled in a run against Park in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 West, who had been enjoying Park's respectful bows earlier, did not take the 
gesture warmly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted an inside pitch to be called a strike and he acted like an amateur 
or a minor leaguer," said West, who proceeded to take a cool, hard stare at 
Park. "I think he got the message." 
</P>
<P>
 Park immediately bowed to West, as he had done to start the game and when he 
came to bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was trying to apologize," West said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Park through his interpreter: "I felt I showed an expression of 
disapproval, and I felt he didn't like that." 
</P>
<P>
 After Park struck out Walker and then Darrin Fletcher on a called strike by 
West, Park stopped to say, "I'm sorry," in English to West as Park headed to 
the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Mike Piazza said that as soon as the umpires get used to Park, he 
should have no problem, despite his inexperience with American niceties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is they have to respect his ability," Piazza said. "As he 
establishes himself in the major leagues, then those kinds of things will be 
less and less obvious." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jeff Fassero dominated the Dodgers until the sixth, when Raul Mondesi broke up 
his perfect game with a single. . . . The Dodgers won, 5-3, when Billy Ashley 
hit a two-run homer against Butch Henry in the top of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 After Darryl Strawberry grounded out in the seventh, West ejected him when 
Strawberry complained about some earlier strike calls. TIM KAWAKAMI

 An examination of Joe Carter's broken right thumb revealed a couple of small 
fractures caused by a pitch from Minnesota's Scott Erickson on Wednesday and an 
old fracture that was causing no problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The injury should be completely healed in three to four weeks, and he can 
play as soon as he can tolerate it," Toronto Blue Jay spokesman Howard Starkman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, it was thought Carter would sit out nearly eight weeks, but Carter 
said that he expects to be in the lineup on opening day.

 Michael Jordan bloodied his right knee while stealing a base, even after the 
opposing team's third baseman told him to stay up. 
</P>
<P>
 Players were making the calls in a Class-A exhibition game between the Chicago 
White Sox's Prince William team and Baltimore's Frederick club because the 
umpires left early to attend a union meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the seventh inning, Jordan beat out a grounder to short for his second hit 
in 10 minor league at-bats. He stole second, sliding feet first, and then third 
-- but had a moment of indecision, and went in awkwardly, half-standing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I had to slide," he said. "I thought I had it beat. When I 
slid, it was hard dirt," Jordan said. "He (the Frederick third baseman) said, 
'You're safe. . . . You really didn't have to slide.' "

TRANSITION PLAYER; SINCE BEING TRADED FROM MONTREAL, LEBEAU IS FINDING NICHE 
WITH DUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The morning after he was traded for the first time in his life, Stephan Lebeau 
picked up the newspaper at home in Montreal last month and saw himself staring 
back from the front page. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he joined the Mighty Ducks in Buffalo later that day, he knew he 
had left behind the peculiar pressure and glory of being a Montreal Canadien. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the U.S., it was a tiny line," Lebeau said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had gone from a team that had won 24 Stanley Cups to one that hadn't won 
that many games . 
</P>
<P>
 He had gone from a team whose dressing room is recreated in full and reverent 
detail in the Hockey Hall of Fame to one whose players probably wouldn't be 
recognized if they stood in line to pay admission. 
</P>
<P>
 He had gone from living his boyhood dream to a team that, as a boy, he never 
dreamed would exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebeau, a small, playmaking center -- only 5-10 and 170 pounds, if that -- was 
acquired Feb. 20 in exchange for goalie Ron Tugnutt. Lebeau grew up 30 minutes 
outside Montreal, and the Canadiens held a special place in the imaginations of 
the French-speaking youngsters in his town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hockey was everything for us," he said. "I started playing at the age of 5 
and I was skating at the age of 3. So hockey has been my life since I was born. 
I was on the ice almost every day during wintertime. During summertime, you 
played on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 And almost every day you played, you pretended you played for Les Habitants.  
</P>
<P>
 Lebeau got to live the dream. No one else from his town did, except his 
younger brother, Patrick, who played two games with Montreal during the 1990-91 
season. Stephan was only 25 last year when he lay sprawled on the ice laughing, 
posing with his teammates and the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the greatest achievement of my life," Lebeau said. "The best moment of 
my life, too." 
</P>
<P>
 He was the team's fourth-leading scorer, with 31 goals and 49 assists, and he 
had three goals and three assists in 13 playoff games. With his 
pinpoint-accuracy shot, he led the Canadiens in shooting percentage at 20.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 But after an ankle injury kept him out for long stretches this season and he 
came back only to be a somewhat ineffective third-line center, he knew he was 
going to be traded. He wasn't going to get the ice time he needed to thrive, 
and once he got used to the idea of not being a Canadien, it wasn't the worst 
thing in the world. Where he was going, he would play more -- and hopefully 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a chance to play at least five years in my own city. It was a great 
thing, but now it's over," Lebeau said. "For me, I've turned the page on 
Montreal. I'm very happy to be here, I just want to help the team." 
</P>
<P>
 That he has done. The past week and a half, Lebeau has broken out of his 
adjustment period with five points in four games on two goals and three 
assists. He might be doing even more if the more of the Ducks were good enough 
to finish the chances he creates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a lot of guys who can really play with him," General Manager 
Jack Ferreira said. "(Joe) Sacco has come along, he's got the speed. (Lebeau) 
is a give-and-go type center. You need skill to play that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Lebeau's first nine games as a Duck were no great shakes, at least as far as 
production. He was creating chances, but he didn't break the ice until his 
third game as a Duck, with a goal and an assist against the Quebec Nordiques. 
</P>
<P>
 But the transition wasn't going to be that easy and immediate. He went the 
next six games without a point -- including a disappointing and emotionally 
charged first meeting with the Canadiens. Coach Ron Wilson saw a player who was 
pressing, and was glad the first meeting was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who first tried Lebeau on a small line with wingers Tim Sweeney and 
Terry Yake, lately has had him centering Troy Loney and Sacco -- a blend of 
size and speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's getting a little more comfortable," Wilson said as Lebeau got used to 
his new teammates. "He's a small guy, a little bit like a Cliff Ronning-type 
player in Vancouver. When Cliff gets in trouble, it's when he's trying to 
maneuver through traffic and not move the puck. Stephan (was) pressing a little 
bit with the puck and he's been caught in some traffic. He's got to play away 
from the traffic and move the puck quicker." 
</P>
<P>
 After a month now, the transition has been made, and Lebeau is clearly the 
most skilled player on the team, especially with Anatoli Semenov sidelined by 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not finding it easy to lose so often for the first time in his career, 
but there are trade-offs. He has talked to other players who have left the 
Canadiens -- Stephane Richer, Claude Lemieux, Denis Savard -- and there was a 
theme to what he heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said the pressure was less," Lebeau said. "Montreal is maybe one of the 
toughest places to play because of the pressure from the fans and the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great place to play hockey when things go well, but when things go 
wrong it's probably the worst place to play hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations? 
</P>
<P>
 "People want you to win two Cups in a year," Lebeau said with a smile and a 
shrug. "When you lose a game, they're not happy. So I cannot imagine how it 
would have been in Montreal, what we've been through here, those three games 
without scoring. It's different. It doesn't mean it's better, just hockey's 
been there so long. They're used to winning the Cup every three years, or 
almost." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Ducks, expectations are so much lower. They don't expect to win it 
until four years from now. Really . Wilson does occasionally grant that might 
be optimistic -- so he says maybe they should just aim to make the final in 
their fifth year, not necessarily win it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebeau doesn't scoff at their presumption. He approves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fact that I've won once, but when you win the Cup, you want it back. 
It doesn't mean that by going to a new team I don't want to win another Stanley 
Cup. That's why I'm happy. I heard that they want to win the Cup here five 
years from now."

MIGHTY DUCK NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; MCSWEEN GETS HIS BIG BREAK AND BREAKS OUT 
</P>

<P>
 Finally, at the age of 29, defenseman Don McSween found himself playing 
regularly in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, at 29, Don McSween got chicken pox. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played in the minors seven years," McSween said. "Couldn't I have gotten 
them then?" 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he came down with the classic childhood illness as an adult. He's a 
father for goodness' sake -- and he was the only person in his house itching 
and trying not to scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had them on the bottom of my feet, in my ears, underneath my tongue, in my 
throat," said McSween, who has no idea how he contracted it. 
</P>
<P>
 He only knows that after appearing in only nine NHL games in his first six 
seasons as a pro, he had finally made it with the Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the pox were upon him, and he missed the next seven games. McSween hasn't 
played since the March 6 loss to San Jose, which sent the team's playoffs hopes 
spiraling. But he is healthy now and back in shape, and could return as soon as 
tonight's game against the Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
 McSween, who played on the 1986 NCAA Division I championship team at Michigan 
State, started his career in the Buffalo organization. But after six years, he 
had appeared in nine NHL games, and then only in spot duty. 
</P>
<P>
 This season found him playing with the San Diego Gulls on a free-agent 
contract with time running out on his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're 29, you kind of think your chance has passed you by," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ducks, affiliated with the Gulls, had seen him play and knew he had 
been plus-61 the year before playing with Bill Houlder, now a Duck defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the Duck defense was thinned by injuries in January, the team signed 
McSween to a one-year contract. He proved to be a terrific pickup. With his 
heart and his smart, stay-at-home play, he has solidified a defense prone to 
blunders. 
</P>
<P>
 McSween spent last season playing with Houlder, so he knows how to cover for a 
defenseman who jumps up to try to score. With McSween last season, Houlder was 
plus-50 or so. Without him this season, Houlder has been in the minus-teens all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 McSween is plus-2 after 22 games with the Ducks. And he has scored his first 
two NHL goals -- at an age when most players in the NHL are long past their 
first goal and their last bout with chicken pox. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still something to prove: Terry Yake's pride was dented after Hartford exposed 
him to the expansion draft last season even though he had 22 goals and 53 
points in only 66 games for the Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd like to walk back into the Hartford Civic Center for the first time 
tonight with 30 or 40 goals. Instead, he goes in with 21 -- one less than he 
scored last year when he had far less ice time. 
</P>
<P>
 Yake has played in every Duck game; Bob Corkum and Joe Sacco are the only 
others who have. But he has fallen off in the second half, with only six goals 
since the All-Star break. He has been an important part of the team and is the 
second-leading scorer, but the second-half drop gives ammunition to those (like 
the Whalers) who wondered if his 5-11, 175-pound body is built for a full NHL 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They like Mike: Mikhail Shtalenkov replaced a popular player when he took over 
for backup goalie Ron Tugnutt, who was traded to Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shtalenkov -- a Russian whom his teammates call Mike -- has made plenty of 
friends with a 2.44 goals-against average and a .919 save percentage since 
being called up from San Diego. He has gone 2-2-1 and impressed Coach Ron 
Wilson enough to revive the alternating goalie rotation, ending Guy Hebert's 
short run as No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Shtalenkov is in his first NHL season, but at 28, he's no rookie -- he's too 
old to be. He already had played six seasons for Moscow Dynamo in Russia before 
coming to North America to play minor league hockey and try to catch the eyes 
of NHL scouts last year. He caught the eyes of the Ducks, who drafted him in 
the fifth round last June.

COLLEGE BASEBALL / GARY KLEIN; IT HAS TAKEN SOME TIME, BUT USC IS RANKED NO. 1 
AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It took almost three years, but USC has finally returned to the top of the 
college baseball rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans will start today's Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division series 
opener against UCLA ranked No. 1 by Baseball America for the first time since 
May 6, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 USC is 22-6 overall and 8-4 in conference play. Last weekend, the Trojans won 
two of three against Stanford, the first time since 1981 that USC has won a 
series at Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 First-place USC, which has won 13 of its last 14 games, has a half-game lead 
over California in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being ranked No. 1 is not going to bother us because teams are always out to 
get us anyway," said senior infielder Lionel Hastings, who was seven for 13 
with a home run and five runs batted in against Stanford. "That's just part of 
playing at USC." 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Boone began the week batting .384 and Walter Dawkins had hit nine home 
runs for the Trojans, who feature one of the nations's best offensive lineups. 
The key to the Trojans' success, however, has been a pitching staff that has 
compiled a 3.16 earned-run average. Freshman Randy Flores, a left-hander, is 
4-0 with a 1.46 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's shown a lot of moxie for a freshman," Coach Mike Gillespie said. "He's 
not intimidated by any situation." 
</P>
<P>
 USC is hoping to ride its No. 1 ranking to a division title, a regional 
championship and its first trip to Omaha for the College World Series since 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans will try not to stumble this weekend in the three-game series that 
ends Monday. UCLA is 6-17 overall and 2-4 in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've scuffled in a big way," Gillespie said of the Bruins. "But they're 
most definitely going to win some big games and ruin someone's season." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: If former Wichita State right-hander Darren Dreifort makes the 
Dodgers' opening-day roster, he will be the third player from the 1993 draft to 
break into the major leagues. Who were the first two? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to L.A.: Sixth-ranked Wichita State completed its first regular-season 
visit to the Southland since 1983 Wednesday at Cal State Fullerton, and Shocker 
Coach Gene Stephenson sounds as if he won't mind leaving the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked our driver how long it would take to get from our hotel in Costa Mesa 
to Cal State Fullerton (in the late afternoon)," Stephenson said. "He told me, 
'It could be 40 minutes or it could be gridlock.' I said, 'Gridlock? What's 
gridlock?' We don't have gridlock in Wichita." 
</P>
<P>
 What the Shockers have, despite having lost twice to Fullerton, is a team that 
appears capable of reaching the College World Series. Wichita State (11-7) won 
two of three against 14th-ranked Long Beach State before the Fullerton series. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephenson, in his 17th season at Wichita State, has built his program into 
one of the nation's best. The Shockers, national champions in 1989, regularly 
draw crowds of 5,000. Stephenson has popular radio and television shows. Even 
pitching coach Brad Kemnitz has a radio show. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, Long Beach and Fullerton will visit Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do enjoy coming out here," Stephenson said. "As long as the people we play

 Got your number: Pepperdine's 2-1 victory over Fullerton last week was the 
Waves' eighth in a row over the Titans, a streak that dates to 1990 and 
includes the 1992 national championship game.

 "I can't explain it," Pepperdine Coach Andy Lopez said. "I wouldn't even know 
where to start."

 Pepperdine (15-11) completes an important three-game West Coast Conference

 Howard's end: Cal State Northridge outfielder Kevin Howard began the weekend 
having hit four homers in his last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 The run started two weeks ago when he hit a grand slam in a comeback victory 
over Hawaii to help the Matadors complete a Western Athletic Conference series 
sweep. Howard was one for 11 in the series before his homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard hit for the cycle and added an additional homer in a nonconference 
victory over Hartford, then homered against Cal State Sacramento last weekend. 
The Matadors (15-13) are playing host to Fresno State this weekend.

NEWSWIRE: A KEY TEST IS FAILED BY TYSON

 Mike Tyson's plans for early release from prison have been put on hold because 
he failed a high school equivalency exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson, who is serving a six-year sentence for rape at the Indiana Youth 
Center, can retake the two-day test in 90 days, Phil Slavens, assistant 
superintendent of operations at the facility, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the former heavyweight champion had passed, he would have had three months 
deducted from his sentence, making him eligible for parole next February. Tyson 
is scheduled to be released in May of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson's supporters said he was more determined than ever now to pass the test, 
and still hopes to be released early. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to emphasize, that though we certainly had hoped to pass on the 
first time, many persons have had to take it two and three times," said 
Muhammed Siddeeq, an Indianapolis Public Schools teacher who is tutoring Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavens said it was "reasonably common" for inmates to fail the test, but more 
than 50% of every testing group usually passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson was convicted two years ago and sentenced to six years in prison for 
raping a beauty pageant contestant in 1991 in an Indianapolis hotel room. Auto

LOS ALAMITOS; TREMBLAY RESUMES WINNING WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ANDERSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Driver Nicol Tremblay is back on the racetrack, winning races and continuing 
his best season in recent years, despite having been involved in one of the 
worst spills in California harness racing in several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tremblay, 52, won races with two of his best 3-year-old fillies last week -- 
Hutt Girl and Fancy Margarita. Tremblay's quick return was a credit to his 
physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Four horses and drivers were involved in the spill March 12. Driver Len 
Blaylock suffered the worst injuries -- a broken elbow and a broken ankle -- 
that kept him hospitalized until the middle of last week. Tremblay suffered a 
chipped bone in an ankle. Drivers Mark P'Pool and D.R. Ackerman, also involved, 
were uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the four horses were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the accident (start to) happen, but I didn't have time to get out of 
the way," Tremblay said. "It happened so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Tremblay has almost equaled the last week in February, his best 
this year, when two of his 3-year-olds -- Cat In A Hat and Mariah's Tribute -- 
won divisions of the California Sires Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Mariah's Tribute won his second stake of the meeting in a $15,000 
California Sires Stakes for 3-year-old trotting colts. It was his first victory 
in a month and came two weeks after a fourth-place finish in a Sires Stakes 
that he led into the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariah's Tribute, co-owned by Spirit of Lodi Farm and Nicol's 27-year-old 
daughter, Nathalie, has won two of 10 starts and $23,840. In the last six 
weeks, Tremblay has changed the shoes on the gelding and watched him develop 
into one of the leading 3-year-olds in California. Only Hunter's Key has also 
won two stakes in that division.  
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's stake was conducted in less than ideal conditions. Horses had to 
contend with a sloppy track and a driving rainstorm. Tremblay kept Mariah's 
Tribute off the pace until the horses were half a mile from home. At that 
point, he moved around the early leaders and held off River City Sir for a 1 
1/2-length victory. The time of 2:03 1/5 was exceptionally fast, considering 
that another field of trotters was timed in 2:08 later in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to keep a strong hold on him," Tremblay said. "He wanted to go fast, 
but I couldn't let him or he might have gone off-stride." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Mariah's Tribute was fourth in three of his four races at 
Sacramento. His best finish was a second behind Magna Missile in a $16,000 
stakes in August. He returned to the races in January and finished fourth in 
two races before finishing seventh against older horses on Feb. 10. Since then, 
he has had two strong races despite the March 12 mishap. 
</P>
<P>
 Having horses that are competitive in each division of the 3-year-old stakes 
is a major reason Tremblay is doing so well. He is among the top 10 drivers and 
top 15 trainers, and several of his stakes horses have won or placed in major 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 Fancy Margarita has been second to division leader Lil Eggie in stakes for 
3-year-old trotting fillies this year. Fancy Margarita won her first race in 15 
starts on Thursday, but has earned more than $20,000. She has the misfortune of 
being part of the same California foal crop as Lil Eggie, who has won nine of 
12 starts over the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Heated Debate, a 4-year-old trotting filly whom Tremblay co-owns with Tom 
Durant, has won two of nine starts this year, including the $26,000 Electioneer 
Futurity for 4-year-old fillies on Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Tremblay's pacers are also having an excellent meeting. Cat In A Hat, whom he 
co-owns with Wendi Wiener of Yorba Linda, won the sires stakes division for 
3-year-old pacing colts on Feb. 26.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; HORSE HAS A CLOUDY DISPOSITION 
</P>

 Where Bien Bien goes, rain follows. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time the 5-year-old Manila horse is entered in a turf race, bad weather 
seems to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 John Toffan and Trudy McCaffery's horse, who prefers his grass firm, didn't 
run in the Hollywood Turf Cup last Dec. 12 after rain left the turf course 
yielding. 
</P>
<P>
 The skies opened again before the San Luis Obispo last month, and although 
Bien Bien ran as the heavy favorite, he was beaten by Fanmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Readied for the San Luis Rey after his second-place finish in the Santa Anita 
Handicap, Bien Bien might not run in the Grade I race Sunday because of rain 
Thursday and more was being forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to run because (the San Luis Rey) is weight for age," trainer Paco 
Gonzalez said. "But if the turf course is very soft, he won't run. If it's like 
it was in the San Luis Obispo, he'll probably run." 
</P>
<P>
 Second in four of his last five starts on the Santa Anita turf course, Bien 
Bien will be favored again if he is a participant Sunday and he won't have to 
concede any weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying eight pounds less than Bien Bien when he defeated him last month, 
Fanmore and the four other males -- Bien Bien, Grand Flotilla, Navire and Quick 
Ransom -- entered Friday were assigned 124 pounds. The mare Capracotta was 
assigned 119. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth in the San Luis Obispo in his American debut, Grand Flotilla could have 
been closer with a more patient ride. Seventh after a half-mile, the 7-year-old 
roan took off when he saw daylight and moved up to join pacesetter Fanmore down 
the backstretch. Grand Flotilla remained second until he was past the eighth 
pole, then faded and wound up 5 1/2 lengths back. Eddie Delahoussaye replaces 
Corey Black for the San Luis Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 "He fits just as well as any horse in there," trainer Jenine Sahadi said. 
"He's doing very well. He worked a good three-quarters in 1:14 and change 
(Tuesday). He's just a nice, old professional horse. Nothing bothers him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The California Horse Racing Board has begun a process that will allow bettors 
to make an alternate selection in the Pick Six and Place Pick Nine in the case 
of a scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the race favorite is automatically substituted for any scratched 
horse. With the change, bettors will still have that option or will be able to 
designate the horse they want substituted. If the alternate is also scratched, 
the favorite will be substituted. 
</P>
<P>
 The change was requested by Hollywood Park last year and it is possible that 
the alternate-selection option will be in place for that track's fall meeting, 
which will begin in November.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; TITANS RALLY IN 10TH INNING TO GET PAST SAN JOSE STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton needed extra innings for the second consecutive game to 
win. This time the Titans scored four runs in the 10th inning and went on to 
beat San Jose State, 7-3, in the Big West Conference opener for both teams 
Friday at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (22-6) was coming off a 13-inning, 5-4 victory over Wichita State on 
Wednesday. The Titans scored a run in the ninth to take a 3-2 lead but San Jose 
came back to tie it on a Tim Gavello's RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 Bret Hemphill put Fullerton up, 5-4, with a sacrifice fly that scored Dante 
Powell in the 10th. Adam Millan followed with a two-run double. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Silva, who allowed the run in the ninth, pitched a scoreless 10th for the 
victory. Silva, a sophomore right-hander, is 3-1. Chad Rolish allowed two runs 
in seven innings but got no decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams meet today and Sunday at 1 p.m. San Jose State, which had a 
seven-game winning streak stopped, is 17-11. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Redlands softball tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman wins two of three -- Susan Caton pitched pitched a two-hitter and 
struck out three as Chapman beat Menlo, 14-1, in a game called after three 
innings because of a time limit. Bernie Fancuberta had two hits on the day 
including a double, two RBIs and two runs scored and Lisa Simpson scored three 
runs, and hit a double and two singles. Chapman also beat Redlands, 3-0, and 
lost to Gustavus-Adolphus, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Southern California College 3, Lovile (Ala.) 0 -- Shannon Osyala pitched her 
fifth shutout of the season, a two-hitter with four strikeouts, for for SCC

CENTURY LEAGUE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; FOOTHILL OVERCOMES RAIN, SANTA ANA VALLEY TO 
WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Foothill's baseball team, a noncombatant in the Century League title fight a 
year ago, has come out swinging this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights weathered the weather and Santa Ana Valley Friday to continue 
their hold on first place.A 4-2 victory at Foothill left them looking down on 
the rest of the league. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, five of the league's teams finished within two games of each 
other. The lone patsy was Foothill, which finished last with a 5-10 record. The 
Knights have nearly matched that victory total already in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 With Friday's victory, Foothill (5-4, 3-0) has already beaten last season's 
co-champions -- Orange and Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights wasted little time against the Falcons (4-5, 1-2). Kevin Daft 
ripped a two-run double in the bottom of the first, then scored on a single by 
Mike Ford, for a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 David Milton and Joe Torrez made that stand up, but it took some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Milton (2-2) went five innings -- which included a 45-minute rain delay in the 
second inning -- for the victory. It wasn't a masterpiece. Milton walked seven 
and threw two wild pitches. But he also picked off two runners and gave up only 
a bunt single. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons had the bases loaded with two outs in the second when rain halted 
play. When Milton took the mound again, he got Jesse Garcia to foul out. 
</P>
<P>
 Milton was pulled after walking the first two batters in the sixth. Torrez 
retired the first five he faced, three on strike outs, then gave up three hits 
and two runs before getting the final out. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Serrano went the distance for the Falcons. He struggled through the 
first three innings, then retired the last 11 batters. Serrano (0-1) struck out 
four and walked three. CHRIS FOSTER

PREP VOLLEYBALL ROUNDUP; LAGUNA BEACH TOPPLES NO. 1-RANKED DANA HILLS IN FOUR 
GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Laguna Beach, ranked third in Orange County, upset top-ranked Dana Hills in 
four games Friday night in a nonleague boys' volleyball match at Laguna Beach 
High. But neither coach was thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't mean anything," Laguna Beach Coach Michael Soylular said after 
the 15-8, 15-13, 17-19, 15-3 victory. "They're an awesome team, but maybe all 
this proves is that we'll be a contender in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior outside hitter Dan Styles had 21 kills and senior outside hitter Beau 
Bianchi had 20 to lead the Artists (5-0), who passed well and were able to side 
out consistently to frustrate Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dana Hills Coach Oz Simmons knows the rugged early-season competition 
will prepare the Dolphins for a tough South Coast League season and the 
playoffs, he wasn't happy with their performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had two years of losing matches like this," Simmons said. "I thought 
two weeks of good practices and no game-competition would be good for us, but . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins (4-1) looked ragged. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 1, Laguna Beach took a 7-1 lead before Dana Hills battled back to tie 
it, 13-13. After a hitting error from the back row by Matt Clem, Laguna Beach 
setter Kurt Nelson, who had 50 assists, spiked a free ball off Bob Hefty's 
block attempt for game point. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 2 followed the same pattern, with the Dolphins falling behind, 8-3, and 
the Artists closed out the game scoring points on two Dana Hills errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of unforced errors," Simmons said. "We started blocking well in 
Game 3, but we weren't doing much of anything else the rest of the night." 
</P>
<P>
 But Neil Hewko had nine of his 17 kills and Clem had four of his eight blocks 
in Game 3 to help Dana Hills rally from a 14-10 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 17-17, Jeremy Darner, who had 17 kills, spiked from the 
left side to give Dana Hills a side out. Then Clem, who also had 18 kills, had 
consecutive blocks to close out the game, 19-17. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was the last spark Dana Hills showed. 
</P>
<P>
 After a hitting error by Styles closed Dana Hills within 3-2 in Game 4, the 
Artists scored 12 of the last 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why they lost the momentum," Soylular said. "We had match-point 
at 14-10 and they came back. That's the beauty of this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Szilard Kovacs, a 6-foot-9 middle blocker who has signed with USC, had 13 
kills and nine blocks for Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In other nonleague matches: 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena 3, Valencia 2 -- Joe Reynoza had a school-record 45 kills for 
Valencia (4-3), which lost, 12-15, 6-15, 15-7, 15-12, 15-9. Mike Jemmett had 30 
kills for El Modena (3-2). Valencia setter Matt Geissman had 75 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza 3, Capistrano Valley 1 -- Mike Allison had 27 kills and Mark Alleman 
had 20 kills for ninth-ranked Esperanza (4-2), which won, 16-14, 15-9, 10-15, 
15-7. Jason Klems added 16 kills for the Aztecs. Eighth-ranked Capistrano 
Valley is 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park 3, Aliso Niguel 2 -- Chris Greely had 22 kills to lead Villa Park 
(3-3), 14-16, 15-12, 15-12, 5-15, 15-3. Drew Wetzler had 16 kills and Jim Chou 
had 14 kills for the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Express League: 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino Southwestern Academy 3, St. Margaret's 1 -- Gavin Cuneo had 13 
kills and Idris Nolan 26 assists for St. Margaret's (2-4, 1-1), which lost 
15-8, 15-7, 11-15, 15-11. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY ALL-STAR WRESTLING; THIS MATCH IS A 'FUN THING' FOR 30 SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three practice sessions didn't put them in peak postseason form, but for the 
30 seniors who gathered for the Orange County All-Star Wrestling match Friday 
night at University High, it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 This night, to honor their high school wrestling accomplishments, was more 
about fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for the kids, it's a compliment for the seniors, it's just a fun 
thing," said Santa Ana Coach Scott Glabb, who coached the winning Red team. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by State champion Darryl Christian of Canyon and a strong supporting cast, 
the Red team took a 28-22 decision over the Blue team, coached by Steve Stewart 
of University. 
</P>
<P>
 Had it not been for Stewart's generosity, the Red team would have struggled to 
prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 Red team member Eric Escobedo of Huntington Beach (171 pounds) was a no-show 
and Woodbridge's Jesse Liu (189) was out with an injured shoulder. Rather than 
forfeiting two matches, Stewart allowed the Blue team's Scott Rojo (189) to 
switch teams and drop a weight class -- to 171 -- to wrestle Capistrano 
Valley's Terry Tuzzolino. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo's Rojo, the South Coast League and Division I Southern Section 
champion took a 4-1 lead in the second period and held on to win, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to finish the season with a win," said Rojo, who was just as 
ecstatic to end the season with a victory against Tuzzolino. "I was pretty 
nervous. It's intimidating to go against a guy who's second in the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Rojo had practiced with Tuzzolino, the Division I section and Masters champion 
and runner-up in the State meet, this week and thought they were evenly 
matched. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun. There were a lot of good wrestlers here. It was an honor to be 
here," Rojo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind Magnolia's Dan Jurado (103) and Santa Ana's Roger Santiago (112), the 
Red team took a 6-0 lead. The Blue team countered with victories by Savanna's 
Randy Bowers (119), Orange's Jason Bress (125), Buena Park's Vince Virgen 
(130), El Dorado's Tommy Noel (130) and Calvary Chapel's Mauricio Mora (135) -- 
who defeated State champion Juan Alvarez of El Modena -- for a 16-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena's David Wells (140) defeated State runner-up Alfred Frausto of 
Edison for the Red team, and Christian (140), Chris Jaime of El Modena (145), 
San Clemente's John Witting (152) and Newport Harbor's Chris Edwards (160) won 
for the 22-16 Red team lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Victories by Rojo and Marc Albert of Los Alamitos (171) secured the Red team 
victory, although Buena Park's Wali Sibrie had the only pin of the match to 
pull the Blue team to the 28-22 final.

 The Angels did make one trade Friday, sending minor-league reliever Bob Gamez 
to the San Francisco Giants for outfielder Steve Hosey. Hosey, who hit .292 
with 16 homers and 85 RBIs at triple-A Phoenix, is expected to open the season 
as the starting right fielder in triple-A Vancouver."He's in Bo's shadow," 
Rodgers said, "but our feeling was that we needed a right-handed hitter in 
triple-A in case something happens to Bo. Bo will probably be here one year at 
the most, anyway. If (Jackson) plays bad, we'll get rid of him; and if he plays 
good, he'll get rid of us." . . . The Angels game against the Oakland Athletics 
was rained out, so what do they do for entertainment? DH Chili Davis gave left 
fielder Eduardo Perez a haircut. . . . Mark Leiter, who has had a mild strain 
of his lower back, was pushed back to Sunday. . . . Starter Joe Magrane, who 
isn't expected to be ready until the end of April, was placed on the 15-day 
disabled list. BOB NIGHTENGALE

HART GETS BACK IN THE SWING, 10-3; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: ESPY HELPS INDIANS 
BREAK OUT OF HITTING SLUMP IN FOOTHILL VICTORY OVER BURBANK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hart High found itself starting Foothill League baseball play Friday with an 
offense that was having trouble doing just that -- starting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians scored a total of five runs in their two previous games, both 
nonleague defeats. They couldn't get untracked. They needed a catalyst to 
reignite the hit machine that scored 20 runs in two games two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They needed a designated rally starter, and designated hitter Mike Espy 
delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy, a 5-foot-11, 214-pound left-handed batter, lined a two-run single off 
the right-field fence in the first inning to key a 10-3 victory over Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy's liner looked as if it would be a double, but it reached the fence so 
quickly that right fielder Courtney Ranshaw was making his relay throw when 
Espy rounded first base. But that's OK. Espy, who came to the plate with a .188 
batting average, gave the Indians what they were looking for -- a 2-0 lead and 
early momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I really wanted to do was get those runs in, because I've been 
struggling," said Espy, Hart's No. 5 hitter. "It felt solid, and it got out 
there pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart (5-3) collected 11 hits. Espy was two for two. He added a bloop single in 
Hart's four-run third inning before Mike Adachi belted a two-run single. 
Adachi's hit was big because it came with two out and immediately followed a 
failed squeeze bunt attempt. Chad Ott followed with a bunt single, which led to 
Jeremy Seipel's two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy kept on contributing. He was hit by a pitch and drew a walk in his other 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitchers Ramiro Alvarez and Frank Garcia of Burbank (4-4) battled wildness. 
Alvarez (2-2) gave up eight hits and six runs (four earned) in 2 2/3 innings. 
Garcia gave up four runs in 2 1/3. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Burbank pitchers walked five and hit four batters (two were beaned but 
not hurt). They also served up several hanging curveballs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw a lot of those today," Espy said. "It wasn't the best pitching we've 
seen, but it wasn't the worst. But that was the first game we came out and 
attacked in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Coach Chad Nammack said Alvarez was wild because he threw hard in 
practice the previous day and was not scheduled to start. But Alvarez had to be 
pressed into service after scheduled starter Brian Sindle was suspended from 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart starter Kevin Pitzer improved to 3-0.

SCHEFFELS, SIMI VALLEY GIVEN A LIFT; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: ACE IS OFF FORM, BUT 
ROYAL ERRORS START PIONEERS ON THE WAY TO 11-5 MARMONTE VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley High pitcher Bill Scheffels needed an early boost. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty from a 2 1/2-week break between starts, the ace of the Pioneer staff 
didn't have his best stuff against visiting Royal. But thanks to a four-run 
first inning led by Scheffels' triple, Simi Valley cruised to an 11-5 Marmonte 
League victory Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheffels gave up five earned runs and four hits, including two home runs, in 
six innings but the Pioneer offense came through early -- thanks to a few 
breaks courtesy of Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 The game started on an inauspicious note for the Highlanders (4-3, 1-1 in 
league play). Simi Valley leadoff hitter Kary Kozlowski reached first base on a 
routine ground ball when the throw by shortstop Joel Mellinger pulled the first 
baseman off the bag.  
</P>
<P>
 Kozlowski scored after a double by Tim Nykoluk and a wild pitch by David 
Vicari (0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Hankins hit another routine grounder, but the ball skipped past third 
baseman Brent Egan. Scheffels followed with a triple down the right-field line 
and the Highlanders were down, 2-0, and had committed two errors before the 
first out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't mentally into it," Royal Coach Dan Maye said. "We had four 
sophomores out there and we were tight, partly because we were playing Simi 
Valley and partly because we weren't ready. We had some communication problems 
and it just took a while to settle down." 
</P>
<P>
 Egan, one of the four sophomores, made two outstanding plays on grounders 
later in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Staked to a 4-0 lead, Scheffels (3-0) battled his control in the second 
inning. He walked Egan on four pitches to start the inning, then threw two wild 
pitches to the next batter, enabling Egan to score on a ground ball by Shawn 
Fossen, cutting the deficit to 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he struggled some the entire game," Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers 
said. "He didn't have his curveball working and he definitely didn't have his 
best stuff, but when he got the lead, he was able to hold on." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheffels didn't have any control problems the rest of the game, but in the 
fourth inning Mellinger homered over the center-field wall to bring Royal to 
within 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheffels settled down until there were two out in the sixth inning when Egan 
tripled and designated hitter Maki Kramer homered on consecutive pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we had the big lead and I just wasn't concentrating," Scheffels said. 
"I wasn't tired. It was just a kind of ho-hum type of game." 
</P>
<P>
 Vicari, making his second start of the season, kept the Pioneers (6-1, 2-0) in 
check until the fifth inning, when mistakes by Royal gave Simi Valley more 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Gonzalez bunted directly to Vicari, whose throw was dropped by first 
baseman Adrian Mendoza. After a single by Kozlowski and a sacrifice by Nykoluk, 
the Highlander pitching self-destructed.  
</P>
<P>
 Vicari was replaced by Phillip Derryman after walking two batters on eight 
consecutive pitches. Derryman hit the first two batters he faced, gave up a 
run-scoring single by Jevon Markarian and walked another batter, giving Simi 
Valley an 11-2 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think David was mentally down after a couple of mistakes were made behind 
him and he pitched defensively instead of being aggressive," Maye said. "We 
need an attitude check sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Derryman got only one out before being replaced by sophomore Matt Pittstick, 
who got the final out after the Pioneers sent 11 batters to the plate.

SHE FEELS ROSY AFTER DEFECTING OUT OF THE BLUE; CUBAN, ACTING ON IMPULSE, 
BOLTED AT A TENNIS TOURNAMENT IN MEXICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rita Maria Pichardo had no immediate plans to defect. At least not in October 
in the middle of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came spontaneously. She said it was as if she had grabbed the 
idea out of the air. Pichardo, 23, a native of Cuba, had long considered 
fleeing her country. But not on this day, not during a tennis tournament in 
Zacatecas, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sweltering autumn afternoon -- Pichardo guesses Oct. 23 -- when she 
abruptly decided the sweat on her brow would be more appreciated in another 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The impulse came, and Pichardo, possibly the best-ever Cuban women's tennis 
player, reacted with the same aggressiveness she had always shown on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Without hesitation, she charged. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, clutching a fake passport, Pichardo crossed the international 
border at Tijuana into the United States. Two days later she landed in La 
Crescenta, at the home of her cousin, Carlos Sanchez -- who came here as a 
Cuban refugee in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, Pichardo hopes for an opportunity that wasn't available 
in her country: to play Wimbledon, the U.S. Open . . . all the Grand Slam 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to talk about any politics," Pichardo said. "The absence of 
funds is what keeps a tennis player in Cuba from advancing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pichardo, Cuba's five-time national champion, admits it was more than 
economics that restricted her to playing only satellite events in South America 
and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a fear of letting their players play Grand Slam tournaments . . . a 
fear of losing them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pichardo said she left Cuba because she, like other Cubans, struggled to make 
a living. As a professional athlete with asylum in the United States, she might 
finally play money tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosperity has its price. Still in Havana is her fiance, her brother and 
her father, Gerardo Pichardo, who became a widower three years ago. Rita Maria 
never said goodby. She had planned to return after playing the Mexican 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pichardo, who had won her fifth consecutive National Championship of Cuba 
tournament in February of 1993, was told in Zacatecas by the Cuban Tennis Assn. 
that she would no longer be given new equipment like other players. "I was 
national champion, but if I didn't take used rackets, I wouldn't be able to 
travel," said Pichardo, who sensed she was being phased out. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I took off then." 
</P>
<P>
 Pichardo is not ranked in the top 300, said her agent, Gus Dominguez, because 
she hasn't played any prominent events. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now she's a little out of shape," Dominguez said. "But I have to say 
she's a very patient, understanding, model athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to have her train with the UCLA women's team. We want her to be 
confident. Athletes that perform at a high level have a certain cockiness. We 
want her to be at that level." 
</P>
<P>
 From her arrival in the United States until early February, Pichardo had not 
worked with a coach. Then she met Gene Malin, a respected instructor who works 
with several Valley players. He said Pichardo has the ability perhaps to play 
in a Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got some talent," Malin said. "I think she can get into the top 50. She 
can win points, but how well she competes is another story." 
</P>
<P>
 But that, according to Pichardo, is her strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel when the odds are even and the other player is at my level, my 
aggressiveness and competitiveness put my opponent on the defensive," she said. 
"I have controlled aggression. I always know what I'm going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Pichardo has vowed to avoid the fate of Karelia Echevarria, her predecessor as 
Cuba's top women's player, who quit in her prime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the girls left the sport early, because there was no future," 
Dominguez said. "The sport is not promoted. Many got married or went to other 
careers." 
</P>
<P>
 When Pichardo decided to defect, she contacted friends in Guadalajara. The 
friends picked her up at the Zacatecas tennis center, ostensibly for a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours after Pichardo disappeared, Augustine Martinez, the Cuban coach, 
called Pichardo's friends in Guadalajara and was told she was not with them.  
</P>
<P>
 But Martinez contacted the Cuban Embassy, which dispatched two agents to watch 
her friends' Guadalajara home. 
</P>
<P>
 By then Pichardo had left Guadalajara, staying with other friends in Toluca, 
near Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared when I found out men had come," she said. "If I was taken back 
to Cuba, they would have taken tennis away from me. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my career." 
</P>
<P>
 Her Cuban coaches couldn't take away her career, but now they are holding her 
fiance, Duvier Medina, as a hostage. Pichardo said Medina, 23, also is a top 
player in Cuba. She said officials, who leaned on Medina to persuade Pichardo 
to return, have since taken away his privilege to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pichardo: "I told him I'm going to wait for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Gerardo, and her younger brother, Gerardo Jr., support Rita 
Maria's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want me to have a bright future," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dawn of that bright future came when Pichardo, standing in front of a 
7-Eleven store in San Ysidro after crossing the border, called her cousin, 
Enrique Sanchez, in nearby Chula Vista. Enrique brought her to Carlos in La 
Crescenta. 
</P>
<P>
 The traumatic earthquake on Jan. 17 -- the first Pichardo had ever experienced 
-- did little to shake her resolve. Pichardo is firmly committed to staying in 
the United States at least until she gets a shot at a Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pichardo: "Not even 100 earthquakes could make me go back to Cuba."

CITY SECTION HAS NO MERCY IN SOFTBALL; LACK OF THE 10-RUN RULE LEADS TO SCORES 
OF 55-1 AND 50-1 ON THE SAME DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taft High's Michelle Haber enjoys batting, but this was ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 Haber made 13 plate appearances in a nonleague softball game against Fairfax 
last week as the Toreadors won by the improbable score of 55-1. Records on 
routs are not kept, but this had to be one of the most lopsided victories in 
City Section softball history. 
</P>
<P>
 The same day, Poly thrashed Hollywood, 50-1. In a sport often dominated by 
overpowering pitching and characterized by low scores, two Valley teams 
combined for 105 runs -- on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't there a sportsmanlike rule that would prevent such thrashings? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes, sort of. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section enforces an automatic "Mercy Rule." If a team trails by 
10 or more runs after five innings, the game ends. The City Section version, 
however, is strictly voluntary. The coach of the losing team can raise the 
white flag and surrender after five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 But more often than not, it's the losing coach who is unwilling to end such 
public humiliation and opts to keep the girls on the field for seven innings. 
Coaches want to use the full game as practice time, and members of a visiting 
team would rather play -- despite the huge deficit -- than wait for the team 
bus to arrive for the ride home. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the vast discrepancy in ability among teams in the 49-school City 
Section has made routs commonplace. Surprisingly, coaches on the winning side 
of the routs are the ones calling for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think after five innings, if a team is up by 10 (runs), that ought to be 
enough," said El Camino Real Coach Neils Ludlow, whose team beat Sylmar, 12-0, 
last week in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills Coach Carolyn Gunny disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not want a team to feel annihilated," Gunny said. "But if the coach 
wants the kids to play for the practice or whatever, then they should be able 
to play." 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real's 12-0 victory over Sylmar last week might seem one-sided, but 
it qualifies as a nail-biter compared to other recent games. Last week, Verdugo 
Hills beat Hollywood, 31-0, and Kennedy trounced Belmont, 18-0. 
</P>
<P>
 This week was no different. Monroe defeated Van Nuys, 20-2, and Verdugo Hills 
followed its 31-0 victory with a 28-1 pounding of Belmont, which threw in the 
towel after five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 And those are only the reported routs. Some coaches, such as Poly's Kim McEwen 
say they refuse to publicly humiliate teams that lose by a large margin. McEwen 
did not report the Parrots' 50-1 victory to any newspaper out of respect for 
the Hollywood players, who voted to continue the game after five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to keep playing," McEwen said. "Their bus wasn't there yet and 
they were having a good time. I told the (Hollywood) coach after the game I 
wouldn't be reporting the score to the papers. I just felt it wouldn't be nice 
to the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 McEwen bristled when she learned that the Taft-Fairfax score appeared in print 
-- with a banner headline no less. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know (girls) don't get a lot of press -- or positive things said about us 
-- and this was kind of like a joke. It really rubbed me the wrong way," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft Coach Donna Hetman shares McEwen's view and asserts that she tried her 
best to keep the results from the public. "I never called in the score," she 
said. "(The newspaper) called me and I was kind of adamant about not (printing) 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Taft-Fairfax game lasted only three innings because Taft -- yes, Taft -- 
had had enough. After nearly three hours during which Taft batted around 13 
times, it was Hetman who begged for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went over and said, 'Coach, our bus is here and I've got to get these kids 
home. They've got school tomorrow,' " Hetman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairfax Coach Judy Edwards reluctantly complied with Hetman's plea, 
disappointed that her team could not use the rest of the game for practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ridiculous," said Haber, a senior pitcher who did not give up a hit 
against Fairfax in three innings. "It's not practice for us. It's just kind of 
a waste." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, players and coaches pity their lesser-skilled opponents during a rout 
and try to make it easier on them. Players will swing at any pitch that is 
close, take half swings or even bat opposite handed. 
</P>
<P>
 But why should a team be forced to adopt those measures? Why prolong a 
one-sided game just to reach the requisite seven innings? 
</P>
<P>
 According to City Section Commissioner Barbara Fiege, the competition is not 
always over after five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could actually make up 10 runs in one inning," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but those occasions are rare. Some teams are simply vastly superior 
to others among City schools. A few powerful City teams feature players who 
have participated on Amateur Softball Assn. summer teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Other City squads are barely distinguishable from gym class teams. At Fairfax, 
few players trying out for the team this year owned gloves. Five are still 
borrowing gloves from the coach. And when some players raised enough money 
through candy sales to buy mitts, they mistakenly placed them on their throwing 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches Edwards at Fairfax and Hetman at Taft are on opposite ends of the 
spectrum. Edwards is teaching her players how to hold a bat and how to wear the 
glove. Meanwhile, Hetman is signaling for drag bunts, slap hits and delayed 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season ended at Fairfax with only nine girls in the program, and this is 
the first year Fairfax has fielded a junior varsity. Edwards, a first-year 
coach, has 35 players in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to be competitive in two or three years," she said. "If you stop 
(a game automatically) at the 10-run rule, my girls would never learn to field 
a ground ball." 
</P>
<P>
 And until more teams in the City nurture strong pitchers, learn to catch and 
throw consistently and hit pitches that travel about 50-55 m.p.h., there will 
be routs -- and plenty of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But some coaches are trying to control the routs through scheduling. Edwards 
and Hetman have taken that course. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't bet on seeing a Taft-Fairfax matchup next season. Both coaches said 
never again, as long as both remain coaches.

 Tim Feeley, an assistant at Poly High, has been named the school's head 
football coach, replacing Fred Cuccia, who resigned in January to accept a 
similar position at Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeley, 42, served last year under Cuccia, helping to guide the Parrots to the 
Mid-Valley League title and a 4-3 record in the Valley Pac-8 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeley was the B football coach at Kennedy High from 1990-92 and a Golden 
Cougar varsity assistant during the 1988 and '89 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sky's the limit as far as I'm concerned," Feeley said Friday. "That's the 
way we're looking at it. We've got a great nucleus of offensive and defensive 
linemen returning from last year's team so we're looking forward to a good 
season. . . . I want to make Poly a football school again." 
</P>
<P>
 Poly posted an 11-3 record and won the 1990 City Section 3-A Division title in 
Cuccia's second season. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeley, a native of Saginaw, Mich., graduated from Chatsworth High in 1969 and 
earned his undergraduate degree in physical education from Cal State Northridge 
in 1976.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: FOR SHANAHAN, OPPORTUNITY IS KNOCKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is no typographical error. 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Jason Shanahan is tied for the Cal State Northridge lead in 
stolen bases with five. That is five more bases than he swiped in his first two 
seasons at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 And then some. 
</P>
<P>
 "First five since Little League," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan said he simply has been getting the green light more often from third 
base coach Mike Batesole. And he has stolen the bases in only six attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had great speed, but I never thought I was slow, either," Shanahan 
said. "I've just had more opportunities." CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Cook Sizzles 
</P>
<P>
 Something about Western Athletic Conference play seems to appeal to second 
baseman Keyaan Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 In six conference games, Cook leads Northridge in average (.542), runs (nine), 
slugging percentage (.833), on-base percentage (.633) and is tied for the lead 
in doubles (four). 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Cook finished 15th in the WAC West Division batting race with a 
.315 average and tied for seventh in homers with four. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, not everybody walked away from last week's 20-4 pasting of Hartford 
feeling completely warm and rosy. The windshield of Batesole's pickup truck was 
shattered by a Matador foul ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the player, there were so many hits in the game that nobody 
could recall who hit the errant ball. Junior Colleges Lost Homers 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Coach John Klitsner blames his baseball team's recent woes on erratic 
fielding and spotty hitting after getting off to a resounding start at the 
plate. Mission recently snapped a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit 20 home runs in our first 10 games and we haven't hit one home run 
since," Klitsner lamented. "We've made a lot of errors and we are hot and cold 
with our hitting." 
</P>
<P>
 One unexpected strength has been the work of the pitching staff, led by 
freshmen Ray Rivera (6-2, 2.80 earned-run average) from San Fernando High and 
Robert Ballester (4-1, 3.10) from Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our pitching, which we thought would be an area of concern, has a 2.90 ERA in 
conference (play)," Klitsner said. Around the Campuses . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Cal State Northridge right-hander Marco Contreras (3-4) has completed his 
first seven starts. With 27 regular-season games remaining, he has an outside 
shot at breaking the school record of 15 set by All-American Craig Clayton in 
1991. Contreras completed eight of 14 starts as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 * Right-hander Jason Vargas of Northridge had a streak of scoreless innings 
snapped at 10 when he surrendered a leadoff homer against Long Beach State on 
Tuesday. Earlier, the Valley College transfer strung together 8 1/3 hitless 
innings spanning appearances against Cal State Los Angeles, Hartford and Cal 
State Sacramento.  
</P>
<P>
 * Paul LaMott of Cal Lutheran narrowly missed the Kingsmen single-season 
record for shooting percentage. LaMott, a 6-foot-6 junior forward-center, made 
70 of 111 shots (63.1%). Brad Reed set the school record of 63.9% (106 of 166) 
during the 1977-78 season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bill Oates, who led The Master's men's basketball team to a 28-5 record 
during his first season at the school, has a 626-257 record (.752 winning 
percentage) during his 31-year career.

</P>
<P>
 Saugus 3, Burroughs 0 -- Junior right-hander Brandon Hernandez fired a 
one-hitter, struck out six, walked none and did not allow a runner past first 
base in winning his first Foothill League game. Darren Hoevel had two

Mesa. SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley 3, Burroughs 0 -- Junior Kim Scott and sophomore Danielle

</P>
<P>
 Royal d. Camarillo 15-3, 15-0, 15-11 -- With its Marmonte League winning 
streak stopped at 66 matches, Royal was eager to re-establish its pride and did 
so in convincing fashion by routing visiting Camarillo in a league match. Josh 
White had 37 assists, Dan Rizzo had nine kills and Eric Carlsen added eight 
kills and four stuff blocks. The Highlanders had not lost a league match in six 
years until Thousand Oaks defeated them on Tuesday.

IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD; MUSIC: MICHAEL HORTON HAS DONE 
EVERYTHING FROM 'CATS' TO OPERA TO 'MR. ROGERS.' HE MAKES HIS L.A. MASTER 
CHORALE SOLO DEBUT ON SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An operatic tenor whose influences include Lily Tomlin, Martin Short, Lucille 
Ball and Fred Rogers? 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Horton, making his Los Angeles Master Chorale solo debut in Benjamin 
Britten's "Rejoice the Lamb" on Sunday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, is not 
what you might expect. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, ask the 36-year-old, classically trained singer with the 
long-haired, laid-back look how he psychs himself up to face a challenge and he 
responds: "I say to myself, I did 'Cats.' "  
</P>
<P>
 The Kentucky-born Horton figures that if an operatic non-dancer could learn to 
dance, sing Andrew Lloyd Webber lyrics in German and crawl around the stage on 
his knees for two years -- as he did during the Hamburg production of the 
musical -- he can do just about anything. And has. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his eclectic accomplishments are regular gigs on "Mister Rogers' 
Neighborhood" doing puppet voices, the European musical theater productions of 
not only "Cats," but Webber's "Phantom of the Opera," and stabs at writing for 
theater and radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had always been groomed for a career in opera," Horton said. "There was 
this mind set that once you get all these scholarships to college and graduate 
school (Horton received the Corbett Foundation Fellowship for graduate studies 
and a Metropolitan Opera National Council prize), you feel it's your 
responsibility or destiny to fulfill these dreams. Which fortunately," he 
added, "I found out were not mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving "incrementally" East from the South, Horton spent six years in New 
York, where "things weren't happening very fast as far as a solo career went." 
In 1988, he went to Germany where his career "took a right turn into musical 
theater" when a friend suggested he audition to understudy for 
Gus/Growltiger/Bustopher Jones in "Cats." He snared the first cast role 
instead. His subsequent roles in "Phantom," directed by Hal Prince, were 
Monsieurs Andre and Reyer; he also sang on opera and concert stages from London 
to Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he was flying back intermittently to Pittsburgh and "Mister Rogers 
Neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Musical theater "was the best thing that ever happened to me, coupled with 
(Fred Rogers') encouragement to believe that I had more than one voice, that I 
could use my natural mimic's ear and what he called my whimsical sense of humor 
to do other kinds of work in the entertainment field." 
</P>
<P>
 Since his college days at Birmingham-Southern and at the University of 
Cincinnati-Conservatory of Music, Horton has been making friends laugh by 
portraying eccentric characters drawn from life, a la Lily Tomlin and "Saturday 
Night Live" alumnus Martin Short. The impressions would just "bubble forth," he 
said, as they did when he chanced to meet PBS family icon Rogers through a 
mutual friend and Rogers' wife Joanne, a concert pianist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had heard him mimic all these different people and I thought Michael could 
do almost any voice in the spectrum," Rogers said as he described what led him 
to invite the singer to join the show in 1982. "He has a wonderful whimsy about 
him and such versatile vocal range." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Horton's puppet alter-egos: Rogers' favorite, Betty Okanak Templeton, 
whom Horton calls a chatty, "feisty, babbling" Southern matron "patterned after 
the mother of one of my girlfriends in college." Mild-British-accented James 
Michael Jones was inspired by a night janitor at a church, and he got the part 
of Old Goat, a character in Rogers' "Grandparents Opera," because, he said, he 
could speak "goatese." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton returned to the U.S. in 1992 after a family medical emergency and the 
death of a close friend. When he moved to California a year later, the first 
person he called was L.A. Master Chorale music director Paul Salamunovich, who 
hired him "for the whole season." 
</P>
<P>
 The high tenor ("that's kind of where I live, up in the stratosphere"), who 
hopes to find "partial employment" in animation as a voice-over artist, will 
solo in the Chorale's "Messiah" at the Music Center in December, and intends to 
return this summer to the San Diego Symphony and the Pacific Symphony 
Orchestra, finish writing a radio play and do a series of outreach concerts 
with the chorale's chamber group next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My background in opera has helped me learn languages, to learn about music 
and music history and get a great liberal arts education. And what that does," 
he said, "is make me want more." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Sounds of the Ages," Los Angeles Master Chorale, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 
Sunday at 7:30 p.m. Program includes works by Bernstein, Britten, Holst, Mozart 
and Vaughan Williams. Tickets: $7-$44; (213) 365-3500.

THIS ROCK BAND DIGS ITS SERENDIPITY; POP MUSIC: LUCK AND TIMING PAY OFF FOR 
DIG, A GROUP THAT FEATURES A THREE-GUITAR ATTACK. THE BAND PLAYS ON A BILL WITH 
BLIND MELON ON SUNDAY AT THE PALLADIUM.

 "It wasn't like we thought we were going to get a hit single and be a big MTV 
buzz band," says Scott Hackwith, songwriter, guitarist and lead singer for the 
Los Angeles-based rock band Dig. "We weren't even going to do a video." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the band, it changed that decision. The video Hackwith 
directed with GraemeJoyce for the song "Believe" became an MTV "Buzz Bin" clip 
and helped the band draw attention to its self-titled album and land 
high-profile gigs. Dig will appear on a bill with Blind Melon on Sunday at the 
Hollywood Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hackwith tells it, Dig's history is filled with such serendipity. After 
moving from San Diego to Los Angeles to work as a production assistant on music 
videos, Hackwith put together a band with acquaintances Jon Morris (guitar), 
Johnny Cornwell (guitar) and Anthony Smedile (drums), and then found bassist 
Phil Friedmann through a classified advertisement in the Music Connection.  
</P>
<P>
 An A&R representative at Radioactive who knew Smedile came to see the 
fledgling band rehearse. Within a few weeks, they had a recording contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Hackwith, calling from Kansas City, makes it all sound easy. "I'll usually sit 
down with my acoustic (guitar) and mess around with some ideas," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those ideas became the songs on "Dig," an album packed with slinky 
art-rock grooves reminiscent of Jane's Addiction, as well as distortion and 
cathartic anger worthy of Alice in Chains.  
</P>
<P>
 What separates Dig from the guitar-rock pack though, is Hackwith's songwriting 
and the band's three-guitar attack. It's as easy to hear classic rock-style 
riffs on "Dig" as it is layers of distortion.  
</P>
<P>
 Hackwith, 27, cites a list of guitar influences ranging from Pink Floyd to 
Swervedriver. "Through the years I've gone through everything," he says. "I 
moved into San Diego and people my age were listening to KISS and Cheap Trick 
and Ted Nugent and stuff like that. Then there was that whole heavy-metal 
phase, and I met this punk-rock girl right after I got out of high school, and 
she got me into everything from Einsturzende Neubauten to Bauhaus." 
</P>
<P>
 The band ended up with three guitarists almost by accident. Morris was brought 
on board because Hackwith was having trouble singing and playing guitar at the 
same time. Hackwith eventually returned to playing guitar, and Morris stayed 
on.  
</P>
<P>
 Hackwith is typically understated about his lyrics, saying they're just "slice 
of life stuff." He says "I'll Stay High" is about not wanting to grow up, while 
"Believe" was written after the L.A. riots. "Everybody was trying to unite and 
come together," Hackwith says. " 'Believe in your own God' was (saying) I 
believe in what I believe in and I just want to be left alone." 
</P>
<P>
 That anonymity may be harder to come by as Dig's popularity grows and Hackwith 
spreads his talents. Hackwith recently produced "Acid Eaters," an album of '60s 
songs for the punk group the Ramones, and Dig will continue to tour through the 
summer. "Dig" has already sold about 100,000 copies, according to Karen Malluk, 
the band's A&R representative, and a second single, "Unlucky Friend," will be 
released in early April with a video.  
</P>
<P>
 "Enough people know the band from the first single that they'll be paying 
attention to the second," said Sheri Howell, the director of talent relations 
for MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his laid-back attitude, Hackwith seems pleased with his band's 
success. "We wanted to make albums," he says. "It just happened a lot quicker 
than we thought." 
</P>
<P>
 * Dig will be on the bill headlined by Blind Melon on Sunday at the Hollywood 
Palladium, 6250 Sunset Blvd. Mother Tongue and Alice Donut are also scheduled 
to play. The show will begin at 6:30. Tickets are $16.50. (213) 962-7600.

NOTHIN' BUT NET -- AND A SHIRT FOR LUCK; SPORTS: RABID O.C. FANS CLING TO 
'MARCH MADNESS' RITUALS, EVEN THOUGH STUNTS DON'T MAKE MUCH SENSE.

 The Orangemen of Syracuse never had a chance, figures Stacy Nixon of Santa 
Ana. For the past four years, ever since she torpedoed the Denver Broncos in 
Super Bowl XXIV, Nixon has been sure that she could jinx a team merely by 
cheering for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Syracuse lost because I was rooting for them," said Nixon, who actually 
wanted Missouri to win and even borrowed a Syracuse T-shirt for Thursday's NCAA 
basketball tournament game to strengthen the hex. "It's kind of a reverse 
psychology." 
</P>
<P>
 With the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. basketball tournament and its 
"March Madness" at fever pitch, there's no better time to see superstitious 
fans like Nixon in action. Though they do nothing more than watch on 
television, rabid fans are donning special hats and shirts, occupying lucky 
spots on the couch and refusing to shave -- all in the earnest belief that 
their behavior can affect the outcome of games. 
</P>
<P>
 Such superstitions are quite common, especially among sports spectators, 
experts say. The irrational beliefs are born of a need to control the 
uncontrollable, they say, making the sports fan particularly vulnerable to 
confusing cause and effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "During sporting events, people are often highly charged and highly excited," 
said Dr. Steve Chandler, a professor of psychology at Chapman University. "And 
they can easily develop inaccurate or invalid connections to explain what are 
actually coincidental events. Generally, it's benign and funny to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 While fans nationwide may believe that it was Duke forward Grant Hill's 22 
points that keyed his team's victory over Marquette on Thursday, Marc Caress of 
Fountain Valley knows better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got here and they were down a point, " said the 21-year-old UC Irvine 
student, showing off his lucky Duke basketball jersey. "Then I got here with 
The Shirt and they won by 10." 
</P>
<P>
 But magic apparel doesn't always bring good fortune. Chris Doherty's 
Louisville Cardinals fell to Arizona on Thursday night despite his following 
The Ritual to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fountain Valley man wore his Louisville baseball cap and T-shirt and 
refused to shave since the team's last loss March 6. And at the precise moment 
the game started, as always, he slipped a Louisville basketball jersey 
inscribed with the number 1 over his T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just didn't help this time," he said. "I may have to change the pattern 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most superstitious fans, Doherty realizes his stunts don't make much 
sense. But he clings to them nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are watching a game, you are obviously out of control," said the 
scruffy-looking Doherty, who said he would soon be clean-shaven. "So, whatever 
it takes to push them along, I'll do it. I feel like I'm contributing in some 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Another basketball fan whose faith in dressing for success took a hit this 
week is Kelly Carter, 26, a sports agent from Huntington Beach. For five years, 
Carter has been sporting a Kansas Jayhawks baseball cap during televised games. 
In that time, the Jayhawks have made it to two Final Fours. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Jayhawks' ouster from the tournament at the hands of Purdue Thursday 
night left him puzzled and frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just couldn't pull it out of the hat, no pun intended," said Carter, who 
wears a Jayhawks tie at work on game days. "There's not much you can do when 
you are playing against the likes of Glenn Robinson. That kind of talent just 
outweighs the superstition factor, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Respecting the power of ritual, however, is nothing new for Carter. A former 
high school and college basketball player, Carter blames three losses by teams 
he played on to his failure to put on two socks and lace up the shoe on his 
left foot before dressing his right one. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we lost that third time, I said 'never again,' " Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, it's not the clothes that make or break a team so much as what you 
do with your body during the telecast. During NCAA tournament time, stockbroker 
Chris Steer finds himself and his buddies performing the "back-slap" or "I-5." 
</P>
<P>
 A variation of the high-five, the move, which consists of hitting the back of 
one's hand against the palm of someone else's hand is a momentum builder, Steer 
claims. The 27-year-old Long Beach resident credits the maneuver with helping 
the Duke Blue Devils capture the national title in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that's why Duke won," Steer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Kiyotoki isn't so theatrical about her team blessing. As a little girl 
attending USC football games with her father, Kiyotoki began crossing her 
fingers with two minutes left in each game to pass on good luck to her team. 
Today, she finds the maneuver especially effective for hoopsters at the 
free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always feel it will somehow give my team that extra oomph and that they 
will somehow know I'm doing it," said the 30-year-old corporate auditor from 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, however, superstitious fans aren't even aware they harbor fantastic 
beliefs. When asked if he had any, Syracuse fan Brian Belsito said no. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are losing, I'll move to a different area on the couch," said the 
20-year-old Belsito, who found himself at a sports bar Thursday night, far from 
his lucky sofa. 
</P>
<P>
 Without his lucky seat nearby, the Orange Coast College student from Tustin 
had no idea how to summon good luck for his team. It just wasn't practical to 
give up his seat in a crowded bar, so after his team fell way behind Missouri, 
Belsito decided to watch another large television screen. 
</P>
<P>
 After Belsito's switch, the Orangemen staged a comeback that sent the game 
into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually watch them at home," Belsito said. "But if they win tonight, I 
could end up here every time they play." 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse lost, 98-88. Cancel that reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Can superstitious behavior possibly work? No, answer the experts. Yes, say the 
faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the litmus test may be the NCAA tournament fortunes of the Arkansas 
Razorbacks, who beat Tulsa 103-84 Friday night. Nixon is rooting for them to 
win it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll lose for sure," she said.

fellow tribe member. "There'll be more Juanenos in the parade than ever before 
because of Teeter," says Mike Rosenberger, parade chairman. "They'll be 
marching beside and all around her to show their support." The parade starts at 
11 a.m. near the Mission San Juan.

GUNFIRE ERUPTS OUTSIDE O.C. SHERIFF'S DEPT. 
</P>

 A brazen daylight attack outside Orange County Sheriff's Department 
headquarters Friday sent bystanders scrambling for cover as six assailants 
descended on a man, clubbed him and opened fire at this unlikely site for 
settling a grudge. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was struck by gunfire. The injured man, who was hit with a tire iron, 
wandered into the nearby lobby of the Men's Central Jail with blood dripping 
from his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailants, identified by authorities as suspected gang members, sped away 
in a BMW sedan and a Honda Civic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never, never, ever, in 26 years, seen an attack like this in a place 
like that," said Santa Ana Police Sgt. Dick Faust. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion of gunfire at 3 p.m. sent jail visitors running and ducking 
behind concrete benches and a hot dog cart near the complex. About 15 Santa Ana 
police officers and sheriff's deputies converged on the area, but the 
assailants had already escaped in different directions. No arrests had been 
made Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured man, Van Pham, 20, of Garden Grove, was treated for a cut on the 
back of his head and later released. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham had been working at the jail earlier in the day, sweeping floors as part 
of a court-ordered work program, when he exchanged heated words with six men 
who may have come to the jail to visit a prisoner, police said. The Sheriff's 
Department complex is across the street from the Civic Center that includes the 
seat of county government, as well as the Santa Ana Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in two cars parked along the curb outside the jail, the men waited for 
Pham to leave at 3 p.m, Faust said.  
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the men yelled at Pham in Vietnamese as he walked along the 
sidewalk. The men then tackled him in the street and someone struck him with a 
tire iron, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Pham and the driver of a black Honda fought, a passenger in a 
charcoal-colored BMW grabbed a gun from the car's trunk -- by some witness 
accounts a small rifle, by others a handgun -- and began shooting at the victim 
as he bolted toward the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman, following Pham, fired four shots before the attackers retreated 
and fled. Police found no spent ammunition shells at the scene, and said the 
gun was likely a revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty scary. I'm standing on the sidewalk, then all of a sudden 
there's a fight, then people start running," said Rob Horton, who was at the 
jail to visit a friend. "It all happened so fast, people were running and 
ducking." 
</P>
<P>
 The attack left bystanders shaken and police officials incredulous.  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the jail is in an area where there's a lot of (criminal) activity, but 
to have an incident right there , well, that is pretty unusual," said sheriff's 
spokesman Lt. Dan Martini. "I'm sure it wasn't planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys probably weren't thinking, but that's always the problem. And I 
guess it's also the reason we have so many people in custody right there," 
Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faust described the gunman as an Asian male, 5-foot-3 and weighing 110 pounds. 
He was wearing a light-blue shirt and dark khaki pants. The man who fought with 
Pham was described as Asian, 6 feet in height and weighing 130 pounds. He was 
wearing a white shirt and light-brown pants. Both vehicles were "low-rider" 
cars that sit close to the ground, witnesses said. Santa Ana police asked that 
anyone with information about the attack or assailants call (714) 834-4801.

OIL LEAK HARMS PLANTS, WILDLIFE IN CHINO HILLS PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 1,000-gallon oil spill has coated more than two miles of a creek flowing 
through Chino Hills State Park and into the Santa Ana River, harming plants and 
wildlife along the way, park officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Park officials said the spill was brought to their attention by a park visitor 
on Sunday, a week after a line ruptured at an oil well near the southeastern 
boundary of the 12,000-acre recreational area. In turn, they said, they 
notified the state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very concerned about it," said David Vincent, district superintendent 
for the state Department of Parks and Recreation. "We have a beautiful canyon 
that comes through that part of the park called Aliso Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said although cleanup began immediately after the parks department 
learned of the leak, rains last weekend pushed the oil downstream, and Thursday 
night the water breached two makeshift dams, allowing some of the oil to spread 
into the Santa Ana River near Green River Golf Course.  
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the park between the golf course and the southern part of the 
Lower Aliso Canyon campground has been closed to the public, park officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger Andre Ramos said the spill has "done a lot of damage to the wildlife 
and plants." So far, he said, two dead wood rats and some dead fish and insects 
have been spotted in the oil.  
</P>
<P>
 He added that parks officials suspect that the spill killed many more animals 
which were washed into the Santa Ana River by the rains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything living is going to be harmed by the oil spill," said Robert Goodman, 
a herpetologist and graduate student at Cal Poly Pomona. "Pacific tree frog, 
Western toad, arroyo chub are all species that live in the park, and are going 
to be directly affected by the oil spill."

INS MUST CONSIDER 'FAMILY TIES,' APPEALS COURT RULES; IMMIGRATION: THE 
DEPORTATION CASE INVOLVES A CANADIAN WHO HAD LIVED WITH HER U.S. BOYFRIEND FOR 
MANY YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Immigration officials must consider a woman's "family ties" to her boyfriend 
and his relatives in deciding whether to deport her, a federal appeals court 
ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2-1 decision, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Ruta Marie Kahn 
of Encinitas may be able to demonstrate family ties, a factor weighing against 
deportation, even though the couple's relationship was not considered a 
marriage under California law. 
</P>
<P>
 The court did not say that all unmarried couples should be considered to have 
family ties for purposes of the deportation law. But the judges indicated that 
a relationship qualifying as a common-law marriage in states that recognize 
such marriages should be considered by immigration officials in assessing cases 
from other states. 
</P>
<P>
 In dissent, Judge Alex Kozinski, who quoted the Paul Simon song "50 Ways to 
Leave Your Lover," said the Immigration and Naturalization Service has a 
legitimate reason to define a couple's family ties as marital status under 
state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples who live together in a state that does not recognize common-law 
marriages "can go their separate ways any time they please," Kozinski wrote. He 
cited one of the "50 ways" in the Simon song: "Just slip out the back, Jack." 
</P>
<P>
 A common-law marriage -- two people considering and representing themselves as 
husband and wife but without a legal ceremony -- is considered the equivalent 
of marriage in 13 states and in Washington. California does not recognize 
common-law marriages but will accept another state's determination of such. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn's attorney, Frank Vecchione, said Kahn and boyfriend John Caldwell were 
recently married after having lived together for many years. Vecchione said 
their previous relationship probably would have been considered a marriage in 
many states. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn, a Canadian national, was admitted to the United States as a permanent 
legal resident in 1978. The INS sought to deport her after she pleaded guilty 
to money-laundering and conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
 Vecchione said Kahn's role was limited to selling glassware in a chemical 
supply shop in San Clemente five or six years ago. He said she was placed on 
probation by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law allows deportation to be waived if an immigrant's good character, 
ties to the United States and other sympathetic factors outweigh the 
seriousness of the grounds for deportation. 
</P>
<P>
 An immigration judge ruled in Kahn's favor, citing, among other things, her 
relationship with Caldwell -- who likened it to a common-law marriage -- and 
his family. But the Board of Immigration Appeals denied a waiver, saying 
California law precludes recognizing the couple's relationship as a family tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court majority, Judges James Browning and Procter Hug, ordered the 
case reconsidered, saying deportation must be decided under a uniform federal 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 If family ties depend on varying state laws, the court said, "whether an alien 
is granted a waiver of deportation may depend on that alien's state of 
residence." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kozinski said the administration of many federal laws, including 
immigration law, depends on state definitions of marital status. For example, 
he said, a legal marriage to an American citizen, determined by state law, may 
make an immigrant eligible for admission to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marriage connotes a level of stability and commitment that simply doesn't 
exist between unmarried folks, no matter how warm their relationship," Kozinski 
said. He also said the cases of many long-term gay and lesbian couples were 
more compelling than that of Kahn, who had the option of getting married. 
</P>
<P>
 Vecchione said the ruling "reflects a recognition that in modern-day society, 
most romantic relationships of long standing have equal status with that of a 
legal marriage." He declined to comment on the possible implications for 
same-sex couples.

FERRET LEGALIZATION BILL REJECTED 38-25 BY STATE ASSEMBLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bill to allow Californians, like people in 46 other states, keep ferrets as 
pets has been rejected by the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote Thursday was 38-25 for the bill, three votes short of a 
majority.Assemblyman Jan Goldsmith (R-Poway) said he would try again and agreed 
to amend his bill to require pet ferrets to be spayed or neutered. 
</P>
<P>
 California is one of only four states that do not allow ferrets to be kept as 
pets. The others are Michigan, Massachusetts and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferret groups say the animals are playful and harmless and are so domesticated 
they cannot survive in the wild if they escape. The groups estimate there are 
100,000 to 500,000 ferrets kept illegally in the state, many of them by people 
who bought them in other states and don't realize they are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would allow ferrets to be kept as pets as long as they are vaccinated 
against rabies. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill is opposed by the state Fish and Game and the Health Services 
departments. The former claims the animals can escape, turn wild and endanger 
native weasels and other wildlife. The latter says ferrets are dangerous 
animals which can attack infants and bite them in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state of California spends tens of thousands of dollars enforcing this 
prohibition," Goldsmith said. 
</P>
<P>
 His bill is supported by a state veterinarian group, which says legalization 
would make it easier for vets to vaccinate and treat ferrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the state of California has better things to do than regulate little 
animals," said Assemblyman Robert Frazee (R-Carlsbad). 
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith pointed out that ferret groups have contacted the 46 states where 
the animals are legal and none have reported any problems with escaped ferrets.

PLAN WOULD UNITE O.C. ORDINANCES; HEALTH: ANTI-SMOKING RULES DIFFER FROM CITY 
TO CITY. MOST WORKPLACES DON'T ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO LIGHT UP; FEDERAL BAN WOULD 
ENSURE THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration's proposal Friday to ban smoking in virtually all 
of America's indoor workplaces would not change the habits of most employers in 
Orange County, but it would help clear the air at several city halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city ordinances, such as one set to take effect this summer in Laguna 
Hills, ban smoking in workplaces outright. But a majority of city laws are more 
selective, regulating smoking in certain areas, such as restaurants and 
restrooms, but not all public places. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue locally will get even more complicated next year. Orange County has 
voted to prohibit smoking in all businesses, eateries and retail stores by 
January, 1995 -- but only in unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal law proposed Friday by Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich would 
provide a uniform code to give nonsmokers nationwide the protection that local 
ordinances have not always provided, anti-smoking advocates said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time," said Phil Barnett, an administrative aide for U.S. Rep. 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who is sponsoring his own no-smoking bill in 
Congress. In Orange County, he said, "anti-smoking laws are such a patchwork." 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment is shared by many city officials who have been struggling to 
strike a balance between those who want to live smoke-free and those who 
advocate smokers' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be very good," said Wayne Peterson(, a city councilman for Laguna 
Beach. "All restaurants and workplaces would be treated the same rather than 
this piecemeal approach." Laguna Beach, which now restricts smoking in 
restaurants and workplaces, will prohibit smoking in all restaurants by Jan. 1, 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Most employers regulate smoking, and increasingly that means a total ban in 
their buildings, said Elizabeth Winfree-Lydon, a senior staff consultant at The 
Employers Group, a trade association with 1,000 local members. 
</P>
<P>
 State law, city ordinances and social pressure have forced changes in just the 
past few years, she said. "Fifteen years ago, meetings would be held in 
smoke-filled rooms; people would be smoking in seminars. Now that's unheard 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 A smoker herself, Winfree-Lydon works in a nonsmoking five-story building in 
Santa Ana. "It's not a problem," she said. "I just step outside." 
</P>
<P>
 At Cushman & Wakefield's office management division in Santa Ana, smoking is 
allowed only in hallways and foyers, administrator Peggy Roland Sanchez said. 
About 90% of businesses in her company's office buildings prohibit smoking in 
their offices, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 More stringent are Koll Management Services Inc. and C.J. Segerstrom & Sons, 
neither of which allow smoking in their office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate nonsmoking regulations are often far stricter than city ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana, for instance, bans smoking in 22 city buildings but has no law that 
prohibits lighting up anywhere else, including restaurants. But at Ingram Micro 
Inc., a computer distributor located in the city, all offices are smoke-free. 
Employees who smoke must go outside to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that is frowned on by the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks tacky to have people out front smoking," said nonsmoker Marilyn 
Sutherland, assistant to company President Sam Inman. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed federal law is not without its critics. 
</P>
<P>
 At the bar in the Bombay Bicycle Club, a Santa Ana restaurant, Kevin Francis, 
57, and Doug Denniston, 31, argued about the issue Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am for it," said Denniston as his lunch partner finished his fish and 
chips, then lit a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a drag, Francis complained about "being ragged at" for the past several 
years. As for the new proposal, he said, "I am opposed to it, not because I am 
a smoker but because it infringes on people's rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Still other opponents of government-sponsored smoking regulations say that 
what they fear most is bureaucracy.

 "I really prefer a smoke-free environment, and that is what I have," said 
Thomas Wilck, president of Thomas Wilck Associates Inc., an Irvine public 
relations firm. "But with the legislation will come more regulations, and we 
will have to end up filling out more paperwork."

LAW STARTS SCHOOL SHOPPING FRENZY; EDUCATION: OPEN ENROLLMENT PROMPTS FAMILIES 
TO PORE OVER OPTIONS. SOME TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.

 Throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District, parents are buzzing: 
Finally, they can enroll their children anywhere in the system regardless of 
where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 School shopping has become a full-time job for some parents, who are 
interviewing principals, attending classes and orientation meetings and 
collecting test scores. Even parents who were considering private schools are 
rethinking their options. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the topic everywhere -- at the park, at PTA meetings, if you run into 
a friend who has a 4-year-old. There is no one who doesn't talk about this," 
said Maggie Scott, a parent in the Miracle Mile area who is shopping for an 
elementary school for her son. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education this week gave parents more freedom to choose a new 
school within the Los Angeles district -- as long as racial balances remain 
intact and classroom seats are available. Under the new guidelines, parents no 
longer have to receive the principal's permission before withdrawing children 
from their school and enrolling them elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the open enrollment policy leaves families with some obstacles -- 
especially the lack of space at many desirable schools -- a great number of 
parents view it as a new lease on school life. Many parents have complained 
about low test scores, bad teachers, bilingual education hindering the progress 
of other students and campus violence but have been unable to move because of 
district red tape and a policy encouraging parents to stay with neighborhood 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents in some Orange County school districts also have been busy discussing 
how parental choice may change their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here have been talking about it since Proposition 174 (mandating open 
enrollment) was proposed," said Marilyn Buchi, a Fullerton Joint Union High 
School District trustee. "We've had some choices before, but not this wide 
open. People like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The school choice program is just getting underway in the Capistrano Unified 
School District, which serves 32,000 students. According to district 
spokeswoman Jacqueline Price, 6% of the district's students have requested to 
go to a school outside their neighborhood. She said that percentage is typical 
for large California school districts. Two schools, Aliso Niguel High in Aliso 
Viejo and the new John Malcom Elementary in Laguna Niguel, had more applicants 
than room. A lottery will be held to fill the openings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Ana and Irvine school districts, where open enrollment has been 
in place for at least 10 years, the passage of the school choice law last fall 
was met almost with indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we will need to do is simply remind our parents that they have that 
option and make sure they're aware of the different programs being offered in 
many of our schools," said Diane Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Santa Ana 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, even before school offices received the bulletin outlining the 
open enrollment rules, campuses began fielding calls from parents. Schools 
primarily on the Westside and in the west San Fernando Valley are drawing the 
most attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristi Thomas, office manager at Tarzana Elementary School, said: "The parents 
seem to know more about this than we at the schools know." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be because parents have made the open enrollment season their game, 
analyzing test scores, class sizes, even racial balances in search of an ideal, 
or at least acceptable, school. One parent attended a school play one night 
recently to check out the other parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm totally consumed by this whole thing right now," said Janet DiMartino, a 
Sherman Oaks parent who is looking at public and private schools for her son. 
"The range is just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Broadsky, a parent from Encino, said: "I've gone to a lot of meetings. 
I've talked to five different principals. I've gone through the phone book and 
every source that I can." 
</P>
<P>
 She has even put together her own comparative school guide highlighting the 
issues that are important to her: academic program, athletics and enrichment 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Principals say they are getting calls from parents whose children attend 
private schools and who are now considering enrolling them in public schools. 
DiMartino said she is treating public school as a more serious option now that 
open enrollment is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The maze of enrollment policies and admission permits -- and the dearth of 
guiding information from the school district -- has left many parents 
frustrated. Some parents say they rely mostly on neighborhood rumor mills for 
information about one of the most important decisions they will make for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are on your own and there is a great deal of confusion," said Scott, the 
Miracle Mile mother. "What I would like to see from the district -- although I 
am sure they will tell me there are a million reasons why it can't be done -- 
is a single document, a guide that outlines all the various ways you can go to 
a school, from day-care permits to magnet schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent frustrations likely will grow as the school shopping frenzy reaches a 
peak after May 16, the day that schools will release their count of available 
slots and make applications available. Many of the schools that parents regard 
as most desirable will not have nearly enough space to satisfy demand. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say they have the solution. Rather than traditional waiting 
lists, principals will hold lotteries to draw names of parents who want their 
children to attend a particular school. The state-mandated random drawings, 
scheduled for June 14, will be monitored by a three-member committee: the 
principal, a teacher and a parent. 
</P>
<P>
 But some highly sought-after schools may not get to the lottery stage. 
Principals at schools with high parent interest -- Carpenter Avenue Elementary 
in Studio City, Third Street Elementary in Hancock Park and Welby Way in Canoga 
Park -- say they likely will not have much space to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 The state law that ordered school districts to allow open enrollment gives 
first priority for space to students who live in the neighborhood. Students who 
are bused for integration and to relieve overcrowding also have priority, along 
with students whose parents work or use day care in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling parents that the good news is there's open enrollment; the bad 
news is we don't have space," said Joan Marks, the principal at Carpenter, 
where hundreds of parents typically show up for orientation meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away, at Sherman Oaks Elementary School, Principal Ed Krojansky 
said he expects to have room for about 75 students. "This school does have a 
reputation for having a high-quality program so I was not surprised by the 
level of interest," he said. "We welcome it and we're ready." 
</P>
<P>
 If the new enrollment policy is a boon to parents, it can also benefit 
schools. With more students, principals can hire more teachers, offer more 
classes and increase parent involvement. It also could improve morale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives us a nice boost that people are appreciating what we do," said Linda 
Pacheco, principal at Germain Street School in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some school board members have hailed open enrollment as a major step 
in education reform, others have expressed reservations. Board President 
Leticia Quezada said parents' expectations have been raised too high and that 
excitement over the program could sour if parents are shut out of their first 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crux of this issue will be what schools are on the list and whether the 
available space matches the interest out in the parent community," Quezada 
said. "If they don't match, then we are going to have a lot of frustrated 
parents out there and I really want to minimize that." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the open enrollment policy does not guarantee bus transportation, 
Quezada and others said options for some parents could be limited. 
"Unfortunately, parents in my district find themselves working two jobs. Often 
they don't have cars to even transport them to work," said Quezada, who 
represents parts of the Eastside and the northeast Valley. "They really don't 
have a choice. Choice means nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although district officials have estimated 50,000 openings in 500 schools, 
parents say they are skeptical about where those openings will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real question is: Is there really going to be any spots for choice 
applications in the best schools, in the schools everyone cares about?" asked 
Susan Bernard, a Westside parent. "It seems there is going to be a lot of 
space, but where?" 
</P>
<P>
 As board member Julie Korenstein put it: "I think it's going to take at least 
a year before we see whether it was a real option or something on paper that 
just looked nice." 
</P>
<P>
 The state law, authored by Assemblywoman Dede Alpert (D-Coronado), directed 
all school districts to adopt similar open enrollment guidelines. The law was 
sparked by the school voucher movement that offered parents tax credits to help 
offset private school tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy does not apply to the magnet schools -- where enrollment is by 
districtwide lottery of applicants on lengthy waiting lists -- or charter 
schools, which operate independently of district regulations.
