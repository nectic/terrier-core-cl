 ROLL 'EM: Though many people associate the movie biz with Hollywood, it's 
remarkably big in Ventura County. County residents working in the film and TV 
industry bring home a whopping $157 million a year.Another $45 million annually 
is spent while filming on location here or for other services. . . . Fillmore, 
for one, aggressively markets itself to filmmakers. Look for the town in the 
newly released "I Love Trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 TESTING THE WATER: Wise politicians often seek honest advice before running 
for office. A Thousand Oaks City Council gadfly is asking for it in spades. . . 
. In a questionnaire to about 150 Thousand Oaks insiders, Ekbal (Nick) Quidwai 
seeks some honest feedback about his 2 1/2-year run of unsolicited speeches and 
political theater in the council chambers. Respondents can check a box urging 
him to run for council, or one that says, "You are full of it! Stop wasting our 
time by being involved!" 
</P>
<P>
 VENTURA COUNTRY: If Ventura County were a separate nation, just think of the 
possibilities. . . . Ojai could get rid of that pesky federal radar tower. The 
bases at Point Mugu and Port Hueneme could house a formidable navy. And our new 
currency could hardly be much weaker than the dollar. . . . But customs 
inspections on the Ventura Freeway would slow things down. . . . If we were a 
country, we'd rank 35th in output (B1). Big Spenders

ATTACKS ON 'CHRISTIAN RIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am concerned at the comments of several Democratic political figures, 
including the President of the United States, in regard to Christians and their 
political activities (June 25, 26). It was my understanding that there was 
freedom of religion in this nation. I would hardly consider myself part of the 
"religious right," but somehow, given this series of attacks, my actions, 
opinions and statements within the political and social arena are now totally 
disqualified as being "intolerant." 
</P>
<P>
 It is impossible for any American, regardless of religious or spiritual 
belief, creed or background, to simply put that part of himself aside while 
acting within our constitutional rights as American citizens, to vote, to 
organize peaceably, to speak freely, and to act as we see fit in accordance 
with the law. Everyone here has something he or she places his or her faith in, 
and people cannot talk of "intolerance" or "bigotry" and at the same time focus 
attacks on particular people here in America simply because they don't like 
where (or in whom) we place our faith. 
</P>
<P>
 What truly concerns me is not that I am afraid of having my political rights 
stripped by innuendo and malice: That is among the least that we have gladly 
suffered for his sake. It is that political and social elements in this nation 
are intentionally trying to undermine a particular faith, discouraging those 
who might seek grace within it, simply for short-term political gain, viewing 
religion as nothing more than an extension of politics.

 * Re "Elders' Comments on Religious Right Spark GOP Call for Her Ouster," June 
25: Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-Fla.) states, "She should be using this office to 
fight sickness and disease . . . " It would seem to me that is precisely what 
she is doing. Speaking out against the ugly and killing sickness and disease of 
bigotry, intolerance, ignorance and hate does "advance the general health and 
welfare of all Americans." Her message is a call to reason amid the din from 
those who would promote ignorance, proclaim their patriotism while maneuvering 
to diminish, deny and destroy our rights and freedoms, and hatefully assert a 
perversion of the lesson of the teacher Jesus.

ANTI-GRAFFITI PADDLING BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I couldn't believe what I was reading! Mickey Conroy's (R-Orange) revolting 
bill ordering that juvenile graffiti offenders be beaten with a paddle has 
passed its first Assembly committee hearing (June 29). What sort of mixed 
messages does this state wish to proclaim? The youth of today experience more 
violence than they can handle, whether through gang activity, parental 
mistreatment, or media overload. Now we want to teach these already-troubled 
youngsters that physical abuse is an effective solution for a social problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Grow up, California Assembly members! Have the foresight to see how this bill 
will affect your children, and the good judgment to create responsible, 
productive legislation. We and our children deserve a government that has the 
courage to educate with respect, not threaten with brutality.

 * It might sound like a cruel resolution to an epidemic problem. But since 
most graffiti vandals are under the age of 18, doing time at California Youth 
Authority facilities brings them back out with more revenge on our city walls. 
Paddling as punishment in front of peers and community might act as a lesson in 
humility and a deterrent to an otherwise very expensive crime. As for the ACLU, 
I'm sure they will be more than happy to paint over every square inch of the 
defaced property found throughout all of California.

 * Why, I wonder, does Conroy want to limit his paddling bill to graffiti? And 
why just juveniles? If paddling would be an effective deterrent to graffiti, 
why not to car theft? Assault? How about white-collar crime? 
</P>
<P>
 If a few whacks on the rear end are appropriate for the kid from Ohio who may 
or may not have spray-painted the cars in Singapore, if they would shape up the 
graffiti "artists" of California, why not apply the same measures to tax 
cheats, deadbeat parents, parking scofflaws, politicians on the take? Girls as 
well as boys? Women as well as men? Why not? 
</P>
<P>
 I am not sure I would like to live in a paddle-happy society, but if I had to, 
I would want everyone to have an equal shot at a sore butt. 
</P>
<P>
 And, yeah, print their names in the paper. A chance at public humiliation.

 * Conroy has some strong points in favor of paddling young graffiti vandals. 
But they seem to come from the "good old days," when "men were men and they 
fought hard for what was right." I would like Conroy to show me any place in 
history where using violence to fight violence didn't, in the long run, create 
more violence. If it had worked, then why is there so much violence all over 
the world today?  
</P>
<P>
 I felt the comments by Irwin Hyman, Temple University psychology professor, 
were very astute (June 23). But be careful, he's one of those touchy-feely 
people. He belongs to a rapidly increasing portion of the world population that 
is becoming aware of another way to see themselves and the world around them. 
</P>
<P>
 As more humans experience that their worth and power are complete within 
themselves, then they will have no need to try and take them away from someone 
else. As this awareness spreads we will work together in ways beyond our 
present imagination.

 * A few years ago I attended my 40-year high school reunion. One of our guests 
was our principal at that time. Several of the men recalled the "swats" they'd 
received from the principal as punishment for various misdemeanors. They were 
not complaining about being mistreated. On the contrary, they were complaining 
that not enough, if any, of this type of discipline was being applied today. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, I attended another alumni function, a men's golf tournament, which 
included two former coaches as guests. The committee chairman had made two 
paddles -- with holes -- which were presented to the coaches. It was done with 
nostalgic humor and with gratitude for the "firm hand" with which they had 
disciplined those who had stepped out of line. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we have Assemblyman Tom Bates, who thinks the idea or corporal punishment 
is "so extreme" (June 23). And Hyman, who fears that "paddling of juveniles 
could spread to the adult penal system and hence to the military, where the 
flogging of U.S. sailors on the high seas was practiced through the mid-1800s," 
and that "corporal punishment can lead to embitterment, anger and 
post-traumatic stress . . . (in) impressionable youths." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, gee. We sure don't want to do anything that would upset the kiddies, do 
we. Gimme a break. All you have to do is compare the classrooms of yesterday 
and today, and the results of these two "schools of thought."

RIORDAN'S VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times' story (June 26) regarding Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's vote 
in favor of first-year construction funding for the Pasadena light rail line 
does a disservice to Riordan and the communities supporting construction of 
this line. You fail to state that it was Riordan who held up the first MTA 
board action on funding the line because he was unsure as to the merits of the 
line -- hardly the action of a person who supposedly is worried about helping a 
company (Tetra Tech) in which he owns an interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The $97-million appropriation finally approved by the MTA board, as part of 
Riordan's motion approving the agency's entire fiscal year '93-94 budget, was 
not developed by Riordan but by the Rail Construction Corp. (RCC) staff, in 
conjunction with the City of Pasadena staff and consultants, and represented 
the first-year funding necessary to keep the line on schedule for a 1998 
opening. The appropriation should have been $106 million but was pro-rated 
since the MTA's budget was not adopted until two months into the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the report that MTA CEO Franklin White wants to cancel or slow down the 
line, that is as accurate today as it was last year, and is a continuing source 
of irritation to Pasadena line supporters. We have done everything the MTA 
asked us to do in order to make this line a reality, including seven years of 
planning, community involvement and millions of dollars of local investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you should concentrate on the real story at the MTA -- the need to 
adequately manage our bus and rail systems so that the operating deficit is 
eliminated, thereby allowing the mandate from the voters for a multi-modal 
transportation system envisioned in Props. A and C to move forward.

MILESTONE IN THE LOVE CANAL CASE; HUGE SETTLEMENT UNDERLINES THE PROBLEMS IN 
NATIONWIDE TOXIC WASTE CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty years after residents of Love Canal, N.Y., first became aware there 
were hazardous chemicals in their yards and homes -- contamination that they 
linked to a number of physical ailments -- Occidental Chemical Corp. has 
announced that it will pay the State of New York $98 million to settle one of 
the major civil lawsuits resulting from Love Canal's pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, Occidental has taken a big step toward closing the remaining 
suits and countersuits in a case that has raised national consciousness about 
the dangers of chemical waste. However, even this partial resolution 
underscores the dilemmas in cleaning up toxic dump sites. Among the more than 
1,200 sites on the national Superfund list are such Southern California 
problems as the McColl dump in Fullerton, the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
and an abandoned DDT factory in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Love Canal's problems began in the 1940s when Hooker Chemicals and Plastics 
Corp. dumped 22,000 tons of chemical waste in the area, near Niagara Falls. By 
1978, concern that the toxic substances were linked to birth defects and 
illnesses had caused nearly 500 families in the neighborhood to flee their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years there were many lawsuits, and in 1988 a federal court held 
Occidental, which acquired Hooker Chemicals in 1968, liable for costs under the 
Superfund Act, the federal program to clean up the nation's most polluted 
places.  
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup of Superfund sites like Love Canal has been too slow and far too 
costly. That's why the Clinton Administration earlier this year proposed an 
overhaul of the 14-year-old Superfund program. But reaching consensus on just 
how to restructure Superfund has not been easy.  
</P>
<P>
 One key issue is how clean is "clean." The Administration argues that 
different standards of cleanliness should apply depending on the next likely 
use of the property. The idea has much to recommend it: Arguably, a waste site 
destined to become an airport, for example, need not be as clean as one 
reserved for new homes and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But Love Canal indicates how troublesome these standards may be in practice. 
In 1894 excavation for a hydropower canal began at the site; 50 years later 
Hooker dumped chemicals, and 10 years after that homes and schools were built. 
Existing Superfund sites may also change hands and be put to uses not 
envisioned in current cleanup plans. For example, local residents may one day 
wish to establish a residential tract at the site of a commercial airfield that 
earlier was converted from a military facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Standards that permit a lesser standard of cleanliness for one use as opposed 
to another will constrain the public's choices and perhaps impose higher public 
costs. Until that dilemma can be resolved, the Love Canal settlement can only 
stand as an example of how costly the process could be.

TURNING UP THE LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five years ago the City of Los Angeles had no ethics law, no ethics commission 
and -- cynics argued -- no ethics. However, in testament to how government can 
begin to clean up its act when the people demand it, Los Angeles now boasts 
what arguably are the toughest local ethics ordinances in the nation, in 
addition to an independent-minded Ethics Commission dedicated to making those 
ordinances stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it took prodding and some in city government took longer to embrace 
change than others, today the results of reform are evident: a city government 
more accountable for explaining how money influences the system. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not to say there's not room for improvement. But Charter Amendment H, 
the landmark ethics ordinance approved by voters in 1990, ensures there will be 
giant spotlights shining on City Hall in the form of financial disclosure rules 
for city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Provisions in the law also included limits on investments, a ban on 
honorariums, ceilings on gifts, partial public funding for campaigns and caps 
on contributions.  
</P>
<P>
 Now the City Council wisely has decided to heighten scrutiny by requiring 
lawyer-lobbyists, for whom City Hall is a second home, to report their lobbying 
activities to the Ethics Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action at the same time loosens disclosure requirements for 
advocates who are not big-money players and who use the system infrequently. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, none of this would have seemed possible. Bright lights, shine 
on.

EARTH'S RESOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for running the piece headlined "Plunder of Earth Began With Man" on 
June 10. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that the net lesson for us is that our generation and that of 
our children have a great opportunity and bear a correspondingly heavy 
burden.While our science has put into our hands more efficient means for 
plundering the Earth than ever before, and our worldwide economic system 
increases the short-term profit to be gained by doing so, our science at the 
same time gives us better tools than ever before to understand the consequences 
of what we do and to devise better alternatives, and our democratic political 
system (despite its flaws) gives us as citizens more power than ever before to 
influence, or even control, what is done. 
</P>
<P>
 If we use those scientific tools and that political power, we can avoid the 
mistakes of past cultures and preserve our planet.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; TIP THE BALANCE TO THE 'REBUILD' SIDE; OWNERS OF 
QUAKE-HIT RENTAL PROPERTY ARE IN A BIND THAT GOVERNMENT AND LENDERS CAN SETTLE 
FOR THE GOOD OF ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
 My brother Gene and I have lived in Los Angeles since 1945. Along with our 
father, we built our first apartments in 1954 and have been actively building 
and investing in real estate since then. On Jan. 17 we, like everyone else in 
Los Angeles, had our world badly shaken, in so many ways. Luckily, no one in 
our seven damaged properties suffered any physical harm, due to the brave 
efforts of our managers and the tenants themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 After recovering from the initial shock, we set about deciding whether or not 
to rebuild. It's not a simple question, and believe me, at times we feel like 
Tevye from "Fiddler on the Roof," reciting, "On the one hand, however, on the 
other hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuild: Only we owners of the properties at the time of the quake can utilize 
the Small Business Administration loan funds. If we don't rebuild them 
ourselves, no one else is eligible for the loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't rebuild: Even though our buildings sustained $3.9 million in physical 
damage, the SBA can lend us only $1.5 million because of rules that consider 
all of our family companies as one entity. This means that some buildings won't 
get rebuilt if the additional dollars can't be found. Now that the state's bond 
measure has been defeated, we don't know where to turn for the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuild: Because we've owned these buildings for quite some time, they are 
fully depreciated from a tax point of view. If we don't rebuild, letting the 
buildings go to foreclosure, we'll get hit with a whopping tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't rebuild: No one knows if we'll be able to rent apartments in badly 
quake-hit areas. If the rebuilt apartments stay empty, what will we have 
accomplished? 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuild: We're good citizens of Los Angeles and have benefited most of our 
lives from working here. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't rebuild: The city is pressuring us to demolish our vacant structures as 
a blight-prevention measure unless we can rebuild quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuild: We have an obligation to our tenants, vendors, investors and partners 
to see this temporary setback through and make things right again. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't rebuild: No one has a good handle on what our personal liability will be 
in the future if we are unable to obtain insurance and another quake occurs. We 
keep coming back to the basic economic issue of too much debt. Even if we were 
to find additional capital, the buildings can support only so much debt. The 
decline in real estate values in general means we might never be able to sell 
the properties at a price that will pay off their full indebtedness. 
</P>
<P>
 So, no matter how much we'd like to rebuild, it's clear that we can't just add 
more debt without some sort of accommodations from our existing lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA alone can't do the job; the federal agency needs help from the banks. 
The banks need regulatory relief if they are expected to cooperate. Without it, 
they will continue to foreclose on quake-related properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me suggest the following creative alternatives to foreclosing: 
</P>
<P>
 * Lenders have been patient, waiving payments on damaged properties. But 
instead of requiring a lump sum at the end of their patience, the amount owed 
should be added to existing debt and amortized over the length of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Halt foreclosure proceedings for earthquake-damaged properties to allow 
owners time to rebuild and regain an income stream. This could take another 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allow banks to loan on a higher percentage of the value of quake-affected 
structures, then share later in any appreciation in value. This would require 
modification of some federal banking regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 At last count, there were nearly 300 apartment buildings in the San Fernando 
Valley with 16 or more "red-tagged" units declared unsafe for occupancy. The 
owners of many of these buildings face the same dilemmas that my brother and I 
do. Without some creativity, coordination and civic leadership, a large portion 
of this housing stock simply won't be rebuilt. There are compelling social, 
economic and political reasons for everyone to pull together and begin to 
rebuild now rather than going by the book.

 The city, state and federal governments each have their own rules. A 
coordinated partnership, along with private property owners and their lenders, 
is needed to take advantage of the help that is being offered by the federal 
government. This partnership could drive a real recovery and tip the scale 
toward a decision to rebuild.

GIVE THE STATES A CRACK AT DEVISING REFORM; HEALTH POLICY: CONGRESS IS BOGGED 
DOWN IN POLITICS AND AVOIDING HONEST ANSWERS. LET'S LOOK FOR REGIONAL 
SOLUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THEODORE R. MARMOR and and JERRY L. MASHAW, Theodore R. Marmor is a 
professor of public policy and Jerry L. Mashaw is a professor of law at Yale 
University. They frequently write on health-reform issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have reached a point in the congressional struggle over health-care reform 
where there is enough opposition to defeat the Clinton Administration's plan 
but nothing like a firm majority for an alternative. With proposals emerging 
from the House Ways and Means Committee, Senate Finance Committee and three 
other committees, the press reports are confusing, the policy issues are 
unintelligible to most Americans and the chances of deadlock are considerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Can a workable version of national reform be enacted when no majority exists 
for any single plan? The answer is yes, but you'd never know it from the 
compromise proposals now making the rounds. The real challenge for reformers is 
to find a strategy that reflects whatever agreement there is on the goals of 
health reform and accommodates the disagreements on means. Instead, in the 
search for a plan that can pass, the compromisers focus on what seems doable 
politically rather than what is substantively desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of these political compromises -- which look appealing on the surface 
but are badly thought through -- currently crowd the agenda: 
</P>
<P>
 * Amending the definition of "universal coverage." Debates on this issue mask 
a substantive disagreement about how great a role public compulsion, of either 
individuals or businesses, should play in ensuring coverage. A group in the 
Senate Finance Committee including John Chafee (R-R.I.) and John Breaux (D-La.) 
suggests giving up President Clinton's nearly 100% goal and substituting a 95% 
coverage "target" by the 2002. This approach is misguided because it fails to 
confront either the large-scale insecurity or the cost escalation problems that 
have driven reform. Who will the 5% left uncovered turn out to be? You? Me? The 
chronically ill? The usually well? Only if we know the answers to these 
questions would we know whether reform was likely to achieve its major goals. 
The methods proposed to increase coverage if it falls below the target 
percentage may also be misaimed -- either ineffective (another study of the 
problem) or pointed in the wrong direction (employer mandates, which would 
fizzle if the uninsured were not workers). 
</P>
<P>
 * A continuing aversion to straight talk about paying for reform. This was 
evident in President Clinton's original proposal that employers pay for the 
health insurance of their employees, reinforcing the delusion that because 
employers write checks for health insurance, they bear the costs. Then and now, 
it is we citizens who bear the costs, whether it's through direct taxes, 
increased prices or forgone wages and employment. The only relevant questions 
-- then or now -- concern the fairness and sustainability of the distribution 
of the costs. We will keep paying a steep price in confusion and discord until 
this crucial matter is understood. Those who want to avoid all mandates -- 
individual or employer -- have given us a scheme that is truly illusory: Tax 
40% of the most expensive health-insurance plans to provide subsidies for low- 
and moderate-income Americans. But people in expensive plans may be there 
because they are ill, not because they are rich. And the game-playing that will 
go on by people trying to stay below the 60th percentile ought to reemploy any 
insurance company personnel laid off by other reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forgetting about the cost-control problems that prompted the reform movement 
in the first place. The continuing escalation of health costs, which still 
threatens the affordability of health insurance, has dropped out of the 
vocabulary of compromise. Words like moderate or centrist typically appear in 
descriptions of senators like Breaux, Chafee, David Durenberger (R-Minn.), Kent 
Conrad (D-N.D.), David Boren (D-Okla.) and others, but they don't fit the 
reforms sponsored by them, because they contain no serious approaches to cost 
control. Just as it does not make sense to cross a chasm in two steps rather 
than a leap, it is impossible to have workable health reform without slowing 
the rate of expenditure increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a compromise that builds on agreed goals but permits enough variation 
of means to assemble a majority for reform? One possibility is state-led reform 
(in this, California is a leader, with its modified single-payer health-reform 
initiative on the November ballot). Congress could pass legislation that 
provided federal assistance to states that enacted universal coverage, 
insurance law reform and reasonable controls on costs. This would leave states 
free to choose which administrative and health-delivery changes they wanted to 
implement. By mandating basic reform principles without imposing their 
administration, state-led reform builds on the reformers' consensus about goals 
while allowing for wide differences in the means of achieving them. 
</P>
<P>
 States already have a significant track record in health reform, including 
Hawaii's near-universal coverage and employer mandates. Given the diversity of 
states, their varied experience with health care and intense local preferences, 
why enact a single brand of national health reform, especially if it's the 
poorly considered compromise that we seem to be headed toward?  
</P>
<P>
 By moving compromise in the direction of preserving goals rather than defining 
means, we can allow states the further thought and experimentation that are 
needed for effective implementation.

COLUMN RIGHT/ SUSAN CARPENTER MCMILLAN: A SOCIAL STIGMA FOR ABORTION? LET'S 
HOPE SO; A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS THAT IT MAY GO THE WAY OF SMOKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

spokesperson for the Pro-Family Media Coalition of Southern California and a 
founder of ShE LIST, a conservative women's political-action committee.

 New figures released recently by the Alan Guttmacher Institute showed that the 
rate of abortions performed in the United States is at its lowest since 1979. 
The Guttmacher Institute, which is the research arm of the powerful 
pro-abortion organization Planned Parenthood, cited several reasons for the 
drop: a reduced number of abortion clinics and abortionists who perform them, 
increased influence of pro-life demonstrations and a growing aversion to 
abortion on moral grounds.  
</P>
<P>
 With the Supreme Court firmly committed to keeping abortion legal, this 
decline should signal new hope for pro-lifers. Despite unmovable obstacles, the 
anti-abortion message is finally beginning to penetrate the public's 
consciousness, after 21 long years. I believe that the downturn in abortion 
statistics marks the beginning of the end for abortion on demand, much as early 
no-smoking areas marked the beginning of the end of unrestricted tobacco fumes 
in public places. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues of abortion and smoking have much in common. Both industries 
quickly recognized that public ignorance can be a powerful tool when properly 
used by the barons of deceit. Like smoking, abortion was reduced to a 
non-harmful procedure: Cigarettes were touted as providing a calming stimulus; 
the living fetus became a glob of tissue. Both have received millions of tax 
dollars on top of the millions they make as profitable businesses. Both have 
been slickly packaged, skillfully marketed and shamefully popularized. Both 
employ influential Washington lobbyists, and both remain under the safety net 
of "choice."  
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco and abortion industries both have adopted variations of the 
rationale that "no one's forcing you, so don't try to stop me." Both industries 
vehemently deny scientific facts and continue to bastardize the truth. But the 
most undeniable fact of all is that both kill.  
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1960s, the pro-abortion movement methodically plotted a strategy 
that would overturn the long-standing social taboo of terminating fetal life. 
In short, they figured out a way to successfully sell killing to the American 
public. They began by enlisting the support of willing media, bombarding them 
with statistics and stories that went unchallenged by a traditionally skeptical 
profession. Next, they turned abortion into a "women's-rights issue," pitting 
the entire sex against the historically male-dominated institutions of 
religion. Women vs. men, rights vs. religion, the timing was impeccable, as 
many people were already in the process of waging a war for civil rights. The 
civil-rights movement, the women's movement and the peace movement all made the 
timing ripe for this kind of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, the abortion industry then achieved legalization of abortion for the 
entire nine months of pregnancy through the infamous Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court 
decision. Next, stealing a page from the tobacco industry's handbook, they soon 
made abortion socially acceptable. Medical students, in many cases, were 
required to learn how to perform abortions, which ensured the removal of any 
stigma from the procedure. The fetus was reduced to nothing more than a 
fertilized egg, federal funds were obtained and the industry began to boom.  
</P>
<P>
 The opposition, on the other hand, was underfunded, overworked and had zero 
access to hostile and biased media. But what the anti-abortion movement did 
have were facts and dedication. Much like the anti-smoking crusaders, 
pro-lifers aggressively took on one of the most powerful industries in the 
country. And finally, after years of pro-lifers' continual vigilance and 
stamina, an enlightened public is beginning to "choose" to say no to abortion. 
In the end, however, abortion, like smoking, will never be completely outlawed. 
It will always to some degree be available and legal. But through committed 
activists, diligent volunteers and persistent education on fetal life, the 
demand for abortion, like smoking, seems to be burning itself out.  
</P>
<P>
 Thank goodness that abortion, like smoking, is finally beginning to have a 
negative social stigma attached to it, reminding us that evil always has a 
lifespan, while truth is timeless.

COLUMN LEFT/ HARRY BERNSTEIN: COAL MINERS GET THE SHAFT FROM NLRB; THE BOARD'S 
NEW CHAIRMAN, A LIBERAL, TAKES A TOUGH STANCE AGAINST WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN, Harry Bernstein was for many years The Times' labor writer.

<P>
 Despite some encouraging words from President Clinton and his appointment of 
yet another committee to look into the problem, there is almost no chance 
Congress will make any major improvements during his Administration in 
America's outdated labor laws that mostly help corporations and hurt unions. 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton says he wants changes, he is in the middle of furious battles 
with Republicans and some Democrats over everything from health care and 
welfare reform to foreign policy, and he isn't likely to fight hard for 
labor-law reform since that would provoke even more conflict with Congress and 
gridlock with the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 So the best that unions can hope for as their ranks dwindle is an end to the 
decades of mostly pro-management decisions from the National Labor Relations 
Board. And that is a pretty slim hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was cheered last year by labor and liberals when he nominated Stanford 
law professor William Gould IV to be chairman of the powerful NLRB, which 
enforces the country's labor laws and tries to encourage peace between unions 
and business. After nine months of opposition from conservatives, Gould was 
confirmed by the Senate in March.  
</P>
<P>
 In the battles between powerful corporations and badly weakened unions, Gould, 
a labor-relations expert, is an arbitrator who promises to remain neutral in 
those usually one-sided battles. That doesn't offer much encouragement for the 
embattled labor movement, since Gould will have to rely heavily on the exact 
language of what is now bad law. 
</P>
<P>
 From my past contacts with Gould, I know that he is sympathetic to unions, 
labor-management cooperation and the concept of collective bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But with most corporations today striving for what they call a "union-free 
environment," Gould has a seemingly impossible job in trying to bring real 
fairness to labor-management disputes by simply following our current unfair 
laws.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet if anyone can make a valiant effort toward that goal, it could be Gould. 
He is the most openly pro-union NLRB chairman since Frank W. McCulloch, who 
chaired the board more than 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould has held the job for little more than three months, so any judgment of 
his performance would be premature. But based on his record to date, he will 
have to try harder to overcome the NLRB's pro-management stance of recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 One ominous sign was Gould's deciding NLRB vote to seek as much as $1.3 
million in contempt fines from the United Mine Workers for alleged picket-line 
misconduct during last year's seven-month strike against 12 coal companies. 
</P>
<P>
 UMW President Richard Trumka furiously denounced Gould, saying his vote was 
reactionary and a bad omen for future decisions. Other union leaders agreed. 
All whom I contacted viewed Gould's vote against the miners as a distressing 
start for him as NLRB chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Gould was determined to prove he is not blindly pro-union, since 
management critics almost blocked his confirmation on grounds that he was too 
liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 But with his vote in the miners' case, Gould went too far to make his point. 
The coal-strike settlement included an agreement between mine owners and the 
union to drop all picket-line misconduct charges against the union and charges 
of unfair labor practice against the companies. Even the government-appointed 
mediator, William J. Usery, urged Gould and other NLRB members to dismiss the 
charges against the miners. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, Gould has moved to streamline the slow-moving NLRB. He is 
trying to expedite union representation elections and speed up adjudication of 
unfair-labor-practice charges against companies, since lengthy delays usually 
favor management. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Gould has been tougher on workers and unions than need be. But in the 
long run, he is still likely to be far more evenhanded than any of his 
predecessors in the past few decades. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the only way to put some real justice in our labor law would be for 
Congress to enact major changes. A good first step would be passage of the 
workplace fairness bill, which would ban the permanent replacement of strikers 
-- a tool that allows management to vitiate the unions' most potent weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would finally remedy a foolish 1938 Supreme Court ruling holding that 
workers had the legal right to strike without being fired, but also finding 
that it would be legal to "permanently replace" them -- as though there was a 
difference.

PROPERTY VALUES: ESCROW PROCESS CAN BE PUZZLING IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although almost everyone who has bought or sold a home in California has been 
through escrow, it remains confusing for many people. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the confusion is that there is no uniform pricing for escrow 
services and that different types of escrow service providers are regulated by 
different state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply defined, an escrow is a deposit of funds, deed or other instrument by 
one party for delivery to another party. The principals to the escrow -- the 
buyer, seller, lender and / or borrower -- forward their escrow instructions to 
an escrow officer, who is supposed to assure that no funds or property will 
change hands until all the instructions in the transaction have been followed. 
The escrow officer must follow all the principals' instructions, paying all 
bills as authorized, distributing funds and accounting for disbursements in the 
form of a written closing or settlement statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The escrow process is often likened to a jigsaw puzzle -- it's not complete 
until all the pieces are in place. On the seller's side, the deed to a property 
must be surrendered, liens must be settled and a termite report needs to be 
secured. The buyer must make a cash down payment, and get a new loan, fire 
insurance and possibly a home protection plan. 
</P>
<P>
 All escrow companies in California can be classified into two basic 
categories: licensed or so-called controlled. Licensed escrow companies are 
independent businesses licensed by the California Department of Corporations. 
Controlled escrow companies are owned by a variety of real estate related 
entities and are regulated by a patchwork of agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate and mortgage brokers who provide escrow services are supervised by 
the California Department of Real Estate, title insurers by the Department of 
Insurance and lenders by the California Superintendent of Banks or the 
Department of Savings and Loan. Lawyers can also facilitate an escrow, but this 
is rarely done in California because of the high cost of legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a growing battle for escrow business in the San Fernando and Santa 
Clarita valleys and Ventura County. The number of independent escrow companies 
has been declining as title companies and other "controlled" escrow providers 
snatch a bigger share of the business. Consumers could benefit from the 
competition, but they might also be confused about who to turn to when buying a 
home or refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
 The roughly 80 licensed independent escrow providers in the region say they 
are the only unbiased escrow companies. Other companies, they argue, can't do 
an arms-length transaction if they are associated with a real estate firm, 
lender or title insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Licensed independents are required by law to insure consumers' funds against 
theft or misappropriation with a bond purchased through the Escrow Agents' 
Fidelity Corp. They also must meet certain net worth or minimum liquidity 
requirements, surety bonding and regular audits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Title companies and other controlled escrow services are not neutral," said 
Ken Carver, owner of Carver Escrow in North Hollywood. "We, as an independent, 
have no ax to grind." 
</P>
<P>
 But whoever is performing the escrow service has to follow all the escrow 
instructions, and even independent escrow companies can find themselves 
beholden to clients who bring them lots of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent escrow companies are anxious because their numbers are waning as 
they find it harder to compete with discounted services offered by title 
insurance companies. Carver recalled recently declining an office building 
transaction because he couldn't compete with the lower price offered by a title 
insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Carver's original bid was for $1,800. When the client asked for a discount, he 
matched the title insurance company bid of $1,000. But then the title company 
said it would charge just $200 for its escrow services, which Carver said he 
couldn't afford to match. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within five years, there will be far fewer independent escrow companies," 
Carver predicted. "The title companies will wipe us out and they'll have a 
monopoly. Then prices will go up." 
</P>
<P>
 Carver said he charges each side of an escrow transaction a $100 flat fee, 
plus another $2 per side for each $1,000 of the transaction value. For the sale 
of a $300,000 home, this would translate into a cost of $700 for the seller and 
$700 for the buyer. For a refinancing, the cost would be $700 for the owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Lawyers Title Co. in Pasadena charges a total of $990 for the same 
size transaction in the San Fernando Valley, which is split between the buyer 
and seller, said Edward Beierle, the firm's senior vice president and general 
counsel. That's about 30% less than Carver's fees. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Beierle argued, consumers benefit from the backing of a large 
title insurer versus a small local escrow company. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Hanson, vice president of Benevest Escrow Co., which has offices in 
Sherman Oaks, countered: "The title company that discounts its services can't 
offer the same services that I do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is no uniform pricing, it is hard for consumers to know whether 
they are getting a good deal. "There is a wide difference in pricing, depending 
on where you are located," Hanson said. "In Northern California, we can't 
charge as much as we do in Southern California." And in Southern California, 
she said, prices vary from neighborhood to neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the price, consumers should be sure that they are dealing with a 
reputable escrow company. One important question to ask is what happens to 
escrow funds if they are embezzled. There should be some sort of insurance or 
fidelity bond to protect your transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 In August last year, California Escrow Systems Inc., an independently licensed 
escrow agent, was seized by regulators after several hundred thousand dollars 
were missing from trust accounts. Fortunately for clients of California Escrow 
Systems, the company was required by law to be backed by insurance from the 
Escrow Agents' Fidelity Corp. The Department of Real Estate says it has no 
similar requirements for escrow operations affiliated with real estate and 
mortgage brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 500 home buyers and sellers involved in transactions with Country 
Oaks Escrow Inc. in Santa Clarita also faced the loss of $2.75 million that 
state investigators said was embezzled by the company's owners. Country Oaks, 
which was the state's third-largest escrow company, was shut down by the 
Department of Corporations in June, 1993. As with California Escrow Systems, 
losses were insured by the nonprofit Escrow Agents' Fidelity Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Escrow Institute of California publishes a number of pamphlets that are 
available free to consumers. These include "'Your Escrow and You," "Dictionary 
of Escrow Terms" and "What a Licensed Escrow Company Can Do for You." The 
toll-free number to call to receive these publications is (800) 3-ESCROW.

 COMET CLEANSER? You won't feel even a ripple here, but if some experts are 
right, Jupiter will get quite a jolt July 16. That's when an enormous comet is 
expected to collide with that planet. The ramifications will be debated at a 
free lecture Thursday night at San Juan Capistrano's San Juan Institute, which 
specializes in studies of the solar system. . . . Telescopes will be set up so 
you can get a "before" look at Jupiter. The consensus among scientists: The 
collision should be fascinating, but shouldn't have widespread effects on the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
 FLAG BURNERS: Burning the American flag might get a political protester in 
trouble, but it's considered a glorious tradition if you're a Boy Scout or Girl 
Scout. . . . That is why the Girl Scouts are asking you to take a look to see 
if your flag is old or tattered and needs to be replaced. If so, take it to the 
Newland House at 19820 Beach Blvd. in Huntington Beach on Saturday afternoon. 
The Girl Scouts there will burn it, they say, to "retire it in the proper 
patriotic manner."

<P>
 NEW ZEAL: The Alaskan Eagle, the 65-foot sloop owned by Orange Coast College, 
takes on its most ambitious jaunt yet July 16. . . . It sails each summer, 
usually for three- to five-month trips with students and staff to Hawaii or the 
South Pacific. This time, it's on a yearlong journey to New Zealand. Nicole 
Carbon, an Orange Coast engineering major, won one of the scholarships to sail 
the first leg of the trip. "It's always been my dream to sail around the 
world," says Carbon. "This is the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 TAKING ATOLL: The Alaskan Eagle will carry more than just students. It's also 
loaded with medical supplies to be turned over to clinics at remote Pacific 
islands and atolls where the boat will be stopping. Dr. Gilbert Roys of Anaheim 
Memorial Hospital, who led the collecting of the supplies, is taking three 
weeks' vacation to sail along and handle their distribution. Besides loving to 
sail, he says, "If I can help these people with their medical needs, I'll have 
even more fun."

MARION WILLIAMS; LEADING GOSPEL SINGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gospel singer Marion Williams, whose love and mastery of spiritual music 
influenced greats from Aretha Franklin to Little Richard, has died in 
Philadelphia at age 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams died Saturday of vascular disease at Albert Einstein Medical 
Institute. Although she suffered from diabetes and severe kidney problems in 
recent years, Williams continued to sing to audiences throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Her soaring voice radiated the richness and power of gospel music. She won 
many accolades. In December, Williams was the first gospel singer ever honored 
by the Kennedy Center in Washington. There, she sang for President Clinton and 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "For almost a half-century now," Clinton said, "no voice has soared like that 
of Miss Marion Williams." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams also was the first singer to win a "genius" grant from the MacArthur 
Foundation, a total of $374,000 in cash. The foundation hailed Williams as "one 
of the greatest and most versatile singers of her generation, exerting a 
profound influence not only in gospel, but also in the development of rock 'n' 
roll and soul music." 
</P>
<P>
 When news of the honor arrived a year ago, she was working in the soup kitchen 
of her Philadelphia church. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling Stone magazine had the highest praise for Williams, considering her 
not only the greatest of all gospel singers, but "possibly the best singer 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
 She appeared on stage with Duke Ellington and Dizzy Gillespie. And her 
powerful voice and extraordinary range influenced an array of singers. Little 
Richard once credited his high-pitched trills and falsetto whoops to hearing 
Williams when he was young. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Aug. 29, 1927, to humble beginnings in Miami, Williams was the youngest 
of 11 children. Only three of her siblings survived past their first year. 
</P>
<P>
 By age 3, Williams had started singing "the Lord's music," along with her 
mother, a soloist in the church choir. "My mother had a voice on her," Williams 
said in an interview. "Her number was 'Oh, Jesus, Let Me Ride,' and she used to 
sing it at church every Sunday. People, white people and black people, used to 
come from all around Miami Beach to hear my mama sing." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was during a visit to her sister's in Philadelphia at age 17 that 
Williams won notice. After singing a gospel song at a local church, Williams 
received such an ovation that she was invited to join the Ward Singers, a 
premier gospel group at the time. With them, she toured the United States and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marion came out of the Pentecostal culture, and she brought a fire to the 
Ward Singers. When she sang, she would simply turn the church out," said 
Bernice Johnson Reagon, a curator at the National Museum of American History at 
the Smithsonian Institution and author of a book on gospel history. "She is 
simply the best we had during the classical gospel era of the '40s and '50s." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1959, she had formed her own gospel group, the Stars of Faith, which toured 
widely. Williams struck out on her own in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout her career, she rejected offers to sing "secular music" ranging 
from blues to jazz. "I was offered $100,000 to make one blues record, and I 
turned it down," she said. "I sing for the Lord, and that's enough for me." 
Williams described herself as a woman "practically born in a church" and said: 
"I ain't no rock 'n' roller. I'm a holy roller." 
</P>
<P>
 She recorded 10 solo albums, including her latest, "I Can't Keep It to 
Myself." Her music is heard in such movies as "Fried Green Tomatoes" and 
"Mississippi Masala." And she appeared on Bill Moyers' PBS documentary "Amazing 
Grace." 
</P>
<P>
 "She knew how to move you from one emotion to another without jilting you and 
when you least expected it, she would drop a vocal bomb on you," said the Rev. 
Clarence Blair, operations manager for a 24-hour religious radio station in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "What she did was real, it was not a game," Blair said. "Her singing was an 
extension of her religious commitment."

FEAR OF CRIME LINGERS AFTER RESCUE OF GIRL, 12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When kidnaped 12-year-old Kathleen (Katie) Romanek emerged from a parched cow 
pasture, it brought sobs of relief from residents and praise for the 
near-instant response from law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the girl's 20-hour abduction that ended Sunday raised fears that this 
close-knit farm town is not the haven that residents had always imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that she was able to walk out of that area is good news," said 
Maureen Alldredge, a senior citizen who had joined about 500 volunteers helping 
with the search. "But this has shown us that this stuff permeates our society. 
We are all now aware that this world is unsafe, even in Lodi." 
</P>
<P>
 Katie, kidnaped at knifepoint Saturday evening from her Lodi home, was bruised 
on her lip and eye but otherwise appeared unharmed, according to San Joaquin 
County Sheriff Baxter Dunn. She reportedly was back home with her family 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police on Sunday arrested Steven Reece Cochran, 25, and booked him on 
investigation of burglary, kidnaping and sexual assault. He was being held 
without bail. Cochran has served time in jail in Arizona for burglary, Lodi 
Police Chief Larry Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie's rescue and the arrest climaxed a frantic search set in full motion 
within hours of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen said the efforts paid off in capturing Cochran, who collapsed shortly 
after surrendering to authorities just outside the rural town of Bellota. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very much aware of the intensity of the police search," Hansen said. 
"I believe it was just a shrugging of the shoulders and then giving up." 
</P>
<P>
 Katie, too, knew police were searching for her -- she could hear a helicopter 
above the field where she was being held captive. But as she was whisked from 
the scene to a nearby hospital, she told deputies she had just one desire. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was concerned about seeing her parents," said Dunn, the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 The relief of Katie's father, Bob Romanek, was apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thank God that we got her back," he said.

COMMENTARY; WORK STOPPAGE A LOSS FOR ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER SCHMUCK, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everybody loses. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's get that straight right at the beginning. If the Major League Baseball 
Players Association sets a strike date next Monday and then goes through with 
its threat to shut down the final months of the season, everybody loses. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans lose, because the mixed blessing of realignment -- for better and 
worse -- has made the 1994 season one of the most interesting in years. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners lose, because they dragged their feet on a revenue-sharing plan and 
now are in danger of losing great sums of playoff and World Series money. 
</P>
<P>
 The top players in the game lose, because they make tremendous salaries and 
several players -- most notably Seattle Mariners home run machine Ken Griffey 
-- appear to be on their way to record performances. 
</P>
<P>
 And the youngest players lose, because they are the ones most vulnerable to 
the financial hardship that would be created by a lengthy work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the owners and players appear to be on a collision course again, 
their differences so fundamental that another lengthy strike, such as the one 
that interrupted the 1981 season for 50 days, appears all too likely. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of such a strike would depend almost entirely on the resolve of 
the union membership, so the question of who loses the most is most relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 For every Cal Ripken or Barry Bonds at the top of the salary scale, there are 
a dozen Jack Voigts, guys who make close to the major-league minimum salary and 
would lose a third of it if a strike were called Aug. 1. That could mean making 
as little as $75,000 this year -- which might seem all right to the average man 
on the street, but isn't all that much for a kid who's supporting a family back 
home and keeping an apartment in the city. Especially if there is no guarantee 
that he'll be back next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Difficult as it might be to imagine, even the players making millions could 
face some short-term hardship if they have overplayed their financial hand and 
under-prepared for a serious crimp in their cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked a little bit about that," said Florida Marlins player 
representative Bryan Harvey. "We've been telling them, 'Save your money.' 
Fortunately, most of our guys don't have three cars and three houses. We talked 
about it last year, when there was a possibility of a strike. Hopefully, they 
have put enough aside to hold them over." 
</P>
<P>
 No one is going to be left completely out in the cold. The players union has 
been setting aside a portion of each player's share of licensing revenues since 
1990 in anticipation of another work stoppage. The total strike fund is 
estimated to be at least $150 million, so some players could be eligible for as 
much as $150,000 in relief payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Those benefits would be based directly on the amount contributed by each 
player, however, so the players who need the most financial help actually might 
be entitled to the least strike relief. The union withheld a third of the 
licensing revenue in 1990, half in 1991, two-thirds in 1992 and all but $5,000 
per player last year. 
</P>
<P>
 If a player came into the major leagues midway through the 1993 season, he 
might have only $30,000 (less a prorated share of strike-related union 
expenses) set aside. If a player entered the league two months into this 
season, he would have almost no share of the union war chest, but union reps 
say that those players will not be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it should be a problem right out of the chute, and even if it 
becomes a problem for them, that will be taken care of quickly," said Baltimore 
Orioles pitcher Jim Poole, who is the club's alternate player rep. "There are 
plans to take care of players who have no service time before this year. 
They'll be taken care of, whether they have time or not." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the young guys understand, we're doing it for them just as the 
players in 1981 did it for us," Orioles player rep Mike Mussina said. "In 1990, 
I was in that situation. We didn't feel we should give in because of baseball 
and the players. You've got to look at it long term." 
</P>
<P>
 The fans can look at it only short term. The Cleveland Indians are in first 
place and looking like a postseason team for the first time in 40 years. 
Griffey is on pace to challenge Roger Maris' single-season home run mark, and 
Matt Williams and Frank Thomas are not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken just moved within one season of breaking Lou Gehrig's once-seemingly 
untouchable record of 2,130 consecutive games played. If the players strike the 
last two months of the season, it would push the date of his projected 
record-breaking game back from late June 1995 to August or September. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a shame to lose this year," Harvey said. "This is my seventh 
year in the majors, and I've never seen anything like what guys like Griffey, 
Thomas and Jeff Bagwell are doing right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey has come out in full support of the union. The players have shown 
amazing solidarity at a time when their interests are far more diverse than 
ever before in the history of the game's labor/management relationship.

 Greg Gumbel will replace Jim Lampley as the host of NBC's "NFL Live" pregame 
show, the network announced. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gumbel was signed last month, NBC said he would be used as a play-by-play 
announcer on NFL football.But Gumbel and Lampley have switched roles, with 
Lampley taking over Gumbel's play-by-play spot. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC spokesman Ed Markey said the change was made because of Lampley's HBO 
conflicts and also because Lampley, who lives in Los Angeles, had to make 
weekly trips to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Gumbel's first NBC assignment will be as host of the pregame coverage for the 
baseball All-Star game July 12. He will also serve as host of NBC's "Baseball 
Night in America," which makes its debut Friday, Aug. 26.

in the 1927 Rose Bowl. He was the captain of the 1928 team.

 Luis Arnaiz, veteran journalist from the sports newspaper "AS" in Madrid, 
joined the growing list of soccer experts who said this World Cup might be the 
the most exciting ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been to seven World Cups, and I have nothing like I have seen here," 
Arnaiz said."Every place you go here, stadiums are full. In no other country 
has it ever been like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Arnaiz: "The big games in each country are always sold out, but a gem 
like South Korea and Bolivia? Or Saudis and Belgium? In other World Cups, those 
games get 5,000 people. Here they get 65,000 people. It is amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnaiz said that judging from the crowds, he feels the only way for an 
American professional league to survive is to divide it in terms of ethnic 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have one team just Irish, another team Mexicans, another team Dutch," he 
said. "If you do it like that, each of those teams would have a huge 
following." BILL PLASCHKE

 Another look at U.S.-Brazil: "Let's talk a little about the American team.I 
see it as the weakest of the teams that have moved to the next level. Even 
Saudi Arabia stronger. Bora Milutinovic organized a competitive team for sure. 
Nobody works harder. From the goalkeeper (Tony) Meola to Marcelo Balboa to Tab 
Ramos, they are tireless. Physically they appear to be very well prepared 
Technically, however, the American team is still in the age of innocence."

 In Bangladesh, fans marched by the angry hundreds and burned the FIFA 
president in effigy. In Calcutta, candle-lit shrines sprang up at street 
corners, where fans prayed for the salvation of their idol. 
</P>
<P>
 One man in Calcutta, the teeming Bengali city that since the turn of the 
century has been a hotbed of both leftism and soccer, blamed the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diego Armando Maradona is the latest victim of the evil hand of American 
imperialism," Supid Bose wrote to a Calcutta newspaper. "It is evident to all, 
save those who have been rendered blind by the forces of consumerism in the 
United States that Maradona is the victim of a deep-seated plot.

<P>
 "Would the hero of Latin American football be banned if he had not sent a 
signed jersey to the great Fidel Castro?" Bose demanded.

 Belgians were sad and bitter about their team's exit from the World Cup after 
its 3-2 defeat by the Germans on Saturday. As expected, chief among their 
complaints is the non-call by referee Kurt Roethlisberger when Germany's Thomas 
Helmer took down Josip Weber in the penalty area in the 70th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 From Page 1 of the Walloon daily "La Derniere Heure" (The Last Hour), under 
the headline "Red card for the referee": 
</P>
<P>
 "Switzerland was famous for its banks and its chocolate. Now, she will also be 
famous due to a certain Kurt Roethlisberger, international referee, who 
distinguished himself on Saturday by refusing (Belgium) a penalty for an 
unmistakable foul by Helmer on Josip Weber." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Belgium's first-round defeat by Saudi Arabia is linked to the Saturday 
Loss in La Libre Belgique's headline: "The Germans have finished the work of 
the Saudis." 
</P>
<P>
 Le Soir was milder, saying merely: "Superfluous regrets: the (team) comes back 
home; some trace of bitterness. . . ."

ART REVIEW; KERTESZ: PICTURING TRUTH; GETTY'S SENSITIVE SELECTION PAYS TRIBUTE 
TO THE PHOTOGRAPHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Andre Kertesz is one of the great classic figures of modern photography. 
"Andre Kertesz: A Centennial Tribute" at the J. Paul Getty Museum celebrates 
the 100th anniversary of his birth in Hungary in 1894. 
</P>
<P>
 The show consists of about 50 images drawn from some 160 owned by the Getty, 
and they are crafted into another of those impeccable exhibitions we've come to 
expect from curator Weston Naef. It's accompanied by a pocket-size paperback 
monograph that has the intimate feel of those first art books we all treasured 
as kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensitive selection of these shows causes visitors to linger, pensively. 
They raise the old blue-sky questions about how, and why, this is so good. Here 
we get answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kertesz was a master at making the commonplace appear unexpected. One of his 
first signature images is "Underwater Swimmer," a World War I period picture of 
a young man taking pool therapy for a battle wound. The water distortions in 
the bird's-eye view make him look headless. Absurdist wit is tinged with Dada 
violence and Surreal vision, but the picture is primarily an autobiographical 
response: Kertesz was himself wounded in the Great War. Photographs that 
suggest maiming continue in images of manikins and artificial limbs leading to 
his unforgettable "Arm and Ventilator," where a man's arm looks as if it's 
about to be severed by an industrial-strength fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kertesz certainly became artistically sophisticated when he moved to Paris in 
1925. Among others, he eknew Mondrian and shared some of the painter's pristine 
vision. Beginning here it's possible for the artistically literate to find 
references to modernist styles. Kertesz's "Distortion 150," an image of a 
female nude, looks like a Henry Moore. The collage "Going for a Walk" was 
influenced by Cubism. "Martinique," which depicts a silhouette of a figure 
behind glass contemplating the ocean, is reminiscent of Rene Magritte's brand 
of Surrealism. Such observations may have value but they miss the point. The 
"ism" is never the first thing you see in a Kertesz photograph. What you do see 
is a snippet of the real transformed by a particular poetic sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 He had the kind of restraint that clarifies expression. "Mrs. Hubbell" wears a 
conservative suit, but her slight smile and the lovely fall of her hand make 
her sexier than Marlene Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
 Naef makes his curatorial point by emphasizing early and later works that 
bracket the Paris period. Every photographic amateur knows the 1921 "The 
Circus, Budapest" with its couple peeking through a knothole. This unique 
exercise in amused tolerance owes nothing to anyone except the temperament that 
produced it. 
</P>
<P>
 Less familiar, perhaps, is the magic of early photographs as small as 
oversized postage stamps or never quite as large as a postcard. They express an 
innate artistic grasp of scale more often ascribed to poets and painters than 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dancing Faun" captures one of those fairy-tale moments of youth in an 
oval format not 2 inches wide. It shows Kertesz's brother's naked silhouette 
dancing among foliage delicate as ferns. Later Kertesz varied the theme in 
Parisian scenes, where giant smokestacks or the Eiffel Tower become as intimate 
as dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like thousands of other Europeans beleaguered by the onslaught of World War 
II, the artist fled Europe, settling in New York in 1936. His pictures do not 
complain of Manhattan's sometimes overwhelming monumentality or the refugee's 
problems of making a new life except in the most oblique and endearing way. In 
"The Lost Cloud," a wonderful little puff of atmosphere floats by a skyscraper. 
"Puddle, New York" captures the grit and grandeur of Manhattan by reflecting 
the Empire State Building in melting snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Kertesz had a remarkable understanding of the formalities that make imagery 
powerful, an innate grasp of style and a wonderful gentleness of expression. 
Maybe the most important quality of his pictures is that they make you like 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 His temperament puts you in mind of Jean Renoir. Both come across as men with 
no illusions and who love life anyway. Both their works leave you with the 
sense of having been seduced by someone who just wants to tell the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kertesz's photographs make you glad he lived to be 91.

 Wedding Bells: Actor Liam Neeson, 42, and actress Natasha Richardson, 31, who 
met while performing Eugene O'Neill's "Anna Christie" on Broadway, were married 
Sunday in a private ceremony at their country home in Upstate New York. About 
70 guests attended, including the bride's mother, Vanessa Redgrave; Steven 
Spielberg and wife Kate Capshaw; Mia Farrow; Emma Thompson, and director Ron 
Shelton. THE ARTS

 Expanding Tanglewood: The popular Tanglewood festival of classical music in 
Lenox, Mass., which began 60 years ago on a makeshift stage in the horse ring 
of a farm, will dedicate its new concert hall and larger campus on Thursday. 
The $9.7-million concert hall will anchor the neighboring 120-acre campus 
purchased in 1986. Inside the five-story hall's airy interior, cellist Yo-Yo Ma 
and pianists Peter Serkin and Leon Fleisher will join in a program of music by 
Bach, Beethoven, Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein. Tanglewood managers, 
reaching back to the festival's past and celebrating its present, named the new 
campus after Bernstein and the hall after Seiji Ozawa. Bernstein often taught 
and conducted at Tanglewood while Ozawa leads the Boston Symphony Orchestra, 
which makes its summer home at Tanglewood.

 * Statue Vandalized: The missing left arm of a landmark Madrid statue, ripped 
off by soccer fans during wild celebrations of Spain's weekend World Cup 
victory, was found Monday in a plastic bag laying on a city street. Police said 
about 2,500 soccer fans had swarmed around the 212-year-old statue of the 
goddess Cibeles, which dominates a fountain in the tree-lined Paseo de la 
Castellana, after Spain beat Switzerland on Saturday to advance to the World 
Cup quarterfinals. There was no word from conservators Monday on whether the 
statue could be repaired.

 p Carrying On: The show must go on, even when the lead baritone has collapsed 
on opening night and his understudy has been sent home. Singer Anthony 
Michaels-Moore fell ill after the first act of Jules Massenet's "Manon" at 
London's Royal Opera House on Saturday night, and with no replacement singer to 
go on stage, conductor David Syrus finally filled the gap by singing from the 
wings, while producer Stuart Maunder mimed on stage. "Under the circumstances, 
the audience reacted very well. The solution was hardly ideal, but it saved the 
show from being a disaster," said Helen Anderson, an opera house spokeswoman. 
None of the audience, which paid up to $150 for tickets, asked for a refund.

 * Bowl Changes: Guitarist Mundell Lowe will appear at the Hollywood Bowl on 
Wednesday, on a bill that features fellow guitarists George Benson and Lee 
Ritenour in a tribute to the late Joe Pass. Lowe replaces Charlie Byrd, who 
canceled his appearance because of scheduling conflicts. Meanwhile, Patti 
Austin will replace Chaka Khan on Sunday at JVC Jazz at the Bowl. Khan also 
withdrew because of a scheduling conflict. TELEVISION

became interested in broadcasting three years ago as host of the monthly "Ask 
the Lieutenant Governor" show on WLS. "The bug bit, to put it quite simply," he 
said. Kustra made $72,775 a year as lieutenant governor. His new salary wasn't

THEATER REVIEW; SANDRA REAVES INCARNATES 'GREAT LADIES OF BLUES & JAZZ' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A theater piece based upon impressions of famous blues and jazz singers 
doesn't exactly trigger a sense of eager anticipation. It has, after all, been 
attempted in the past, rarely with much artistic success, in settings ranging 
from Diana Ross' idiosyncratic rendering of Billie Holiday in the movie "Lady 
Sings the Blues" to last summer's erratic theater production of "Sang, Sista, 
Sang." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was all before singer Sandra Reaves decided to do her own versions of 
Holiday, Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters, Dinah Washington and Mahalia 
Jackson. Her performance Sunday in "The Late Great Ladies of Blues & Jazz" at 
the Richard Pryor Theatre succinctly underlines the three elements that are 
required to do the job right -- talent, talent and more talent. 
</P>
<P>
 And Reaves is loaded with it. The first half of the show -- despite superb 
impressions of Rainey, Smith and Waters -- is a bit slow, in part because the 
dramatic segments, conceived and written by Reaves, fail to delineate some of 
the real distinctions between the three blues-associated performers. A stronger 
feeling, for example, for Rainey's insistence upon retaining the country blues 
aspects of her music, for the pressures placed upon Smith to sing overly 
suggestive lyrics, and for the problems Waters faced as an African American 
actress in the '30s, would have added needed substance and energy to the first 
act. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reaves makes up for the opening section's uncertainties by returning after 
the intermission with a chilling vision of Holiday singing "In My Solitude" 
that literally draws a collective gasp from the audience. Her Dinah Washington 
is almost equally effective, capturing the powerful rhythmic essence of the 
popular blues vocalist's musical style, as well as her sometimes abrasive 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after the dark poignancy of Holiday and the upfront brassiness of 
Washington, Reaves suddenly shifts into a brilliantly convincing presentation 
of Jackson. In look, manner and, above all, in vocal sound and sheer physical 
presence, her rendition of the gospel queen rocking through "He's Got the Whole 
World in His Hands" and "When the Saints Go Marching In" is no less than 
astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its occasionally uneven moments as a production, this is a one-woman 
performance to be savored and remembered. Reaves has had some earlier 
visibility via appearances in the Broadway musical "Raisin," the films "Round 
Midnight" and "Lean On Me" and a recurring role (as Esther) in the TV soap 
"Another World," but she comes into her own, magnificently, in "The Late Great 
Ladies." 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately minimal direction is provided by Rick Khan; a colorful array of 
costumes were designed by Michael Hannah and Trashy, and Lanny Hartley is the 
music director. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Late Great Ladies of Blues and Jazz," Richard Pryor Theatre, 1445 N. 
Las Palmas Ave., (213) 466-2222. Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays

TV REVIEW; 'SEAPOWER' EXPLORES OCEANS' IMPACT

<P>
 "Seapower: A Global Journey" is no afternoon at the beach. It's public 
television's richly diverse six-part voyage across the world's oceans. 
</P>
<P>
 Narrated by Leonard Nimoy, this is a captivating, globally visionary 
exploration of human dependence on the seas -- at present, historically and 
into the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekly one-hour episodes, beginning tonight, are each tautly framed around 
subjects such as seaborne commerce, U.S./Russian/British naval forces, mapping 
the ocean floor, the gnarly question of ocean possession and, in the amusing 
"Passage to Paradise" (July 26), dream-seekers on luxury cruisers pursue their 
fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Employing six directors, executive producer Leo Eaton (who wrote many of the 
episodes) is especially good at juxtaposing archival and historical clips with 
crisp, contemporary material that can absorb your eye with stunning images. 
</P>
<P>
 Structurally, the programs artfully slip among past, present and future with a 
scope that advances the basic thrust of the series: that the ocean is our new 
frontier and the fate of our planet depends on entering the 21st Century 
selflessly mapping and monitoring the ocean for its food, raw resources and 
energy.  
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's opener, "Lifeblood," explores how the search for oil defines the 
rise and fall of empires as the access to grain, gold and copper once served 
the same purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruling the Waves" (July 12) is a daunting post-Cold War illustration of the 
plight of Russia's huge submarine fleet (currently twice as large as ours) and 
the depressed state of its seamen and its navy. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Americans grumbling about plant closures and foreign competition, 
"Trade Winds, Trade Wars" (July 19) is an eye-opener. Suddenly economics no 
longer looks fuzzy. Focused on an Asian cargo ship's journey around the world, 
the material dramatizes not merely the peril to the U.S. of low wages and 
off-shore labor but, crucially, how modern shipboard container transportation 
has literally shuttered American plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The ocean has had its economic and political advocates before. But seldom has 
the camera lens carried us so spectacularly from the China Sea to the Arctic 
Ocean and told us what it all means to our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Seapower: A Global Journey" airs each Tuesday, beginning tonight, on 
Channel 28, 9 p.m., through Aug. 9.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; YOUSSOU N'DOUR PULLS IT ALL TOGETHER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Youssou N'Dour's two-hour performance at House of Blues on Sunday was a total 
package that simply lacked flaws on any level -- visually, musically or 
theatrically. The Senegalese vocalist's powerful, high-pitched singing was 
comparable to that of Salif Keita, and the 10-piece Super Etoile de Dakar band 
was a well-oiled machine with a loose, jammin' feel. 
</P>
<P>
 N'Dour's mbalax style had enough repetition for the melodic hooks to take hold 
over a pervasive rhythm undertow. The arrangements flowed unpredictably -- from 
sweet alto sax to spidery, bluesy lead guitar line, keyboards to hand 
percussion, talking drum to dance turns that were every bit as much "solos" as 
any instrumental passage.  
</P>
<P>
 Stevie Wonder traded wailing Islamic vocal lines with N'Dour on a traditional 
Senegalese piece, with the band members seated on the stage in white robes. But 
N'Dour had already transfixed the full house with canny audience participation 
routines that had everyone eagerly joining in. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, that audience connection would give the lie to record industry 
notions that American audiences can't relate to African or any other 
non-English language music. Super Etoile de Dakar translates as "Superstar of 
Dakar" (Senegal's capital), and on the strength of his performance Sunday, 
using that much-abused term isn't wishful thinking on N'Dour's part -- it's 
fact. DON SNOWDEN

'GENGHIS KHAN' A TRIUMPH FOR MUSEUM; ART: THE EXHIBITION IS A 'BOON' TO THE

 A landmark exhibition of ancient art and artifacts from a remote area of 
modern China is a smash hit at Los Angeles County's Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
 "Genghis Khan: Treasures From Inner Mongolia," which was organized by the 
museum under a special arrangement with the Chinese government and the Inner 
Mongolian Autonomous Region, is "the biggest boon to the museum in the last 10 
years," said Catherine Krell, deputy director of marketing and public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition traces 3,500 years of Mongolian history and culture by 
presenting more than 200 objects, many of them from recent archeological digs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Originally scheduled to close on May 22, "Genghis Khan" proved to be so 
popular that is has been extended through Aug. 14. More than 75,000 people have 
attended the show since it opened on March 6, easily surpassing all other 
events at the museum in recent years, Krell said. The Exposition Park facility, 
which rarely has the means to stage major exhibitions, attracted a total of 
750,000 visitors during the past fiscal year.  
</P>
<P>
 "This museum was dying," Krell said. As a result of an ongoing budget crunch, 
the museum's county budget dropped from $11.4 million in fiscal 1991-92 to 
$9.28 million in fiscal 1993-94, she said, and if the proposed county budget is 
adopted for the new fiscal year, the museum's public funds will plummet to $6.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "But 'Genghis Khan' has brought the museum back to life," Krell said. It has 
stimulated membership, attracted tourists, brought telephone inquiries from all 
across the country and rewarded the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam T. Kessler, who organized the show during several trips to Inner 
Mongolia, said he is delighted that his efforts have been so well received. 
"The exhibition opens up a vast and mysterious part of the world," he said. 
"The remarkable finds retrieved from this area are a cause of excitement for 
Westerners much in the way ancient Egypt was at the turn of our century." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Exit interviews with visitors indicate a high level of satisfaction with the 
show, according to Krell. "People are fascinated with the history and the 
dynasties; they call it a thinking exhibit," she said. "But the most common 
remark is that it's hard to imagine that the objects could be so old." 
</P>
<P>

DANCE REVIEW; FLORICANTO LABORS TO EXPRESS ACTIVISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gema Sandoval is a reformer -- and they can be hard to live with. 
</P>
<P>
 As founder and artistic director of Danza Floricanto/U.S.A., Sandoval has 
worked for nearly 20 years to bring a greater sense of social context and 
contemporary relevance to folklorico performance in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In her company's program at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre on Sunday, the 
dancers performed straight at the audience only during her 10-year-old suite 
from Sinaloa. In recent repertory, they danced for one another, sustaining both 
eye contact and the concept of a society in which dancing fulfilled a deeper 
function than merely pleasing the outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Both "Jarabes de Antano" and a depiction of California ranch life of the early 
19th Century presented a reminder of Latino warmth and sophistication in varied 
arrangements of social dances accompanied by mandolin, voice, guitars, 
percussion -- and, alas, an uninvited helicopter overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 A new Northern Mexico suite added bold, cowboy-style sashaying and other Anglo 
influences. And, as if the result wasn't vibrant enough, Sandoval updated her 
selection of border dances with a finale of Chicano "La Quebradita" modernism 
-- then invited members of the audience to join in. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission came the downside of Sandoval's artistic activism. As 
usual, her spoken introductions offered thoughtful and sometimes trenchant 
perspectives, but the dutiful dancing in "Los Concheros" couldn't begin to 
match her eloquence. What she wanted us to see in the performance simply wasn't 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 The gap between speech and dance widened into a chasm in "Jornada Mestiza," an 
unwieldy mythic pageant adapted/excerpted from Sandoval's "Epopeya Mestiza" of 
1991. Here actor Albert Ybarra intoned high-minded phrases about Latino 
endurance and Sandoval conjured up supporting imagery both sacred and profane 
-- everything from the Virgin of Guadalupe to La Catrina, the sardonic symbol 
of death. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their impact on Mexican Americans, these images aren't automatically 
clear or meaningful to others -- even other Latinos. And their juxtaposition on 
Sunday often proved downright confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, neither the conventional folk dance passages nor the contemporary 
choreography by Francisco Martinez could hold the expressive weight that 
Sandoval seemed to intend. In trying to rid folklorico of its decorative 
conservatism, she not only overwhelmed her source material and her company but 
created a theatrical event in which dance itself somehow became just a 
sideshow. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine guest musicians for the program included the Violeta Quintero 
Ensemble, Mariachi Juvenil Sol de Mexico and AmmoniaAzul.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; COMMON SENSE ABOUT POLICE TAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who, if anyone, has been at the listening post in Laguna Beach?  
</P>
<P>
 Seven Police Department employees, alleging violation of their rights, filed a 
$10,000 claim against the city on the ground that their personal conversations 
were taped improperly; the city promptly rejected the claim.In April, the 
district attorney found insufficient evidence of criminal conduct to file 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy, which is still being sorted out, surrounds a taping system 
that police say now has been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, workers learned that their idle conversations, including things 
they might have said about their bosses, had been recorded, apparently even 
after the telephone conversations ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Was this simply a case of faulty equipment or of real snooping? The police 
union says it has evidence of eavesdropping for years. Police officials say the 
problem began with the installation a year ago of a new telephone system that 
had "a glitch." Chief Neil J. Purcell says he has apologized and that the 
matter should be put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 A few simple principles should be affirmed. First, a police department needs 
to have a recording system that works as intended. Second, the rules of 
recording need to be promulgated by top officials and understood by all. 
Finally, there's the matter of common sense for employees: In a busy police 
station, records of conversations between law enforcement personnel and the 
public are a fact of life. The station is not exactly a quiet booth in a coffee 
shop.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; LUCRATIVE LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE BEATLES; 
FILMS: 'A HARD DAY'S NIGHT' WAS A HIT 30 YEARS AGO. NOW PRODUCER SHENSON PLANS 
A DOCUMENTARY ON ITS MAKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 People always complain that the path to success in Hollywood is unknowable, 
but veteran producer Walter Shenson says he has the answer. "Just make sure 
your first film is a hit," he explained with a laugh over breakfast recently at 
the Regent Beverly Wilshire hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Shenson knows of what he speaks. His first several films were successes, which 
is an especially good career move. And this year Shenson is making plans to 
celebrate the biggest of them all. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 30 years ago that Walter Shenson asked a band called the Beatles to 
play themselves in a movie. The result was "A Hard Day's Night," which many 
still consider the best rock 'n' roll film of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 Shenson hopes to rekindle a bit of Beatlemania with "The Making of a Hard 
Day's Night," a television documentary timed to coincide with the film's 30th 
anniversary this fall. The project will include unseen footage and interviews 
with behind-the-scenes participants. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the documentary came to the producer about a year ago. The 
surviving Beatles were already at work on a comprehensive documentary on the 
band, but Shenson says they said OK to his project after witnessing the 
excitement generated earlier this year by the 30th anniversary of their first 
appearance on "The Ed Sullivan Show." 
</P>
<P>
 "They were nervous about a conflict at first," Shenson said. "And I've never 
wanted to do anything in conflict with them. We've always worked together. But 
after (the Sullivan anniversary) they said, 'Go ahead.' So I had their 
blessing." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Shenson still refers to the Beatles as "the boys" when the 
surviving members are well into middle age is a sign of how long they've been 
in business together. Shenson was a producer living in London, best known for 
having made the 1959 Peter Sellers breakthrough movie, "The Mouse That Roared," 
when a call came that changed his fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was approached by United Artists to make a movie with the Beatles, and I 
said, 'You mean those kids with the long hair and guitars?' " said Shenson, who 
was in his early 40s at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Shenson says UA was more interested in the soundtrack that would result from 
the movie than the movie itself, since there was no reason to think audiences 
were interested in a pop band comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 A meeting with the group and their manager, Brian Epstein, soon followed at 
Abbey Road studios. After the deal was made, Shenson casually instructed the 
band to come back to him with six new songs. The Beatles started filming the 
movie soon after their Ed Sullivan appearance, and the $500,000, Richard 
Lester-directed film premiered in August, 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 So popular was the movie, which was shot in black-and-white documentary style, 
that Shenson claims UA got its money back in one day. But it was Shenson who 
had the last laugh. Under the contract with UA, the rights to both "A Hard 
Day's Night" and its follow-up, "Help!," reverted to him and the Beatles after 
15 years -- just in time to exploit the video and cable TV revolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotta tell you, the money does come in," Shenson said of the profits 
from the two movies, which he and the group split equally. "You ought to see 
the size of the checks I send them." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Making of a Hard Day's Night" may prove another bonanza for Shenson, 
since he plans to syndicate it worldwide. The documentary is narrated by Phil 
Collins, who was a 12-year-old extra in the original movie. Shenson's biggest 
gem is concert footage of "You Can't Do That," a song that appeared on the 
soundtrack but was cut from the movie because of time considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 The producer remains active in the business, with two projects in development 
and well-received recent movies such as "Reuben, Reuben" and "Echo Park" to his 
credit. But it's clear from all the 1960s memorabilia that clutters his office 
that much of what he was and came to be is still tied to those halcyon days 
with the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really felt like I was in the middle of a Marx Brothers movie," Shenson 
said. 
</P>

 Image make-over: With Europeans examining why their entertainment industry is 
so troubled, Hollywood's United International Pictures is trying to avoid being 
cast as the scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which distributes films overseas for Paramount Pictures, 
Universal Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, has put out a detailed rebuttal to 
charges that it is monopolizing European theaters. The report, titled "UIP: The 
Real Picture," is being widely distributed in Europe and the United States. It 
makes the case that the distributor has actually lost market share since 1989, 
that it encourages competition, and that it poses no threat to European 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The public relations campaign comes as UIP fights an uphill battle to renew 
its special operating agreements with European governments. In an open letter 
that accompanies the report, UIP President Michael Williams-Jones says much of 
the criticism of the company is "ill-informed."

EXECUTIVE SUITE: COMPANY TOWN; KAREN KEHELA NAMED PRODUCTION PRESIDENT AT 
IMAGINE 
</P>

<P>
 Karen Kehela, 29, will succeed David Friendly as president of production at 
Imagine Entertainment, the powerful independent movie company headed by 
director Ron Howard and producer Brian Grazer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kehela joins the small group of high-level Hollywood female movie executives 
that includes Columbia Pictures President Lisa Henson and TriStar Pictures 
production President Stacy Snider.Kehela began her career as an intern for 
Grazer eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Kehela was promoted after Imagine was unable to come to terms on a new 
contract with Friendly, who has been with the company seven years. Sources said 
Friendly was asking for more money than Imagine wanted to pay and that he also 
was hoping for a partnership. His contract runs until December. It is uncertain 
how much longer he will remain aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Friendly, a former entertainment reporter for the Los Angeles Times, told The 
Times that the split with Imagine is "not at all acrimonious" and that "Ron and 
Brian have been like family to me." He said he has no other job lined up as of 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Kehela began at Brian Grazer Productions in 1986 after graduating from UCLA. 
After Imagine was formed, she rose through the ranks to senior vice president 
of production, moving to New York to run Imagine's New York office in 
September, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 When that office was shuttered in late 1992, just before Howard and Grazer 
took the company private in March, 1993, she moved to Imagine headquarters in 
Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 Kehela said that for the entire time she has worked with Grazer and Howard, 
"they continued to provide opportunities for me at every turn, and, naturally, 
I'm especially excited about this one." CLAUDIA ELLER

 Paramount/Viacom: The proposed $3-billion merger of CBS Inc. and home shopping 
channel QVC Inc. may be getting all the headlines now, but there still are a 
few loose ends to tie up in another huge deal. Shareholders for Viacom Inc. and 
Paramount Communications are scheduled to meet separately this week to 
officially put the stamp of approval on that $10-billion deal.Paramount 
stockholders are to meet Wednesday in the Hotel du Pont in Wilmington, Del., 
with Viacom's stockholders gathering the following day at the Equitable 
Building in New York. Viacom won the battle for Paramount over QVC in March, 
and now owns 50.1% of the company. Approval on both sides is a formality. But 
the third part of the deal -- a combination with video giant Blockbuster 
Entertainment -- remains all but dead. Blockbuster officials have yet to 
declare the deal dead, but they have said that it won't happen unless the value 
of the stock transaction climbs significantly by Sept. 30. Analysts don't 
believe that will happen. JAMES BATES

O.C. ART REVIEW; LOOKING AT LIFE, CULTURE AND DEATH FROM RITE ANGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the key features of contemporary art is that it is meant to be 
"completed" by the thoughts of an intuitive and knowledgeable viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, many museum visitors don't feel adequate to the task. But when 
an exhibition deals with the traditions surrounding birth, coming of age, 
marriage and death, suddenly everyone's an involved "expert." 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, on a purely visual level, "Rites of Passage in America: Traditions of 
the Life Cycle" -- at the Fullerton Museum Center through Aug. 14 -- is pretty 
much your standard-issue didactic presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by the Balch Institute for Ethnographic Studies in Philadelphia, the 
show consists of four walk-in booths stocked with photographs, costumes, 
accouterments (ranging from a prayer shawl worn by a boy at his bar mitzvah to 
a pocket-watch chain made from the braided hair of a deceased person) and a few 
videos of actual ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than operating on the lazy assumption that the beliefs and behavior 
of every member of an ethnic or religious group are identical, the show focuses 
on specific individuals who follow or adapt traditions to suit their own needs. 
(The catalogue enlarges on this approach, with numerous "case histories" that 
demonstrate, among other things, how traditionally "male" ceremonies have been 
modified to include females.) 
</P>
<P>
 What makes "Rites of Passage" truly compelling, however, is the fact that we 
all have directly relevant personal experiences to compare and contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 My moment came when I saw a photograph of a troubled-looking young Hmong man 
standing beside the hospital bed of an elderly woman whose face is cruelly 
disfigured by tubes and bandages. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the text, the Hmong believe that "any intrusion into the body at 
the time of death provides a conduit for evil" -- a viewpoint painfully at odds 
with modern hospital procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw in place of that elderly woman the face of my own mother, who quietly 
battled various forms of cancer for 20 years. Surrounded by diverse images of 
death and mourning, I relived the anguish of watching her die and the 
incredibly sad, frank and funny moments of the ceremony my family devised to 
honor her memory. (Related story, above.) 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the most affecting images in "Rites of Passage" are the ones 
that seem to be transformative or at least deeply meaningful to the people 
portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a video showing moments from an Apache girl's "sunrise ceremonial" -- a 
public rite marking the onset of menstruation -- the girl has a rapt expression 
on her face as she leads her godparents to a ceremonial tepee where she is 
visited by "mountain spirits" in tall headdresses, blessed by the community, 
has her face painted with sacred clay and runs around a bonfire symbolizing the 
gods' release of all troubles to the four winds, before returning to the camp 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Compare this to the ritual of being herded into a junior high school A-V room 
with only the female members of your class in order to watch a cloying movie 
called something like, "Your Special Day," in which a wide-eyed teen-ager has 
an unbelievably perky conversation with her TV-housewife clone mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Other memorable public ceremonies excerpted in the show include a videotaped 
mehendi party (wedding shower). A Pakistani bride-to-be living in New York sits 
among a large group of clapping female friends while her hands and feet are 
painted by an expert with squirts of henna creating delicate lacy designs. 
(Traditionally, the rest of the bride's body would be veiled in fabric.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the strict purpose of the ceremony has lost its relevance, the 
embracing communal feeling it evoked seems well worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the warmest moments in the show is the shot of a young blond man in 
Cambodian dress smiling up at his mother -- a dead ringer for Doris Day -- as 
she ties ritual strings on the wrists of his Cambodian bride. 
</P>
<P>
 (The couple, who also had a Baptist wedding, put their own spin on tradition 
by minimizing the role that alcohol usually plays in the Cambodian ceremony and 
substituting candy for the usual cigarette favors.) 
</P>
<P>
 A 1929 silent home movie of a wedding unwittingly recalls the era before the 
video revolution turned happy events into intrusively over-documented ordeals. 
</P>
<P>
 We see the bridal veil being adjusted in a garden, shiny black cars disgorging 
formally dressed guests, people entering the church, and then -- cut! -- we're 
at the outdoor wedding feast where the athletic bride jokingly wields her cake 
knife like a ceremonial sword. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, we never would know about the Apache coming-of-age ceremony had it 
not been faithfully documented on video. (The problem of intrusiveness -- 
whether the transgressor is a single outside observer or a crew of camera 
operators -- has always dogged ethnographic studies.) But in this instance the 
camera keeps a respectful distance that seems to give everyone as much 
breathing room as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's worth reflecting -- as folklorist Steven Zeitlin points out in a 
catalogue essay -- that preserving snapshots in family photo albums has 
enhanced life-cycle traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer fleeting memories, they are captured in permanent form. Come to 
think of it, even the action of taking a photograph in the first place promotes 
momentary "events" into milestones that tend to assume increased significance 
as time goes by. 
</P>
<P>
 But the focus and manner of homemade documentation remain fluid. While 
mainstream 19th-Century parents routinely commissioned photographs of their 
dead children laid out for burial, death rarely enters the realm of the 
contemporary photo album. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the photographs of New York street murals made by Puerto Ricans to 
commemorate slain friends and family, and the phenomenon of the Names Project 
quilt in memory of those who died of AIDS reveals a sad new preoccupation with 
senseless death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rites of Passage" is a modest show that doesn't pretend to be the last work 
on a complex and endlessly intriguing subject. But as the touchstone for 
discussions with family and friends about the nature and purpose of ritual in 
daily life, this exhibition is more than adequate. 
</P>
<P>

noon to 4 p.m. Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday; noon to 8 p.m. Thursday.

JAZZ REVIEW; PONCHO SANCHEZ: HE GIVES IT THE WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIME 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Move over, James Brown. It's time to award Poncho Sanchez the crown as "the 
hardest-working man in show business." 
</P>
<P>
 Few keep more active on the local scene. Sanchez's eight-piece band can be 
found playing at least a couple Southern California clubs nearly every weekend 
and many of the nights in between. 
</P>
<P>
 When not seen locally, he's on the road. Last week, after a concert at the 
University of Oklahoma in Norman, Sanchez flew back just in time to make an 
appearance in a Studio City restaurant. The band has also made triumphant 
appearances in Japan and Mexico City in the past few months. Vacation? Never. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Sunday was no day of rest, despite the three-day weekend, for the 
conguero and his ensemble. Spread across the spacious bandstand at Randell's, 
Sanchez and company worked up a sweat chattering away on salsas, cha-chas and 
other Latin rhythms, all in top-notch style. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching Sanchez work, one can't help but admire the man's drive as he pounds 
his way through percussive-rich jazz standards or takes a turn at the 
microphone to sing dance songs in Spanish. Likewise, the other seven members of 
his band have the same, strong work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 The first set, in the tradition of Cal Tjader and Willie Bobo, was one of jazz 
tunes twisted just so to fit Latin rhythms. The arrangements were magical 
re-creations of familiar pieces, such as Count Basie's "Shiny Stockings," which 
became a vehicle for Ramon Banda's rippling timbale work, and the ballad "My 
Foolish Heart," which jumped along on Jose (Papo) Rodriguez's muscular bongo 
play. The rhythmic emphasis made each of these well-known numbers kick off 
their shoes and dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez himself turned Gerry Mulligan's bop-styled "Five Brothers" into a 
percussive party, taking the lead with short, call-and-response lines on his 
congas before rifling through a long double-time line that ended with two 
powerful slaps. The conguero also added snap to saxophonist Eddie Harris' "Cold 
Duck Time," turning the R&B-based number into a Latin-rhythm extravaganza 
without losing any of the tune's funky flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's most exciting moment came when Sanchez, Rodriguez and Banda 
picked up large, bead-draped gourds and began to shake and chug along to the 
beat of Mongo Santamaria's "Afro-Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Long a workhorse in the Sanchez repertoire, the tune took on new depth as the 
three exchanged shimmering sounds and blunt reverberation from the bottom of 
the gourds. As they built up steam like a train pulling from the station, 
bassist Tony Banda added the familiar riff that prompted the horns to jump back 
into the theme. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's principal soloists are the three-man horn section. Saxophonist 
Scott Martin led the way on "Cinderella," using his tenor to impart an 
after-midnight panic to the cha-cha based workout. On pianist David Torres' 
"Two, One, Three," he cruised through an alto solo that closed on a single 
high-pitched exclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 Trombonist Alex Henderson navigated the difficult changes of "Five Brothers" 
with grace and a surfeit of breath. Trumpeter Jeff Bunnell, a substitute for 
usual horn man Stan Martin, whose wife had just had a baby, was kept busy with 
solos on almost every tune and a fluegelhorn feature on "My Foolish Heart." 
Bunnell's strongest work came on Clifford Brown's "Daahoud," in which he played 
with some of the late trumpeter's fire and creative spark. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez moved away from his congas to sing "Prestame Tu Corazon," before 
pacing the piece with a cowbell while pianist Torres shifted chords back and 
forth to the salsa beat. Though Sanchez's vocals aren't perfectly rendered 
affairs, they're sung with enough enthusiasm and rhythmic flair to pass within 
the band's fine instrumental framework.

OFF THE TICKER: SOUP'S SALES NO JOKE TO OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spurred by the claims of a self-appointed health "expert," a humble vegetable 
soup has become the talk of Japan. Even the prime minister swears by it, and 
sales are booming. 
</P>
<P>
 Its advocates say the soup -- a stock made from radishes, carrots, dried 
mushrooms and burdock root -- can prevent cancer, cure diabetes, lower blood 
pressure and vanquish hangovers. Its detractors, health experts among them, say 
the concoction could not possibly live up to those claims and that Kazu 
Tateishi, the former taxi driver who is its chief promoter, is a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Tateishi's book, "How to Become Healthy With Vegetable Stock," has been on 
bestseller lists since April. His publisher, Tokuma Shoten, admits that 
Tateishi is not a doctor, as the author had previously claimed. Tateishi was a 
hit on the lecture circuit, and he charged $150 to $180 to examine and advise 
"patients." Tateishi was arrested last month on suspicion of practicing 
medicine illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the stressed and the health conscious are buying cans and boxes of the 
soup by the case, and suppliers say they are hard-pressed to keep up with 
demand.

UAW DISPUTE WITH CATERPILLAR JUST CRAWLS ALONG; LABOR: STRIKE AT MAKER OF 
EARTHMOVING EQUIPMENT EXEMPLIFIES SIMMERING BATTLES BETWEEN OLD-LINE UNIONS AND 
INDUSTRIAL BEHEMOTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the picket line outside Caterpillar's sprawling tractor plant, John McCoy 
uses his head to display his disdain for his employer of 29 years: He wears a 
John Deere cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Just up the street, a union billboard painted in Caterpillar's bold yellow 
colors announces: "You are entering a war zone. Caterpillar vs. its UAW 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the symbols of the nation's longest ongoing labor confrontation. 
Caterpillar and its 14,000 United Auto Workers union members have been at a 
bitter impasse for nearly three years. And there is no end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor strife escalated last month when the UAW announced a nationwide 
strike affecting 12 plants in Illinois, Pennsylvania and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the walkout appears timed to focus attention on Caterpillar just as 
the U.S. Senate is considering legislation -- already approved by the House -- 
that would bar companies from hiring permanent replacements for striking 
workers. The UAW ended a 163-day strike in 1992, when Caterpillar threatened to 
do just that.  
</P>
<P>
 But the strife at Cat -- the world's largest producer of earthmoving and 
construction equipment -- has deeper roots. 
</P>
<P>
 It exemplifies the long-simmering battles between powerful old-line unions 
that want to keep hard-earned wages, benefits and protective work rules and 
industrial behemoths seeking the cost controls and flexibility to be globally 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last decade or more -- with the UAW's complicity -- Caterpillar has 
modernized its factories, reorganized operations to improve efficiency, boosted 
exports and earned record profits. But those gains could be fleeting unless the 
company achieves a lasting labor peace. 
</P>
<P>
 While the dispute is centered in Peoria -- the world headquarters of 
Caterpillar and a working-class city that has long symbolized Main Street, 
U.S.A. -- the outcome will have a much broader impact, particularly for 
organized labor, whose clout has declined dramatically in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The standoff is unusual -- not only for its length and complexity, but also 
because it seems a throwback to another era, when contract disputes led to long 
strikes with macho displays of raw, muscular power. Labor experts say the trend 
today is toward labor-management cooperation, not confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Caterpillar workers, even those on the picket line, do not come across 
as firebrands. Many have grown weary of the dispute and complain of being pawns 
in a power struggle between union leaders and company management. 
</P>
<P>
 Caterpillar has a long history of poor labor relations. In 1982, the UAW 
struck for more than 200 days. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the industrial Midwest was decimated by recession and foreign 
competition in the 1980s, labor and management at Caterpillar made a major 
effort at teamwork. One example: an employee involvement program in which 
management solicited the ideas of shop-floor workers to improve factory 
operations and efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Such cooperation, however, halted in 1991 when contract talks broke down. The 
reason: Caterpillar refused to accept a "pattern" contract that the UAW had 
negotiated with competitor John Deere & Co. and expected to impose on Cat. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1991, the UAW struck Caterpillar plants in East Peoria and 
Decatur, Ill. The strike eventually spread to other plants, with salaried 
workers stepping in to run production lines. By the following February, the 
company had declared an impasse and implemented its last contract offer. 
Caterpillar told all workers to return, saying it would replace those who did 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 As thousands of applications poured in for replacement jobs, about 1,000 UAW 
members crossed the picket lines. The union ended the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides still have not returned to the bargaining table. Up until the 
recent walkout, an unstable peace existed in the plants. The union had urged 
employees to "work to rules," doing no more than required to keep one's job. 
Managers were vigilant of any attempts to disrupt operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the labor strife, Caterpillar has flourished under the leadership of 
Chairman Donald Fites. 
</P>
<P>
 The company spent nearly $2 billion in upgrading its plants in the last seven 
years. It expanded overseas, with half its sales coming from abroad. It 
reorganized into 13 product centers that have improved its ability to respond 
to market changes quickly. Last year alone it introduced 46 new products. 
Manufacturing time was cut four-fold in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Profits soared in 1993 to $652 million, after two years of losses. Cat's 
revenues were $11.6 billion, up from $10.2 billion in 1992. In the first 
quarter of 1994, Caterpillar earned a record $192 million, its sixth 
consecutive quarter of higher profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is clearly concerned about the lingering labor conflict. Both the 
company and union agree that the strife has not hurt quality, but productivity 
has suffered.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken the steps necessary to compete globally," said spokesman Terry 
Thorstenson. "We are quick. We are agile. The only unresolved issue is a signed 
labor agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 But the prospects for that are not good. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, confrontations between workers and managers have escalated 
in the plants. Jerry Brust, director of labor relations, charges the union is 
deliberately disrupting operations and provoking managers. 
</P>
<P>
 The UAW counters that the company has created a hostile work environment. 
Since late 1992, the union has filed 92 unfair labor practice charges against 
Caterpillar. The charges range from banning of union and strike-related 
insignias worn by workers to dismissing employees for union activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The union also insists that the most recent strike is over continued unfair 
labor practices. In a strike on unfair labor practices, workers cannot be 
permanently replaced; in a walkout over economic issues, they can. 
</P>
<P>
 "What prompted this strike is the growing pressure from our members because of 
the company's continued violations of labor laws," said Jerry Baker, chairman 
of the UAW's central bargaining committee for Caterpillar. 
</P>
<P>
 The company maintains the union is using the unfair labor practices charges to 
force it to sign a contract. "We believe the current strike is an economic 
one," said Brust. 
</P>
<P>
 The permanent replacement issue is a hot button to organized labor. Unions 
have been pressing Congress to ban the use of permanent replacements, because 
it has tipped the balance of power against unions in collective bargaining. 
Ever since President Ronald Reagan fired the federal air traffic controllers 
for an illegal strike in 1981, more and more companies have opted to replace 
workers striking over economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 President Bill Clinton has supported the ban. But the outlook for the 
legislation is bleak this year in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Caterpillar continues to hold the threat of permanent replacement over 
striking workers. The day after the walkout, the company placed ads in the 
local newspaper seeking workers making $17 to $19 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 applicants brought their resumes to an employment center in 
suburban Peoria, according to Cat. Brust said the new hires are not permanent, 
but he won't pledge that they will not become permanent replacements.

GATT BRINGS THREAT OF NEW CONTROVERSY OVER TRADE; FOREIGN RELATIONS: OPPONENTS 
CITE LOSS OF BILLIONS IN TARIFF COLLECTIONS AND PRESSURE ON U.S. LABOR, 
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The graffiti, freshly scribbled on the concrete wall of the new business 
school building at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, says bluntly: "Stop 
GATT." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, a rap recording is being circulated among trade specialists, 
its lyrics hammering away at the agreement that rewrites the rules of 
international commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on here? 
</P>
<P>
 Last autumn, the North American Free Trade Agreement polarized American 
political opinion. But NAFTA, in terms of economic impact, involves small 
change compared to GATT. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the new world trade agreement, which negotiators began working on nearly 
eight years ago, about to roil the nation the way NAFTA did last year, 
reopening deep and painful divisions and giving President Clinton yet another 
political headache? 
</P>
<P>
 The new pact, about to land on the floors of the U.S. House and Senate, is the 
broadest, most comprehensive trade agreement ever reached. It would create a 
new entity called the World Trade Organization to replace the old GATT 
structure. It would slash tariffs around the world and, its proponents say, 
give the U.S. economy a shot in the arm worth at least $200 billion by some 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents see a darker side to GATT. It would cut the collection of tariffs by 
as much as $10 billion, according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget 
Office. And, opponents say, it would leave the United States at the mercy of an 
international trade bureaucracy that could override U.S. labor and 
environmental laws in the name of more open world trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lie the two biggest obstacles facing the Clinton Administration as it 
prepares for the legislative battle to ratify GATT. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is much broader in scope and impact than NAFTA, the new trade plan 
has attracted little of the angry opposition that almost scuttled the three-way 
agreement among the United States, Mexico and Canada; there is less 
hand-wringing in Congress over how to vote, less pressure from special interest 
groups that weighed in so heavily last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the unresolved questions surrounding the lost tariff revenue and the 
alleged threat to U.S. sovereignty raise the possibility of serious political 
consequences and increase the likelihood of another emotional debate. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, therefore, anxiety is growing that what appeared to be a 
relatively smooth path to approval for the new international trade plan will 
instead be strewn with boulders. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Administration officials and congressional trade experts -- citing 
the wide impact of the global agreement -- are more optimistic about its 
prospects than they were a year ago about NAFTA, assuming that they can 
overcome the funding and sovereignty issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tough one, but it looks fine as long as we can work through the 
process. It needs to be well greased," said a congressional staff member 
specializing in trade matters. "People feel more of a responsibility to vote 
for this than for NAFTA, because the ripple effect isn't just North America, it 
is the rest of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The trade plan was completed last December in Geneva by negotiators from 117 
countries, and initialed by their representatives in Marrakech, Morocco, two 
months ago. Before it can take effect in the United States -- scheduled for 
July 1, 1995 -- it must be approved by simple majorities of the House and 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 It rewrites the rules of global trade, established by the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, in 1947, and modified in multiple rounds of 
negotiations since then. This latest series of negotiations, known as the 
Uruguay Round, would bring into the regime agriculture, the fruits of 
intellectual endeavors such as the creation of pharmaceuticals and, to a 
degree, financial services. 
</P>
<P>
 By cutting tariffs -- the taxes paid on imports -- by as much as 100% in some 
cases and by an average of 40% overall, the agreement sharply reduces some of 
the most onerous regulations intended to protect domestic industries in 
countries large and small. It is hoped the pact will increase commerce and 
domestic economies throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the most optimistic scenario, the House Ways and Means Committee, the 
Senate Finance Committee and other panels considering the legislation that 
would implement the pact will finish their work early enough in July to allow 
both chambers to vote on it before they begin their extended summer recess. 
Under a more likely timetable, however, the crucial votes would not occur until 
shortly before the House and Senate adjourn in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials and congressional sources have come up with a 
proposed collection of tax increases and spending cuts to replace the lost 
tariff revenue, and each has prompted a flood of complaints to House and Senate 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Under deficit reduction rules, known as "pay as you go," any tax cuts or 
spending increases must be met with equivalent tax increases or spending cuts. 
Those rules do not count the anticipated tariff income stemming from increased 
commerce against the loss caused by reduced tariff rates. By some accounts, the 
government could end up collecting $3.90 for every $1 lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the measures being considered are raising $4.8 billion in taxes on radio 
and TV stations for their use of the public airwaves; collecting $1.5 billion 
in fees charged to chemical companies for hazardous waste cleanup; $1.3 billion 
in higher taxes on retailers; $600 million in new gambling taxes, and $500 
million in taxes paid on the value of free parking companies provide to their 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, consideration has been given to cutting farm subsidies by $3.1 
billion and taxing the profits on retirement annuities before they are paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option would be to ignore the budget rule, opting for a provision that 
allows for an "emergency waiver" -- a course one senior Administration official 
said is more likely to be used later in the course of the trade agreement once 
the economic benefits of the pact have become readily apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 Whichever course the Administration pursues, a political outcry is likely to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee 
subcommittee on trade, has pressed for the waiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finding budget cuts or tax increases to 'pay' for the GATT makes no economic 
sense," he said in a recent speech. "Under some (economic) assumptions, the 
(Uruguay) Round may do more to create economic growth and shrink the budget 
deficit than another measure this Congress is likely to consider." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of this course, however, say it will send an unfortunate signal to 
Wall Street, suggesting to investors that the Administration is weakening in 
its resolve to live by the deficit-reducing rules the George Bush 
Administration worked out with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The sovereignty issue has the potential to become the most emotional aspect of 
the debate, akin to the fiery arguments about the impact the North American 
agreement would have on jobs in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 As happened with NAFTA, it has brought strange pairings to the debate. It puts 
consumer advocate Ralph Nader andconservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan 
on the same team, seeking to defeat the pact. At the same time, the Consumers 
Union; the Heritage Foundation, a conservative public policy research 
organization, and Robert H. Bork have spoken out in praise of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics such as Nader have maintained that the World Trade Organization, which 
would replace the GATT, could cite California food safety laws as an unfair 
restraint on agricultural exports to the state, or U.S. auto mileage standards 
as an unfair obstacle to European auto sales in this country. The Clinton 
Administration has aggressively denied such charges -- and has enlisted Bork, a 
former appeals court judge whose conservative credentials are unquestioned, to 
help make its case. 
</P>
<P>
 The sovereignty issue, Bork said in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor, is "a scarecrow." 
</P>
<P>
 "Under our constitutional system, no treaty or international agreement can 
bind the United States if it does not wish to be bound," Bork said. "Congress 
may at any time override such an agreement or any provision of it by statute." 
</P>
<P>
 As for criticism that the agreement will weaken the U.S. position in world 
trade, allow others to dictate trade rules, and put the United States at a 
disadvantaged position in the international forum resolving trade disputes, 
Kantor defended the results of the seven-year negotiation that produced the 
agreement, telling the House Ways and Means Committee last month:

COMPANY TOWN; HOLLYWOOD PLUGS IN; NEW TECHNOLOGY LETS STUDIOS, STARS 
COMMUNICATE GLOBALLY

 During the frantic final weeks of post-production on "I Love Trouble," 
director Charles Shyer and actor Nick Nolte got together on sound stages nearly 
6,000 miles apart for the latest in Hollywood technology -- the 
transcontinental sound-dubbing session. 
</P>
<P>
 A scene from the movie simultaneously flickered on screens at Walt Disney 
Studios in Burbank, where Shyer was directing, and a sound stage in Paris, 
where Nolte was based. As the action began, Nolte and his co-star, Julia 
Roberts, were working late into the night at a diner. Nolte is seen going to 
the counter for coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolte (to Roberts, on film): "Doughnut?" 
</P>
<P>
 Shyer (to Nolte, in Paris): "Make it a tad more confident." 
</P>
<P>
 Nolte: "Confident?" 
</P>
<P>
 Shyer: "Your voice went up a little at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Nolte: "Well, it's really quite charming and clever the way it is, but I'll 
change it." 
</P>
<P>
 Shyer (rolling eyes): "OK, thanks for the warning." Turning to the others in 
the room, he jokes, "That's one of the great things about this technology, I 
don't have to get that eye contact with him. He could be cursing us out over 
there and we wouldn't know." 
</P>
<P>
 The communications system that allowed Nolte to "loop" his lines from Paris is 
emerging as a key element in the technological transformation of Hollywood -- 
changing production routines, giving directors more creative control and 
occasionally even saving money. In the increasingly dispersed entertainment 
industry -- where travel expenses are high and time is often more important 
than money -- it's becoming possible to work from anywhere at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 With Nolte on location for "Thomas Jefferson in Paris" and Roberts in London 
for "Mary Reilly," Shyer originally planned to travel to both places for the 
customary dialogue touch-ups. But in the crunch of a 14-week post-production 
schedule, he ran out of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're cutting pictures here, scoring here, looping all the other actors 
here," Shyer said during a remote looping session in early June. "You do miss 
the one-on-one -- maybe you'd get more nuances -- but this system saved us." 
</P>
<P>
 The "I Love Trouble" communications system was supplied by the Entertainment 
Digital Network, a San Francisco-based start-up known as Ednet with close ties 
to director George Lucas. The company was to be acquired by IDB 
Telecommunications Group this summer, but the deal fell through when IDB's 
accounting firm resigned in May. Several other firms, including AT&T, are said 
to be interested. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology, which has been used on several films in recent months, allows 
high-fidelity audio to be compressed and sent over digital phone lines, while a 
synchronizing system ensures that the studios on either end see and hear the 
same thing, with no delay. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kobayashi and Tom Scott, who first developed the service at Lucas' 
Skywalker Sound for the 1991 film "Backdraft," left the firm in 1993 to found 
Ednet, with the goal of developing applications for evolving telecommunications 
technology specifically for the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 With the support of WilTel, a long-distance provider of fiber-optic phone 
lines, and seed money from friends and family, the company has signed up 
recording studios across the world that have used its system for projects such 
as Frank Sinatra's "Duets" album last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ednet has yet to turn a profit. And bigger fish like Pacific Bell and Sprint 
are beginning to experiment with similar set-ups. But Ednet's revenues 
increased threefold in the fiscal year ending last month to more than $1 
million, and are expected to triple again this year. David Gustafson, its 
marketing director, says Ednet expects to be in the black by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Ednet is concentrating on the audio end of the business. But the 
ultimate Hollywood application -- the instantaneous sending of film dailies 
from production locations to be reviewed by studio executives in Los Angeles -- 
may be possible later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key selling points of the "virtual" production environment made 
possible by the advances in telecommunications is that it allows directors to 
have more creative control than time might otherwise allow. Director Oliver 
Stone supervised the French and Italian sound mixes of his film "Heaven and 
Earth" from Los Angeles earlier this year, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 And director Robert Zemeckis had his home in Montecito linked to Skywalker 
Sound in San Rafael via Ednet's system so he could monitor the preliminary mix 
of "Forrest Gump." 
</P>
<P>
 Zemeckis demanded more suspension squeak in an early scene where a pickup 
truck chases Gump (Tom Hanks) down an alley. Since the sound designer was able 
to make the changes early on, says producer Steve Starkey, it saved time in the 
rush of the final mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of this is changing the face of the industry," Starkey says. "I wouldn't 
want to let it get out of hand because it is very costly to be on-line with the 
system. But I would definitely use it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the technology doesn't come cheap. The "I Love Trouble" production 
paid $800 an hour to be on-line with Roberts and Nolte from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the savings in first-class travel, meals and hotel room expenses for 
various talent is not trivial. Sara Duran, post-production manager for feature 
animation at Walt Disney Studios -- which had Matthew Broderick phone in his 
lines for "The Lion King" from New York over Ednet's network -- calculates a 
net savings when the cost is compared to flying the usual four people to New 
York or London.  
</P>
<P>
 "We used to do this by speaker phone," Duran says. "But you get a delay, and 
you can't really hear what's going on. This has allowed us to really hear."

MR. PRESIDENT, SOME MANAGEMENT TIPS FOR YOU; LEADERSHIP: NOT ALL CONSULTANTS 
AND SCHOLARS AGREE ON THE RAP AGAINST CLINTON, BUT A FEW OFFER ADVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 This is the rap on President Clinton as a manager: He takes too long to make a 
decision. He has no clearly delineated vision for running the country. He's 
mercurial and explosive. He is surrounded by friends and grants access to too 
many people. He takes on too much at a time and leaves his staff guessing about 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if Clinton were the chief executive of a Fortune 500 company, he'd 
probably be fired, business management experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 There's not a President in recent memory who probably could pass muster as CEO 
with today's shareholders and boards of directors. Still, Clinton's management 
style and the White House staff's purported disarray have come under 
considerable fire as critics point to the President's backtracking and 
stumbles, especially in foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Business experts and Washington insiders called Clinton's choice last week of 
Budget Director Leon Panetta as his new chief of staff a good first step in 
reining in a loosely managed White House staff. 
</P>
<P>
 As to Clinton's overall performance, consultants and academics willingly offer 
other advice, but some contend the whole discussion of Clinton's abilities as a 
manager is off target. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job he has -- to run the government -- in no way can be compared to being 
the chief executive of a company, no matter how large. It is a false analogy," 
said Jean Lipman-Blumen, who holds the Thornton F. Bradshaw distinguished chair 
in public policy at the Peter F. Drucker Management Center of the Claremont 
Graduate School in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job of the President of the United States is so far more complex," she 
said. It is as a leader, not as a manager, that the President should be judged, 
she contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is demonstrating leadership by the issues he tackles and the way he 
approaches them, she said. "Leaders deal with big issues, and they may not in 
their own tenure succeed, but they put those issues on the table, underscore 
them, say these are issues we have to address. A manager does more implementing 
and may set lower goals that are more achievable." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But management consultants and scholars say leadership and management are 
intertwined -- that without management skills, leaders cannot attract, keep and 
invigorate followers, set the course and reach their goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Jobs, a founder of Apple Computers and now chairman of Next Inc. in the 
Silicon Valley, "has a reputation as a great leader, but he can't discern that 
(the kind of) life he forces people to live is a marathon and people get blown 
out," said Scott Setrakian, vice president of William M. Mercer's management 
consulting division in San Francisco. In a similar way, he said, Clinton may be 
burning out his staff by expecting them to keep up with his fast-moving and 
wide-ranging intellect. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Setrakian said, IBM's new chairman and chief executive, 
Louis V. Gerstner Jr., "has done remarkable things, probably as big as all 
outdoors. He had to come in and set priorities, set out a vision and do it all 
immediately in the face of some pretty staggering problems. And I think the 
average IBM working stiff will be able to tell you what the goal is . . . what 
is his or her role in it and be fairly if not entirely enthusiastic about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton would do well, experts suggest, to practice a few skills intrinsic to 
every good management -- or leadership -- style: Set priorities, communicate 
them and delegate work. Another suggestion is aimed at Clinton's enormous 
appetite for information and opinions: Know when to say "when." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of Clinton's style, "the common criticism is analysis paralysis, that he tends 
to study things to death, often in conflicting groups of people, without 
arriving at any coherent cross-policies, or decisions," said Richard Ellsworth, 
an associate professor at Claremont's Drucker Center. "He has a seeming lack of 
ability to delegate in an orderly manner, in a way that (staff) people aren't 
running around all doing their own things." 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying issue, Ellsworth said, "is a lack of core values that cut 
across the problems he faces, whether foreign or domestic . . . . Disraeli (the 
British statesman) once said the secret to success is a constancy of purpose. 
What we don't see with Clinton is constancy of purpose, and a clear set of core 
values is what leads to that." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a clearly articulated conservative ideology that gave Ronald Reagan the 
appearance, during his first term at least, of being a skillful manager. Later 
in his presidency, though, Reagan's reputation was tarnished when his staff 
acted so much on their own that Reagan's style came to be seen as delegation to 
the point of disengagement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reagan was the consummate chairman of the board," said Paul C. Nutt, 
professor of management science at the College of Business at Ohio State 
University. "He was interested in only the broadest sweep of policy. He had 
four to five guiding principles, and (chief of staff) Ed Meese and (other 
senior staffers) ran the government." 
</P>
<P>
 However, said Setrakian of Mercer consulting, Reagan's style probably would 
not suit Clinton. "I don't think simplifying the vision thing will work for 
him," Setrakian said. "But what he's got to do is create a really strong sense 
of priorities, communicate them in a very simple way and live with them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers say Clinton's vacillation stems from his ponderous 
decision-making process -- and they contend that process is appropriate for his 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of managing his overall impact on legislation and the country, I 
give him pretty high marks -- much higher than the previous two Presidents -- 
because he's trying to do something and grapple with issues that have gone 
untouched for a lot of years," said Raymond E. Miles, a professor at Haas 
School of Business at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are obviously messy issues, and he's addressing them the only way he 
can, by holding a lot of conversations about them in a lot of forums, 
maintaining an open mind about the final product," Miles said. "Some people 
accuse him of being wishy-washy on those issues, but that's very unfair, 
because those issues are new, enormous, multifaceted and messy. Initiating and 
dealing with fuzzy, messy issues lead to fuzzy, messy areas of the presidency." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Clinton still comes off as inconsistent, said Craig Eric Schneier, a 
private management consultant in Princeton, N.J. "The chief executives I have 
seen be successful have been predictable and consistent, though not 
inflexible," Schneier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bit audacious for me to give the President advice," he said, 
hesitating, "but Clinton could learn from Allied Signal's chief executive, 
Larry Bossidy. . . . He has been able to make the tough calls in his 
organization yet provide the direction, vision and presence required to lead a 
large number of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneier also cited Stanley Gault, who, when he became chief executive of the 
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., "had to come into a tough situation, rally people 
and instill confidence. (He showed how to) present a strategic course, set a 
firm direction and pursue it . . . with consistency and persistence." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no one ideal management style, experts say, because good managers rely 
on their own personality strengths as well as on learned techniques. Baby 
Boomer Clinton may be more in step with current trends suggesting collegial and 
inclusive management strategies that forgo formalized autocratic or top-down 
hierarchies in favor of team consensus building and relying on strengths of 
those who must implement the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's switch to Panetta from Thomas (Mack) McLarty signals a move away 
from a "circular" style of management, in which the executive surrounds himself 
with advisers, said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution 
in Washington. Hess chronicles internal White House organizations from Franklin 
D. Roosevelt through Reagan in his book "Organizing the Presidency;" he also 
served in the Eisenhower and Nixon administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta may use a more classical chopped-off pyramid style, Hess said, in 
which access to the top narrows going up the chain of authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin Roosevelt used a circular management style at a time when the White 
House staff was much smaller, but most subsequent Presidents have preferred the 
pyramid style, Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hess said Clinton's management style "works very well if you have a great deal 
of energy, are very intelligent and work in a small enough universe." The 
change to Panetta, he added, shows that Clinton recognizes "that the U.S. 
government is not Arkansas government writ large . . . (but) that's in his 
head. I wonder, though, in his heart, can he let go? How much delegation can he 
live with?" CEOs of the White House 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the past nine Presidents has brought his own personal management style 
-- along with strengths and weaknesses -- to the task of running the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bill Clinton: Informal organization allows wide access. A quick study whose 
intellectual curiosity prolongs decision-making. Difficulty limiting priorities 
and enunciating vision. 
</P>
<P>
 * George Bush: A methodical decision-maker; ran a relatively formal, 
hierarchical organization. Spurned "the vision thing" and seemed to lack 
overarching goals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ronald Reagan: A delegater. An ideologue with simple goals whose staff 
understood those goals and often acted without prior approval. Called the 
consummate chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jimmy Carter: A micro-manager in a job demanding macro-management. Faltered 
at enlisting popular support for his global vision. Ran a more informal 
organization than predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gerald Ford: Hampered by circumstances of ascendancy, shortness of term and 
lack of opportunity to build his own organization. Blended congressional style 
with formal structure. 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Nixon: Formed a more imperial version of Eisenhower's organization 
that left him isolated. Allowed little dissension. Expanded duties of White 
House staff. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lyndon Johnson: Depended heavily on outside advisory systems: his "wise 
men." Temperamental and bullying. Staff inclined to sycophancy. Diverted from 
other priorities by Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 * John Kennedy: Organization followed legislative style; allowed wide access. 
Managed through crises with informal task- or crisis-specific groups of 
advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dwight Eisenhower: A military-style organization. First to install a chief 
of staff-like assistant (Sherman Adams). Made decisions fast and communicated 
them clearly to staff.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOLLAR BOUNCES BACK IN TOKYO SESSIONS; TRADING: WITH U.S. 
EXCHANGES SHUT DOWN FOR THE HOLIDAY, ACTIVITY OVERSEAS IS SUBDUED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The dollar climbed back above 99 yen early today in Tokyo, recovering from a 
record low on Monday and inspiring a morning rally in Japanese stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading worldwide on Monday was becalmed by the Independence Day holiday in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In between Tokyo trading sessions, the greenback rose slightly against 
European currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 With U.S. financial markets closed for the holiday, international attention 
was turned toward a string of key financial meetings this week -- the U.S. 
Federal Open Market Committee, the German central bank's policy-making council 
and the Group of Seven summit in Naples, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign stocks were generally higher and gold prices rose. In Tokyo, the 
225-issue Nikkei average gained back most of its Friday loss, adding 88.52 
points, or 0.43%, to close at 20,631.93 on Monday. It continued its advance 
this morning, moving above 20,800. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market was up (Monday) because there was no new bad news," said Jonathan 
Davis, broker at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar had closed Monday at 98.67 yen in Tokyo, down from Friday's 98.78 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (G-7) summit is a political carnival and you can't really expect much 
support for the greenback to come from it," said Kaoru Ichikawa, a broker at 
Kokusai Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar has been sliding against the yen over the last few weeks because of 
confusion about U.S. policy to support the greenback, concerns about U.S.-Japan 
trade negotiations and bearish speculators. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar has also fallen because traders expect U.S. interest rates to rise. 
Higher rates erode the value of U.S. bonds and cause foreign investors to look 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the dollar's troubles, many economists believe policy-makers at 
the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates this week to defend the 
greenback, deciding instead to put the domestic economy ahead of global 
currency concerns. The Fed's policy-making group meets behind closed doors 
today and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 This view, however, is not universal. There are some analysts who think the 
Fed will boost rates to shore up the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has already pushed short-term interest rates up three times this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Japan's trade surplus dipped 6.7% in May, as the country used its 
strong currency to import more goods, the Finance Ministry said Monday.

 Canada Sets Shark Limits on Atlantic Coast: The Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans said the aim of the "Atlantic-wide management plan" for porbeagle, short 
fin mako and blue sharks is to bring the "unlicensed fishery under control, 
because shark fishing along the Eastern Seaboard and in the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence has increased dramatically over the past few years. The shark plan 
comes two days after Canada rolled back a $1,080 license fee imposed on U.S.

 Italy's Inflation Cools: Once among the highest in the Western world, the 
country's inflation rate has been cut to a 25-year low of 3.7%, the government 
said.It was good news for Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's conservative 
government as it tries to tame the country's runaway budget deficit. With labor 
costs accounting for 60% of a company's expenses, a 1992 accord between the 
government and unions scrapping the automatic linkage of pay hikes to inflation 
has been vital in the fight against rising prices. Figures for May show wage 
inflation growing just 2.5%.

 'Flash' Computer Chips to Be Developed: Japan's NEC Corp. and SunDisk Corp. of 
the United States have agreed to jointly develop a new generation of "flash" 
computer memory chips.The companies plan to begin marketing 256-megabit flash 
memories in 1997. The largest flash memory chips currently available hold 16 
megabits, or about 16 million units of binary information. Unlike conventional 
computer memory chips, flash memories continue to hold information even after 
power to the units is turned off. They are expected to become a lightweight 
alternative to computer hard disks.

 Intel Will Cut Chip Prices: The chip maker, keeping rivals at bay, today will 
announce the first of two price cuts on its microprocessors for the third 
quarter.The cuts are aimed at making Pentium the standard chip for PCs, which 
would eat into the market of companies that make clones of Intel's 
previous-generation 486 chips. The planned cuts are expected to bring the price 
of the entry-level 60MHz Pentium below that of the company's 486DX4 chips by 
the end of the year, analysts said. Intel's 486 and Pentium chips are part of 
its x86 family of microprocessors, the brains inside an estimated 75% of the 
world's personal computers.

 Venezuela's Planning Minister Quits: The official in charge of long-term 
economic planning quit because of disputes with the government on how to rally 
Venezuela's foundering economy. Planning Minister Luis Carlos Palacios said he 
disagreed with government plans announced last week to impose price and 
exchange controls. He also said the government had ignored a broad economic 
plan put forward by his ministry that included increasing the prices for fuel, 
modifications to the social security system and intensified talks with the 
International Monetary Fund.

WAL-MART'S WALTONS ARE RICHEST OF RICH; WEALTH: FORBES SAYS JAPANESE TYCOON IS 
TOPS AMONG INDIVIDUALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Walton family of Wal-Mart renown ranked as the world's richest this year 
with a fortune totaling $23.6 billion, Forbes magazine reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese hotel and railroad magnate Yoshiaki Tsutsumi was the richest 
individual, according to the magazine's annual ranking of billionaires, 
released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the billionaires -- both families and individuals -- have 
become a less-exclusive group, with their ranks swelling by 47 to 358 from a 
year ago, the magazine says in its July 18 issue. The billionaires were worth a 
combined $765 billion. Tsutsumi alone has a net worth of $8.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The region with the fastest-growing billionaire population is Latin America, 
which boasted of 42 in this survey. When the magazine compiled its original 
billionaires' list in 1987, Latin America listed just six. Asia is another 
fertile region. This year, excluding Japan, 46 Asian billionaires were counted. 
In 1987, there were but 14. 
</P>
<P>
 In overall numbers, however, the United States ranks as the world's largest 
producer of billion-dollar wealth, with almost three times the number of 
billionaires as the next-closest country. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. billionaires totaled 120 in the Forbes ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other places with billionaires in the double digits were: Germany, 
42; Japan, 36; Mexico, 24; Hong Kong-Macau, 13, and France, 11. 
</P>
<P>
 American families ranked at the top of the list. Following the Waltons were 
the Mars family, with a fortune of $9.6 billion, and the du Ponts, listed as 
being worth $9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Among individuals, Microsoft founder Bill Gates was behind Tsutsumi with a net 
worth of $8.2 billion. After the software innovator came the one-time richest 
individual American, investor Warren Buffett, whose net worth totals $7.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Forbes said it excludes from its list royal families and heads of state, 
because their fortunes come more from political heritage than efforts in the 
realm of economics. The magazine said it also excludes dictators. The Top 10: 
</P>
<P>
 * Walton family; $23.6 billion; Wal-Mart Stores; United States. * Mars family; 
$9.6 billion; candy; United States. * Du Pont family; $9 billion; chemicals, 
manufacturing; United States. * Hans and Gad Rausing; $9 billion; packaging; 
Sweden. * Yoshiaki Tsutsumi; $8.5 billion; land, railroads, resorts; Japan. * 
Bill Gates; $8.2 billion; Microsoft; United States. * Warren Buffett; $7.9 
billion; stock market; United States. * Paul Sacher and Hoffmann family; $7.8 
billion; Hoffman-LaRoche, Switzerland. * Tsai family; $7.5 billion; insurance, 
construction; Taiwan. * Theo and Karl Albrecht; $7.3 billion; supermarkets; 
Germany.

BRIEFCASE: TECHNOLOGY; ENTREPRENEURSHIP BLOSSOMS, SOFTWARE INDUSTRY GROWS IN 
COUNTY'S LANDSCAPE 
</P>

<P>
 This is my last technology column -- I've taken a job covering the chip 
business in Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had an interesting tour of duty in Silicon Beach or whatever nickname 
high-tech entrepreneurs are using these days for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past four years, I've seen the county's high-tech landscape undergo a 
radical change. When I started working here, the newsmakers were computer 
systems and components manufacturers like AST Research Inc., Advanced Logic 
Research Inc. and Western Digital Corp. They helped the county broaden its 
image beyond that of a center for the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the software companies began to grow, creating jobs to replace those lost 
as the big hardware concerns began manufacturing their goods overseas or 
outside California. The software industry's rise passed largely unnoticed, 
though, partly because Orange County wasn't lucky enough to be the home to 
giants like Microsoft or Novell. (In an ironic twist, the county's biggest 
software firm, Platinum Software Corp., faltered earlier this year when its top 
executives resigned because of an accounting scandal. The company's product: 
accounting software.) 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Spectrum has blossomed into a high-tech mecca, thanks to support from 
UC Irvine, venture capitalists, network groups like the American Electronics 
Assn.'s Software Forum, patent attorneys and sunny weather. Engineers who work 
in the industrial park -- at Toshiba America and Western Digital -- have lots 
of company these days at smaller companies nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, high technology accounts for only one Orange County job in 20 today, 
and the fact that its economy is diversified may protect the county from ups 
and downs such as those that the San Jose area experienced as the fortunes of 
the computer chip industry fluctuated. So say the county's boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrepreneurs continue to prosper. Tom Yuen, a co-founder of AST, is hoping 
that lightning will strike twice -- that the five small computer-related 
companies he has started will become international contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 High-tech fraud has prospered, too, perpetrated by information 
superhighwaymen.

 Brian Fargo, who 10 years ago was just a small-time video game designer, has 
turned his Interplay Productions Inc. in Irvine into a major player with $60 
million in annual sales.  
</P>
<P>
 A block away from Interplay, Martin Alper, a poker partner of Fargo's, has 
expanded Virgin Interactive Entertainment Inc. to a venture with more than $100 
million in annual revenue.They both anticipated the rising popularity of 
multimedia games, which combine sound, graphics, video and text. 
</P>
<P>
 Such companies aren't creating enough jobs to rival the numbers employed by 
the aerospace companies, such as Hughes Aircraft and Rockwell. But, having 
emerged as they did in the midst of the recession, they point the way to future 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahead: the information superhighway. The phone and cable TV companies are 
already wiring Orange County with fiber-optic cable. When that happens, Orange 
County will no longer be defined by its existing borders. It will be part of 
cyberspace. I'll see you there.

DODGERS LEFT WITH A WET FUSE; BASEBALL: THE EXPOS' HENRY DROPS THEIR RECORD 
AGAINST LEFT-HANDED STARTERS TO 8-15 WITH A 5-1 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With the sound of bursting fireworks echoing through Dodger Stadium Monday 
night, Tom Lasorda, like his hitters, was quietly bemused. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackle and glare of fireworks dominated the postgame atmosphere, but, 
once again for Dodger hitters against a left-handed starter, it was all fizzles 
during the game. 
</P>
<P>
 This time it was converted reliever Butch Henry and the Montreal Expos who 
shut down the Dodgers, 5-1, before 54,859, bringing the Dodger record against 
left-handed starters to 8-15, the second-worst mark among National League 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, the Dodger manager was asked, is this happening to his predominantly 
right-handed hitting lineup? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why," Lasorda said. "I wish I knew. With the right-handers we 
have in the lineup, we feel we should be very, very effective against 
left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should want to bat against left-handers. They should believe they can 
beat left-handers." 
</P>
<P>
 So is it a confidence problem? "I didn't say that," Lasorda said. "Just right 
now, that's the way it is. But these are the same guys we've had there all 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry (5-1) limited the Dodgers to five hits and no runs in his 6 2/3 innings 
and shackled right-handed power hitters Mike Piazza, Eric Karros, Raul Mondesi 
and Tim Wallach. 
</P>
<P>
 "When things like this happen, you just have to get back to basics and not try 
to burst out all at once with a 10-run inning or anything," Piazza said. "You 
just have to try to chip away." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Karros: "We're not hitting left-handers right now. But we hit them 
earlier this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Rojas pitched the final 2 1/3 innings for the Expos -- striking out 
pinch-hitter Henry Rodriguez, Brett Butler and Piazza in the ninth -- and 
earned his 13th save. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just in one of those ruts," Karros, who ended an 0-for-19 slump with a 
run-scoring single against Rojas in the eighth. "I guess when it rains, it 
pours." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lasorda: "When you have a few guys in a slump, that's when the lack of 
runs come." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Dodgers are scheduled to face left-hander Jeff Fassero today. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Expos scored once in the first -- with Marquis Grissom scoring 
on a tag-up from third base on a short fly ball caught by shortstop Rafael 
Bournigal -- and three times in the fourth against Dodger starter Ramon 
Martinez (9-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez went seven innings and gave up four runs and eight hits. He was 
victimized by a series of softly hit balls that found open territory in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Walker opened the inning with a bunt single, went to third on a soft 
single by Darrin Fletcher, and scored on a bloop single by Wilfredo Cordero. 
Fletcher scored on a bloop single by Mike Lansing. Cordero scored on a 
fielder's choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to lose that way," Martinez said. "Three runs like that: flare, 
little ground balls. . . . I pitched very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry, who hadn't gone longer than 6 2/3 all season, held the Dodgers to three 
singles through the first six innings but got into trouble in the seventh after 
consecutive singles to Bournigal and pinch-hitter Mitch Webster with two out. 
</P>
<P>
 After loading the bases with a walk to Butler, Henry was replaced by Rojas to 
face former Expo Delino DeShields, who struck out. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, however, had more excitement coming his way. After Bournigal was 
pinch-hit for in the eighth, DeShields, who broke into professional ball as a 
shortstop, was moved over to short because Dodgers are not carrying a backup at 
that position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been hoping that situation wouldn't come up," DeShields said. "I've got a 
lot of bad memories from that part of the field -- my whole minor league 
career." 
</P>
<P>
 The first ball of the ninth inning came right at DeShields -- a sharp grounder 
off the bat of his old friend, Grissom. But DeShields handled it cleanly and 
threw Grissom out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Expos stretched the lead to 5-0 on Walker's solo home run against Omar 
Daal in the top of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss reduced the Dodgers' lead in the National League West to five games 
over the second-place Colorado Rockies, who spent the holiday splitting a 
doubleheader with the Chicago Cubs.

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; BRAZIL SHOWS LESS IS MORE; SOCCER: DESPITE 
LEONARDO'S EJECTION -- AND PLAYING 10 MEN TO 11 FOR MORE THAN 40 MINUTES -- IT 
FINDS WAY TO PREVAIL.

<P>
 It was the forearm shiver that was going to shake the World Cup like a dry 
martini, or maybe a Molotov cocktail. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the elbow to the head that stood to bring mighty Brazil to its knees, a 
red-card violation and a red-flag warning that needed no translation from here 
to Sao Paolo: 
</P>
<P>
 DANGER! 
</P>
<P>
 PESKY USA INSECTOS SWARMING AGAIN. 
</P>
<P>
 ANOTHER SOUTH AMERICAN SOCCER POWERHOUSE IN MUCHA AGUA CALIENTE. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the concept of taking one for the team to a new extreme, U.S. 
midfielder Tab Ramos sustained a second-stage concussion, a fractured skull, an 
overnight stay at Stanford Medical Center and -- no kidding -- a yellow card in 
exchange for the expulsion of Brazilian defender Leonardo in the 44th minute of 
Monday's second-round match. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a lot to give, but the result had history-making implications. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonardo's red card gave the underdog Americans a man advantage for, 
potentially, the final 46 minutes of regulation play -- and overtime, if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven Americans versus 10 Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans viewed the development as the chance of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians shrugged and said, "Well, almost an even fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Alberto Parreira's penalty-killing unit was something to behold, as was 
the ball for most of the second half. The Brazilians beheld the ball, and 
beheld it some more, playing keep-away until the 74th minute when Romario found 
a seam in the U.S. defense and isolated running mate Bebeto for the 
game-breaking shorthanded goal. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the Americans played 11 on 10 for 41 minutes -- until U.S. defender 
Fernando Clavijo received an equalizing second yellow card of the game -- and 
did not put a single serious shot on net. 
</P>
<P>
 If anybody had an advantage, it was Claudio Taffarel, the Brazilian 
goalkeeper. Taffarel turned in what was easily the least-taxing shutout of the 
tournament: 90 minutes, zero saves, please step forward into the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Nice work if you can get it. 
</P>
<P>
 So Miracle On Bermuda evaporated just like that, and now the Americans have 
four years to chew on the Blown Opportunity By The Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, midfielder Hugo Perez's wheels are grinding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have played better in that situation," Perez said. "I think we 
should (have attacked more). 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if the team was afraid or what. I just don't know. It's 
difficult to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Bora Milutinovic, U.S. coach and post-elimination spin doctor, sang a 
different song, proposing that it's not unusual to lose to a side that must 
play down one. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the first time a team one man down has been able to beat us," 
Milutinovic noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil had to play harder and (consequently) had the ball more in the second 
half. That was the deciding difference." 
</P>
<P>
 And another thing: Brazil is still Brazil, whether it's playing with a full 
deck or down a Leonardo or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Perez, an assistant coach on the 1990 U.S. World Cup team and now a 
technical adviser for the U.S. Soccer Federation, pointed out: "People have to 
understand that Brazil could beat most teams in this tournament playing with 10 
men. And when they play with 11, it seems like 12." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonardo's red card also served as an electric prod to the slumbering, 
lumbering Brazilians, stuck as they were in third gear and a nil-nil tie as the 
first half drew to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 "Psychologically," Perez said, "when a team goes down a man, it tends to dig 
deeper and work a lot harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, when you're talking about Brazil, you're talking about a team with 
intense nationalistic pride. This a country that has been frustrated for 24 
years in the World Cup. The players just said, 'Hey, whether we have to play 
with 11 or 10, we cannot let the country down.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So, was Tab Ramos' broken parietal bone suffered in vain? 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel real sorry for Tab right now," forward Ernie Stewart said. "(But) I've 
seen this happen before in Europe -- when you're down one man, you know you 
have to give a little extra. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess everyone tries a little harder and the team plays better. That's the 
only way to explain it." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing behind his press-row seat, Perez applauded the U.S. players as they 
shook hands with the winners and trudged off the Stanford Stadium field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face facts," Perez said. "I'm sure all of us were hopeful for -- I'm 
not going to say a miracle -- but maybe a major upset went Leonardo went off at 
halftime. You're thinking, 'Hey, they've only got 10 now. We've got a real 
chance at this thing.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But nobody in the world plays with 10 the way Brazil can. Today, we played as 
well as we can play. But Brazil, they're in another class. . . . It's been 24 
years, but it looks like this might be their World Cup."

won't accept the rationalizations and incisive analysis that is the inevitable 
aftermath of a loss. It is too soon and it hurts too much and this is still the 
time to be alone with their pain. 
</P>
<P>
 No one wanted to hear Monday that losing 1-0 to Brazil is some kind of 
achievement, that getting beyond the first round of the World Cup for the first 
time in 64 years is something to take out and display as a treasure. No, the 
measure of their growth as a soccer team is that the U.S. players are 
disappointed and truly believed themselves capable of beating the team that 
looks destined to win the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing well is no longer acceptable to the U.S. team, and that is as sure a 
sign of their ambition as any. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played with a huge heart today," U.S. assistant coach Timo Liekoski said. 
"We did everything we could. We played with the discipline we wanted. In the 
end, the team with the experience at this level won." 
</P>
<P>
 Determination and strength of will is no match for technical skill. And even 
as Brazil played a man short for half the game, the United Sates launched 
short-lived attacks that were foiled again and again as Brazil controlled the 
midfield and the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in front of 84,147 enthusiastic fans at Stanford Stadium, the U.S. 
team came into the game with its usual positive approach, the kind of 
we-can-do-it enthusiasm that had caused many skeptics to scoff at them. Again 
and again, U.S. players had insisted they had reached a point that they could 
play with and beat any team in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Confidence is one thing, performance is another. Almost from the beginning of 
the game, frustrations mounted for the United States. Already without John 
Harkes because of a one-game suspension, the team lost Tab Ramos in the 44th 
minute with a slight skull fracture. Ramos had tangled with Brazil's Leonardo 
and received a yellow card for a hard foul, but Leonardo was red-carded on the 
play after he cracked Ramos' head with an elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 The red card on Leonardo gave the United States a one-man advantage for most 
of the second half, but it couldn't take advantage.  
</P>
<P>
 Ramos was taken from the field and later found to have a broken bone over his 
left ear. He was admitted to Stanford Medical Center for overnight observation. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of Ramos presented U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic a second tactical 
decision. The first had been to start Hugo Perez for the first time in the 
World Cup as a withdrawn forward in place of Eric Wynalda. In Harkes' place on 
the left side of the midfield, Milutinovic started Cobi Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The inclusion of Perez was meant to increase the U.S. ability to hold the ball 
in the midfield. Milutinovic said that after the loss to Romania in the first 
round, he knew Perez had to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones offered speed -- enough pace to be a danger on the attack and sufficient 
quickness to get back and help on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The game plan was to drop back on defense -- at times there were eight or nine 
players back -- win the ball, and then counterattack. It was a controversial 
approach, as many U.S. players believe the team is best at attacking and using 
its speed to pressure the opponent. There was little pressure from the United 
States on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sport in which statistics are seldom revealing, there was this: Brazil 
had 16 shots and the United States four, only one from inside the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans knew exactly how to stop the Brazilian team," Brazilian 
goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel said. "It was very tough marking one-on-one. They 
knew the only way to stop the Brazilian team was to close our offense. Besides, 
it was very hard to play against a team that instead of playing, wanted to 
destroy our game." 
</P>
<P>
 Destroy? The United States wanted to take away Brazil's ability to create, to 
eliminate space and try anything to shut down the potent tandem of Bebeto and 
Romario. Nothing worked. The pair dribbled and passed and swerved through the 
midfield and, frequently, slashed behind the U.S. defense on dangerous runs. 
Only the United States' successful use of the offside trap kept Brazil from 
scoring more. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a handful of Brazilian shots bounced off the post, and a clear scoring 
chance was averted when Thomas Dooley cleared the ball off the line after 
Romario's shot beat Tony Meola early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States felt it had accomplished something after a scoreless first 
half, but the Brazilian pressure mounted. Its goal, in the 74th minute, seemed 
to deliver the final blow to the U.S. team. Alexi Lalas, who along with Marcelo 
Balboa, played an exceptional game on defense, missed a sliding tackle on 
Bebeto after a pass from Romario and the Brazilian's shot beat Meola to the far 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilian bench erupted after the goal and the team's comfort level rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil is through to the quarterfinals, where it will play the Netherlands in 
Dallas on Saturday. U.S. players will disperse to their families and homes and 
reflect on what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, U.S. players walked misty-eyed to the locker room and trickled 
out later. Milutinovic walked around speaking softly to his players, his hands 
stuffed deep into his pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Ernie Stewart, eyes red-rimmed, was asked what Milutinovic said to the 
team after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told us we should be proud of ourselves," Stewart said quietly. "But right 
now his words don't mean too much because we are still disappointed over our 
loss. Maybe tomorrow, or in a few weeks, we'll be able to appreciate his words 
more." 
</P>

ANGELS BRING OUT THE BEST IN CLEMENS; BASEBALL: RIGHT-HANDER LEADS RED SOX TO 
4-1 VICTORY, ONLY HIS SECOND IN EIGHT STARTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels traipsed into the visiting clubhouse Monday morning at Fenway Park. 
It was unusually quiet. There was no laughter and only a few words spoken. 
</P>
<P>
 They had been forewarned days ago, and now the moment finally had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 They were about to face Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed a cruel assignment, particularly considering the Angels are vying 
with the San Diego Padres for the worst record in baseball, but they were 
buoyed by the rumors that Clemens had been struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens had won only one of his last seven starts. . . . His fastball had 
diminished. . . . He wasn't picked for the All-Star game. . . . Maybe this 
would finally be their day? 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys came in thinking, 'Hey, here's my shot,' " Angel right fielder Tim 
Salmon said. " 'If I can do something off him, it'll probably be on 
'SportsCenter.' ' 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was looking forward to the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, a few hours later, the Angels were back sitting in front of their 
lockers, asking one another how this can keep happening, losing once again, 
4-1, to the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens (7-4) made the Angels look inept -- which hasn't been difficult these 
days -- yielding only two hits and striking out 10 in seven innings before 
leaving because of a tight groin. He has defeated the Angels in nine 
consecutive starts at Fenway, compiling a 1.09 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 No pitcher has dominated the Angels as has Clemens. He has defeated them 20 
times in his career, the most victories by any active pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the old Roger Clemens that I've seen," Angel Manager Marcel 
Lachemann said. "He didn't look too bad to me." 
</P>
<P>
 No one's looking bad these days against the Angels, who lost for the 23rd time 
in 34 games and at 34-49 are 15 games below .500 for the first time this 
season. The Angels are batting .162 this trip, and have been limited to four 
hits or fewer in four of their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're slumping now, no doubt about that," Lachemann said of his hitters. 
"But they have been basically carrying this club all year. So to say one part 
of the team is more responsible than another is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Against Clemens, the Angels didn't reach second base until the fifth inning 
and didn't reached third until the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gets a lot of respect from me," said Chili Davis, who struck out for the 
23rd time in his career against Clemens, the most of any active player. "But I 
wouldn't put Roger in a class of his own. I give guys respect, but I don't put 
guys in the immortal category. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were that damn good, they'd be 29-0 every year, have thousands of 
strikeouts, and nobody would even touch him." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Salmon: "All I know is that I can be looking for a fastball, and he can 
throw a fastball -- and he can still throw it right by me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, I face him enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' only hope on this day was when Clemens left the game. Angel 
starter Phil Leftwich, who retired 19 of the last 21 he faced in his first 
complete game of the season, was invigorated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a great feeling when that happened," Salmon said. "I thought, 'Hey, 
this is our day.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it made little difference. The Angels opened the ninth with 
consecutive singles against reliever Ken Ryan, but meekly ended the game when 
Jim Edmonds, Chad Curtis and J.T. Snow failed to hit the ball out of the 
infield.

MORNING BRIEFING: IS GENDER WORTH MORE IN TENDER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hall of Fame golfer Patty Sheehan doesn't like the way female athletes are 
portrayed in different ways than males. She says the inequality mirrors the 
rest of society. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the glaring examples of discrimination," she said, "is John Daly, who 
is an alcoholic and has beaten his wife and been a jerk at times. He just signs 
a $30-million contract with Wilson for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you have Jennifer Capriati, who is a young kid who got caught with some 
marijuana and all her contracts are taken away from her." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Andy Benes came within two innings of pitching the first 
no-hitter in the history of the San Diego Padres last Sunday. Which three other 
teams have never had a pitcher throw a no-hitter? 
</P>
<P>
 All in the family: Benes' younger brother, Alan, pitched a one-hitter Saturday 
night, leading the Class AA Arkansas Travelers to a 5-1 victory over Shreveport 
in the Texas League. 
</P>
<P>
 Love that city: Pitcher Greg A. Harris, picked up by the New York Yankees 
after his release from the Boston Red Sox, will become the 52nd player to play 
for the Yankees and New York Mets. Harris pitched for the Mets in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy welcome: When people call Jacobs Field, operators answer: "Thank you for 
calling the first-place Cleveland Indians." 
</P>
<P>
 Cannibalism? Dick Butkus, the great linebacker of the Chicago Bears who was 
called the "Animal" by rival players, was accused on occasion of biting them. 
</P>
<P>
 Butkus, now an actor, was wounded by the charge of biting. He said: "That 
biting charge definitely is not true. I'm a football player, not a gourmet." 
</P>
<P>
 Role model: The San Francisco Giants signed Darryl Strawberry to play right 
field, but what about Mark Carreon, who has been playing that position? He went 
nine for 15 with two homers and eight runs batted in during a four-game series 
with Montreal. On Sunday, his three-run homer gave the Giants an 8-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my role," Carreon said. "I know when Darryl gets here it will be back 
to the routine. But it's been fun to contribute." 
</P>
<P>
 More tears: Just because Arnold Palmer gave a tearful farewell at the U. S. 
Open, it doesn't mean that Arnie won't be around. He has entered the PGA 
Championship for a record 37th consecutive appearance Aug. 11-14 at Southern 
Hills in Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer is one of only six players to shoot all four rounds in the PGA in the 
60s -- but he has never won it. When he shot 68-68-69-69 -- 274 in 1964, Bobby 
Nichols shot 271. 
</P>
<P>
 More than oversight: Warren Moon, the new Minnesota Viking quarterback, is 
upset that Florida State's Charlie Ward was not drafted by an NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Charlie Ward can't get drafted, that shows you there's something wrong," 
Moon told Inside Sports. "Here's a kid who's done everything you can possibly 
do in college football -- win a national championship, win a Heisman Trophy, 
great passing statistics -- and then they're going to say he's not tall enough 
or his arm's not strong enough? That's totally uncalled for." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: The New York Mets, the Colorado Rockies and the Florida 
Marlins.

 That was the worst 40-minute power play I've ever seen. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It became apparent on the Fourth of July that 10 Brazilian soccer players are 
better than 11 Americans. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The United States showed marked improvement from the 1990 World Cup tournament 
but shouldn't necessarily expect more success in 1998 in France. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, the United States hasn't won an Olympic Games medal in hockey since 
winning the gold in 1980 at Lake Placid, N.Y. . . .

<P>
 There are no Peles on this Brazilian roster, but there are 16 players who go 
by one name and are worthy of the honor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Orel Hershiser and Fernando Valenzuela didn't do badly for a couple of geezers 
Sunday at Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers' 3-1 victory over Philadelphia was the 
lowest-scoring game in the major leagues that day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Angel rookie pitcher Brian Anderson, who has been overmatched lately, belongs 
with Dodger prospects Darren Dreifort and Chan Ho Park in the minors. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There were some terrible choices in the fans' All-Star balloting, but the same 
kind of thing would have happened if the players and managers had voted. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers are the only first-place team that will be represented by only one 
player next Tuesday at Pittsburgh. . . .

 A second-place team, Houston, leads both leagues with five selections. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Least-known all-star in years is Astro rookie right-handed pitcher John Hudek. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 One of the keys to the Cincinnati Reds' success is team speed, made even more 
formidable by the acquisition of Deion Sanders. . . .

 Pete Sampras shouldn't have to apologize for being so much better than 
everyone else at Wimbledon and taking all the suspense out of the competition.

 ESPN's Linda Cohn described Wimbledon spectator Jack Nicholson as an "American 
werewolf in London."...

 Running back might become a Raider strength, instead of weakness, if they 
trade for the New England Patriots' Leonard Russell. . . .

 House of Upsets: The highest-rated male and female horses in the country, The 
Wicked North and Hollywood Wildcat, were defeated on consecutive days at 
Hollywood Park. . . .

 The surprise winners, Slew Of Damascus in the Gold Cup on Saturday and 
Corrazona in the Triple Bend Handicap on Sunday, both got brilliant rides by 
Gary Stevens. . . .

 Slew Of Damascus' victory in slow time enhanced the opinion of many 
handicappers that a 3-year-old will win the Breeders' Cup Classic. . . .

 I can't think of one good reason why racing stewards consider it necessary to 
talk to the jockeys in question on the phone before ruling on an inquiry. Does 
a home plate umpire ask the batter and catcher if a pitch was inside or down

 The St. Louis Blues, looking to beef up their defense, acquired the rights to 
Calgary's Al MacInnis and signed New Jersey's Scott Stevens to an offer sheet. 
In exchange for MacInnis and a draft pick, the Blues sent the Flames defenseman 
Phil Housely, along with two draft picks.

 By acquiring MacInnis, the Blues have the right to match any other offer for 
the six-time NHL all-star. MacInnis reportedly was offered more than $2 million 
for next season by the Flames; the Blues are offering $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Stevens' deal is for $16 million over 
four years, including a signing bonus of at least $2.5 million. The New Jersey

OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; BLESZYNSKI ADVANCES TO MIXED DOUBLES FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mark Loughrin did his best to laugh it off, which was his most graceful 
option. 
</P>
<P>
 During a two-game stretch in an Olympic Festival mixed doubles tennis 
semifinal, almost every ball he hit went askew. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem. Loughrin could afford a few errant shots. He has Ania Bleszynski 
for a partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every time Loughrin was handcuffed by one of Brian Patterson's serves, 
Bleszynski answered the next offering with a strong return. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept telling her, 'You're keeping me in there,' " Loughrin said. "She 
carried us for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski, from Thousand Oaks, and Loughrin, from Greendale, Wis., advanced 
to Wednesday's gold medal match by defeating Patterson and partner Kristen 
Sanderson, 6-2, 6-4, Monday at the Dwight Davis Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory kept alive Bleszynski's hopes for earning medals in all three 
tennis events, although she suffered her first defeat of the competition in 
women's doubles earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Carlisle White, from Spartanburg, S. C., and partner Laura Berendt of 
Tampa, Fla., upset Bleszynski and Jennifer Heiser of Stockton, 7-5, 7-6 (6-4), 
in a semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Any loss by Bleszynski is considered an upset. Event organizers seeded the 
Stanford-bound 17-year-old first in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 She has almost lived up to the billing. Bleszynski is 2-0 in singles, 3-0 in 
mixed doubles and 1-1 in women's doubles. Bleszynski and Heiser will play 
Christine Sim of Shawnee Mission, Kan., and Tara Snyder of Wichita, Kan., today 
for the bronze medal in doubles at 1 p.m., shortly after Bleszynski finishes 
her semifinal match in singles. 
</P>
<P>
 After a similarly fast start last year, Bleszynski tired in the final two days 
and took home two bronze medals. 
</P>
<P>
 She does not anticipate faltering this time, even though the weather -- 
temperatures in the 90s and humidity to match -- is similar to what she 
experienced last year in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more prepared and I know what to expect," she said. "I know to go to bed 
earlier and I know to drink more and rest more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not tired at all yet. I'm enjoying myself." 
</P>
<P>
 In other tennis action, Elliott Weiss of Dallas and Jakub Pietrowski of 
Huntington Beach defeated David Sutton of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Philip 
Tseng, 6-2, 6-2, in a men's doubles semifinal. Tseng is a Harvard-Westlake High 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Tseng was eliminated from singles action, losing to 
Brandon Kramer of Reno, 7-5, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 In swimming, Nicole Beck of Ventura led the West 4-x-100-meter medley relay 
team to a wire-to-wire win in four minutes, 20.99 seconds. Beck got the West 
off quickly, swimming a 1:05.94 split on the first leg, the backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
 In the equestrian team dressage final, Heather Bender-Atwell of Burbank and 
Dennis Callin of Westlake Village formed half of the gold medal-winning West 
team. Bender-Atwell, riding Mikhail, and Callin, riding Excel, helped the West 
score 3,778 points to edge the East team.

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; THE BEST EVENTUALLY WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN; 
BRAZIL: ROMARIO, BEBETO TAKE A WHILE BUT INEVITABLY CONNECT FOR THE WINNING 
GOAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazil's Romario and Bebeto are fast forwards. They are not fast friends. 
After learning that they had been assigned to sit next to each other on the 
team's plane from Brazil to the United States for the World Cup, perhaps so 
that they could bond, Romario called a news conference to demand a new flight 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But after they connected for the only goal in a 1-0 victory over the United 
States on Monday at Stanford Stadium in the World Cup's second round, Romario 
and Bebeto rushed into each other's arms and celebrated as one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so happy, as if I scored the goal myself," Romario said. "That Bebeto 
did it makes no difference to me. When we embraced, the words that he uttered 
to me were like those from one brother to another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I will be able to say similar words to him in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto's version was less melodramatic. The words, Bebeto said, were: "Thank 
you for giving me that pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps something was lost in the translation. But whatever passed between 
them, they had to be sweeter than the unprintables spewing forth during the 
frustrating first 74 minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to find space in a U.S. defense that could be more aptly described as a 
blockade, Romario and Bebeto were crafty enough to create chances for 
themselves. But they could not finish what they started. 
</P>
<P>
 They combined for nine shots, seven inside the penalty area. Bebeto barely 
missed in the 26th minute, when he angled a shot from the left side that went 
wide right. Romario's shot in the 45th minute hit the right post. Romario's 
shot in the 48th minute beat goalkeeper Tony Meola but was kicked off the line 
and out of danger by defender Thomas Dooley. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the 74th minute, Romario and Bebeto got their act together. Dribbling 
down the middle of the field, Romario evaded the sliding tackle of Dooley, 
drawing defender Marcelo Balboa toward him. With Balboa committed, Romario 
passed to his right, to Bebeto, who had gotten behind defender Alexi Lalas. All 
that was left for Bebeto to do was beat Meola, which he did with a shot into 
the left corner. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. defender Paul Caligiuri described the scene as if it will forever be 
burned into his memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal came as a shock," he said. "Right when we lost the ball, somehow 
Romario got it. He just turned and went right at us. Right down the middle. We 
just had to keep backing up and backing up. If we challenged him, he's so 
potent when he tries to shoot and score. That's where Bebeto read his play very 
well. He created some space for himself, then Romario made a great pass. I 
think everyone was looking for him to try and shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 The man who was supposed to be in the space that Bebeto created, Lalas, said: 
"I should have stepped up on Bebeto and played him offsides. But I stayed with 
him and slid and watched it go into the back of the net. Oh well. He finished 
it very well. He was going a hundred miles an hour. These guys are dribbling 
maniacs." 
</P>
<P>
 If there was any satisfaction for the U.S. defenders, it was that "in the end, 
Brazil had to rely on the two guys who have been scoring goals for them, 
Romario and Bebeto," U.S. assistant Timo Liekoski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario said that he was never worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the way soccer is," he said. "You struggle during the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all due respect to the American team, which is a great team, I think 
Brazil dominated the game and tried to create space in the field during the 
entire game. Just one ball went in, but, with a little luck, two or three 
others could have too." 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that if we persisted, if we kept playing, we would score," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also congratulated the United States for its defensive strategy, 
designed by Coach Bora Milutinovic. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the hardest game we've played so far in the tournament," he said. 
"Bora's a great coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Romario and Bebeto then retired to the team bus, where it is possible they 
might have sat together. This might be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

 At Foxboro Stadium Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria vs. Italy 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 10 a.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Traditional European power Italy takes on African newcomer 
Nigeria in an intriguing game that could further shake up the once-predictable 
order of soccer. Nigeria enters today's game trying to duplicate Cameroon's 
feat in 1990 -- reaching the quarterfinals as African champion. The sheer power 
of Nigeria is frightening to any World Cup team, but Italy hopes to neutralize 
it with superior tactical play. The Italians have been the tournament's great 
underachievers but should get a boost from the return of goalkeeper Gianluca 
Pagliuca, who was suspended for a game. "In the three first-round games, I saw 
three different games, three different Italys," Coach Arrigo Sacchi said. So, 
the question is which one will Nigeria see today. That might prove the 
difference between a disappointing end or an inspiring restart for Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: The Nigerians came to the United States as young innocents abroad, 
but after winning Group D, they are sounding more like a veteran World Cup 
team. Coach Clemens Westerhof and his players were feuding last week over money 
and access to players' wives and girlfriends. The players have accused 
Westerhof, their Dutch coach, of playing favorites in order to sabotage their 
efforts to receive a $5,000 bonus for winning today's match. Further inciting 
the players was Westerhof's order that the team leave the hotel where their 
wives and girlfriends were staying. Italy could face problems of its own if it 
is eliminated. The players wanted to meet Argentina, a respected power, instead 
of a dangerous unknown. But when Argentina fell to Bulgaria, 2-0, Nigeria won 
Group D and the Argentines finished third. "Losing to Argentina might have been 
acceptable, but if we lose to Nigeria, there will be people waiting for us in 
Italy," forward Giuseppe Signori said. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Midfielder Roberto Donadoni says the second round will mark a 
change, Italian style. "We are like bombs set to go off," he said. "We have to 
explode." Whether that means they will fall flat or advance to the 
quarterfinals is anyone's guess. Italy needs star Roberto Baggio to take 
control if Nigeria is to be denied. Baggio has been suffering from an injured 
Achilles' tendon, but Sacchi believes he will be a presence today. The 
Nigerians said they had too much respect for Argentina in a 2-1 loss. If they 
learned from that defeat, they might overwhelm Italy with a lightning attack. 
If Italy can control the midfield and play a more deliberate pace, it will 
advance with a close victory, but it will be difficult to slow the Nigerian 
attack. Rashidi Yekini and company are simply too fast. Nigeria, 3-2. ELLIOTT

 At Giants Stadium East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico vs. Bulgaria 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 1:30 p.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: The rule mandating a one-game suspension for receiving two 
yellow cards has robbed Bulgaria of its three best defensive-minded players: 
Trifon Ivanov, Tsanko Tzvetanov and Zlatko Iankov. This is good news for 
Mexican offensive stars Luis Garcia, Luis Roberto (Zague) Alves, and Carlos 
Hermosillo. Garcia scored twice in the first round, Hermosillo added two 
assists and Alves was fouled a team-leading eight times while forcing opponents 
to chase him into the corner. The Mexicans have two other offensive stars 
playing in the middle of the field -- Alberto Garcia Aspe and Marcelino Bernal, 
whose goal gave Mexico a 1-1 tie with Italy. Bulgaria's offense is essentially 
two men: Hristo Stoichkov and Emil Kostadinov. They combined for three goals, 
three assists and 21 shots in the first round. That is more production in each 
category than Mexico's Garcia, Alves and Hermosillo combined. But Bulgaria has 
yet to face a pressing defense like the one fashioned by Mexican Coach Miguel 
Mejia Baron. Holding Ireland and Italy to one goal each made stars of Jorge 
Rodriguez, Claudio Suarez and Juan Ramirez Perales. Another budding defensive 
star, Ramon Ramirez, who played well against Italy's Baggios, should play his 
second game of this World Cup. No talk of the Mexican defense is complete 
without mentioning goalkeeper Jorge Campos, the brightly adorned daredevil who 
charges anything with 18 yards.However, Bulgaria goalkeeper Borislav Mikhailov, 
a second-division player in France, has made his reputation here with 22 saves 
while giving up only three goals. Campos has given up three goals while making 
12 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: The Mexicans are making no secret that they are thrilled to be 
playing Bulgaria, which took advantage of a terrible Greek team and a terribly 
uninspired Argentine team to advance. The Bulgarians were winless in 17 World 
Cup finals games until this year and have not advanced past the second round in 
five previous appearances. But the players who thought they would be playing 
tough Nigeria should not celebrate too soon. This same Mexican team that has 
thrilled its country by winning difficult Group E also tied Bulgaria and lost 
to the United States in pre-Cup matches. Mexico is a talented team but not 
talented enough that a couple of players can afford to lose concentration. 
Bulgaria is not so talented, particularly with the three suspensions, but it 
has enough firepower in Stoichkov and Kostadinov to surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: More than 70,000 will turn the Meadowlands into a suburb of Mexico 
City. Bulgaria will look around and realize that in more than one way, it 
doesn't belong. Mexico, which showed flashes of brilliance in its last two 
games, has caught a wave that should carry it past Bulgaria and on to the 
quarterfinals against . . . oh, yeah, Germany. Mexico by a goal. BILL PLASCHKE

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; SPOTLIGHT; SO MUCH FOR SOCCER AS ART IN ENGLAND

 The Daily Telegraph in London has noted that England's non-participation in 
the World Cup finals "has had a surprisingly beneficial effect on the betting 
industry, where a $75-million play is expected by the end of the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 At William Hill (betting shops), where they anticipate an $18-million share of 
the action, spokesman Graham Sharpe said: "I think this World Cup has seen 
football betting come of age. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Because England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are not there, betters 
don't need to worry about other loyalties when they put on their bets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, the only reason for watching Bulgaria versus Bolivia -- unless 
you have an uncle from Bulgaria or an auntie from Boliva -- is because you've 
got money on it."

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; SPOTLIGHT; THESE COMMERCIALS BROUGHT TO YOU BY 
HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Haitian military and its civilian puppet government took advantage of the 
country's fascination with the World Cup to put down the United States and 
spread some propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
 During the telecast of the U.S. game against Brazil on Monday, Haiti National 
Television constantly ran slogans across the screen in Creole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long live the Haitian flag," read one of the mild ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are masters of our own sun and soil," read another, followed by, "There 
are no traitors among us." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came "No to occupation" and "Down with an invasion," references to the 
threat of U.S. intervention to drive out the military. 
</P>
<P>
 The most anti-American of the programming came during the halftime 
intermission when the network, which had been off the air for lack of money and 
electricity until the World Cup, ran excerpts from a documentary showing U.S. 
troops invading Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 There were pictures of American soldiers shooting into apartment buildings, a 
row of caskets containing Panamanian bodies and one graphic close-up of the 
charred head of a body being carried from a wooden structure burned to the 
ground during the 1989 U.S. attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there was a cartoon graphic showing a colorful Haitian public bus 
that was positioned to look as if it were carrying the American players off the 
field after the Brazilians scored or played particularly well.

<TEXT>
<P>
 British sportswriters were ecstatic about Romania's performance in defeating 
Argentina, 3-2, Sunday, and and Romanian captain Gheorghe Hagi was being 
depicted as the best all-around player in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mirror called it a "wonderful game, a vivid, flowing exciting spectacle," 
adding "if this doesn't convert America to soccer, nothing will." 
</P>
<P>
 And from Pasadena, Jeff Powell in the Daily Mail reported: ". . . Gheorghe 
Hagi orchestrated the trio of classic counterattacks which set the tears 
flowing in Buenos Aires yet again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maradona's World Cup persona has been reinvented as a television commentator 
-- a position for which no drug test yet applies -- and he cried openly for 
Argentina as its heroic comeback fell tantalizingly short of forcing Romania to 
extra time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hagi, one of the pretenders to the Maradona throne, scored once and made the 
most delightful goals of the finals thus far." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Daily Express phrased it this way: "The tears of Argentina were 
flowing again in the game in which it had to bounce back from the fall of Diego 
Maradona. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "They were tormented into another crisis by the brilliance of Romanian general 
Gheorghe Hagi."

 The passion for football that Calcuttans and Bangladeshis share is at odds 
with the sporting preference of the rest of the Subcontinent, which runs to 
cricket. 
</P>
<P>
 The time difference with America means that many Bengalis spend the evening 
and wee hours of the morning watching TV broadcasts of Cup games. Calcutta's 
nighttime calm is often rent by throaty cries of "g-o-o-o-o-a-l!" from tens of 
thousands of households, especially if Argentina or Brazil is playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Family disputes reportedly are on the rise, as are stomach upsets caused by 
irregular sleeping schedules.

 July Fourth celebrations and postgame partying drew an estimated 200,000 
people to downtown Orlando on Monday night.The high point -- aside from the 
fireworks -- was a rousing chorus of "Happy Birthday," sung to honor the United 
States on its Independence Day.

 After the final game played in Orlando, members of the police department gave 
their caps away as souvenirs. The caps were highly popular, especially with

 Belgians were sad and bitter about their team's exit from the World Cup after 
its 3-2 defeat by the Germans on Saturday.Chief among their complaints is the 
non-call by referee Kurt Roethlisberger when Germany's Thomas Helmer took down 
Josip Weber in the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 From Page 1 of the Walloon daily "La Derniere Heure" (The Last Hour), under 
the headline "Red card for the referee": 
</P>
<P>
 "Switzerland was famous for its banks and its chocolate. Now, she will also be 
famous due to a certain Kurt Roethlisberger, international referee, who 
distinguished himself on Saturday by refusing (Belgium) a penalty for an 
unmistakable foul by Helmer on Josip Weber."

 Americans are traditionalists when it comes to pregame hosts. We have Bob 
Costas and Greg Gumbel. 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, however, pregame World Cup coverage on RAI, the state broadcasting 
company, begins with an hourlong burlesque show, hosted by Valeria Marini and 
Alba Parietti. 
</P>
<P>
 "Palpitating Valeria and pounding Alba are the first soubrettes to have been 
given the job of hosting a soccer program," London's Sunday Telegraph reports. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 7 million Italians reportedly tune in. 
</P>
<P>
 The women admittedly don't know much about soccer X's and O's, so they spend 
most of the hour on the stage in various stages of undress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being vapid is my job," Valeria is quoted as saying. "You need a bit of 
silliness to help distract people from everyday problems." CHRIS DUFRESNE

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; DUTCH HAPPY WITH GIFTS FROM IRISH; SOCCER: 
FIRST-HALF DEFENSIVE LAPSES ARE TOO MUCH FOR IRELAND TO OVERCOME IN 2-0 LOSS TO 
NETHERLANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Wim Jonk's 25-yard shot slipped through the hands of Irish goalkeeper Pat 
Bonner and rolled into the yawning mouth of the net, Ireland's World Cup hopes 
slipped away too. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Bonner was helpless to recover from his inexplicable mistake Monday, 
his Irish teammates were helpless to erase a two-goal deficit against a 
determined and diligent Dutch team. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonk's goal, in the 41st minute, launched the Netherlands to a 2-0 
second-round victory and into the World Cup quarterfinals, the country's best 
showing since its runner-up finishes in 1974 and '78. The Dutch created other 
chances Monday that were more dazzling than Jonk's shot, but none had more 
impact than the midfielder's direct but stoppable blast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was important to get another goal before halftime," Dutch Coach Dick 
Advocaat said. "The Irish really went for it in the second half, but you could 
see they tired. We played well in the first half, and even though the Irish 
played better in the second half, they never looked like they would win the 
match." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dennis Bergkamp, who scored the first goal after a misplay by Irish 
defender Terry Phelan: "Any lead is important, but two goals up on the Irish 
made them work harder in the second half. . . . I think they made mistakes 
because of our positive, attacking play. We deserved the goals. We made it very 
difficult for them."  
</P>
<P>
 Although Bonner got a substantial part of the ball, he couldn't explain the 
difficulty he had with Jonk's shot. Time froze as the ball trickled behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got my hands on the ball, but it just squirmed out of my hands and went 
into the net," Bonner said. "The ball was coming in at an angle, and if I had 
taken it earlier it would have bounced off my hands and gone for a corner 
(kick). But because I stayed by my net, when it came to my hands and went out 
of my hands, it went into the goal. I still don't know what happened. It has 
got to be me that takes the blame." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonner's guilt aside, there was more credit to be given the Dutch than blame 
heaped on the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing before a lively crowd of 61,255 at the Florida Citrus Bowl, both teams 
entertained their large and loyal followings with early offensive thrusts. The 
singing, drum-beating fans in vivid orange and the outnumbered but spirited 
fans in emerald green each had their moments of joy, until Bergkamp seized the 
moment for Holland in the 11th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an unfortunate goal against the Irish, scored after Marc Overmars 
intercepted Phelan's header, beat defender Phil Babb and passed to his left to 
Bergkamp for a tap-in. It forced the Irish to change their tactics and press 
forward, a change the Dutch exploited. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had to come at us," Bergkamp said, "and I'm not really sure that's their 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland's game revolves around controlling the midfield, running forever and 
looping long passes toward the goal to generate one or two high-percentage 
chances. The Dutch defense denied them those opportunities after the opening 
minutes, keying on Steve Staunton and Tommy Coyne and starting counterattacks 
when the Irish sent extra players up field. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do I say? We're going home," said Ireland Coach Jack Charlton, who held 
a consolation cigar at his postgame news conference. "We might have gone out in 
a little bit of a different way. When you give away two silly goals it leaves a 
bad feeling in the mouths of some people, but, all in all, I could ask no more 
of the players." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that they were ready to leave their second World Cup tournament, one in 
which they upset Italy and finished second in "the group of death," a quartet 
that included Italy, Norway and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly don't think we did ourselves justice today," said defender Paul 
McGrath, who played on the 1990 squad that lost to Italy in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonner agreed. "If Holland had scored two nice goals from 10 pass movements, 
that would be one thing, but to lose when you've shot yourself in each foot, 
it's very, very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch, who will face Brazil on Saturday at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, are 
3-1 and more impressive with each game. They've scored six goals and given up 
only three, and on Monday they dictated a comfortable and confident pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played very strongly in the first half and were able to play in a very 
high rhythm," said Ronald Koeman, again a standout on defense. "The second half 
we played more defensively, but we could do that with a 2-0 lead." 
</P>
<P>
 The talk about how they would do if Marco van Basten had been healthy and if 
Ruud Gullit hadn't quit the team in a huff has died down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to do it with the players we have," winger Bryan Roy said, "and at 
the moment, it's going very well."

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; IRELAND'S FORGIVING FANS: TO EIRE IS HUMAN; 
LOYALISTS: DESPITE COSTLY GAFFES, SUPPORTERS SAY PLAYERS WILL BE GIVEN HERO'S

<P>
 Both were costly mistakes, almost comparable to a man kicking a shot into his 
own net. 
</P>
<P>
 By definition, Pat (Packie) Bonner and Terry Phelan were the goats of 
Ireland's 2-0 loss Monday to the Netherlands at the Florida Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelan, a defender, had weakly headed a back pass toward his goalkeeper that 
was intercepted by Holland's Marc Overmars, who made a crossing pass to Dennis 
Bergkamp, who scored in the 11th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 41st, Bonner, the Irish goalkeeper, allowed Wim Jonk's shot from 25 
yards to pass through his hands into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Unpardonable. 
</P>
<P>
 For such a sin, Colombia's Andres Escobar's bullet-riddled body lies in a 
freshly dug grave in Medellin. Escobar, who committed an own goal in Colombia's 
loss to the United States, was gunned down outside a restaurant Saturday as 
murderers reportedly shouted "thanks for the auto goal." 
</P>
<P>
 A reporter, unclear as to how soccer passion plays around the world, wondered 
whether the Irish players would fear for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unthinkable," Kieran Walsh, a reporter from the Munster Express, responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh and Irish fans interviewed said Bonner and Phelan will return to a 
hero's welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonner and Phelan return to Dublin today and more than a quarter of a million 
fans are expected to salute the Irish team this week at Dublin's Phoenix Park. 
That would make it the largest Irish gathering since a papal visit in the late 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake: The Irish deplore losing. In pubs, the expletives will flow 
as freely as the Guinness. In papers, game tactics will be second-guessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed," Walsh said as he was filing his daily report. "I thought 
we went down too easily." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, Bonner and Phelan will be exonerated. The Irish live and die 
with their team, but do not kill over it. 
</P>
<P>
 Irish fans wanted to make clear the distinction. "For South American people, 
that's how seriously they take their soccer," Dublin's John Cleary said as 
Irish-green paint dripped down his face. "In Brazil, they jump out of windows 
when they lose. Northern Europeans are a colder type of people. There will be 
harsh words. But Irish fans are very forgiving." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a large group of Irish fans gave their team a supportive send-off as 
the team bus pulled away from the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't use Colombia as a judge," said another Irishman, who did not want 
to be identified. "Colombia has its own rules and laws. Our guys will get a 
hero's welcome home, you watch. We're crazy, but we're crazy about life. We 
like to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer fans around the world continued to be sickened over Escobar's murder. 
Before Sunday's game, two fans held up a banner: 
</P>
<P>
 Andres Escobar  
</P>
<P>
 Colombia will never forget you!  
</P>
<P>
 Stop Coward Killers.  
</P>
<P>
 In acknowledgment, fans from Ireland and Holland struck up the chant, 
"Es-co-bar! Es-co-bar! Es-co-bar!" 
</P>
<P>
 The choruses rang out, over and over, in what could only be described as a 
touching moment of soccer solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "You saw the banner, and you saw the response," John Hand of Dublin said. 
"That poor guy should have never been shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Irish fans, admittedly, had lowered expectations for their team. Colombia was 
touted by many to win the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland was elated to survive its group and reach the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish also have memories. No one had forgotten that it was Bonner, at the 
1990 World Cup in Italy, who made a penalty save that allowed Ireland to defeat 
Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like Packie," Walsh, the journalist, said of the goalkeeper. "We like our 
players. They've done so many good things. We remember the good things as well 
as the bad."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ATHLETICS STAY HOT, DEFEAT YANKEES, 4-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 Steve Ontiveros didn't know what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Ontiveros, pitching for the first time in 10 days after suffering a groin 
injury, combined with four relievers on a four-hitter to lead the Oakland 
Athletics to a 4-0 victory over the Yankees at New York on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't sure what was going to happen since I hadn't pitched in 10 days," 
said Ontiveros, who extended his scoreless innings streak to 24 1/3 by giving 
up only four hits -- all singles -- in 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ontiveros (5-2), who has given up only 10 hits during his scoreless streak and 
won his last four starts, helped the A's win for the ninth time in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 New York has lost four of five games after an eight-game winning streak; the 
A's have won 15 of 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Ontiveros had some trepidation about pitching at Yankee Stadium after a long 
layoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've got that short porch (in right field) and a lot of lefties you're 
facing, anything can happen," said Ontiveros, who retired 11 in a row before 
walking Paul O'Neill in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "My legs felt good until the seventh inning. I got a second wind. I felt real 
good but in the seventh, I threw a bunch of pitches to (Danny) Tartabull and I 
hit the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Troy Neel hit a two-run homer and Mark McGwire added a solo shot as the A's 
got eight hits and four runs against Scott Kamieniecki (5-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 7, Minnesota 1 -- Dennis Martinez won his sixth consecutive decision 
and Candy Maldonado hit a tiebreaking two-run double at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians have won five games in a row and are 24-4 in their last 28 games 
at Jacobs Field. Minnesota has lost four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians outscored the Twins, 32-12, in sweeping a four-game series from 
them for the first time since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez (7-4) improved to 6-0 over 10 starts since his last loss on May 11 at 
New York. He gave up six hits, four for extra bases, and one run on Dave 
Winfield's ninth home run. Winfield also tripled and singled. 
</P>
<P>
 Two walks and Maldonado's double put the Indians ahead to stay, 3-1, in the 
fourth, and they finished Jim Deshaies (4-8) during a four-run seventh that 
included a run-scoring double by Carlos Baerga, run-scoring singles by Alvaro 
Espinoza and Omar Vizquel and a sacrifice fly by Kenny Lofton. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 9, Seattle 3 -- Leo Gomez hit two homers and Chris Hoiles and Mark 
McLemore had one each for the Orioles at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive game in which Hoiles and Gomez hit home runs. 
The Orioles have 13 homers in their last four games and have homered in 19 of 
their last 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Sid Fernandez (5-4), activated off the disabled list before the game, gave up 
three runs and eight hits in five innings. He had not pitched since June 18 
because of a strained rib-cage muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 9, Kansas City 4 -- John Olerud had a two-run double and the Blue 
Jays, held hitless for five innings by Bob Milacki, broke loose for five runs 
in the sixth at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Milacki (0-3) saw only two Blue Jay runners on a hit batsman and a walk 
through five innings. But ninth-place hitter Randy Knorr singled up the middle 
to lead off the sixth and start the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Butler singled after Knorr's hit, and Roberto Alomar bunted the runners 
along. Milacki walked Paul Molitor and Joe Carter to force home the first run. 
</P>
<P>
 Olerud doubled in Butler and Molitor. Mike Huff was walked intentionally and 
Domingo Cedeno had a sacrifice fly. Dick Schofield hit an RBI single, finishing 
Milacki. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Macfarlane homered twice for the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 3, Milwaukee 2 -- Pinch-hitter Norberto Martin doubled home the 
winning run in the ninth inning at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 With two out, Craig Grebeck doubled against Ricky Bones (7-6). Jesse Orosco 
relieved and Martin drove in pinch-runner Ron Karkovice. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 4, Detroit 3 -- Will Clark drew a bases-loaded walk in the bottom of the 
ninth inning at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddibe McDowell singled with one out in the ninth against Mike Gardiner (2-2) 
and went to third on Jeff Frye's double.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 10-HOUR DOUBLEHEADER AT WRIGLEY NO HOLIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fourth of July crowd of 37,167 at Wrigley Field turned out for a holiday 
doubleheader. What the fans got, at least the 1,000 or so who stuck around to 
the end, were 10 hours 10 minutes of baseball and rain delays. 
</P>
<P>
 The first game, won by the Cubs, 4-3, was fairly routine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the second took 7 1/2 hours because of rain delays of 34, 59 and 52 
minutes and six extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante Bichette hit a misplayed two-run double in the top of the 15th inning to 
give the Rockies a 4-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Myers (1-4) walked Nelson Liriano to open the 15th, and two outs later 
Walt Weiss singled off Myers' glove. Bichette then lifted a fly ball to 
right-center and outfielders Sosa and Eddie Zambrano let the ball drop between 
them at the base of the wall as two runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Walton (1-0), the sixth of seven Colorado pitchers, got the victory by 
pitching the 13th and 14th. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Harris got the last three outs for his first save. Myers had to bat for 
himself in the 15th because the Cubs had no position players left. 
</P>
<P>
 The doubleheader, played to make up an April 30 rainout, finally ended when 
Sammy Sosa hit a liner to center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I've ever been through anything like that," Bichette said as 
he sat slumped at his locker. "I had trouble concentrating. I was very tired 
and I believe both teams felt the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 Cub catcher Rick Wilkins said, "It's the longest doubleheader I've ever been 
involved in. We even ran out of food. That's a long day right there." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a particularly long day for Kevin Roberson, a backup outfielder for the 
Cubs. He broke his hand when he punched a clubhouse door during the second game 
after striking out as a pinch-hitter and was put on the 15-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opener, Derrick May's line-drive single brought home the winning run 
with two out in the ninth. The Cubs rallied for two runs in the inning against 
Bruce Ruffin (3-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 13, St. Louis 6 -- Tony Eusebio had a career-high four hits and four 
runs batted in and Andujar Cedeno also drove in four runs for the Astros at St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros had 15 hits, 11 walks and a hit batsman to win for the sixth time 
in eight games. It came a day after they also piled up 15 hits in a 12-6 
victory over the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 They did it both times without Jeff Bagwell, their All-Star first baseman who 
was sidelined because of flu. Collins said Bagwell should play tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 2, San Francisco 1 -- Jim Lindeman's leadoff homer in the 10th inning 
against Rod Beck provided the difference at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 All three runs were scored on solo homers. Ryan Thompson hit his 14th homer 
for the Mets in the second and Barry Bonds connected for his 22nd in the eighth 
-- a towering shot that landed several rows back in the upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds' homer broke up a shutout bid by Met starter Mike Remlinger, a former 
No. 1 draft choice of the Giants. He gave up four hits in eight innings, with 
six strikeouts and three walks, and retired 12 in a row before Bonds' homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 5, Florida 1 -- All-Star Jose Rijo pitched six scoreless innings 
and Reggie Sanders broke the game open with a two-run, eighth-inning homer at 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Deion Sanders went three for four for the Reds, who got all the runs they 
needed in the first against the Marlins' Pat Rapp (4-5). He led off with a 
triple and scored when Hal Morris singled to center for his 57th RBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 10, San Diego 4 -- Light-hitting Todd Pratt hit a three-run 
double and a two-run homer at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Jackson (11-2) allowed a season-high 12 hits in six innings but still 
got the victory and extended his streak of not walking a batter to 21 innings.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; WORRELL BOLSTERS THE ENTIRE BULLPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After some turbulent weeks, the Dodger bullpen has settled down, and pitching 
coach Ron Perranoski credits Todd Worrell's recent success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was mental or not, but like hitters do, everybody got into 
a slump at the same time," Perranoski said."And nobody came up and put a stop 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But lately, Worrell's done that, he's throwing real well, he's stopped all 
that. Now everybody's kind of in a groove." 
</P>
<P>
 Bedfore Monday night's game, the bullpen had given up only one earned run and 
stranded every runner it had inherited during this home stand. 
</P>
<P>
 After his two-inning save on Sunday, Worrell has earned a save in his last 
five opportunities. In his last 12 outings, he is 0-1 with five saves and has 
given up only one earned run in 12 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Perranoski traces the bullpen's comeback to Worrell's confidence-building 
1-2-3 outing in the top of the ninth to hold a one-run lead for Ramon Martinez 
against the Cincinnati Reds on June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Since coming off of the disabled list May 23, Worrell has five saves and given 
up two earned runs in 15 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 With a physically sound Worrell, the younger relievers such as Rudy Seanez, 
Omar Daal and Ismael Valdes have been able to settle into supporting roles, and 
rookie Darren Dreifort could be moved out of the closer spot and back to the 
minors to iron out his control problems, Perranoski said. 
</P>

 The Dodgers finished the first half of their season Sunday with a 43-38 record 
through 81 games -- the same record they had through half a season last year. 
With the San Francisco Giants on their way to a 103-victory season, the Dodgers 
were 11 1/2 games out of first place halfway through 1993. TIM KAWAKAMI

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJOR LEAGUES; STRAWBERRY HOMERS, GOES TWO 
FOR FOUR

 Darryl Strawberry took another step toward returning to the majors Monday 
night, lining a sharp single and a solo homer in his first two at-bats for the 
triple-A Phoenix Firebirds. He struck out and popped up in his other two plate 
appearances before being replaced in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing for the first time since signing with the San Francisco Giants on June 
19, Strawberry, who wore No. 44, batted third and was in right field for the 
Giants' top farm team. It was his first game since April 2, a day before he 
left the Dodgers without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went, 'Yes-s-s-s,' " Strawberry said of his homer. "That's something the 
Giants are looking for, and it's something I expect out of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 On April 4, Strawberry acknowledged that he had a substance-abuse problem. He 
spent four weeks at the Betty Ford Center, negotiated a settlement that 
released him from the Dodgers and later joined the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants have had him on a conditioning program since they signed him. 
Although his schedule for returning to the major leagues hasn't been revealed, 
it is believed he will join the Giants after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Siegle, the Giants' baseball operations vice president, said Strawberry's 
first game was everything the team hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly a home run and a single the first day excites everybody and whets 
everybody's appetite, but Darryl has to make the determination when he is 
ready," Siegle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10,000-seat Peoria Sports Complex near Phoenix was sold out. Strawberry 
signed autographs before and after the game. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 San Diego right-hander Andy Benes met with Padre General Manager Randy Smith 
to iron out their differences over comments attributed to Smith by Baseball 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 In the article, Smith praised Benes as being "a horse and a heck of a 
pitcher," but said that Benes could end up as the team's No. 3 starter in the 
future because of the impressive performances this year by Andy Ashby and 
rookie Joey Hamilton.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; CLUB IS SAID TO BE AT A CRITICAL POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 General Manager Bill Bavasi and assistant Tim Mead, scheduled to join the team 
today for the duration of their trip, will immediately attempt to formulate a 
plan to help the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, 4-1 losers Monday to the Boston Red Sox, have lost 23 of their 
last 34 games. They not only are last in the American League West, but have the 
worst record in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is probably the most critical time of the season," Angel 
President Richard Brown said. "We're by no stretch of the imagination out of 
it, but we'd like to do something. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we have some outstanding young talent, but we'd like to add a veteran 
or two. We have to get a little more punch in the lineup and some pitching. The 
trouble is that most teams are not willing to give up a lot because the season 
may be wiped out after the All-Star game." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bavasi: "I don't have any problems trading kids for a proven veteran, but 
you have to be careful. You try to operate as if there won't be a strike, but 
talking to other people, you don't know whether this is July or September." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Hernandez, Angel pitching coach, left the team to be with his wife, 
Donna, who gave birth by Caesarean section to their second child Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Their son was expected to be born July 8, but Donna began experiencing 
discomfort Sunday and was taken to the hospital. Hernandez took a flight after 
the game Sunday to join her in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy is in intensive care for treatment of a rapid heart beat, but Angel 
Manager Marcel Lachemann said that Hernandez told him Monday morning that the 
baby is expected to be fine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel right fielder Tim Salmon conceded that he genuinely was worried for a 
while that Chili Davis was going to decline his invitation to the All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept telling me he was going to turn it down and send me," Salmon said, 
"but I didn't want that. Sure, I'd love to go to the All-Star game some time in 
my career, but I want to go because I was voted in or selected by the manager, 
not by a technicality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Chili, 'Hey, you're the All-Star from this team. You deserve it. You 
go. I'll have my day." BOB NIGHTENGALE

HOLLYWOOD PARK; BLUES TRAVELLER WINS AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Handicap became a foreign affair at Hollywood Park on Monday when 
an Irish-bred colt won the $218,000 grass race and two horses foaled in France 
were next across the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 Blues Traveller, twice a winner at Golden Gate Fields but winless in three 
tries in Southern California, came from slightly off the pace to score a 
one-length victory, with Gothland finishing second, a half-length in front of 
Johann Quatz. Furiously, the 17-10 favorite, didn't seem to appreciate the hard 
ground and ran fourth in a field of seven, beaten by 2 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 At 150-1, Blues Traveller finished third in last year's Epsom Derby, and two 
months later Gary Tanaka, a London investments manager, bought him for an 
undisclosed price. Blues Traveller ran once more in England, then joined 
trainer Rodney Rash in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Rash, Blues Traveller's biggest victory before Monday was the Rolling 
Green Handicap. In his first start at Hollywood Park, he was third behind Grand 
Flotilla and Bien Bien in the 1 1/4-mile Hollywood Turf Handicap. Chris Antley 
rode Blues Traveller last time, and Monday he became the first American jockey 
to ride him twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a golden trip," Antley said. "We settled in just off Eddie 
Delahoussaye's horse (Silver Wizard, who ran sixth). This race was shorter in 
distance, and the grass was to his liking. My horse held in the stretch when 
those other horses came after us." 
</P>
<P>
 Blues Traveler won for the fourth time in 14 starts, paying $12 as the fourth 
choice. His time for 1 1/8 miles was 1:46 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Gothland, ridden by Corey Nakatani, also finished second to Blues Traveller in 
the Rolling Green and carried high weight of 119 pounds Monday, four more than 
the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he has a (distance) limit, but that's a wonderful horse," said Wally 
Dollase, who trains Gothland. "He's going to get a vacation now, and we're 
going to point him for the Breeders' Cup Mile." 
</P>
<P>
 A more immediate goal for Blues Traveller is the 1 1/4-mile Arlington Million 
on Aug. 28, with the chance that he might run one more race in between. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this horse can handle anything from eight furlongs to a mile and a 
quarter," Rash said. "If he gets the right trip, I think he can run with the 
best grass horses in the country." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Devil His Due won the $350,000 Suburban Handicap at Belmont Park by a 
half-length over Valley Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 Devil His Due, winner of the Brooklyn Handicap last month, carried high weight 
of 124 pounds and was hard-pressed to hold off Valley Crossing, who carried 
only 113. Devil His Due, ridden by Mike Smith, paid $3.60 at Belmont and $4 at 
Hollywood Park, running 1 1/4 miles in 2:02 2/5 and earning $210,000 to 
increase his bankroll to $3.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingdom Found, who went to Belmont because trainer Gary Jones didn't like his 
weight assignment for Saturday's Hollywood Gold Cup, led for a half-mile but 
quit running when Devil His Due passed him. He finished last in the five-horse 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Devil His Due's recent achievements, the 5-year-old was no match for 
Holy Bull, the 3-year-old colt who easily defeated older horses in the 
Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Suburban and the American handicaps were the first and last races in the 
National Best Seven, which hasn't caught on and drew a handle of only $306,593 
Monday. No one picked all seven winners and 15 50-cent tickets on six winners 
were worth $4,586.65 apiece. The other winners were Dinner in Rio (9-1) in the 
Ft. McHenry Handicap at Laurel, Hey Hazel (8-1) in the Molly Pitcher Handicap 
at Monmouth Park, Marastani (7-1) in the Stars and Stripes Handicap at 
Arlington, Country Coy (6-1) in the Americana Handicap at Calder and Empire 
Pool (13-10) in the Independence Handicap at Louisiana Downs. . . . After six 
weeks, the jackpot carry-over pool, which is paid if there's only one 
seven-horse winning ticket, is $92,774. . . . The Daily Racing Form's cover 
price has gone up 15 cents to $3, plus tax.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: APPAREL MAKER RECEIVES PROPOSALS FROM 2 INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cherokee Inc., the debt-heavy Sunland apparel maker, announced it has received 
proposals from two investors that could lead to infusions of cash equity. 
</P>
<P>
 Both proposals require concessions from holders of Cherokee's 11% senior 
subordinated notes due in 1999, but neither would affect trade creditors, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it has hired a financial adviser to evaluate the proposals, 
and holders of the senior subordinated notes have been asked to form an 
informal committee.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: VERITEC BOARD OKS 3 NEW SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chatsworth-based Veritec Inc. said its board has authorized three new series 
of preferred stock in a move designed to help the company restructure its 
finances by exchanging preferred stock for debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had hoped to restructure debt by offering new shares of common 
stock, but Jack E. Dahl, the company's chief financial officer, said Veritec is 
unsure that it can legally offer new common stock.A recent reverse split of 
common stock has created a legal question of whether the number of common 
shares outstanding is already the maximum authorized by shareholders, Dahl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahl said the company may seek to have the number of authorized shares 
increased at its Oct. 22 board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Veritec is developing technology that may replace bar code scanning systems 
commonly used in supermarkets. Bar codes contain data that can be scanned in 
one direction, and Veritec is working to develop a data matrix that can hold 
more data and be scanned in two directions.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: HEMACARE TO REPEAT STUDY OF HIV, AIDS TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks-based HemaCare Corp. said it has agreed after talks with the 
federal Food and Drug Administration to conduct a repeat study involving its 
plasma treatment therapy for HIV and AIDS patients before proceeding to the 
next round of clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the company said the FDA had questioned its virus inactivation 
process for preventing the possible transmission of HIV or hepatitis through 
the treatment.The company's plan involves treating HIV patients with antibodies 
from the sterilized plasma of healthy HIV donors. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the FDA, the company's repeat study, expected to take about a 
month, will involve the addition of larger amounts of the HIV virus to normal 
plasma to reconfirm the ability of the process to inactivate the HIV virus. The 
company considers its Immupath therapy a potential treatment for HIV and AIDS 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 HemaCare, which has suffered financial losses in recent years, said it has 
been conducting trials on Immupath since 1990. The company also said it has 
retained Kemper Securities Inc. to help explore capital sources for funding 
future clinical trials.

HAAS MACHINE TOOL COMPANY TO LEAVE AREA; RELOCATION: FED UP WITH CRIME AND 
GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY, THE PRESIDENT SAYS THE CHATSWORTH FIRM WILL MOVE WITHIN 
TWO YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gene Haas was working late in his Chatsworth office one night in November when 
the window abruptly shattered and a shot zinged over his head. One more reason 
to leave Los Angeles, thought Haas, founder and president of Haas Automation, a 
booming machine tool manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months later, Haas has made up his mind. Haas Automation will leave the 
area within the next two years. The company is searching for a new site to 
lease or purchase. Several states have been discussed, including Oregon, 
Nevada, Kansas and Colorado, while other parts of California have not been 
ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime is just one reason. Haas said he is also fed up with the city 
government, unresponsive officials and a building permit process that he says 
hinders business growth. "If you run into any kind of problem with the city, 
they just say, 'Well, that's the way it is,' " Haas said. "Well, we are 
leaving, and that's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 When Haas goes, the Valley will lose one of its brightest players. Haas has 
more than tripled its sales during the last three years, while many local firms 
were cutting back. The company won't disclose its earnings, saying only that it 
has been profitable since it was founded 11 years ago. But Haas said revenues 
for the first six months of 1994 were $35 million, up 84% from $19 million in 
the same period the year before.  
</P>
<P>
 Haas employs 216 people, up from three in 1983. About a quarter are 
college-educated, including many engineers. Others are machinists or assemblers 
earning $12 an hour or more. Although the company has made no decision about 
whether to offer workers relocation assistance, managers say they expect many 
employees will move with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The company makes high-precision machine tools used for cutting and shaping 
metal. Most Haas machines, which include what the industry calls vertical 
machining centers, cost between $50,000 and $100,000, placing them at the low 
end of the market for manufacturing machine tools. Haas' customers use the 
devices to make metal pieces for everything from prosthetic limb joints to golf 
clubs, wing spars and braces for teen-agers' teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Haas General Manager Dennis Dupuis estimates that 5,000 machine tools of the 
type Haas makes are sold in the United States each year. Haas contends it has 
cornered a large portion of this market and will sell 1,400 machines this year. 
Coincidentally, Haas' toughest competitor, Fadal Engineering Co. Inc., is 
next-door. Fadal is the larger of the two, claiming sales of $135 million in 
1993, up 23% from $110 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Haas' success represents a shift since the mid-1980s, when American companies 
were crowded out of the market by low-priced Japanese and German imports, said 
Ian Rogers, a partner and portfolio manager at Strong Funds in Milwaukee, a 
fund management firm. A weak yen relative to the dollar helped give imports an 
edge. "One (American) company after another was going into bankruptcy," Rogers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Things changed after the Reagan Administration took steps to restrict imports 
of machine tools, and the dollar began to fall, thus making Japanese goods more 
expensive here. By 1989, when Haas introduced its machining centers, there was 
plenty of demand for low-priced machines, and few competitors, said Dupuis. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as Haas and Fadal are also benefiting from an economic recovery 
in manufacturing, and from a trend away from mass production, said Alexander 
Blanton, an analyst and limited partner at Ingalls & Snyder in New York City. 
"The trend is toward much more flexibility," Blanton said.  
</P>
<P>
 Haas' machines can be programmed to make small quantities of different parts 
automatically. They make it possible to fill a growing demand for custom-made 
products at low cost because they require little manual tinkering, Blanton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Demand for Haas products is so great that the company has a two-month backlog 
and desperately needs more space to increase production, said Dupuis. The 
company has filled almost all of the 155,000 square feet it now leases, and 
needs another 100,000 square feet to keep growing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Haas, 41, a graduate of Cal State Northridge, said at first he considered 
finding a new location in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was sour about the prospect given his past experience with the city's 
building-permit process. Last year, the company built a 16,000-square-foot 
addition on its leased property in Chatsworth. At first, officials with the 
city's Building and Safety Department said it would take six months to a year 
to get a building permit, Haas said. Haas sought the help of Councilman Hal 
Bernson and got the permit in about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, he contends, constructing the building was fraught with unnecessary 
hassles: Inspectors didn't show up on time, or left work early without 
returning calls. City staffers kept him waiting while they took breaks, and 
ignored the company's pleas for haste, he said. And unexpected fees kept 
accumulating. Haas managers were particularly galled by a 1% tax for art and 
culture projects. "It leaves you with a very cold feeling," said Haas. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that the company's frustration with high state taxes and crime. Last 
November's shooting incident -- in which a pellet gun was fired into Haas' 
office window from a passing car -- is just one example. Visitors to Haas must 
now don special badges since someone brazenly drove away with a forklift in 
daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 Since word of Haas' proposed move has gotten out, the company has been 
inundated with offers of free or dollar-an-acre land, use of public buildings, 
plus industrial bonds and other enticements from job-hungry locales all over 
the country, Dupuis said. Organizations in Texas, Kansas, and even as far away 
as Scotland bombard the company with recruitment materials. "There is a box in 
my office absolutely overflowing with information from economic development 
councils," said Dupuis. "I never dreamed. . . they would be so aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say that Haas' decision to move is premature. The city 
acknowledges problems with its building-permit process, and has promised Haas 
it will strive for speedy processing of permits in future, said Steven 
MacDonald, director of business assistance for Los Angeles Mayor Richard 
Riordan. But, he said, "Can L.A. step up to the plate and give out 15 acres of 
free land? That's not likely." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city is bound by charter restrictions from offering many of the incentives 
that Haas said it has been offered elsewhere, MacDonald said. And the 
enticements Los Angeles can offer -- such as industrial bonds and tax breaks 
for relocating in enterprise zones -- are not well-marketed, he said. A 
committee has been appointed by the mayor to streamline the permit bureaucracy 
and improve business retention; its report, due out within two months, is 
expected to address many of the concerns Haas has voiced. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city is working with businesses individually to help them stay 
in Los Angeles, MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 All this, however, is dismissed by Haas as too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Enterprise zones aren't appealing, said Dupuis. "We want to move someplace 
safe. Someplace where the skies are less smoggy, and the people are friendly."

REGIONAL STOCK PRICES FALL 4.3% IN 2ND QUARTER; INVESTING: PERFORMANCE 
CONTINUES DOWNTREND AND MIRRORS LARGER MARKETS. HOWEVER, THREE S&LS AND TWO 
OIL-RELATED FIRMS SHOWED STRENGTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The regional stock market in the second quarter duplicated its first-quarter 
performance almost to the letter, as three in five area stocks declined in 
value and prices overall fell 4.3% during the three months ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Three savings and loans, as well as two petroleum-related companies, were 
among the strongest local performers, while a giant-screen theater maker and an 
apparel producer were among the hardest hit. The area's stocks include 102 
mostly smaller companies in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys and 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend among local stocks paralleled the general movement of larger 
markets, as the NASDAQ Composite, an index of about 4,000 companies comparable 
in size to many local firms, slipped 5%. The American Stock Exchange index was 
down 4%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue-chip stocks dropped 
less than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 H&H Oil Tool Inc., a Santa Paula-based supplier of oil drilling equipment, was 
the biggest gainer in the quarter among local companies, as its stock price 
surged in response to the company's agreement to merge with another equipment 
supplier. H&H stock more than doubled from $4.50 at the beginning of the 
quarter to $9.63 on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock had languished for years in the $5 range as the company's profits 
were hurt by a slump in oil production and strict California environmental 
regulations. But H&H Chief Executive Henry Rushing said the stock soared when, 
in late May, the company agreed to merge with oil equipment supplier 
Weatherford International Inc., based in Houston. According to the agreement, 
Rushing said, each share of H&H will be converted to .789 share of Weatherford, 
giving the deal a total value of $34.9 million based on Weatherford's closing 
price of $13 on Friday. Weatherford expects revenue of $400 million in 1994, 
Rushing said, while H&H expects $27 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard-based Benton Oil & Gas also posted strong gains, as its price climbed 
from $5.63 to $7.25, a 29% increase. The energy company has curtailed its 
domestic oil activities, partly because of low oil prices, and has announced 
plans to drill four to six deep natural gas wells in the Gulf Coast region of 
Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An S&L and a bank holding company represented two of the top five local 
performers. The price of Glendale Federal Bank's stock rose 91%, from $5.50 to 
$10.50. Glendale was reportedly close to being seized by federal regulators 
about a year ago because it was significantly undercapitalized. But in the 
latest quarter the stock price rebounded as investors reacted to the thrift's 
sale last month, at book value or better, of $226 million in bad real estate 
and commercial loans.  
</P>
<P>
 "The sale didn't require us to take a hit to earnings that a lot of other 
institutions have had to do," said Jeff Misakian, director of investor 
relations for Glendale Federal. During the latest quarter, Glendale also 
announced the sale of 60 of its S&L branches in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock of Ventura County National Bancorp, an Oxnard-based multibank 
holding company, experienced a similar surge, as the price of a share rose 57%, 
from $2 to $3.13. Other S&Ls among the top performers were Great Western 
Financial Corp. of Chatsworth, whose stock rose 14% to $18.38, and Citadel 
Holding Corp. of Glendale, whose stock edged up from $5.50 to $6. The solid 
performance of the S&Ls contrasted starkly with the results of the previous 
quarter, when thrifts fared poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 102 local stocks, 64 posted declines, two more than during the previous 
quarter, while 36 showed gains. Two were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest loser among local companies was Iwerks Entertainment Inc., a 
Burbank-based supplier of special-format movie theaters and virtual-reality 
attractions. The company's stock fell from $21.25 a share to $6.63 during the 
recent quarter, a 69% decline partly attributed to the company's announcement 
late last month that it would post a loss for its fiscal fourth quarter ended 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The expected loss was attributed to development costs of Iwerks' Cinetropolis 
complexes, which combine large screens and motion-simulation under one roof 
with virtual-reality rides, restaurants and shops. The company also suffered 
higher than expected installation costs for its new giant-screen theater at 
Zion National Park in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company had been much more optimistic about how quickly some of these 
things were going to come on," said Gene Heller of the Westwood-based firm 
Silverman Heller Associates, which manages Iwerks' investor relations. "The 
feeling (among investors) was the company would be profitable sooner than it 
has been," Heller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherokee Inc., the troubled Sunland-based maker of clothing and shoes, was 
also among the worst performers. Cherokee's stock price fell 62% from $3 to 
$1.13, about a year after the company emerged from bankruptcy reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Elles, a 12-year veteran of Lee Apparel, was named president of Cherokee 
in September, and he immediately embarked on an effort to streamline the 
company's apparel line. This summer, the debt-heavy company jettisoned the 
dressy outfits and combination wear that were once part of its clothing array. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the company has focused on the products at the core of its market: 
jeans, casual pants and shirts for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Elles hired a number of executives from Lee to manage Cherokee's sales 
operations, and also recruited designers from other fashion makers including 
Liz Claiborne. 
</P>
<P>
 But Elles' moves apparently haven't translated so far into investor confidence 
in Cherokee's ability to succeed in a fiercely competitive industry. 10 Biggest

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: ORDERS INCREASE FOR MAKER OF CAST ALUMINUM WHEELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Industries International Inc., a Van Nuys maker of cast aluminum 
wheels, said General Motors Corp. has increased orders of its aluminum wheels 
for pickups by about 20% due to climbing sales of GM's light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior projected that the additional orders will boost its revenues by about 
$10 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it will begin making the additional wheels in August and 
continue supplying them for the life of the product. Superior reported revenue 
of $393 million for the year ending Dec. 31.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: CHAD THERAPEUTICS TO BUY BACK SHARES OF STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chad Therapeutics Inc., a Chatsworth maker of portable oxygen and 
oxygen-saving systems for lung patients, said it has authorized the repurchase 
of up to 100,000 shares of its common stock per year in private transactions. 
</P>

lighter than expected. Chad said it plans to buy back shares in blocks of no 
less than 10,000 at prices no greater than the fair value of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Therapeutics posted record earnings of $564,577 for the latest fiscal 
quarter that ended March 31, up 77% from $318,893 a year earlier. The results

million in cash.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: RENAMED ACT NETWORKS TO RELOCATE IN CAMARILLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Advanced Compression Technology Inc., which manufactures networking products, 
announced that it has changed its name to ACT Networks Inc. and plans later 
this month to relocate to new headquarters in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, founded in 1987 as a manufacturer of voice compression products, 
said the name change will highlight its emerging role in developing networking 
products.The company said its sales doubled in the past fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced Compression had been located in Simi Valley, but its leased facility 
there suffered a collapsed roof in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake and has 
not been repaired, said Melvin Flowers, the company's vice president and chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The company moved to temporary space in Camarillo after the quake, Flowers 
said. By mid-month, it plans to move to a larger 50,000-square-foot facility in 
Camarillo's Mission Oaks Business Park.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: INSURERS' CREDIT SLIDE APPEARS TO HAVE STOPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The credit ratings of two earthquake-rocked subsidiaries of Woodland 
Hills-based 20th Century Industries -- 20th Century Insurance Co. and 21st 
Century Casualty Co. -- have stopped their downward slide, at least for now, 
according to Standard & Poor's Corp., the New York rating firm. 
</P>
<P>
 S&P has given a B claims-paying ability rating to 20th Century Insurance Co. 
and 21st Century Casualty Co., and a CCC credit assessment rating to 20th 
Century Industries. These ratings are likely to hold for now because S&P has 
removed the company from negative Creditwatch status, which means that 20th 
Century Industries' ratings are no longer being considered for further 
downgrading. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, the company's claims-paying 
ability rating was AA, and its credit assessment rating was A+. After the 
quake, 20th Century Industries' surplus was hit hard by $685 million in 
expenses and quake claims, and the company's rating took a dive. Last month, 
the company announced it was going to stop selling earthquake insurance 
policies to homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was able to secure a $175 million bank credit line recently, a 
factor which helped improve its rating status.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: SOLIGEN TECHNOLOGIES REPORTS 4TH-QUARTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soligen Technologies Inc., a Northridge-based producer of systems for the 
casting and tooling of metal parts, reported a net loss of $604,447 for its 
fiscal fourth quarter that ended March 31, compared with a $49,860 net loss the 
company reported for the same quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue for the recent quarter was $87,251, down 85% from the $600,020 in 
revenue reported for the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The company suffered a net loss of $1.97 million on revenue of $184,089 for 
the fiscal year that ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the company reported a $660,303 net loss on revenue of $601,183. 
</P>
<P>
 The losses have mounted while the company has worked to develop its metal 
casting system, which the company says will dramatically reduce the time 
ordinarily required to produce and tool metal parts for automobiles and other 
uses. 
</P>
<P>
 "During (our) first year as a public company, we have achieved our objective 
of bringing our technology to the commercialization phase," said Yehoram Uziel, 
chief executive of Soligen. "We are on target with our strategic plan and are 
quickly moving to bring our technology to market." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the company sold its first casting machine to Ashland Chemical, a 
division of Ashland Oil. Soligen's machine is based on technology patented by 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: PERCEPTRONICS POSTS PROFIT ON LOWER REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perceptronics Inc., a Woodland Hills-based developer of computer-generated 
simulators for military and commercial training, reported net income of $1.36 
million for its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31, marking a turnaround from 
the same quarter a year ago, when the company posted a net loss of $4.67 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's revenue for the recent quarter totaled $1.78 million, compared 
to revenue of $1.92 million for the same quarter a year ago.For the fiscal year 
ended March 31, Perceptronics reported net income of $1.53 million on revenue 
of $5.81 million. A year earlier, the company suffered a net loss of $9.52 
million on revenue of $11.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue for fiscal year 1994 declined partly because of defense spending 
cutbacks, the company said. However, it attributed its profit turnaround for 
the year to the retirement of $4 million of long-term debt and preferred 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Perceptronics also announced that it is a member of a consortium of industrial 
and academic organizations proposing to the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology a virtual reality system that could be used to train workers for 
operations in hazardous environments. Other members of the consortium include 
Caterpillar Corp. and Silicon Graphics Inc.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: BLACKSMITH SHOP SHIFTS ITS FOCUS OVER 106 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of Ventura County's oldest -- and smallest -- businesses, the 106-year-old 
Norman Blacksmith Shop, provides a living history of the county's people and 
their economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Now located on Dawson Drive in Camarillo, the shop was established in Ventura 
in 1888 by Arthur Norman, great-grandfather of the present owner, John Nuckols. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, the shop's main activity was shoeing horses and fixing 
broken wagon wheels. That work has been abandoned, but through the decades, 
Norman Blacksmith has moved into repairing farm equipment, creating decorative 
ironwork and, most recently, producing security bars for windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuckols, 52, isn't sure when the family-owned company quit repairing wagon 
wheels. He says the firm got out of shoeing horses as demand waned in the early 
1930s. "Now, the farm equipment work is slowing down; agriculture's getting 
smaller," he reported. He celebrated his 25th year with the company Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, Nuckols needed four employees to keep up with orders from 
farmers and custom home builders who wanted fancy iron railings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recent recession, however, he was down to a one-man operation. Now, 
he's taken on a part-time assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The farmers don't send us as much stuff to repair as they used to, but our 
security-bar business is picking up. I guess it's a sign of the times."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: EXXON TO ELIMINATE 45 JOBS; UNOCAL MAY SELL OIL, GAS 
SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least 45 Ventura County oil industry jobs will be lost and the fate of more 
than 200 others is uncertain as a result of actions either planned or under 
consideration by two major petroleum firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The news comes as a blow to the county's stagnant oil industry, which has seen 
its payrolls reduced by more than one-third in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon Co. USA, the domestic arm of Exxon Corp., will eliminate 45 of the 125 
positions at its production control offices in Thousand Oaks by Sept. 1. The 
move is part of a consolidation that will eliminate about 430 jobs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the planners, engineers and others affected by the consolidation will 
be offered a chance to transfer to Exxon USA headquarters in Houston, company 
spokesman Les Rogers reports. Others will be offered early retirement, he said, 
"but ultimately, I'm afraid, some will have to be laid off." 
</P>
<P>
 The move will leave 80 people working in the Exxon USA offices on Hillcrest 
Drive. The unit mostly administers offshore oil and gas production in the Santa 
Barbara Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other development, Unocal Corp., which was founded in Santa Paula in 
1890, said it has received three unsolicited offers for its oil and gas 
production properties in Ventura County and throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 The company hasn't decided whether it will accept the offers and doesn't know 
whether any of its Ventura County employees would be affected, spokeswoman 
Janet McClintock says. Unocal, now based in Los Angeles, employs 245 people in 
Ventura County and 136 in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the potential buyers would need production personnel in Ventura 
County," McClintock said. "We assume it would be in their interest to continue 
with all or most of the Unocal people who are already there." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its division office on Knoll Drive in Ventura, Unocal operates 
seven offshore platforms in the region and has producing fields in the east 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Production properties in Ventura County and in California in general are 
mostly mature," McClintock said. "If the properties are sold, we might use the 
proceeds for exploration and production in southeast Asia and the Gulf of 
Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 Oil industry employment in Ventura County has been lackluster in recent years. 
It fell from 3,300 in 1985 to 2,200 in 1990 and 2,100 in 1993, according to the 
state Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Exxon, such major producers as Texaco, Chevron, Mobil and Shell 
have either shut down or pared their activities in the county since the early 
1980s.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: COUNTY POSTS 13% DROP IN FORECLOSURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County had the best record in Southern California in the first five 
months of the year in terms of reduced foreclosure proceedings against 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 From January through May, lenders started proceedings against owners of 1,182 
homes in the county -- nearly 13% fewer than in the same period in 1993, 
according to Dataquick Information Systems.By contrast, filings fell less than 
1% in Los Angeles County and increased more than 17% in San Bernardino County 
in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, only two California counties showed steeper drops than Ventura County 
in foreclosure actions -- Madera, in the San Joaquin Valley, with 15%, and 
Monterey, with 27%. 
</P>
<P>
 Stabilizing home prices are helping reduce foreclosures, Dataquick suggests. 
"Foreclosures become more of a problem when the value of a property decreases 
to where the homeowner owes more on the home than its market value," said 
Donald L. Cohn, the reporting service's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 In related news, the Simi Valley-Moorpark Assn. of Realtors says resales of 
single-family homes in May rose 2% from the previous month and 7% from May, 
1993. The average selling price in May was $212,000, down 1% from the previous 
month and down 3% from May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 However, condominium resales in May were off 26% from April and 39% from May, 
1993. Average condominium prices in May fell 8% from April and 19% from May, 
1993, to $119,600.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: TELEDYNE RECEIVES ORDER FOR FRIEND-OR-FOE SYSTEM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Teledyne Electronics in Newbury Park has received a $63.8-million order from 
the Air Force for devices that help aircraft pilots identify targets as friend 
or foe. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract calls for the Ventura County unit of Los Angeles-based Teledyne 
Inc. to deliver 200 of the systems by June, 1998. The systems will be installed 
in F-16 jet fighters that will be delivered to the air forces of South Korea 
and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 A Teledyne spokesman said the order is the first production go-ahead for the 
AN / APX-109 Advanced Identification Friend or Foe system. He said the order 
should stabilize the payroll at Teledyne Electronics, but that he didn't know 
whether new hirings would result.

IT CAN ONLY GO UP FROM HERE; THE ANTELOPE VALLEY'S DEPRESSED HOUSING MARKET MAY 
BE RIPE FOR A REBOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a five-year fall from its dizzying heights of the late 1980s, the 
Antelope Valley's housing market still holds an abundance of misery for 
property owners. But signs are emerging that the worst days may have passed or 
soon will. 
</P>
<P>
 Because home values have fallen nearly 30% on average since the market peaked 
in 1989 and 1990, thousands of families who bought in the high desert area then 
are stuck with houses that are worth less than their mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 That has made moves difficult, even when prompted by job losses, transfers or 
divorces. Many owners couldn't pay their mortgages. Some just walked away from 
properties. The result has been record numbers of foreclosures and abandoned 
homes, creating blight and further depressing the housing market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget the recession. It's been a depression," said Richard Cook, a real 
estate agent at Troth Realtors in Lancaster. To cope, Walt Troth, one of the 
owners, said his office has shifted to specializing in re-marketing foreclosed 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
 In an indication of how much the market has deteriorated, foreclosures in the 
Antelope Valley so far this year are outnumbering sales reported by local 
realtors. Total annual sales fell by more than half from 1989 to 1993. In 
addition to the loss in value for current homeowners, median sales prices for 
new houses have fallen by nearly 23% since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be some light on the horizon, however. Like elsewhere, Antelope 
Valley housing prices have stabilized this spring after a long decline. And 
local realtor boards reported their highest number of resales in more than 
three years this spring, although many were of foreclosed properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of the Antelope Valley market also has restored 
affordability--the factor that made housing in the area such a hot commodity in 
the late 1980s, when buyers who were priced out of other communities flocked to 
Lancaster and Palmdale. As a result, experts say, newcomers to the region can 
expect the best housing prices in years in a market that most predict will 
slowly rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's cold comfort for those who bought homes when the market was at its 
peak, however. While they may not lose any more value on their houses, they 
shouldn't expect to recoup their severe declines anytime soon, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Feller knows that story all too well. The 32-year-old communications 
company manager and his wife bought a new four-bedroom, two-bath home in the 
upscale Quartz Hill area for $210,000 in February, 1990, when the market was 
near its peak.  
</P>
<P>
 Payments were manageable at first, but then a growing family and financial 
problems necessitated lowering the payments or moving. Feller spent months 
trying to refinance his loan at a lower interest rate, but the lender refused, 
saying the $180,000 he owed far exceeded the then-current value of the house.

 Today, Feller has a potential buyer willing to pay $130,000 for the house, 38% 
less than Feller's purchase price. But the lender has yet to approve the sale. 
Such sales are called short pays, because the lender is not fully repaid. Some 
lenders permit them to avoid foreclosures, others do not. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime Feller waits, knowing regardless of what happens he probably 
has lost his home and $20,000 down payment. "We got screwed. This is our worst 
concern," Feller said of the dramatic decline in local real estate values. Like 
other hard-hit residents, Feller said he sees no sign of a recovery coming 
despite the experts' predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 His situation is not unique. His builder, Calabasas-based Griffin Homes, went 
bankrupt and was liquidated last August. A neighbor, despite getting a lower 
purchase price than Feller, went through foreclosure when the market collapsed. 
The family that bought Feller's former home in Lancaster lost it. And a friend 
involved in a divorce may face the same prospect, Feller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Antelope Valley, a 1,300-square-mile area of north Los Angeles 
County with nearly 300,000 residents, home resales this spring suffered a 28% 
loss in price for the same properties in 1990, according to TRW REDI Property 
Data, a company that tracks real estate. (A separate analysis by Dataquick 
Information Systems showed smaller median price declines, but did not 
necessarily compare the same properties.) 
</P>
<P>
 Median prices for new homes fell from $167,950 in late 1989 to $129,990 this 
spring, a smaller 23% drop, according to the Meyers Group, another tracking 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 For most Antelope Valley residents who made 5% to 20% down payments on houses 
in the late 1980s, the declines have been more than enough to wipe out their 
equity and leave them "upside down" in their homes. That's the real estate term 
for owing more than your property is worth. 
</P>
<P>
 If owners can stay put and continue to make payments, they suffer no direct 
loss and can wait for values to return, real estate experts said. But 
upside-down owners who need to move, sell or refinance face trouble, and that 
has led to the foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the first five months of this year, the number of Antelope Valley 
foreclosures--1,297, most of them houses--exceeded the 1,122 home sales 
reported by the area's three boards of realtors. Averaging 259 a month, the 
foreclosures are on a pace to exceed last year's tally. 
</P>
<P>
 Total Antelope Valley foreclosures increased tenfold from 250 in 1989 to 2,799 
last year, according to TRW REDI Property Data. Those made up nearly 12% of the 
countywide tally of 23,863 foreclosures for 1993, even though the valley only 
has about 3% of the county's population. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, neighborhoods across the valley are dotted with abandoned homes, 
marked by unwatered landscaping that has turned a parched brown. Some homes 
have been vandalized and left open. Others are illegally rented to unsuspecting 
tenants by con artists, local realtors said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In one east Palmdale neighborhood, a vacant 4-year-old house has been decaying 
for nearly two years while a foreclosure process goes on. Vandals smashed doors 
and windows, stripped the house of fixtures, spray-painted graffiti on walls 
and hauled a decrepit sofa bed into the house. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is a dramatic change from the mid-to-late 1980s, when builders in 
the Antelope Valley couldn't put up houses fast enough to meet buyer demand. 
The heady times began to fade in late 1989, when big price hikes made homes 
less affordable, the nationwide recession hit, the move-up market died and a 
housing glut ensued. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley housing sales peaked in 1989, when 10,368 units were sold. 
Compare that to the 4,850 units sold last year, according to TRW REDI Property 
Data. The number of new home tracts on the market dropped from 161 in late 1990 
to 102 this spring. And builders have spent most of the past several years 
slowly unloading their inventory of unsold houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, inventories are down, prices are at pre-1988 levels and surviving 
builders are cautious. Real estate experts said those factors and others make 
the Antelope Valley market ripe for a rebound. But they warn that unloading the 
glut of foreclosed houses may delay that for some months. 
</P>
<P>
 John Karevoll, a financial editor at Dataquick Information Systems, said he 
expects areas such as the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, closer to 
urban centers, to recover more quickly. He called the Antelope Valley a 
"spillover" market for those who can't afford to live closer to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some encouraging signs, however. Resale purchases in the Antelope 
Valley from March to May totaled about 750 houses, the best quarter in more 
than three years. Median resale prices reported by local realtor boards also 
held steady from February through May at $103,500 after a long decline.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, total Antelope Valley resales in 1993 surpassed new home sales there 
for the first time in some years, records show. New home sales in the region 
totaled 583 from March through May, down 7% from the same period in 1993 and 
down 22% for the same period in 1992, the Meyers Group reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone has lost out, meanwhile. Neri Garcia, 37, recalled looking at new 
Palmdale houses that he couldn't afford in the late 1980s. So Garcia, his wife 
and three children, who lived in rented property in Los Angeles, waited until 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the moving company driver returned to his favorite east Palmdale tract 
and bought the same model he had wanted from the original owner for $112,000, 
about $48,000 less than its original price. Garcia said he likes his quiet 
cul-de-sac, believes his family is safer and thinks the local schools are 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 Among home builders, the state's largest, Kaufman & Broad Home Corp., has won 
the same leading rank in the Antelope Valley in recent years by more than 
doubling its local market share to 25%. As smaller developers failed, the 
well-capitalized giant has been buying up their graded lots at deep discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Mezger, president of the company's Antelope Valley division, said his 
operation sold a record 614 houses in the past fiscal year. Mezger said he 
expects to exceed that number this year, in part with the company's trademark 
focus on catering to entry-level buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Bob Bray of the Meyers Group said the entry market represents the high 
desert's future. "This remains the only outlet of affordable new housing in L. 
A. County. And that bodes well for the Antelope Valley. It's still tough to get 
a new house for $130,000 anywhere else." Antelope Valley Housing Slump 
</P>
<P>
 A spectacular run-up in the Antelope Valley real estate market through the 
mid-to-late 1980s has been followed by an equally dramatic decline during the 
past five years. Most experts say the market now has hit bottom or is close to 
it, and is poised for a slow recovery despite continuing foreclosures. MEDIAN

FIXATIONS: . . . AND BINGO IS HER GAME-O!; NEARLY EVERY THURSDAY FOR THE PAST 
THREE YEARS, MARY MANDILE OF YORBA LINDA HAS GOTTEN HER HAIR DONE AND JOINED 
FRIENDS AT THE POPE JOHN PAUL II CENTER. TURNING 100 WON'T CHANGE THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe this is how they envision heaven, these 150 or so people playing bingo 
Thursday night at Pope John Paul II church.  
</P>
<P>
 In a hall separated by a sliding partition from the worship area (where the 
Masses are held in English and Polish), TVs are mounted on the walls, showing 
the latest bingo ball to emerge from a pneumatic chute. Curtains of the same 
orange and brown print fabric that surround the windows are pulled back to 
reveal an electronic bingo scoreboard. From a poster, a Pope smiles down 
beneficently on the players. On another wall are playful cartoons, including 
one of the devil titled "Bingo Caller." 
</P>
<P>
 The actual bingo caller sits on a small platform where five small American 
flags stand, breeze-less in front of a special desk into which is built the bin 
where the numbered balls are kept percolating by jets of air. 
</P>
<P>
 In a smooth, level voice that sounds like it could continue for eternity, the 
announcer reads the numbers over a small, warmly distorted sound system, 
"I-twenty-fo-were, that's I-two-fo-were. . . O-seventy, O-seven-zer-ooo. . . 
N-thirty-eight, N-three-eight. . . G-fifty-five, that's G-fi-yive-fi-yive. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 All is placid but for that voice, except for the soft sound of daubers -- big 
high-lighting pens -- marking the numbers off on the bingo cards, as they are 
called. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the seeming calm, there is an underlying tension so thick you could 
gum through it without dentures. And when there is a cry of "Bingo!" it breaks 
the calm like a pistol shot, followed by a near pandemonium of everyone talking 
at once, most exclaiming how close they'd come to winning. 
</P>
<P>
 If this isn't heaven, it's close enough for Mary Mandile. 
</P>
<P>
 She sits at a table in the middle of the hall, with twinkling eyes and one of 
the most simple, blissful smiles you'd ever hope to see. She turns 100 this 
Sunday, and for the past three years, since her daughters introduced her to the 
game at Pope John Paul II, she's scarcely missed a week.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good," she says, with the certitude of a James Brown. "I feel happy 
when I'm playing bingo. When I win, I'm happy. When I don't, I keep calm and 
cool." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say she doesn't get caught up in the game. When she wins she 
calls out "Bingo!" with the best of them and waves her arms in the air.  
</P>
<P>
 She's become so enamored of gambling, said her daughter Rose Forte, that 
"she'll spend 12 or 14 hours at the slot machines in Las Vegas. Once we were in 
tears we were so hungry, and she wouldn't stop. Finally we got a security guard 
to go tell her they were closing the casino down. That's the only way we got 
her out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't disturb these people when they're playing. They're die-hards," said 
Jim Hanson, 68, the bingo manager at the church. He pointed out the Kewpie 
dolls, stuffed animals and other good luck charms players bring each week. He 
doesn't especially enjoy the game himself, though he does admit to a bit of 
gambling: 
</P>
<P>
 "In (Mandile's) first year here, when she was turning 97, I told her, 'If you 
get here on your 100th birthday, I'll give you a thousand bucks.' I was 
gambling, and she won and I lost," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 During the bingo this Thursday night he's providing cake and ice cream to 
celebrate her birthday. The bingo event -- which raises $50,000 a year for 
Orange County children's charities through the Knights of Columbus -- can't 
just give Mandile the $1,000, so Hanson says they're having a special raffle 
where no one will be surprised if she wins.  
</P>
<P>
 To Hanson, it isn't just Mandile's age that makes her special. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that she's always so damn happy," he said. "She just sits there happy, 
waiting for that bingo. She's just the way you wish you could be when you get 
older. I could walk in this room and show you a lot of grouches that are only 
65 or 75. She puts so many people to shame. She's 100 and happy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mandile was a housekeeper most of her life, starting when she was orphaned at 
age 12. Her mother died of influenza, followed two years later by her father, 
who, family members relate, died of a broken heart. Mandile quit the eighth 
grade to help a grandmother raise her four siblings. Later she was busy with 
five children of her own. Her husband died in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wasn't the sort who went out and did things. She was always home for us," 
said daughter Alberta DiLorenzo. "She worked hard all her life, but not in the 
outside world. She was a homebody who was always there for us five children, 
and that was that. She's been getting out more in the last three years with the 
bingo than she has all her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandile lives with daughter Forte in Yorba Linda. DiLorenzo lives in 
Placentia, visits often and takes her mother to the beauty parlor every 
Thursday to prepare for her big night out. Forte maintains: "I think its right 
that the elderly should be with you at home as long as possible. I hope the day 
never comes that we have to put her in a home." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandile likes watching musicals, Lawrence Welk reruns and "Wheel of Fortune" 
on TV. Usually, she said, "I sit by my window. My neighbors go by, and I wave 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
 As a hobby Mandile pastes photo albums full of photos of current events she 
clips from newspapers. Of the century she's seen pass she said, "To a certain 
extent I think the changes have been for the better." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all of them. Emphatic, she said. "The children don't listen to the 
mothers! Years ago they used to listen to the mother. Today they don't. They 
just go. Now the children are on their own. The world has changed today. It 
ain't what it used to be. Everything is so changeable." 
</P>
<P>
 When Mandile sings songs of the war era, they aren't about the Gulf, Vietnam, 
Korea or even World War II. Rather, they are from the first global exchange, 
tunes like "Over There," and a bit of poetry she likes to recite: 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser Bill went up the hill,  
</P>
<P>
 Was on his way to France,  
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser Bill came down the hill,  
</P>
<P>
 With bullets in his pants.  
</P>
<P>
 The bingo hall is like family to her now. She sits at the same table every 
week, with her daughters and new friends. The kitchen offers spaghetti for $1. 
Coffee and popcorn are free. Mandile usually spends $20 to play, and sometimes 
wins $250, which comes in handy when it's the grandchildren's birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Most weeks there are about 175 people there, some 50 of them in a separate 
hall for smokers, connected by the TVs and speakers. Sometimes, Hanson says, he 
playfully pits the smokers against the nonsmokers, carrying a prize-laden fish 
bowl swirling with smoke into the smoke-free room. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a regular crowd. Sometimes they hear of a member dying, and one or two 
people have had medical problems while playing, but nothing serious. "It would 
be damn depressing if they were dropping like flies," notes Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
 He says bingo is one of the things that keeps his aging crowd motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody enjoys themselves here, and part of that is because of Mary. 
Everybody knows who the little old lady is now, and they all greet her and take 
care of her." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandile concurs, saying, "Oh yes, bingo helps me a lot. You meet a lot of 
friends and win money too!"

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; REPORTERS REQUIRED TO LIE, AUTHOR ARGUES; NEWS AND 
THE CULTURE OF LYING BY PAUL H. WEAVER ; FREE PRESS $22.95, 243 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEX RAKSIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the day in 1883 before Joseph Pulitzer took over the New York World, the 
paper's gray, forbiddingly dense front page contained a note dryly stating that 
10 city groups would soon commemorate the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge. When 
the bridge opened two weeks later, a picture of its expansive deck and rolling 
beams soared dramatically across the World's redesigned Page 1, inviting 
readers into a three-column story about how the bridge's engineers triumphed 
over tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 These two pages have long been compared to illustrate the way Pulitzer 
breathed life into a stodgy, spiritless institution, thereby setting the model 
that most journalists follow to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this acrimoniously titled book, journalist and scholar Paul Weaver 
argues that the Pulitzerian framework -- by insisting that news be defined as a 
daily drama wherein leaders, caricatured as good or evil, struggle to deal with 
unprecedented social and political crises -- has done nothing less than require 
reporters to lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing examples from the '80s, Weaver shows how journalists -- by recording 
politicians' self-conscious, symbolic responses to fleeting crises rather than 
investigating the institutional and structural roots of the American malaise -- 
managed to miss most of that decade's major news stories. 
</P>
<P>
 We heard tough congressional rhetoric about "tackling the deficit," for 
example, but few reports examined how the deficit was in fact "exploding to 
meltdown proportions." We read about American executives' devout faith in 
private enterprise, free markets and limited government, but not about how 
those executives broke that faith by lobbying for government interventions in

 To his credit, Weaver shares in the blame, describing how he himself began 
writing around "the real issues" as a 31-year-old staff writer at Fortune 
magazine. While covering his first story there -- national efforts to issue new 
limits on exposure to vinyl chloride -- he found that no one involved in the 
debate actually knew how big a dose of vinyl chloride it would take to cause 
cancer, but that everyone was "advocating specific levels as safe while 
attacking as dangerous the different levels urged by others." He wanted to 
write a story about how each side, rather than working collectively to arrive 
at a public health standard "intelligently reflecting the many considerations 
involved . . . was lying in order to benefit themselves at others' expense." 
But because he feared that such a story would prompt hostile letters from his 
sources and expressions of bemusement from his bosses, Weaver instead wrote a 
piece that defined the machinations as a "healthy" exercise in "vigorous 
political competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver -- who eventually was promoted to an assistant managing editor at 
Fortune -- was clearly rankled by his experiences, for he delights in bashing 
the news media as "stupid and dysfunctional" and denouncing the nation's 
capital as "a mecca of hypocrisy, a Vatican of hypocrisy. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he seems to genuinely respect most journalists, crediting them with a 
"nagging, fugitive, contrary awareness of a reality that is sharply at odds 
with the myth." And he quotes opinion polls that suggest that most Americans 
are aware that public discourse has become "a pasticcio of cheesy 
fabrications." 
</P>
<P>
 So then, one may ask, why do journalists continue to leave the capital's lies 
unchallenged? While he is now a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution, 
Weaver offers an explanation usually proffered by leftist media critics: 
</P>
<P>
 When newspapers came to draw the majority of their revenue from ad sales 
during World War I, advertisers, wanting to reach the largest possible 
audience, pressured them to abandon their subjective, often adversarial styles. 
"Thus was born," Weaver writes, "the concept of the news as a story about 
crisis and of journalism as a purely factual discourse without point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 A better explanation for why papers haven't changed, however, is that critics 
such as Weaver have failed to offer any viable alternative. Weaver tries to 
hold up pre-Pulitzerian papers as a model of how to "invite readers to step 
into . . . constitutional and political processes," but scholars such as 
Leonard Levy and Edmund Morgan have shown that such papers usually did nothing 
of the sort. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver's post-Pulitzerian guidelines, moreover, are rife with contradictions: 
He suggests, for instance, that papers expand coverage of "normal, formal 
political, social and economic events" -- the kind that send most readers into 
slumber -- but also that the media's "business strategy (be reoriented) toward 
readers." Contradictions like that speak volumes about the kind of confusion 
over the proper role of the news media that continues to keep the Pulitzerian 
model in place.

CYCLING WITHOUT HELMET IS BAD NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was quite dismayed to see your front-page story in today's Orange County 
edition. Your photography accompanying the article "Wheels of Fortune" (June 
24) describing the new "lowrider" bicycle showed five children and teen-agers 
riding without bicycle helmets. I am sure it is very "cool" to have one of 
these decked-out cycles, and, indeed, they may even help keep some kid out of a 
gang and trouble, but any one of those kids could end up with a severe 
traumatic head injury because he or she was not wearing a helmet.

PANIC DISORDER: NOT JUST A BIOLOGICAL PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I could agree only with the headline of Dennis McLellan's Sunday profile on 
May 29, "Enough Is Enough." The rest of the article does a disservice to your 
readers in falsely implying that panic disorder is a purely biological problem 
awaiting the proper medication.In fact, the most successful treatment for panic 
disorder is a cognitive behavioral treatment developed at Oxford University in 
England. Carefully controlled studies at universities throughout the world 
demonstrate that this treatment is effective for 80% of people suffering from 
panic disorder with less than 5% relapse at the two-year follow-up. In 
contrast, studies of medication treatments of panic disorder typically show 70% 
to 95% relapse within six months of discontinuing the medication. 
</P>
<P>
 Your readers should know that panic disorder has one of the highest 
psychotherapy success rates of any psychological problem. It is not necessary 
to resort to untested treatments when highly effective treatments already 
exist.

'GAY' LIFESTYLES VS. FAMILY VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm incensed! Another big color spread in Life & Style extolling the "gay" 
lifestyle ("We Have Arrived," June 13).What's gay about such a sterile 
relationship? 
</P>
<P>
 Or are these front-page articles just another example of the media's 
denigrating the Judeo-Christian and family lifestyles so prevalent today? Those 
of us who have studied the history of civilization are fearful for America. 
Aren't you?

NAACP FUND HONORS SOME HIGH ACHIEVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIDGET BYRNE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry McMillan accepted her honor in memory of her "Mama." Angela Bassett paid 
tribute to "Mom." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Book Award-winning author and the Oscar nominated actress were 
named 1994 Black Women of Achievement Key honorees by the NAACP Legal Defense 
and Educational Fund at a luncheon Thursday at the Century Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to do my best in everything I do," McMillan said. The best-selling 
writer, whose novels include "Mama" and "Waiting to Exhale," clutched her hands 
to her hair exclaiming, "You almost messed up my 'fro," as the ribbon adorned 
with the achievement medal was hung around her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassett, best known for her portrayal of Tina Turner in "What's Love Got to Do 
With It?" is filming "Strange Day." She told the lunch crowd: "Each time I talk 
to my Mom, before we hang up the phone, she says, 'Be a good girl. Work hard.' 
"  
</P>
<P>
 The other two Key honorees were unable to attend. National Council of Negro 
Women President Dorothy I. Height, described during the presentations as "a 
woman who has given her whole life to upgrading women and their families," was 
in Egypt. Assemblywoman Marguerite Archie-Hudson (D-Los Angeles) was in 
Sacramento working on the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were enough additional awards handed out to keep the ceremony 
running through the entire lunch menu -- salad, chicken and chocolate cake.  
</P>
<P>
 Co-chairwomen Jackie Hempstead, Carolyn J. Fowler and Patt Watts beamed, 
hugged, kissed and posed for photographs with the other honorees, who included 
12 local business and community leaders chosen 1994 Outstanding Black Women of 
Achievement. Janice Bryant-Howroyd, president and CEO of Act One* personnel 
service, received the AT&T Entrepreneur of the Year Award. 
</P>
<P>
 All the medals are engraved with former congresswoman Barbara Jordan's quote: 
"I never intended to become a run of the mill person." 
</P>
<P>
 KCAL-TV anchor Pat Harvey, who was given a Special Recognition Award for her 
involvement in community affairs, spoke eloquently about her trip to South 
Africa during the recent election. The words on the importance of making one's 
vote count struck a chord in the audience, which also heard a passionate plea 
from Elaine Jones, director-counsel of the Legal Defense and Educational Fund, 
to take on gun control and violence as civil-rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones also recently returned from South Africa, where she met former President 
F.W. de Klerk. Not one to hold back, Jones asked De Klerk to tell her three 
things he liked about President Nelson Mandela and one thing he didn't like.  
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'His integrity, the fact that he listens and that he's a genuinely 
warm person.' "And the thing he didn't like about Mandela? I insisted. 'He's 
domineering,' " De Klerk told her. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones laughed. "If De Klerk thinks Mandela is domineering, what would he think 
of all of us?" she asked the audience of high-achieving women.

BEST FRIENDS IN LIFE, DEATH; TRAGEDY: THE 13-YEAR-OLD BOYS WHO DROWNED AT A 
CHURCH OUTING WERE INSEPARABLE. PARENTS, PASTOR AND CONGREGATION ARE LEFT 
DEVASTATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quoc Thai Cao and Man Minh Tran were about as close as two 13-year-olds could 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 Their homes separated by less than a mile, the two boys sought each other out 
on the playground and looked forward to frequent meetings at the Vietnamese 
Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were always together," church member Chris Trinh said. "They were truly 
the best of friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The skinny kids who so enjoyed each other's company died together Sunday, 
drowning during a church-sponsored swimming party and picnic. The accident has 
not only devastated the boys' families but has badly shaken the tightknit 
Vietnamese congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart is broken," Van Quang Cao said, cradling the new high-top sneakers 
he bought for his oldest son just last week. "He was saving the shoes for a 
special time. He never wore them. He will never wear them." 
</P>
<P>
 Cao wept softly as he pulled his son's most recent report card from a drawer 
in the family's tiny but spotless apartment. A bright student, Quoc sometimes 
left the neighborhood playground early to spend more time on his studies, his 
father said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please continue to work very hard in school," teacher Grace DeLew wrote in 
the child's last report card. "You have many talents." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, when Cao found it too painful to speak, church member Nhan Le placed 
a hand on his shoulder in an attempt to steady him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole congregation is very upset," Le said. "Nothing like this has ever 
happened before." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Sunday afternoon tragedy, church members have volunteered to keep a 
vigil with the young victims' families, some offering to stay the night while 
the parents grieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is still in shock over this," said Trinh, part of a church 
delegation that met visitors outside the Tran house Monday. "Our main concern 
is to provide comfort to the families who are mourning right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Cao said his family was still uncertain about the events that led to the death 
of his son and Man. The father, who is studying to become a mechanic, said he 
knew little more about the incident than was contained in the reports of local 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 During the party at the home of the church pastor, the Rev. An Thien Vo, the 
boys apparently slipped out of a shallow Jacuzzi where they were playing with 
several other children and into a deeper pool in the pastor's back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Trinh said the youngsters were apparently placed in the Jacuzzi with others 
because they did not know how to swim. A youth minister was monitoring the pool 
party, but the two boys apparently found their way to the deeper water without 
being noticed either by him or other children in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, the youth minister discovered the pair at the bottom of 
the pool and called for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is one person other than those in the family who is feeling the 
worst right now, it is him," Trinh said of the youth minister, who church 
members declined to identify. "He was just in tears when he came here. He could 
not stop crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big, big loss for our whole congregation," he said. "Everywhere I 
go, I am seeing people crying. The oldest members of our church and toughest 
kids in church are in tears over this. It is horrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Trinh said the pastor's wife, Minh, was virtually inconsolable. "She has not 
been able to eat or drink anything since this has happened." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Cao apartment, the grieving father seemed to reach for anything that 
might remind visitors of his son and his many accomplishments. He pulled a 
certificate from the wall, recording Quoc's successful completion of the Drug 
Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) program at Anderson Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Cao thumbed through a family album, crammed with photographs of young Quoc and 
two other sons. When he pulled a tattered three-ring school binder from under a 
chair, he broke into tears again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never even asked for a new one," Cao said. "He never complained about 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral arrangements are incomplete, but the church is asking for donations to 
defray the costs. Contributions may be sent to the Vietnamese Baptist Church, 
14200 Golden West St., Westminster 92683.

LAND OF THE CAREFREE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: POLICE REPORT NONE OF THE VIOLENCE THAT 
MARRED THE HOLIDAY IN PAST YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 As fireworks began illuminating the Monday night sky, public safety agencies 
across Orange County, from lifeguards to police, reported no serious 
disturbances or accidents related to the Fourth of July celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any major incidents. We don't even have anything minor," said 
Lt. Larry Abbott of the Orange County Sheriff's Department, who helped 
supervise patrol operations for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 The calm that extended into the evening contrasted sharply with the violent 
incidents that marred the July 4th holidays in Newport Beach and Huntington 
Beach over the previous two years, including a 1993 melee in which 40 people 
were arrested in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, particularly in the beach cities, said they were busy handling routine 
matters like crowd and traffic control, quelling noisy parties and stopping 
drunken drivers. Estimates of beach attendance ranged between 400,000 and 
500,000 across the county, with 325,000 in Huntington Beach alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hanging in there," said Huntington Beach Lt. Gary Brooks. "It's one of 
the more quiet Fourth of Julys so far. We are anticipating some problems, 
perhaps later in the evening or early this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguards up and down the coast made scores of rescues in the higher than 
usual surf but reported no drownings or major disturbances. Some bathers 
received neck and back injuries in the five- to six-foot waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its been a real good weekend," said Joe Milligan, a lifeguard at Huntington 
State Beach. "Ninety-nine percent of the people just want to have a good time 
and complied with the rules. But some overestimated their abilities and 
underestimated the surf." 
</P>
<P>
 Police departments throughout coastal Orange County increased their presence 
on the street for the holiday weekend, adding reserve officers, undercover 
agents and detectives, who normally work weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach closed its city beaches two hours early, while Newport Beach 
strictly enforced its 10 p.m. beach curfew and a noise ordinance that carries a 
$150 fine for violators. Newport Beach also restricted traffic on some 
beachfront thoroughfares to control the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Fourth of July festivities in Newport Beach were marred by three 
incidents of violence: a beating, stabbing and a shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 40 people were arrested in Huntington Beach during a downtown melee 
during the holiday. A team of 50 officers in riot gear was called to break up a 
group of roving revelers, who set a huge bonfire in the street using sofas, 
trash, boxes and lawn furniture.

MAGAZINE HELPS STUDENTS TURN THE PAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miguel Ornelas used to spend his free time watching television. That was 
before he wrote a short story that was published in Santa Ana High School's 
acclaimed art and literary magazine, Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 Working as one of the magazine's editors and chief contributors for the past 
year has made Ornelas, 18, more serious about school and life. In fact, writing 
now commands all the senior's spare time. "I didn't think I had any talent," 
Ornelas said. "But when my first story got published, I felt so great about my 
ability that I just wanted to write more and more." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, his grade-point average jumped from 3.5 to 3.8 and his 
self-confidence zoomed. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Vista's creator and adviser, Kay Grable, intended. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine, begun as a one-time assignment, has turned into a celebrated 
semiannual publication that features student poems, art and short stories. 
About 2,500 copies are printed per issue, and students compete to see their 
work published. 
</P>
<P>
 Vista's pages give voice to the culture of the school's largely Latino student 
body. While most of the literature is in English, a few of the poems in each 
issue also are printed in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in Grable's 10th-grade honors English classes produced the first 
issue two years ago and it instantly became popular on campus. More recently, 
it has captured the attention of community groups and city officials, who have 
showered it with accolades. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the magazine was commended by Los Amigos of Orange County, 
a community group. A local bookstore, Martinez-Hernandez Bookcase, applauded 
Vista and proudly stocks copies for the public to take. And, the Santa Ana City 
Council recognized it in March with a proclamation and award for "Excellence in 
Journalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Vista "shows off the caliber of the students in Santa Ana," said Councilman 
Ted R. Moreno. "It's not every day you see this type of magazine in the high 
schools, and it lets the community know that our kids are not in the streets 
causing trouble. They're in the classroom doing good work." 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth edition was published in June and its popularity was evident during 
a recent noontime magazine-signing on campus. Hundreds of students lined up to 
seek the authors' and artists' autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vista highlights the joys and tribulations of student life, with topics 
ranging from love, faith, hope, parents and friendship to hate, violence, 
alcoholism, sadness and gangs. Adolescent depression is tackled in this excerpt 
from the poem "Confused" by senior Miriam Perez: 
</P>
<P>
 The night has been too lonely  
</P>
<P>
 And my heart feels so weak  
</P>
<P>
 Wishing not to be alive  
</P>
<P>
 Because the road has been too long...  
</P>
<P>
 "When you're a teen-ager, you have so many choices to make, and it's 
frustrating because sometimes you make the wrong decisions and that's really 
depressing," said Perez, 17, who emigrated from Mexico in 1989. "That's why I 
wrote 'Confused.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Perez also penned "Dear Jenny," a story about two best friends whose 
friendship would never die. 
</P>
<P>
 She said writing for Vista has lifted her self-esteem and pushed her to excel 
at all her schoolwork. This year she earned college credits by taking two 
advanced courses, and next year she'll take three more. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez said she feels triumphant when her parents, older brothers and friends 
praise her for her work in the school magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is proud of me, and I feel like, somehow, Vista gives me something 
that feels good," she said. "I feel like I'm accomplishing something good, and 
English is my second language so it's like double pride for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Flipping through the magazine's pages on a recent afternoon, Jose Silva, 19, 
said he is impressed by his peers' work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The poems are very moving, and the drawings are really good," the 19-year-old 
student said. The creators "really know how to paint and write. Everything in 
Vista is beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Grable, who urged her students to continue producing Vista after its initial 
success, was named Santa Ana Unified School District's Teacher of the Year this 
year and recently was chosen a recipient of Disneyland's Creativity Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Vista is also being considered for a Golden Bell, a top state education award 
given annually by the California School Boards Foundation.  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana High's student population is 95% Latino and the magazine "represents 
(the students') culture," Grable said. "It's light-hearted and heavy-hearted 
cultural expression." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Rubio, 17, one of Vista's editors, wrote the opening poem in the spring 
1994 edition in Spanish and English. He titled it, "Mil Amores (A Thousand 
Loves)." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was inspired by a girl I liked," Rubio said. "And I wrote it in Spanish 
first because Spanish is so romantic." 
</P>
<P>
 Writing for the magazine, he added, "opens a window in education. It teaches 
us to express ourselves in a positive way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grable first urged her students to participate in Vista by having them write 
their prose on secondhand computers she bought. Once the students printed out 
their work and pasted it up on boards, Grable said, "they got excited and 
wanted to do more." 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids feel very successful because they are proud of their work. And 
people throughout the community have been encouraging," Grable said. Now, 
students from throughout the school compete to have their work published in the 
booklet-size magazine. Two campus clubs for student writers and artists choose 
the drawings and writings that get published. 
</P>
<P>
 Grable, who advises the campus Writers Club, said the students' participation 
in Vista has fostered leadership skills, boosted self-esteem and even raised 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magazine is building cultural awareness with expression through art and 
writing," Grable said. "It's an avenue of appreciation of the students' ability 
and a way that we can say, 'You're good, you have a lot of skill and we believe 
in you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Mario Bustos' poem "You," which appeared in the winter 1993 edition, 
speaks to the students' newfound self esteem:  
</P>
<P>
 This is you:

 The brightest star in the whole universe

 Nothing matches the pride that comes with having her work reproduced in Vista, 
said Theresa de la Torre, 17. Her powerful paintings "Sharecroppers" and "Dream 
State," which depict poverty and anguish, respectively, appear in the latest 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great feeling to see your work published," the student artist said, 
holding the magazine. "It's not like an art show because that's not permanent. 
This, you can hang on to forever."

LAND OF THE CAREFREE; FOURTH OF JULY: ATTITUDES AND WEATHER ARE SUNNY AS PEOPLE 
RELAX AT BEACHES, PARADES AND BLOCK PARTIES. 
</P>

 From the coastline, where tanned bodies and brightly colored umbrellas formed 
a ribbon along the hot sandy beaches, to the parks and main streets where 
parades and festivals were held, Orange County partied, marched, danced, cycled 
and roller-bladed its way through another Independence Day Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the aroma from countless back-yard barbecues faded away, skies were filled 
with the pageantry of fireworks displays over 22 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The country looks good to me," said Linda Lagattuta, one of the residents of 
the 5300 block of Keelson Avenue in Santa Ana, which was celebrating its 26th 
consecutive Fourth of July block party. "People say there's this problem and 
that problem, but we are all here, and we are all happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at the Huntington Beach Fourth of July Parade, which drew 230,000 
people Monday, many agreed that the U.S. looks pretty good at the age of 218, 
even if it has experienced some growing pains in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach resident Mark Kemmer, 37, roped off a patch of grass along a 
Main Street sidewalk two days before his city's parade, not because the floats 
and other attractions are so spectacular but because the event gives him a 
sense of "small-town America," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The country does have some significant problems, but it's things like this 
that help us reaffirm some of our basic sense of morality," Kemmer said. "It's 
a nice tradition to hold onto." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim resident Trisha Stoll, 44, said she has seen many changes in Orange 
County in the past two decades, including a growing ethnic diversity that 
symbolizes the freedom that Independence Day stands for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you see all nationalities here. It shows you what the U.S. is all about," 
Stoll said as she watched the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say the country looks pretty good, but some of the politicians don't," 
added 85-year-old Harold Ewell of Huntington Beach. He and his wife, Martha, 
76, had just watched a line of elected officials -- including Gov. Pete Wilson 
-- cruise the parade route in convertibles, before "Bill and Hillary" Clinton 
look-alikes strolled by. 
</P>
<P>
 Along Main Street, parade watchers created their own amusements. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyclists tied flags to their seats, and those not in swimwear were generally 
wearing red-white-and-blue. Youngsters had their faces painted, and adults 
behaved like kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love parades, but my family doesn't, and that's why I'm here by myself," 
said Fred Padilla, 50, of Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Front lawns facing the parade route were filled with private parties, and 
observers called out to the passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love your doughnuts, Mrs. Winchell," one crowd shouted in unison as 
Huntington Beach Councilwoman Grace Winchell drove by. 
</P>
<P>
 One couple turned the sidewalk into a dance floor as they swayed to the music 
of a blues band performing on one of the floats. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Buddy (the kissing bandit) Noble, a 28-year-old high school 
football coach, who for the past 12 years has created his own sideshow along 
the parade route with back flips, cartwheels and attempts to kiss parade 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
 Noble jumped on the sideboard of a car to win a peck on the cheek from a woman 
accompanying former California Angel and All-Star pitcher Bert Blyleven. He 
also climbed up the float for a kiss from County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder 
and received huge smacks from World War II veteran Col. Violet Cowden and Lt. 
Col James Ghormley III, the parade's reviewing commander. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Mouse and television star Sarah Purcell, the grand marshal, pushed 
Noble away. And he didn't even try for the governor. "Two words: Secret 
Service," he explained to the crowd as the governor -- oblivious to the joke -- 
cruised past. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd booed when television actor Jack Scalia became irritated with 
Noble's advances toward a woman riding in his car. In a city still jittery over 
street battles between police and revelers last Fourth of July, a police 
officer then approached Noble and, in so many words, asked him to cool his hot 
lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot was the order of the day for those on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 By midday, Tustin resident Diana Abbott, 30, was driving an umbrella into the 
sand and covering her toddler, 17-month-old Alexis, from head to toe for 
protection from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The Abbott family had been there for several hours, arriving before the sun 
had pierced through the early morning haze to beat an expected rush to the 
beach. But they would not be leaving soon. With blankets spread across the 
sand, this would be a day of total relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a day to have fun, because you are off (from work), you don't have to 
cook, everybody expects that you are not going to cook and instead you're going 
to eat sandwiches," Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach was not the most comfortable setting for a Pomona woman who sat 
stiffly on a lawn chair with a brace around her neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my husband, 'I'm giving you 10 minutes to have a good time, because 
I'm ready to go home,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, Keelson Avenue residents stayed home to salute America the way 
they have for the past generation, with their block party, bicycle parade, 
volleyball game and food extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was younger, we wouldn't let the kids on the (volleyball court), and 
now, the kids won't let us on the court," said Bob Williams, 58, who with his 
wife, Patricia, helped organize the first celebration in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the event has actually grown through the years as the children and 
grandchildren of the original residents have come back to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what we have here: families, and family traditions and family 
values," said Thomas Mueller, who returns each year with his wife, Kay, even 
though they moved 15 years ago to a neighboring city.

VARIATIONS ON A THEME; INDEPENDENCE DAY CELEBRATIONS RANGE FROM PATRIOTIC TO 
ZANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Proving once again that pushing freedom to its outer limits can bring one darn 
close to idiocy, about 40 fans of athletics and alcohol celebrated Independence 
Day on Monday by running, paddling and losing their lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair, some of those who participated in the more or less annual Hermosa 
Beach Iron Man competition -- which involves running a mile, paddling a mile in 
the ocean and chugging a six-pack of beer -- kept the libations down for the 20 
minutes stipulated in the contest rules. But most did not, bringing cheers from 
300 observers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hermosa Beach "is just one big, happy family," said "iron man" and City 
Councilman Robert Benz, who claimed that he finished a clean third. 
</P>
<P>
 Benz took some heat for his involvement in the event last year, when the 
drinking was done on the public beach in violation of local ordinances. This 
year, to avoid the controversy, the beer event took place in a private yard 
several blocks away from the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition was but one of the many ways that people in Southern 
California found to celebrate freedom on a day that dawned cloudy but developed 
into a near-perfect backdrop for parades, picnics, concerts and fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, no doubt, spent the day indoors in front of television sets watching the 
U.S. team being eliminated from World Cup competition by losing to Brazil, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 But others filled parks and pools and about 230,000 lined the route of the 
Huntington Beach Fourth of July Parade, which featured a campaigning Gov. Pete 
Wilson and is billed as the largest Fourth of July parade west of the 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 The smallest parade might have been the homey line-up of vans and pickup 
trucks decked out with red, white and blue streamers, balloons and pinwheels 
that wound through the streets of the Oakridge Mobile Home Park in Sylmar for 
45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't much to look at, but the caravan summed up the community spirit that 
has emerged since Jan. 17, when the Northridge earthquake started fires that 
destroyed 57 of the 600 residences. All of them, which 2,000 people call home, 
were damaged and since then neighbors have become closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it's 218 years after the Declaration of Independence, we learned 
it's not only independence, but interdependence that's important," said 
resident Joe Mayzels, explaining that the earthquake taught neighbors to 
support each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Greer and Robi Robins scraped together a few dollars and bought blue 
vests with white stars to wear while singing "God Bless America" from their 
lawn chairs as the parade passed by. They had lived in motels until late May 
and many of their quake-damaged belongings are still in a trash bin in their 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This parade has been an emotional lift; we've been so depressed since (the 
quake) happened," Robins said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunland-Tujunga, dozens of people sat in lawn chairs along Foothill 
Boulevard to view a procession of horseback riders, Boy Scout troops and 
colorful clowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake View Terrace resident Don Stoll, who sported red, white and blue tennis 
shoes, said he has attended the Sunland-Tujunga parade every year for the past 
10 years "just for laughs." 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest float they had last year was a locksmith truck with crepe paper 
on it," Stoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood was similarly upbeat for many at an urban version of a country picnic 
put on in a parking lot by the Union Rescue Mission in Downtown Los Angeles, 
where 50 volunteers served 400 pounds of barbecued ribs, 400 pounds of chicken, 
1,500 pounds of watermelon, 500 pounds of coleslaw and 100 pounds of ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,500 men, women and children from the streets and hotels nearby 
wound through a serving line and then ate to the throbbing beat of rock, rap 
and hip-hop music churned out by two Christian "biker" bands. For the children 
there were games and a petting zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla Leonard, 42, said she welcomed the all-afternoon celebration because 
it gave her and her 7-year-old daughter a chance to eat a hot meal. She said 
their stuffy room in a single-room-occupancy hotel nearby does not have cooking 
facilities and usually they cannot afford to buy hot take-out food. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were celebrating the Fourth of July in my own home I would be . . . 
having the same kind of food," said Leonard, who has lived off and on at the 
Frontier Hotel for six years. "I'm really surprised they can afford to provide 
so much, because it's so nice." 
</P>
<P>
 But Leonard, who served in the Navy during the Vietnam War, said the holiday 
means more to her than a chance to eat a traditional meal. "I take it 
seriously," she said. "I would like my sacrifice for freedom to be recognized. 
It's not just another day to celebrate."

CATCHING EDUCATION'S WINDFALL; FUNDING: L.A.-AREA SCHOOL REFORMERS PREPARE 
PITCHES FOR SOME OF THE $500 MILLION OFFERED BY PHILANTHROPIST WALTER 
ANNENBERG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 One evening in mid-May, USC President Steven B. Sample hosted a dinner in his 
campus conference room for about three dozen handpicked guests. They included 
teachers, public school administrators, union leaders, local education 
reformers and a state senator who has been a key player in efforts to improve 
California schools.  
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Sample's list for a breakfast meeting that stretched till 
noon included Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, executives from some of the 
city's most influential corporations and representatives from several private 
foundations.  
</P>
<P>
 Both groups got some tantalizing news and the same assignment. Walter H. 
Annenberg, the philanthropist and former publishing mogul who has announced 
plans to give half a billion dollars to education reform, was considering the 
Los Angeles area for a chunk of the funds. But first, Annenberg wanted to know 
how leaders here would use such a gift. 
</P>
<P>
 If their ideas find favor with Annenberg and his advisers, unprecedented 
amounts of fresh capital could flow in to help spread reform efforts of those 
who are grappling to reinvent schools on shoestring budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are conceiving this as a way to turbocharge the reform efforts already 
under way in the Los Angeles area," said Theodore Mitchell, dean of the UCLA 
Graduate School of Education. Mitchell and Guilbert C. Hentschke, dean of USC's 
School of Education, were asked by Sample to write an initial proposal, based 
on talks with the Annenberg representatives and the views expressed at the two 
USC sessions and subsequent meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The still-evolving proposal for the Los Angeles Metropolitan Project (LAMP) -- 
which sent a draft report of its ideas to the Annenberg people last week -- 
envisions the money going directly to small groups of schools across Los 
Angeles County.  
</P>
<P>
 According to people who attended the meetings and helped fashion the proposal, 
schools hoping to participate would have to show they have the support of 
parents, teachers and community and business leaders. Because the money would 
go directly to groups of schools instead of to school districts, a nonprofit 
organization would be set up to oversee efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 While schools would have great autonomy in using the money, they would have to 
demonstrate a commitment to high academic standards and an intimate campus 
setting so students get individual attention. Schools would also have to show 
how they will be accountable for student progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these principles are common to reform projects already under way, 
including LEARN, the Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now, 
which involves community groups, business leaders, parents, the teachers union 
and officials of the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been at this for 10 years now, and there is not much disagreement in 
this city about what reform looks like," said Peggy Funkhouser, president of 
the Los Angeles Educational Partnership, a business-backed group that works 
with area public schools and participates in LEARN. "There were a lot of 
nodding heads in that room," said Funkhouser, who attended the dinner session 
at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Roos, LEARN's president, called the Annenberg project "a timely bridge" 
between local reform ideas and the means to put them into wide practice. "It's 
just a super opportunity for Los Angeles," Roos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sample pulled together the meetings at the request of Vartan Gregorian, the 
president of Brown University and longtime Annenberg friend who was asked by 
the philanthropist to advise him on how to distribute his $500 million 
"Annenberg Challenge" gift. Gregorian was accompanied by Theodore R. Sizer, a 
nationally known education reformer and Brown professor who is expected to be a 
key player in the gift decisions. The Annenberg National Institute for School 
Reform is based at Brown and headed by Sizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than start another new program, Annenberg and his advisers want to 
focus on proven reforms, a position emphasized when the gift was announced Dec. 
17 in a White House ceremony. The Annenberg Institute will get $50 million to 
expand its efforts, including the 700-campus network of public and private 
secondary schools founded by Sizer in 1984 and known as the Coalition of 
Essential Schools. Several local districts have affiliated schools.  
</P>
<P>
 Another $50 million is earmarked for the New American Schools Development 
Corp., which has collected private donations for nine groundbreaking school 
design projects, including one developed jointly by the Los Angeles Educational 
Partnership and United Teachers-Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional $15 million will go to the Education Commission of the States, 
which is aiding reforms in several states.  
</P>
<P>
 Much of the remaining $385 million is expected to go to local school reforms, 
with about a third to be concentrated in the nation's urban areas. Don Ernst, 
policy director for the Annenberg Institute, said schools will be required to 
match them in some way, to demonstrate community support. 
</P>
<P>
 Detailed terms of the gifts still are being worked out, Ernst said. What is 
firm is that recipients must demonstrate that they have autonomous schools that 
have formed alliances with universities and business and community leadership 
and have developed a set of proven principles. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposals have been solicited and received from groups in New York City and 
Chicago in addition to Los Angeles. Leaders in Detroit are working on a 
proposal, and the institute may consider including Philadelphia and an alliance 
of New England cities in the first wave of local grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Some participants in the Los Angeles meetings said the group proposed that 
some of the funds go to LEARN schools or to affiliates of the New American 
Schools Development Corp. Other recipients would include members of Sizer's 
Coalition of Essential Schools or the Accelerated Schools Project, developed 
several years ago at Stanford University and producing results at several 
campuses that serve disadvantaged minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, of UCLA, said the document forwarded to Annenberg is likely to 
change as it is disseminated to wider circles for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to take the ideas that came up in the meetings and coalesce them 
into something that reflected the cross-section of the community's interest," 
Mitchell said. "We believe we now need to broaden the discussion in the 
community."  
</P>
<P>
 The Annenberg gift is the latest by the 86-year-old former ambassador to Great 
Britain. Annenberg took over his family's struggling publishing empire and grew 
wealthy with the likes of TV Guide, Seventeen magazine and the Daily Racing 
Form.

ACID DEATH CASE GOES TO NEW TRIAL; COURTS: MAN CONVICTED IN 1980 KILLING OF A 
WOMAN GETS ANOTHER CHANCE WITH RULING THAT HIS CONFESSION WAS ILLEGALLY 
OBTAINED. TWO OTHERS REMAIN IN PRISON.

<P>
 Nearly 14 years have passed since Patricia Worrell's hopes of becoming a 
lawyer vaporized on an August night when she opened the door of her Sylmar home 
to a stranger who tossed a quart of lye in her face. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinded and disfigured, Worrell died 10 days later, bleeding to death as the 
caustic chemical she had inadvertently swallowed burned through her esophagus, 
then an artery. She left behind a 10-year-old son, who had been awakened by her 
shrieks of pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutors say the attack was paid for by Worrell's jilted fiance, 
who was inside playing cards with her when two men, one carrying a glass jar 
filled with lye, knocked on her door. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the story of Worrell's excruciating death again will be told as the 
retrial of Ricardo H. Robinson, one of three men convicted of first-degree 
murder, mayhem and conspiracy in connection with the attack, begins in a Van 
Nuys courtroom. Testimony begins today. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who claims he had no role in the plot to maim Worrell, will act as 
his own lawyer. His 1982 conviction was overturned two years ago by a federal 
appeals court, which ruled that his confession to the crime was illegally 
obtained. It was his fifth appeal in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors Robert L. Cohen and Jodi Link will re-create events that happened 
14 years ago -- but they will not be able to use Robinson's 1980 statements to 
police. Cohen said he was surprised to locate most of the original witnesses 
who, he said, "are alive and well." 
</P>
<P>
 But Worrell's older brother, Bill Dziamba, who said he attended court hearings 
for four years, does not plan to be in court the second time around. The case 
has left him bitter and questioning the efficacy of the criminal justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sham. This guy threw acid in my sister's face. God, this thing. . . . 
She was my baby sister," he said in a telephone interview from his home in 
Ohio. "She was 34 years old and she was going to graduate from law school and 
she was killed by some creep. What has this country come to?" 
</P>
<P>
 By December of 1980, the trail led to Worrell's former fiance, Richard Morton 
Gilman of Burbank, a man 10 years older than she, who had recently graduated 
from law school but had failed the bar exam. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple met and fell in love at what was then known as the San Fernando 
Valley College of Law. Worrell had been elected president of the student bar 
association. Gilman even gave her his grandmother's ring.  
</P>
<P>
 But Worrell broke off the engagement and refused to give back the ring, Cohen 
said. She filed a battery complaint against Gilman after they quarreled 
violently over the ring, but apparently dropped the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 A month before the attack, according to court records, Gilman met a prostitute 
in a hotel bar in Las Vegas and told her his tale of woe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lamenting his lost love, he gets together with a hooker," Cohen said. "He 
asked her if she knew anyone who could do a job for him. She set up a meeting 
with her pimp. He agreed to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 That job consisted of disfiguring Worrell. Gilman allegedly paid $750 to the 
pimp, a sometime bounty hunter named Bobby Ray Savage.  
</P>
<P>
 Savage initially brought another man with him to Los Angeles for an attempt at 
disfiguring Worrell. But the attack did not occur because she had house guests, 
according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned with Robinson, who allegedly demanded an additional $1,000 
payment, which he never received, the documents say.  
</P>
<P>
 The year 1982 brought trials and the convictions of Gilman, Robinson and 
Savage. All three were serving 25 years to life in state prison, and the case 
seemed to be forgotten, left to gather dust in the courthouse archives. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robinson would not give up. After losing three appeals in the state and 
federal courts, he wrote William Genego at USC Law Center's Post Conviction 
Justice Project. Genego lost a fourth appeal before persuading the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse Robinson's conviction on the ground that 
his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination was violated. 
</P>
<P>
 The divided court found that Robinson had given incriminating statements to 
police, even after telling the officers: "I have to get me a good lawyer. . . . 
Can I make a phone call?" according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1966 Miranda decision, police must stop questioning a suspect who 
asks for a lawyer, and the prosecution cannot use any incriminating statements 
made after the request. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the retrial jury will not hear Robinson's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators were able to track down a star witness -- Kim Bricker, the 
former Las Vegas prostitute who introduced Gilman to Savage. Bricker, who 
provided key testimony during the earlier trials after being granted immunity 
from prosecution, had moved to Pennsylvania.  
</P>
<P>
 And the prosecution has enlisted another surprise witness: Bobby Ray Savage, 
who is serving a 25-years-to-life sentence at the California Men's Colony in 
San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said Savage, who has lost all his appeals, has an obvious 
motive for testifying: "He's probably asking himself: 'Why should I let this 
guy go free, when I'm sitting in here?' "

ENTREPRENEUR HELPS THE NEEDY SIGN ON TO COMPUTER JOB SKILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year and a half after she graduated from an entrepreneur training program, 
Sheila Louison is working long hours in a cramped storefront office in Gardena, 
struggling to keep her operation going and not earning a penny in salary. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike most entrepreneurs, Louison, executive director of the nonprofit 
New World Computer Training Center, does not measure success by the bottom line 
on a balance sheet. She measures success by the troubled youths and low-income 
adults who are learning how to operate that required tool for success in the 
1990s and beyond: computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Computer illiteracy is one of the biggest problems in minority communities 
today," says Louison, 31. " But adults who need computer skills training don't 
have the money to get it, and children in low-income families don't have 
computers at home to learn on like most other children do. When I see kids' 
eyes light up when they turn on a computer, or when I see a woman who's been 
unemployed because she lacks computer skills suddenly realize that she can 
learn DOS or Windows -- well, that's a much greater reward than just making 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the need for computer training and job placement in low-income 
communities, Louison says, the number of people served by her program so far is 
relatively small. Since the center opened in January, about 100 children and 
adults have received training in everything from math and reading skills to 
programs such as MS-DOS and WordPerfect. 
</P>
<P>
 The results in many cases may be life-changing. 
</P>
<P>
 There's Consuelo Navarro, 46, who two years ago lost her job as an office 
manager for a small Gardena company when it brought in computers. Navarro had 
never touched a computer in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know computers don't bite, but I was afraid of them," Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent the next two years looking for work and not finding it -- largely, 
she believes, because she lacked computer skills. Then the city of Gardena's 
Employment and Training Department sent her to Louison's center for a 
two-month, 20-hour-a-week computer course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have two children in college and now I know more about computers than they 
do," said Navarro, who recently landed a "computerized" clerical job. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't anybody who can't learn how to use computers," says Louison. "Or 
doesn't need to." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's 11-year-old Perry Williams of Carson, one of six children of a 
working single mother whose family cannot afford a home computer -- or for that 
matter, the usual $100-per-child fee for the center's two-week summer "computer 
camp." Nevertheless, Perry and three of his siblings spend two hours a day at 
the center, learning computer programs such as "Algeblast," a math skills 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry described this as "learning, but in a fun way." 
</P>
<P>
 Government and corporate agencies that have sponsored students in Louison's 
program give it high marks for effectiveness, and give her high marks for 
dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 "The training has been excellent," said Patrick Martinez, manager of 
employment and training for Gardena, which has put a dozen students through 
Louison's program. "It can really mean the difference between getting a job and 
not getting it." 
</P>
<P>
 After the riots, Louison signed up for a three-month training course in 
entrepreneurial skills sponsored by the city of Los Angeles and designed to 
help minority community residents set up businesses in their damaged 
neighborhoods. Louison, a onetime college business major, studied small 
business techniques and computer applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Louison and her mother later opened a day-care center in Gardena, but she said 
she "wanted to do something more to help the community." A year ago she opened 
the nonprofit New World Youth Center. The youth center also offered job 
training programs, including computer training -- using about $20,000 worth of 
computer equipment that Louison bought with her own money. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of funding forced the youth center to close, but Louison moved the 
computer training program to a 1,600-square-foot storefront on South Van Ness 
Avenue in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee for the full two-month adult program is about $2,000, which none of 
Louison's students can afford on their own. Some are sponsored by government or 
private agencies; others are charged based on their ability to pay, which 
sometimes is zero. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's annual budget of about $150,000 for teachers' salaries, rent and 
other necessities comes from donations, fund-raising efforts and student fees. 
So far Louison has drawn no salary, living on income from the day-care center.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a crying need in the community for this kind of training," Louison 
says. "It's not just about keyboards. There are lives to be saved out there."

A LESSON ON THE LAW FOR TRUANTS, PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was time to lay down the law: Either the boy goes to school or the family 
goes before a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles police officers, a deputy district attorney and assorted 
county and school district officials were ready to let Ruben and his mother 
have it. The boy, who missed 41 days of fifth grade this year, must return to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the truancy court of last resort. On any day, 30,000 Los Angeles 
Unified School District students are absent from school, and those without 
legitimate reasons cost the district about $80 million a year. The most extreme 
cases land here, before a state-mandated school attendance review board. 
</P>
<P>
 While the truancy meetings are private, panel members and parents recently 
allowed a Times reporter to attend an afternoon session and review confidential 
school records. The Times chose to identify the family members by their first 
names only. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the review board's intention to get tough with Ruben, when the time 
came for the family to face hard questions, the members of the board softened. 
The boy was weeping and his mother was pleading. 
</P>
<P>
 She explained that she tried to make Ruben attend school but that she could 
not force him. "I'm trying to get all my boys to school," she said, her eyes 
wide as she nervously surveyed the imposing panel. "There's no excuse for them 
-- they just didn't want to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Grobeson, a deputy district attorney -- who had been ready 15 minutes 
earlier to threaten the family with court action -- changed his tone. "This 
meeting is a last chance for you so you never have to step foot inside a 
courtroom," Grobeson said, addressing Ruben. "All you have to do is go to 
school and try. The law says you guys have to go to school and the law says 
your mom has to send you to school. I don't want to make you cry and I don't 
want to embarrass you, but I want you to understand." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The panels meet weekly and hear the worst stories: The San Fernando Valley 
second-grader who had not been to school in 60 days and who was tardy 39 times. 
The 12-year-old from the Valley who skipped 70 days of school last year. The 
10th-grader from East Los Angeles who ditched 65 days of school and who was 
late 40 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Children face the review board after teachers and school officials admit 
defeat, sometimes after lengthy counseling sessions. It took years for the 
system to finally catch up with Ruben. According to his school records, the boy 
has missed 170 school days since kindergarten -- just 10 days short of an 
entire school year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bureaucratic language of the truancy form, the boy's "non-attendance 
(was) due to parental inability to send student to school." 
</P>
<P>
 Under California's compulsory education law, parents must send children ages 6 
to 18 to school unless the student has passed a state test for early 
graduation. A related law provides for making students under 18 wards of the 
court for habitual truancy and another law makes it a crime for adults to 
contribute to the delinquency of a minor -- a statute prosecutors are using 
more often in truancy cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his meeting with the panel, Ruben's counselor, Raphael Confortes, 
explained that the boy tells his mother that he is sick or that he just does 
not want to get out of bed. "They fight every morning," Confortes said. "He 
doesn't want to get up. His older brother has similar problems. I've been there 
and seen it -- they just fight to stay home and she usually lets them." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel members, meeting in an East Los Angeles school district office, said 
Ruben's mother probably needs to gain more control over her boys and order them 
to school. The case, they said, was typical of the truancy cases they see: 
single, working mothers with strong-willed children who are controlling their 
families. They simply are not going to school because no one is strong enough 
to push or encourage them. 
</P>
<P>
 And once the students are truant for a long period, it is often hard for them 
to return. They have fallen behind both academically and socially, their 
counselors say. 
</P>
<P>
 The review boards also evaluate the whole family -- not just the truant child. 
It is not uncommon, for example, for the panels to discuss siblings and require 
counseling or tutoring programs for them as well. 
</P>
<P>
 That was evident when the review board called the case of Julio, a chronically 
absent 11-year-old. The fifth-grader skipped 40 days of school this year, 
bringing his total to 273 missed school days since kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, whose school records indicate that he reads at the first-grade level 
and does math at the third-grade level, had intensive meetings with his 
counselor over seven weeks. The counselor, Marcia Cunha, said she talked to the 
boy in blunt terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a large conference with his family and I told him he could ultimately 
be removed from his home and placed into a foster home," she said. "That really 
set in his mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Julio's attendance improved. 
</P>
<P>
 But in reading Julio's file, the panel members noticed that his sister, Laura, 
had an even worse attendance problem. The eighth-grader skipped more than 100 
days of school this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Without warning, the panel turned to the girl. "Laura, why aren't you going to 
school?" said one review board member "It's the law that you have to go to 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting hunched over, her head down and her voice barely audible, Laura said 
she just did not like school. "Every year, they teach the same things, the same 
things," she said. "It's boring." 
</P>
<P>
 Their mother said Laura often complained of health problems that kept her home 
from school. The mother also said that she knew that the two children were not 
going to school while she worked cleaning houses but that she was unable to 
reverse the pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 In Julio's file, the counselor had written: "Mom works full-time and does not 
feel it is her responsibility to get Julio to school every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the family had moved three times in the year -- a situation the 
mother acknowledged was probably not good for her children. "With all the 
changes, they became rebellious and not wanting to go to school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Panel members, apparently disbelieving the extent of the girl's health 
problems, told her mother to either take Laura to the doctor and get medical 
notes or encourage her to see the school nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura gave one-word answers and appeared uninterested in the proceedings. It 
was then that Los Angeles Police Officer Armando Romero took over. "I can tell 
from your body language that you don't care about this, but I'm going to tell 
you something: This is real important," Romero said, his voice calm and steady. 
"We're going to take you in front of a judge if you don't start attending 
school. It's because of you and your brother that we are all here. I'd be 
embarrassed if I were you, and you look like you don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, most parents and their children sign a contract saying they will 
attend school and counseling sessions, among other things. The panel ultimately 
had Laura sign a contract stating that she would regularly attend school. Her 
mother was required to attend parenting classes and to discuss Laura's 
absenteeism with her counselor to find programs and activities for her. Julio 
was required to continue going to school. 
</P>
<P>
 When parents or students do not live up to the terms of the contracts, the 
families can be brought back to a review board hearing and then sent to the 
district attorney's office for possible prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 77 truancy cases that went to court last year, most resulted in 
suspended fines without jail time for parents or their children. Other cases 
were dismissed or the students were put on probation for other, unrelated 
offenses, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the penalties are very, very lenient . . . and many of the judges are 
looking for any way possible of getting rid of these cases," said Tom Higgins, 
the head Los Angeles County deputy district attorney in the Juvenile Division, 
who runs a program in 19 county schools aimed at curbing truancy. "If a kid's 
been missing school extensively and then has attended for two weeks, the judges 
say, 'OK, things are getting better. Dismissed.' " 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials are even more blunt. "The system needs to work 
better and the laws need more teeth," said Nathana Schooler, who oversees the 
elementary school attendance counselors. "It is always that we have to make an 
extreme, concerted effort to make the system work." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Jack Gold, who says he hears several truancy cases a year in San 
Fernando Valley Juvenile Court, said he believes the problem needs to be 
addressed before the case ever gets to court. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the heavy crimes coming through here -- robbery, murder -- these are 
real cumbersome cases to deal with," Gold said. "Often, it comes down to how do 
you make the mother responsible for the kid? She drops the kid off at school, 
she goes to work and the kid leaves school. Who's fault is that?" 
</P>
<P>
 For Ruben and his mother, the review board process helped. The boys are 
regularly attending school and have been late just a few times in the past 
couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I was in court," Ruben's mother said after the board meeting. "It 
was scary. There were all these adults in front of me. But what they said was 
true: you have to go to school and finish." 
</P>
<P>
 "No question, it worked," Confortes said of Ruben's hearing. "Their attendance 
has improved. The mother was given certain directions and she's following 
them." Costly Truants The Los Angeles Unified School District lost about $80 
million last year because of unexcused student absences. The district receives 
state funds for students whose absences are excused, such as for illness or 
family emergencies. The district is not paid when students do not have valid 
excuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Students with high absenteeism are sent to hearings with state-mandated school 
attendance review boards, the final step before cases go to a hearing with the 
district attorney's office. Cases then are sent to court if charges are filed. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1992-93, the following numbers of students attended review board hearings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Elementary school: 263 
</P>
<P>
 * Middle school: 101 
</P>
<P>
 * High school: 123 
</P>
<P>
 For the same year, the following numbers of students attended hearings with 
the district attorney's office: 
</P>
<P>
 * Elementary school: 78 
</P>
<P>
 * Middle school: 84 
</P>
<P>
 * High school: 60 
</P>
<P>
 The following numbers of students had charges filed against them and/or their 
parents and went to court: 
</P>
<P>
 * Elementary school: 25 
</P>
<P>
 * Middle school: 27 
</P>
<P>
 * High school: 25

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COUNTY SENDS 25 TO HELP FIGHT WILDFIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 25 county firefighters were dispatched to Hesperia and other city units 
in the county were placed on alert Monday as wildfires continued to burn, 
threatening mountain and desert resort areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Fire Department dispatcher Leo Schneider said Monday that a team 
of firefighters was sent to assist area units in fighting stubborn blazes which 
have caused the evacuation of campgrounds near Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildfires also caused the evacuation of homes near Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said the county strike team left about 3 p.m. Sunday and it was not 
known when they would return or whether additional county units would be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire departments in Costa Mesa and Santa Ana were also placed on alert in the 
event more help is needed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they need us, we definitely have the resources," Schneider said. "As I 
understand it, they have several fires working up there. Bu we haven't received 
any recent updates."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; OPPOSITION FACED BY PROPOSED TEEN CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed nightclub for teen-agers might be a tough sell to the Planning 
Commission tonight, after a monthlong hearing delay in which efforts to work 
out potential problems failed to sway city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The city planning staff has recommended that commissioners deny a permit to 
convert a former restaurant into a teen dance club called Shout West on 
Marguerite Parkway near Avery Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, which would have a capacity of 600, would not serve alcoholic 
beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans also failed to win the support of Sheriff's Lt. Randy Blair, Mission 
Viejo's chief of police services. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to commissioners, Blair expressed concern about adults socializing 
with teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the petitioners intend to admit adults over 21 to mingle and associate 
with juveniles," Blair wrote, "a potential exists for possible 
less-than-wholesome circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo sheriff's deputies also received a negative report from Anaheim 
police about a club for minors called Kaleidoscope. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair said he was told the nightspot experiences gang-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "While Mission Viejo is not 'claimed' by any gang, we nevertheless have known 
gang members and associates who live in the city," Blair said in the memo. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed club's owners say they just want to provide a safe environment 
for South County teen-agers who have long complained about the lack of youth 
entertainment opportunities in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Security guards will regularly patrol the parking lot and other potential 
problem areas, said Les Wilson, who wants to open the club. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson feels his Mission Viejo location is not comparable with Anaheim because 
Anaheim has a greater gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
 As for teen-agers socializing with adults, Wilson said men in their late 20s 
and older aren't likely to frequent a nightclub that doesn't serve alcohol.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; HIS LOVE FOR CARS SHOWS IN HIS WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You have to take Chuck Swanson's word for it when he says he's a car nut. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not just because he's a police officer or because the 52-year-old 
Anaheim resident has restored hundreds of cars. 
</P>
<P>
 It's that exaggeration and lies don't come easily to the head of the polygraph 
testing unit for the Anaheim Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest evidence of Swanson's automobile passion is Unit 301 -- a restored 
1953 Plymouth Cranbrook police car. 
</P>
<P>
 With contributions from local businesses, about $2,000 of his own money and 
about a year of hard work, Swanson put the aged black-and-white back on the 
California roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to do an old police car," said Swanson, who donated the 
car to Anaheim's police explorer group. "We need all the positive attention we 
can get" in the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The restored car was invited to appear in its first parade Monday during a 
Fourth of July celebration in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Since February, the car has been drawing crowds, starring at police 
graduations and open houses. The car, which bears the sign "not in service" on 
its back windshield, is strictly for show, Swanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of times a week, Swanson takes the vintage car out on the road, and 
that's where the vehicle attracts most of its admirers. One motorist followed 
him five miles just to ask to take pictures of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a lot of comments from people who say, 'Yeah, my dad, or my granddad, 
had a Plymouth like that,' said Swanson, 52, who has been with the Anaheim 
Police Department for 27 years. "It's just good PR (public relations) for the 
department." 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson and the car have also received admiration from an unlikely source. 
</P>
<P>
 "I even get gangbangers who go by and give you the thumbs up," he said. 
"There's a gap between young people and adults, and it's neat to have something 
like this to bring them together." 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson rescued the car, which had weeds growing inside it a year ago, from an 
auto junkyard for ex-movie cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he doesn't know which movies, Swanson said, the car has been featured 
as a taxi cab, a family auto and, of course, a police car in films. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with $10,000 work, most of it donated by local business, the car still 
has its "idiosyncrasies," Swanson says. Sometimes, he has to shut off the 
engine to get the car in first gear. 
</P>
<P>
 The door latch on the driver's side needs to be fixed, and there's a paper 
clip on the old-style siren to keep it from sounding when the car goes more 
than 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 But Unit 301 is getting there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a labor of love," Swanson said. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; CITY TO CONSIDER BUILDING LIBRARY

<TEXT>
<P>
 The young city, without a library within its borders, will spend $24,000 on a 
study to determine whether it should build its own system or continue to pay 
for access to an Orange County branch. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been paying $538,000 annually so its residents can use a branch 
of the Orange County Public Library District in nearby Mission Viejo.But the 
county, strapped for cash, is turning over that branch to Mission Viejo and 
delaying a planned county branch in neighboring Aliso Viejo until 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 So the city of Laguna Hills, incorporated 30 months ago, decided last week to 
hire the consulting firm of David M. Griffith & Associates to help it figure 
out what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is one of several looking at the costs and benefits of opening their 
own libraries in the wake of the county's cutback in library hours and 
services.LYNN FRANEY

 Citing concerns about the city's financial management, Marty Simonoff has 
announced his intention to run for City Council in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 Simonoff, 43, is a retired captain with the Huntington Park Police 
Department.The 13-year Brea resident now works with his family-owned recycling 
and trash hauling business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very concerned that the city will not be able to maintain essential 
public services with a budget deficit estimated in excess of $2 million," 
Simonoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the city to operate in a more efficient and effective manner than in the 
past, a realignment, consolidation, partnership or restructuring of city 
operations is needed. Additionally, the city must also re-evaluate the impact 
of redevelopment on the revenue sources available." 
</P>
<P>
 Simonoff, who is making his first bid for public office, said he is also 
concerned about increasing the number of activities and facilities for youth. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Sonie, is a teacher's aide at Brea Olinda High School. Their 
daughter is a junior at the high school, and their son is a seventh-grader at 
Brea Junior High School.ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; 3 OPTIONS OFFERED ON LA VETA PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A citizens advisory committee studying ways to accommodate future traffic 
growth on a historic stretch of La Veta Avenue offered the City Council three 
options at a study session last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Veta Avenue Community Advisory Committee, which began meeting about 
nine months ago, could not agree on one recommendation because of conflicts 
between residents who want to preserve the area's historic flavor and others 
who want to accommodate traffic that may double within 20 years, said city 
traffic engineer and committee chairman Bernie W. Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
 The group -- composed of community members, business representatives and city 
staff -- was finally able to agree on three proposals: to reduce traffic on the 
street by restricting land use, to create a "reversible travel lane" for use 
during peak traffic hours and to widen the road by about 12 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, 11,000 to 12,000 vehicles use the street each day. The city 
projects that the total could increase to 21,000 vehicles per day by the year 
2010. 
</P>
<P>
 Public hearings on the three options in the group's final report are scheduled 
to begin Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Veta project would be part of a citywide program to improve La Veta, 
Main Street and West Chapman Avenue, Dennis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program may cost more than $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to a separate study of La Veta Avenue between Cambridge and 
Glassell streets because residents strongly objected to proposed changes, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all candor, there were some direct conflicts between the preservation 
element and the circulation element," said Dennis, who characterized the 
discussions as "serious and intense." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Joanne Coontz said the city should compliment Dennis "on working 
with such a diverse group." Dennis assured her that "no blood was shed." 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed by council members, Dennis said that city staff members would 
recommend widening the street as traffic increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question the council would have to wrestle with would be the mitigation 
efforts," he said. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; TEAM'S FIREWORKS STOLEN FROM STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pre-dawn burglary Monday disrupted the fund-raising efforts of the Costa 
Mesa High School girls basketball team, which lost about $2,800 in fireworks it 
had planned to sell for the Fourth of July holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said five people, using a crowbar, broke into the Freedom Fireworks 
stand at Grace Lane and Baker Street about 2:45 a.m. and removed 150 boxes of 
pyrotechnics worth more than $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours later, authorities recovered some of the fireworks and arrested 
four juveniles and an adult. The burglars managed to pry open a hole in the 
corrugated metal stand, even though the booth was guarded by team supporters in 
a mobile home parked nearby. Further details were not available. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls basketball squad has sold fireworks for the last six years to raise 
funds for new uniforms and equipment. Lisa McNamee, the team's head coach, 
estimated the loss at $2,800. Those wishing to make a donation to the Costa 
Mesa High team can write to McNamee at 2400 Main St., Suite 201, Irvine, Calif. 
92714.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; MAN ONCE ADOPTED HEADS ADOPTION UNIT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Few things please Stephen Abdo more than seeing children adopted by caring 
families. Except, of course, having a hand in making that happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The local businessman was recently named president of the Orange County Board 
of Trustees of Holy Family Services, the same adoption agency that placed him 
with his own family almost 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really, honestly feel it's more a privilege than anything," Abdo said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's great "to have an opportunity to help these young birth parents make the 
decision to give their child up for adoption and help families adopt children. 
(The agency) really affects the lives of all these people, and hopefully in a 
positive vein," Abdo said. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 27, Abdo, 39, was selected to lead the board after four years as a 
trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that five years ago he and his wife, Liz, became involved with the 
agency because they appeared to be unable to have children of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 But after they had gone through much of the process to adopt a child through 
Holy Family, Liz became pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple eventually had two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Family, which has served the community since 1945, is the second largest 
private adoption agency in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 It provides free birth and parent counseling as well as adoption services, 
regardless of ability to pay, said spokeswoman Mecca Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Abdo said his experiences as an adopted child and a prospective 
adoptive parent make him especially appreciative of his new position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very lucky; I have great parents. Hopefully, I'll be able to do for 
some young child what I have had done for me," he said. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; LAST YEAR'S BUDGET GETS FINAL CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has amended the city's $26-million general-fund budget for 
fiscal 1993-94 to reflect expenses that were not anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 The city spent $1.7 million more than it budgeted, according to Finance 
Director Brian Mayhew, including $1 million in payments for unused sick leave 
and vacation time that employees have converted to cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Fire Department exceeded its overtime budget by nearly 
$670,000, and the city manager's office incurred an additional $35,000 expense, 
Mayhew said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those expenses must be reflected in the "final numbers" for the 1993-94 fiscal 
year, which ended Thursday, Mayhew said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except for the size, this is fairly routine," Mayhew said of the council 
action last week, adding that the budget is always "cleaned up" before the 
start of a new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in adopting the 1993-94 budget, city officials assumed that 
medical expenses for employees would be reduced and that employees would not be 
allowed to convert unused sick leave to cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, city officials said overtime expenses in the Fire Department would be 
reduced by 95% after the council approved the department's reorganization in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 Contract negotiations with employee groups about changes in benefits are still 
going on, officials said, and a lawsuit by the firefighters union delayed a 
Fire Department reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a Superior Court judge ruled against the firefighters union, the 
delay caused overtime expenses at the Fire Department to soar above the 
budgeted $75,000, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting City Manager Robert J. Huntley said that city efforts to put limits on 
how much unused sick leave and vacation time that employees can convert to cash 
had the opposite effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who had a whole bunch of stuff accumulated through the years were 
converting them" to cash, Huntley said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that city officials hope to set limits on the current practice of 
unlimited cash payments for unused sick leave and vacation time as part of the 
effort to control city expenses. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; COUNCIL MEMBERS TO DEBATE TERM LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members will debate their own fates tonight as they argue about 
how many terms they can serve before they are required to leave the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council already has approved a ballot measure that, if passed by voters in 
November, would limit council members to two four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli wants to give residents the option of voting on 
another measure that would limit council members to three consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Saltarelli and Councilman Jeffery M. Thomas assert that a limit of two terms 
would weaken Tustin's clout on county and regional boards that operate on a 
seniority basis. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Pro Tem Jim Potts, who thinks a three-term limit is too long, 
contends that the city wouldn't lose any more influence with shorter term 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the agenda for the 7 p.m. council meeting is a proposed ordinance that 
would regulate public nudity, though Potts said he didn't know of any incidents 
of public nudity occurring in the city that would have prompted the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting City Atty. Lois E. Jeffrey said the ordinance "reflects the latest 
thinking of the United States Supreme Court on the issue" and that it would 
give Tustin "more effective tools for regulating public nudity than exist in 
the current city code." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would not apply to establishments devoted to theatrical 
performances, which could include topless bars. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also is scheduled to consider a measure prohibiting public 
officials from accepting gifts from people who do business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 If the gift ban is approved, the council also would have to amend the city's 
conflict-of-interest code. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, in addition, will discuss a proposed ballot measure that would 
allow voters to decide if the city's solid-waste disposal contract should be 
put out to bid every five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Potts said a competitive bidding process would result in cost savings for 
Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was open to bid, we'd get a much better deal for the city," he 
maintained. ALAN EYERLY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers from the Humane Society will canvass city streets over the next few 
weeks in a campaign to encourage pet owners to obtain licenses for their dogs 
and cats. 
</P>
<P>
 All neighborhoods in the city will be targeted, said City Manager Jerry L. 
Bankston, who estimated that 15% to 20% of Seal Beach pets do not have proper 
registrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will spend about $6,000 on the effort but expects to receive $15,000 
in new pet license fees, Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The push to license pets comes as the city recently set up a new computer 
system that will store all animal control records. 
</P>
<P>
 Pet owners will be able to purchase licenses from the Humane Society workers, 
who also will distribute information about rabies vaccinations. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; NONPROFIT AGENCIES WILL NEED TO RELOCATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two dozen nonprofit agencies and charities that work out of the city's 
Multiservices Center must vacate the facility by early next year, the City 
Council has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the groups could be relocated to city offices in the corporation yard. 
But other groups might have to find new quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's decision last week was designed to save money. The city, which 
offers center tenants rents well below market rates, loses about $65,000 a year 
operating the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jamboree Road building needs earthquake retrofitting as well as $400,000 
worth of repairs to the air-conditioning system. The City Council hopes to sell 
the building rather than make the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Center tenants fought to keep the facility open, saying the city was best 
served by clustering its nonprofit agencies in a central location. The groups 
provide such services as child care, drug prevention classes, temporary housing 
and family counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council said it was not economically wise to operate the center. It 
set Jan. 31, 1995, as the date when all tenants should be out of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members directed city officials to locate as many agencies as possible 
in vacant city office space. They also asked officials to examine whether the 
city might rent private office space and sublease it back to some of the 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can make a long-term commitment to this building," 
Councilman Greg Smith said. "But we can't afford not to make a long-term 
commitment to these groups." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are now in the process of having the Multiservices Center 
appraised. The 40,000-square-foot building was appraised at $4.5 million 
several years ago -- before the local real estate market slump. A preliminary 
appraisal conducted in June pegged the center's value at $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Paula Werner said she hopes the city will work to keep the 
agencies' rents as low as possible. She noted that the groups could lose grant 
money if they are forced to increase their administrative costs by paying 
higher rents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are providing needed services for the city," Werner said. "I think the 
city has a responsibility to help them." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY ADDS $3 MILLION TO ITS RESERVE FUND

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a fiscal 1994-95 budget that increases the 
city's reserves without raising taxes or cutting services. 
</P>
<P>
 The $59-million general fund budget balances the city's books while adding 
about $3 million to its reserve fund. 
</P>
<P>
 No major cutbacks were proposed by City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. Earlier in 
the year, the city eliminated 70 jobs in an effort to close a $4.5-million 
budget shortfall. Some workers were laid off, while others decided to take 
early retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they were prepared to make further cuts in staffing last 
month when they presented the budget. But the city's fiscal health improved 
slightly over the past six months, making further reductions unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, the city has eliminated more than 100 jobs at a 
savings of about $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the 1994-95 budget last week, making few changes in 
the spending blueprint. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; EX-SOUTH VIETNAM LEADER TO GIVE TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The former commander-in-chief of the South Vietnamese Army and former 
president of the Republic of Vietnam, Gen. Nguyen Khanh, is scheduled to 
address the Orange County Forum, a public affairs organization. 
</P>
<P>
 His talk, titled "The Economic War for Vietnam," is expected to focus on the 
possibility of Vietnam becoming a colony of China if the United States does not 
immediately invest in its economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Khanh was born in South Vietnam in 1927. He graduated from a French military 
academy in 1947 and pursued a military career. He became South Vietnam's chief 
of state in 1964 but was overthrown in a coup d'etat in 1965 and left Saigon 
for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977 he immigrated to the United States and now lives in the San Francisco 
area with his wife, Nguyen Le Tran, and four of their six children. 
</P>
<P>
 Khanh will speak at an Orange County Forum luncheon meeting, scheduled for 
11:30 a.m. Thursday at the Hyatt Regency Irvine, 17900 Jamboree Road. Admission 
is $25 for forum members and $35 for non-members. For reservations, call (714) 
588-9884.

3RD VICTIM OF MULTIPLE CRASH ON SANTA ANA FREEWAY DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Gardena woman who was one of several people struck by a car while looking at 
the wreckage of a crash on the Santa Ana Freeway died Monday, bringing the 
accident's toll to three dead and five hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Christina Macias, 27, died about 10:30 a.m. at UCI Medical Center in Orange, 
where she had been taken after a string of collisions early Sunday near the 
Ball Road off-ramp. Also dead as a result of the crashes were Elizabeth Newman, 
35, of Dominguez Hills, and Patricia Ann Maglietto, 24, of Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the California Highway Patrol, the chain of events began shortly 
before 3:30 a.m. Sunday when the driver of a Mustang going about 100 m.p.h. 
rear-ended a Ford pickup truck driven by Alfredo Cortez, 51, of Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Mustang, Rafael Cruz, 27, of Santa Ana, tried to flee on 
foot, but was captured by police and arrested on suspicion of felony drunken 
driving and misdemeanor hit-and-run driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after that collision, a Honda Civic driven by Lori Kitagawa, 19, of La 
Palma slammed into the Mustang. The drivers of a Camaro and a Thunderbird then 
stopped to notify authorities about the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Maglietto was in the Camaro with her boyfriend, Justin Sarver, 21, of North 
Hollywood. Newman and Macias were in the Thunderbird driven by Karen Counsell, 
38, of Torrance, who called 911 on her car telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Counsell, the passengers of her car along with Maglietto and Sarver next went 
into the highway's center divider to look at the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Elisa Ortiz, 28, of Los Angeles, driving a Toyota off-road 
vehicle, struck them. 
</P>
<P>
 Maglietto was killed instantly. Newman suffered fatal injuries and died within 
hours at the hospital. Sarver and Macias were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortez, the driver of the Ford pickup, and Counsell were slightly hurt. Ortiz, 
who is pregnant, also received minor injuries although she was trapped in her 
vehicle and had to be removed by emergency crews. Police said she has not been 
cited pending further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitagawa, who was driving the Honda, was listed in good condition Monday 
evening at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. Sarver was listed in fair 
condition after surgery at the same hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, who is being held in the county jail in connection with the crash, was 
treated for moderate injuries at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, a hospital 
spokeswoman said.

FAMILY'S FEAR TURNS TO RELIEF WHEN DISABLED MAN IS LOCATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For nearly a week, Roy Dahlstrom searched Santa Ana bus routes, talked to bus 
drivers and followed leads until they turned cold -- all in search of his 
mentally disabled son who seemingly vanished during one of his first outings 
alone from a local board-and-care facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last day or two, we really felt like something very bad had happened 
to him, something horrible," said Dahlstrom, who was joined in the search by 
several family members. 
</P>
<P>
 But about the time the Dahlstrom family was fearing the worst, Long Beach 
police picked up the hungry and badly sunburned Bob Dahlstrom, who had simply 
taken the wrong bus out of Santa Ana on June 27 and could not find his way 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 His feet covered with blisters, the 48-year-old man had not eaten in six days 
and was discovered walking through the Lucky supermarket near the Long Beach 
Marina, looking longingly at shelves of food. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his haggard appearance, store assistant manager Chuck Keith said he 
first mistook Dahlstrom for a transient and asked him to leave. But Keith 
called police Sunday when the strangely quiet and unkept man returned 
repeatedly over the next few days, always looking at the food. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him if I could call the police so that he could get some help and 
something to eat," Keith said. "He just said, 'Yeah.' When the police came, I 
guess they checked his ID and found out who he was. They got him a cup of 
coffee and sweet roll and he was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Dahlstrom said he was elated when the call came from police. 
</P>
<P>
 When reunited at the family home in Dana Point, Dahlstrom said his son told 
him that he had mistakenly boarded a bus that dropped him in Sunset Beach 
instead of in Santa Ana where was scheduled to attend a county-run class for 
mentally disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
 From Sunset Beach, Roy Dahlstrom said his son spent his time walking and 
sleeping on benches. Perhaps hindering the family's search for him, Roy 
Dahlstrom said, is the fact that his son rarely speaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He won't talk no matter how hungry he gets," his father said. "He's very 
quiet and he would walk away quickly from a stranger unless somebody pushed the 
conversation."

HOMELESSNESS IN THE VALLEY / SURVIVING DAY BY DAY; NOWHERE TO LIVE -- AND YET 
AT HOME; PROFILE: MOST LOCAL STREET DWELLERS ARE OUR EX-NEIGHBORS, FORMER 
CO-WORKERS, OLD SCHOOLMATES. SOME HAVE FALLEN VICTIM TO THE ECONOMY, ABUSE, 
EVEN THE EARTHQUAKE.

 Roaming the streets of Van Nuys with her shopping cart at night, Carolyn Harr 
sometimes walks by her alma mater, Birmingham High School, where she was a 
student more than two decades ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Like many of the San Fernando Valley's homeless, Harr grew up here. But she 
says her native soil doesn't always feel like home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley has few services to offer her, and she and the growing number of 
people who spend their days and nights encamped in cars, back yards, parks and 
garages are often ignored by their former neighbors and schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a mule skin of a woman," said 47-year-old Harr, her tanned skin tough 
from seven years on the Valley's streets. "It hurts very much. I am tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Harr, who said she fled an abusive husband in Phoenix to return to the 
familiar Valley, often sleeps in Louise Park in Reseda during the day because 
she is afraid she will be attacked if she closes her eyes at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in Downtown's Skid Row or parts of South-Central Los Angeles where the 
homeless crowd sidewalks and are highly visible, the 6,000 to 10,000 homeless 
living in the sprawling San Fernando Valley are often hidden. Some panhandle in 
parking lots or next to freeway on-ramps, but many others accept food from 
churches or food banks and otherwise remain out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that most of the Valley's homeless are former residents of its 
homes, students of its schools and employees of its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are members of the Valley community," said Jeff Farber of the Los 
Angeles Family Housing Corp., which runs the Trudy and Norman Louis Valley 
Shelter in North Hollywood. "They are not running away to the Valley, they are 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 The face of the Valley's homeless mirrors its overall population. There are 
more whites and Latinos and fewer African Americans here than on Skid Row or in 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, studies have shown that about half of the homeless are victims of 
economic circumstances such as the loss of a job, cuts in public assistance or 
separation from a spouse who was paying the rent or mortgage. About one-third 
to one-half of the nation's homeless are mentally ill or substance abusers. 
Another third are veterans. But all of the categories can overlap and often do. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter providers say a rising number of the Valley's homeless are families 
with young children, many of whom are victims of the recession, cuts in public 
assistance, domestic abuse, even the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 There are between 43,000 and 77,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, 
according to Shelter Partnership, a Los Angeles nonprofit organization that 
tracks the homeless. And the numbers are growing -- by 13% last year and at 
least that much this year. The partnership estimates the Valley's homeless 
population is growing at the same rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every family I see, there are two I can't," said Farber of the Valley 
Shelter. "The way this community is set up geographically, you don't see them. 
But they are all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the service organizations for the Valley's homeless are small and 
operate at capacity. They also are spread out geographically, making 
cooperation and transportation between them difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie, a 52-year-old unemployed machinist and construction worker from 
Sylmar, who asked that his full name not be used for fear someone he knows 
would recognize him, has lived in his truck for less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, he has already memorized the hopscotch schedule of free meals and showers 
scattered across the Valley: Monday breakfast at the United Methodist Church of 
Sepulveda in North Hills; Tuesday sandwiches at St. Jane Frances Church in 
North Hollywood; Wednesday dinner at The Church on the Way in Van Nuys, and so 
on. "It's tough," Willie said, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the mushrooming homeless population is a growing number of residents 
who are, themselves, dangerously close to being on the streets. The number of 
Valley residents on welfare more than doubled between January, 1991, and July, 
1993, to 174,000, a rate twice that of some neighborhoods in South-Central Los 
Angeles. The Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. estimates that between 50,000 
and 100,000 Valley jobs were lost in the past decade. And in parts of the 
northeast Valley, the poverty rate hovers between 25% and 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 census shows that parts of the Valley, including Arleta and Pacoima, 
have some of the highest rates of residential overcrowding in Los Angeles 
County. Experts say people who make a tightly cramped living arrangement with 
relatives or acquaintances are just one step away from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can be kicked out in 10 minutes instead of 30 days," said the Rev. Gene 
Boutilier, executive director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, a 
new government agency that coordinates the city and county homeless services. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the Valley's housing shortage was the loss of more than 20,000 units 
due to the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, according to the Los Angeles Housing 
Department. Now, thousands of people are using 18-month rental vouchers in 
apartments they cannot afford without the assistance.  
</P>
<P>
 "The clock's ticking," Boutilier said. "We do not have and are not going to 
have enough affordable housing for people who need it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Los Angeles Coalition to End 
Homelessness, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sitting on an economic earthquake in the Valley," he said. "I have yet 
to see a plan to deal with what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clinton Administration's pledge to reduce homelessness by a third 
nationwide before the end of its first term, Los Angeles is expected to receive 
about $20 million from a Department of Housing and Urban Development pilot 
project over three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first homeless allocation, the Administration is seeking an 
unprecedented $1.7 billion for the nation's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon convinced the city to 
include Pacoima in the original application, which concentrated on 
South-Central Los Angeles, East Los Angeles and Downtown. Mayor Richard 
Riordan's office is in the final stages of developing a plan for the funds, 
which will probably go toward drop-in centers, emergency shelters and permanent 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one expects the Valley's fraction -- about $350,000 -- to end its 
homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Without communitywide recognition of the link between homelessness and other 
social problems, some advocates say, the problem will get steadily worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on a wool blanket in a Van Nuys park, a pair of socks drying beside 
her in the scorching sun, Carolyn Harr listed a few regrets: She wished she had 
finished high school, learned to type and raised her four children, two of whom 
are now in foster homes. If she had been taken out of an abusive household as a 
child, she said, she might have escaped the later alcoholism and abusive 
relationships that sentenced her to life on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she welcomes the idea of having a place to live and someone to take 
care of her. But she doesn't let the thought linger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too late for me," Harr said, shaking her head. "I'm past the age of 
wanting a home and beautiful geraniums."

'INTERDEPENDENCE' DAY SPIRIT UNFLAGGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM and MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first frightening minutes after the Northridge earthquake, Ray Hudson 
stood in his plaid bathrobe in the middle of the Oakridge Mobile Home Park and 
watched in horror as a wall of flame swallowed seven of his neighbors' homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost six months later, Hudson on Monday again ventured out into his street 
-- this time decked out as Uncle Sam in red and white striped pants, a dark 
blue jacket, a fake goatee and a tall top hat. 
</P>
<P>
 The homey parade epitomized the spirit of community that has emerged in the 
park since the earthquake shook all 600 homes off their foundations -- forcing 
neighbors to live in one another's garages and driveways while the homes were 
put back in place and releveled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it's 218 years after the Declaration of Independence, we learned 
it's not only independence but interdependence that's important," said resident 
Joe Mayzels. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Arnold, who in six years never had exchanged more than pleasantries 
with her next-door neighbor Kathryn Franks, lived with her husband for several 
months after the quake in a motor home in Frank's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone sticks together here now. We all know each other much better after 
the quake," said Arnold, who sustained about $40,000 in damage, including 
repair costs for a baby grand piano that careened through her living-room wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was but one of the many ways that people in Southern California 
found to celebrate freedom on a day that dawned cloudy but developed into a 
near-perfect backdrop for parades, picnics, concerts and fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley, earthquake recovery was the theme of the 16th annual Fourth of 
July Fireworks Spectacular at Cal State Northridge. Event proceeds were to be 
donated to nearby businesses and residents affected by the quake.  
</P>
<P>
 The event featured carnival booths and rides as well as a traditional 
fireworks show. 
</P>
<P>
 Most adults said they came to hear concerts, such as the one performed by the 
pop duo Captain & Tennille. Madeline Lopez, a Universal City resident, arrived 
early so her family could set up picnic blankets on the football field, close 
to the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think of it like camping," she said. "We're outside for the day. We only 
do it one day a year." 
</P>
<P>
 The mood was similarly upbeat for many at an urban version of a country picnic 
put on in a parking lot by the Union Rescue Mission in Downtown Los Angeles, 
where 50 volunteers served 400 pounds of barbecued ribs, 400 pounds of chicken, 
1,500 pounds of watermelon, 500 pounds of coleslaw and 100 pounds of ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,500 men, women and children from the streets and hotels nearby 
wound through a serving line and then ate to the throbbing beat of rock, rap 
and hip-hop music churned out by two Christian "biker" bands. For the children 
there were games and a petting zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunland-Tujunga, dozens of people sat in lawn chairs along Foothill 
Boulevard to view a procession of horseback riders, Boy Scout troops and a bevy 
of colorful clowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake View Terrace resident Don Stoll, who sported red, white and blue tennis 
shoes, said he has attended the Sunland-Tujunga parade each year for the past 
10 years "just for laughs." 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest float they had last year was a locksmith truck with crepe paper 
on it," Stoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Sepulveda, more than 
300 veterans, family members and others gathered for the hospital's 18th annual 
barbecue.  
</P>
<P>
 The temblor has forced the hospital to abandon its overnight operations for up 
to two more years and many veterans worried that the nearest overnight 
emergency care is in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they could afford to put a bonus on the highways but not put money into 
veterans, then that's a lot of bull," said Edward Tashman, a World War II 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mood was lighter among others who listened to classic rock tunes and 
played carnival-style games on the lawn outside the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more popular soldiers was "Uncle Bert," who was clad in red, white 
and blue from his shoelaces to his baseball cap, and crowned with the Liberty 
Bell and the flags of all five military branches. He passed out lollipops to 
everyone as a button on his vest played the "Star Spangled Banner." 
</P>
<P>
 "I entertain the troops every holiday by dressing up in whatever I can find," 
said Bert Mallory, a Korean War veteran. "I have about 50 to 100 hats, plus all 
kinds of clothes." Back in Sylmar, park residents spent 45 minutes circling 
along tree-lined streets in vans and trucks gussied up with stars, pinwheels 
and balloons.  
</P>
<P>
 Some dressed in elaborate red, white and blue, while a woman portraying Betsy 
Ross waved the flag from the back of a truck.

RETRIAL TO GET UNDER WAY IN 1980 'ACID MURDER'; COURTS: DEFENDANT WILL ACT AS 
HIS OWN LAWYER. HIS CONVICTION WAS OVERTURNED AFTER A RULING ON HIS CONFESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nearly 14 years have passed since Patricia Worrell's hopes of becoming a 
lawyer vaporized one August night when she opened the door of her Sylmar home 
to a stranger who tossed a quart of lye in her face. 
</P>
<P>
 Blinded and disfigured, Worrell died 10 days later, bleeding to death as the 
caustic chemical she had inadvertently swallowed burned through her esophagus, 
then destroyed an artery. She left behind a 10-year-old son, who had been 
awakened by her shrieks of pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutors say the attack was paid for by Worrell's jilted fiance, 
who was inside playing cards with her when two men, one carrying a glass jar 
filled with lye, knocked on her door. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the story of Worrell's excruciating death again will be told as the 
retrial of Ricardo H. Robinson, one of three men convicted of first-degree 
murder, mayhem and conspiracy in connection with the attack, begins in a Van 
Nuys courtroom. Testimony begins today. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who claims he had no role in the plot to maim Worrell, will act as 
his own lawyer. His 1982 conviction was overturned two years ago by a federal 
appeals court that ruled his confession to the crime was illegally obtained. It 
was his fifth appeal in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors Robert L. Cohen and Jodi Link will re-create events that happened 
14 years ago -- but they won't be able to use Robinson's 1980 statements to 
police. Cohen said he was surprised to locate most of the original witnesses, 
who, he said, "are alive and well." 
</P>
<P>
 But Worrell's older brother, Bill Dziamba, who said he attended court hearings 
for four years, doesn't plan to be in court the second time around. The case 
has left him bitter and questioning the efficacy of the criminal justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sham," Dziamba said in a telephone interview from his home in Ohio. 
"This guy threw acid in my sister's face. God, this thing. . . . She was my 
baby sister She was 34 years old, and she was going to graduate from law 
school, and she was killed by some creep. What has this country come to?" 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "acid murder" shocked the collective conscience of Los Angeles. 
The county supervisors posted a $25,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of anyone responsible for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 By that December, the trail led to Worrell's former fiance, Richard Morton 
Gilman of Burbank, a man 10 years older than she, a man who had recently 
graduated from law school but had failed the bar exam. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple met and fell in love at the San Fernando Valley College of Law, 
which has since ceased operation. Worrell, who was to graduate that December, 
had been elected president of the student bar association.  
</P>
<P>
 Gilman even gave her his grandmother's ring.  
</P>
<P>
 But Worrell broke off the engagement and refused to give back the ring, Cohen 
said. She filed a battery complaint against Gilman after they quarreled 
violently over the ring, but she dropped the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 A month before the attack, according to court records, Gilman met a prostitute 
in a hotel bar in Las Vegas and told her his tale of woe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lamenting his lost love, he gets together with a hooker," Cohen said. "He 
asked her if she knew anyone who could do a job for him. She set up a meeting 
with her pimp. He agreed to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 That "job" consisted of disfiguring Worrell. Gilman allegedly paid $750 to the 
pimp, a stuttering, some-time bounty hunter named Bobby Ray Savage.  
</P>
<P>
 Savage initially brought another man with him to Los Angeles for an aborted 
attempt at disfiguring Worrell. But the attack did not occur because she had 
house guests, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned with Robinson, who allegedly demanded an additional $1,000 
payment, which he never received, the documents say.  
</P>
<P>
 The year 1982 brought trials and convictions against Gilman, Robinson and 
Savage. All three were serving 25 years to life in state prison, and the case 
seemed to be forgotten, left to gather dust in the courthouse archives. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robinson wouldn't give up. After losing three appeals in the state and 
federal courts, he wrote William Genego at USC Law Center's Post Conviction 
Justice Project. Genego lost a fourth appeal before convincing the 9th U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse Robinson's conviction on the ground his 
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was violated. 
</P>
<P>
 The divided court found that Robinson had given incriminating statements to 
police, even after telling the officers, according to court records: "I have to 
get me a good lawyer. . . . Can I make a phone call?" 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1966 Miranda decision, police must stop questioning a suspect who 
asks for a lawyer, and the prosecution cannot use any incriminating statements 
made after the request. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the retrial jury won't hear Robinson's statement, which weakens 
the prosecution's case considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators were able to track down a star witness -- Kim Bricker, the 
former Las Vegas prostitute who introduced Gilman to Savage. Bricker, who 
provided key testimony during the earlier trials after being granted immunity 
from prosecution, had moved to Pennsylvania, where she works for a popular 
candy maker. 
</P>
<P>
 And the prosecution has enlisted another surprise witness: Bobby Ray Savage, 
who is serving a sentence of 25 years to life at the California Men's Colony in 
San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutors said Savage, who has lost all his appeals, has an "obvious" 
motive to testify: "He's probably asking himself, 'Why should I let this guy go 
free when I'm sitting in here?' "

THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS; FOURTH OF JULY REVELERS GATHER TO FROLIC, FEAST, 
CELEBRATE THE FLAG

<P>
 From a street fair in Ventura to a park in Thousand Oaks, Ventura County began 
the Fourth of July with eyes focused at ground level -- on parades and 
patriotic speakers -- but ended by staring skyward at spectacular fireworks 
displays. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a day when just about every ingredient for a good time fell into place: 
bright, sunny weather, lots of activities and no major problems, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 By evening, Ventura County fire officials had not responded to any fires 
sparked by fireworks. Last Fourth of July, they were sent out on 25 small fires 
and five people were hospitalized with fireworks-related injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest daytime event took place in Ventura, where a children's parade 
kicked off a street fair that drew thousands to the roped-off downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of children -- many dressed in red, white and blue -- lined up as 
early as 9:30 a.m. to take part in the "Push 'Em, Pull 'Em" parade -- a 
collection of decorated wagons, tricycles, skateboards and scooters. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the starting point, Vincent O'Neill Sr. sat in a lawn chair next to his 
4-year-old grandson, Matt, who was visiting from Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, look at the flags, Matt," O'Neill exclaimed. The boy sat up in his chair, 
but seemed less enthusiastic than his grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have this in Oregon," O'Neill explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Phillips was trying to hold together the wagon she had customized with 
a cardboard box for her 5-year-old daughter, Allie. The woman seemed a bit 
frustrated as she marched through the parade with the box hanging off the wagon 
while Allie scampered around in a Pebbles outfit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always end up pulling the wagon, and she always ends up walking," said 
Phillips, a veteran of four Fourth of July parades. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Eiland snapped photos of parade participants, such as the half-dozen 
children chugging along dressed as box cars. "They look so cute," Eiland cooed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in this parade at least six years," said Dorcie Garcken, who 
supervised the children, all from the same Ventura neighborhood. "But this is 
our first group effort." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the busiest areas at the street fair was the "First Sunday in the Park" 
arts and crafts show. Never mind that it was Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can only show your work here if you have an original craft," said Elena 
Brokaw, of the city's cultural affairs office. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew Lurie of Oak View had original crafts: ceramic flutes and whistles shaped 
like animals. "This is my squeeze for making money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Stone was painting portraits at $15 a shot. By 11:30 a.m., she had sold 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have portraits of my children that were drawn at Disneyland," said Lois 
Crumpacker, commissioning a portrait of her two grandchildren to hang next to 
the others on her bedroom wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone seemed to be in the holiday spirit -- especially over on Main Street, 
where the Leroy Andrews Band played Dixieland and nonprofit groups sold food. 
</P>
<P>
 How was business? 
</P>
<P>
 "Good, good, we've had a steady line all day," said Joe Benser of the Elks, 
whose group was selling tri-tip. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Flavorful Fantasies ice cream stand, Dick Meeks said business started 
booming as soon as the sun burst through the morning fog. "You need sunshine 
for ice cream," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities estimated street fair attendance at 30,000 to 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Park in Thousand Oaks didn't attract that many people, but it 
was crowded nonetheless as about 250 picnickers played volleyball and soccer 
and tossed Frisbees. Charcoal grills filled the air with the rich smells of 
barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, the Fourth of July is always a day of fellowship and relaxation," 
said Gary Thrasher, 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Carol Lappinga, 32, mixed cream and boysenberries to make ice cream. 
"This is a time to be grateful for everything that we have in our lives, 
especially friends," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, 36-year-old Tommy Scott peered into a portable television to 
keep tabs on the soccer match between the United States and Brazil. Scott used 
to live in Brazil and didn't think it was unpatriotic to root for the South 
American team. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no place like America," he declared. " But when it comes to soccer, 
I really favor Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At a city-sponsored picnic at Arroyo Vista Community Park in Moorpark, the 
patriotic significance of the holiday was not forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a green World War II uniform decorated with 12 medals, 73-year-old 
Manuel Eneriz recalled how he and thousands of other Americans fought for 
freedom in the Philippines. In graphic detail, he described seeing comrades 
die. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up in the heavens, hoping that our dear Lord would take heed and 
that a miracle would happen," Eneriz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanning a crowd that included two dozen children, he added: 
</P>
<P>
 "I am proud today to be able to help young people understand the high price we 
have paid for our freedom. For me, every day is a freedom day."

STATE'S CASH CRUNCH TO DELAY ROAD PROJECTS; TRANSPORTATION: SHIFT OF FUNDS TO 
SEISMIC RETROFITTING MEANS THAT SIX IMPROVEMENTS, INCLUDING WIDENING VENTURA 
FREEWAY'S WORST BOTTLENECK, MAY BE POSTPONED SEVERAL YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County motorists may have to endure the Ventura Freeway's worst 
bottleneck well into the 21st Century as a result of a state fiscal crunch that 
is likely to force delays in funding for planned road projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The $53-million widening of the freeway over the Santa Clara River is one of 
six major projects in Ventura County that may be postponed for years due to a 
shortfall of state transportation dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Up and down the state, cash-strapped Caltrans is re-examining its commitment 
to road construction projects with an eye toward shifting funds to seismic 
retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've frozen the process to give ourselves an opportunity to reassess our 
list," said Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago. "When you are looking at Ventura 
County, basically any job there could be a candidate for delay." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say drastic delays are unavoidable because voters rejected a 
statewide bond initiative on the June 7 ballot that would have provided $1 
billion for seismic strengthening. Without those bond funds, Caltrans has to 
raid other projects to cover the cost of bringing freeway bridges up to 
earthquake safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials who have been in touch with Caltrans said they hold little 
hope for local road projects, ranging from the Ventura Freeway expansion to 
construction of new freeway ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it means is these projects are not going to happen in a timely manner," 
said Christopher Stephens, manager of planning and highway programs for the 
Ventura County Transportation Commission. "Projects that are needed today -- 
and were needed yesterday -- are not going to happen when they were scheduled." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before hearing Caltrans' bleak news, county officials were anxious about 
their ability to fund their share of local road and rail projects. But 
Transportation Commission officials last week rejected a half-cent sales tax 
measure for the fall ballot, fearing voters would turn it down, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are experiencing a lot of transportation funding shortfalls in Ventura 
County and the state problem isn't helping," said Carlos Fernandez, the 
commission's manager of transportation planning and legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The six projects that may be delayed include two that have better odds than 
the rest of moving forward on schedule, Stephens said. But he noted that 
Caltrans has sent the county early signals that "everything will be held out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If two are allowed to go forward, those will likely be the reconstruction of a 
Pacific Coast Highway interchange at Oxnard to improve port access for trucks, 
and the widening of a stretch of California 126 near Fillmore, Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The following is a rundown of the six projects that state transportation 
officials are considering putting on hold while diverting funds to seismic 
retrofitting: 
</P>
<P>
 * The widening of a 1.7-mile stretch of the Ventura Freeway from Vineyard 
Avenue in Oxnard to Johnson Drive in Ventura. Scheduled to begin in 1996, the 
project is designed to unclog the worst remaining bottleneck on the 101 from 
Los Angeles to San Jose. Plans include reconstructing the bridge spanning the 
Santa Clara River, so costs may exceed the $53 million Caltrans had penciled 
out. More than half that sum was to come from the cities of Ventura and Oxnard. 
Stephens said early indications from Caltrans are that the project may be 
pushed back another four years. 
</P>
<P>
 * The $30-million reconstruction of the Pleasant Valley Road interchange with 
Pacific Coast Highway, providing an extension of Rice Avenue to Hueneme Road. 
This project is designed to improve truck access to the port by upgrading a 
40-year-old, then-rural interchange that was never intended to carry much 
commercial traffic. Stephens said he has high hopes that the interchange work, 
scheduled to start in 1997, will go forward because federal demonstration 
project funds are involved. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reconstruction of the Lewis Road interchange with the Ventura Freeway in 
Camarillo. This project will provide easier access to the Ventura Freeway from 
Lewis Road, where no direct ramps exist currently. The $17-million allocated 
for the reconstruction includes funds to buy property for a Camarillo station 
to serve Metrolink, and eventually Amtrak, trains. The project was scheduled to 
start in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 * The widening of the Seaward Avenue interchange with the Ventura Freeway in 
Ventura. This project was scheduled to start in 1997 at an estimated cost of 
$8.5 million. Plans also include revising ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 * The widening and straightening of a winding two-lane stretch of California 
126 near Fillmore to Powell Road. This is a continuation of a long-running 
project to reduce accident rates along the road from Santa Paula to the county 
line. Plans for the $10-million, five-mile project call for adding two lanes 
and building a median to help prevent head-on car crashes. Since funds were 
allocated for this work two months ago, Stephens said he wants to make a case 
for it to begin next year as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 * The final phase of widening California 126 from two to four lanes. This 
five-mile section stretches from Center Street near Piru to the Los Angeles 
County line. The $12-million project was scheduled to begin in 1995.

WORLD SURVEY PUTS COUNTY ON A GLOBAL SCALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Just how much economic output is packed into Ventura County? 
</P>
<P>
 More than Luxembourg, a lot more than Iceland and a good bit less than most of 
the world's developed countries. 
</P>
<P>
 So says a report recently released by the Los Angeles-based Economic 
Development Corp., which compares the output of products and services from 
Southern California counties to the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County, with its large agricultural industry and oil installations, 
has a gross product of $16.5 billion annually, according to the report. That 
would merit a ranking of 35th among the world's developed nations if Ventura 
County were a separate country, according to Jack Kyser, chief economist for 
the Economic Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County handily exceeds Luxembourg's $10.5-billion gross product and 
Iceland's $6.7 billion. But both countries have far fewer people than Ventura 
County -- 400,000 for Luxembourg and 255,000 for Iceland, contrasted with the 
more than 700,000 residents of Ventura County. Luxembourg is half the size of 
Ventura County geographically, while Iceland is 21 times larger. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has a long way to go to surpass the country ahead of it. New 
Zealand -- population 3.5 million -- has a $42-billion gross product. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Ventura's gross product and that of the Los Angeles area shows that 
this area is a pretty formidable economic entity," Kyser said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Local business leaders and economists agree that the study is useful as a 
yardstick and shows that, despite past pessimism, the county's economic outlook 
is positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several years, the county has faced hard times but they haven't 
been as hard as people might think, said Gary Heathcoate, chairman of the 
Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he said, even during the recession the county maintained a strong 
economy in relation to the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamshid Damooei, a professor of economics at California Lutheran University in 
Thousand Oaks, agreed that Ventura County has a very viable economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when you compare the productivity of the county in certain industries 
-- like agriculture and manufacturing -- to the corresponding areas in a place 
like Luxembourg or Iceland, you would get a sense of how well the county is 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, broad comparisons between the county and large countries must 
take into account that nations have entirely different economic objectives 
related to such issues as trade and geography. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyser said he understood that when undertaking the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "This comparison is useful for some things, and less useful for others," he 
said. "In these tough times, this kind of report serves to remind people that 
there is a lot going on here. Our part of the world has not gone away." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other counties included in the comparison were Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside 
and San Bernardino. Alone, Los Angeles would rank 15th on the world stage. The 
state of California would rank eighth, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined economic output of Los Angeles and the surrounding counties would 
equal those of highly industrialized nations like the Netherlands, Sweden, 
Switzerland and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 The report compares only countries for which United Nations data is available, 
Kyser said, and does not include the former East Bloc nations.

 Steve Coughlin reaches for a folded dollar bill sticking through the crack of 
a Mazda window and bows almost imperceptibly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you," he says, but the woman behind the wheel isn't looking at him. 
</P>
<P>
 The light turns green and cars sealed against the late afternoon heat file 
past the 46-year-old former heavy equipment operator and the sign describing 
his predicament: No Job, No Home, No Food. 
</P>
<P>
 It's 5:30 p.m., and Coughlin will spend three more hours this day at the 
Sherman Way off-ramp of the San Diego Freeway. He is hoping for $35 to $40 from 
passing motorists, enough for a night at a motel on Sepulveda Boulevard, plus 
food. 
</P>
<P>
 So far he has received $4, and it looks as though he will spend another night 
"camping" in the bushes next to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "No big deal," Coughlin says. "I'll survive. I always do." 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin describes his ability to get by with a certain bravado. He needs 
little besides an old sleeping bag because he is efficient. He can handle the 
dangers of living on the street because he is smart. 
</P>
<P>
 With a few tough words, he says, he scatters teen-agers who threaten to rob 
him. And cops are no problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they give me a ticket for panhandling," he says, tearing up an 
imaginary one. "They'd be better off arresting me. Then I'd have a place to 
stay and some food." 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin was raised in Sylmar. He dropped out of Sylmar High School as a 
freshman, got a construction job and trained to work heavy equipment. During 
the 1970s development boom, he earned enough to buy a home in the Wrightwood 
mountains, where he lived with his wife, two sons and a daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 But then everything fell apart. His wife died 10 years ago, and his children 
-- now in their late 20s -- moved out of state. Jobs became scarce. Coughlin 
sold his home and lived off the equity and unemployment benefits until both ran 
out three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Coughlin has found only day jobs, doing construction or yard work. 
He stayed in a homeless shelter once, but someone stole his tennis shoes. He 
never returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin has rejected his children's offers of help. He has his own life, he 
says airily, with its own routine.  
</P>
<P>
 He gets clothes from the Church on the Way in Van Nuys and washes them at a 
coin laundry on Sepulveda Boulevard. He eats at Fosters Freeze at Sepulveda and 
Sherman, or Denny's. He uses the bathroom at Shell or Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
 To the casual observer, Coughlin might seem satisfied with his life. But that, 
experts say, is part of the problem.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone tries to put a positive spin on their life," says Paul Koegel, a 
behavioral scientist with the RAND Corp. "In situations like this, though, it 
can give lie to the common idea that homeless people choose homelessness. 
That's a disturbing concept, but it's attractive to people who don't want to 
come up with solutions to the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin watches meditatively as traffic flows past. He never speaks to 
motorists unless they give money, he says, and then he is simply polite. It 
helps keep his dignity intact. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Coughlin's pride has limits. His life, he admits, has not turned out 
the way he would have hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a messed-up way to live," he says. "I wouldn't wish it on my worst 
enemy."

 On the outside, 13-year-old Erica is the average North Hollywood teen-ager. 
She wears the trendy baggy clothes, grooves to slow songs on the radio, and 
spends lazy summer afternoons munching popcorn at the movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But listen to her for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Her soft-spoken voice often hesitates as if she is thinking twice about what 
she can say. No wonder. There is a secret to keep. And it has already cost her 
some friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 "When some of my friends at school wanted my phone number, I told them I 
didn't have a phone, because when you call here they say, 'Valley Shelter,' " 
said Erica, fingering a silver cross on the bed of her shelter apartment. "They 
thought I didn't want to be their friend anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that she didn't want her friends to know that she was living in a 
homeless shelter. "People think shelters are sloppy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since last month, when she moved into the Trudy and Norman Louis Valley 
Shelter on Lankershim Boulevard, Erica has been struggling to keep her new home 
a secret from her fellow seventh-graders at San Fernando Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that these friends will fail to understand her predicament, she has 
been able to tell only one friend. "She's been through a lot, too," Erica 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 So has Erica. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her mother, Amanda Ponschke, left their $700 North Hollywood apartment 
in March after Ponschke's roommate, who had been splitting the rent, moved out. 
Erica's father lives in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponschke, 36, who had been unable to find work because it meant leaving her 
daughter alone at night, was taking in only $576 a month from Aid to Families 
With Dependent Children and child support. So the pair turned to the shelter to 
help get back on their feet until Ponschke could find a decent job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to work," Ponschke said. "I used to make $10 an hour shipping and 
receiving. But it's hard to work for $4 an hour when you can earn more on 
welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 But while the shelter is helping them save money for a new apartment, its 
rules have hampered her from inviting anyone over to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter does not allow overnight sleep-overs from visitors and Ponschke 
cannot afford the gas to pick up a friend and return them after only a few 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss not being able to have my friends come over," Erica said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this, the teen-ager has been pleasantly surprised at shelter life. She 
shares a private room with her mother, is able to listen to her music and watch 
her own television. And she has made friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be way worse than this," she said. "I like it. I've met a 
lot of nice people, have a lot of new friends and do a lot of activities." 
</P>
<P>
 And while shelter life will never replace a home, it is no longer anything to 
be ashamed of for Erica. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we get out of here, we're going to find a place. We're going to be 
normal. This is just a temporary thing. And we'll be just like anyone else."

HOMELESSNESS IN THE VALLEY / SURVIVING DAY BY DAY; STARTING LIFE OVER AT 50; 
EVICTED GRANDMOTHER HAS A HOME AGAIN WHERE SHE CAN RAISE HER DAUGHTER'S 
CHILDREN

 It's not the life Samantha Scott planned to lead in her 50th year, and she 
admits to some sadness over that. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two tots packing their mouths with bananas and squabbling over 
playthings this afternoon are her grandchildren, and for them she's become a 
mother again -- after raising four children of her own. For them she quit her 
job and sold everything -- including the Elvis collectibles and family 
heirlooms -- to buy diapers and baby formula. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, and with them, she moved into a homeless shelter after being evicted 
from her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not looking forward to raising another family," she says, then adds 
with a chuckle, "They give me a reason to get up in the morning, but God, they 
give me a reason to go to bed at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott and her grandchildren, Anthony, 2, and 1-year-old Ashley, are back in 
their own home now, a one-bedroom apartment in the sun-bleached heart of North 
Hollywood's gangland. It's nothing like the spacious two-bedroom she once had, 
but then it's much better than a shelter, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But without that shelter, the Women's Care Cottage in Van Nuys, she "would 
have been on the street completely." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's daughter was an 18-year-old gangbanger with problems when she got 
pregnant with Anthony in 1991, Scott says, taking down a portrait of the boy. 
Hidden behind that photograph, in the same frame, is another of her daughter 
with her wrist turned to display a tattoo: "18th St. Gang," it reads in large 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing that the situation was desperate for her pregnant daughter, Scott quit 
"the best job I've ever had" as a medical records clerk and whisked the 
youngest of her four children to Sacramento in an attempt to help her daughter 
escape the influences of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 After giving birth, the daughter came back to the San Fernando Valley anyway, 
and Scott soon followed, jobless and living on the small nest egg she'd worked 
endlessly to build. 
</P>
<P>
 "She called me at 5 o'clock one morning," Scott recalls, fighting tears, "and 
said to come and get (Anthony) because she was going to hurt him." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott went to authorities and eventually received custody of the boy. Between 
court appearances and caring for the child, however, she was unable to find a 
job, and she soon took to holding yard sales for money, hawking her bed, sofa, 
dishes and memorabilia from Graceland to buy food. 
</P>
<P>
 When the eviction notice came, she took Anthony and the belongings she had 
left -- her grandmother's mirror, a cabinet that belonged to her mother and 
Anthony's crib -- and moved in with 13 other homeless people at the Van Nuys 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 While there, she took in her daughter's newborn, Ashley, and the family grew 
to three. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the hearings and court dates continue -- Anthony's parents don't want 
custody, Scott says, but aren't ready to let her adopt him -- Scott pinches 
pennies to make the $811 she receives in government aid and food stamps last 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
 She's just enrolled both children in a day-care center sponsored by the 
shelter and, after an upcoming adoption trial, hopes to find a job again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Shaw of the Care Cottage, considers Scott a classic story of success, of 
long-term homelessness nipped in its impoverished bud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no doubt that she's going to make it," Shaw says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if starting a second family and living in a shelter was not how Scott 
planned to begin her fifth decade of living, she shares Shaw's optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a family," she says. "We'll survive."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 1 KILLED, 2 INJURED IN OXNARD COLLISION

<P>
 A 75-year-old Lancaster man was killed Monday in the first fatal traffic 
accident in Ventura County over the Fourth of July weekend, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whose identity was not released pending notification of next of kin, 
made an illegal left turn in front of an oncoming car at Victoria Avenue and 
Channel Islands Boulevard, Oxnard Police Officer John Ahearn said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12:20 p.m., the victim was driving east on Channel Islands Boulevard, 
then made a left turn onto Victoria Avenue against the traffic light, Ahearn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He slammed into a car traveling west on Channel Islands Boulevard driven by 
Nerces Eykjian, 18, of Oxnard. Eykjian and his passenger, Robyn Hamilton, were 
listed in fair condition Monday night at St. John's Regional Medical Center in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to investigating the fatal crash, authorities on Monday reported 
fewer drunk-driving arrests in Ventura County over the holiday weekend this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday afternoon, the California Highway Patrol had arrested 26 
motorists on suspicion of drunk driving since the start of the Fourth of July 
weekend, compared to 33 during the same period last year. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; COUNCIL TO HEAR FLAP OVER CABLE RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to resolve a dispute over monthly cable rates, Ojai officials and 
Ventura County Cablevision will hold a public meeting July 12 to discuss the 
issue before the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable representatives and city officials will present arguments to council 
members on whether the rates should have been lowered to comply with Federal 
Communications Commission regulations implemented last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Cablevision officials argue that their current monthly rate of $10.62 for 
basic cable service complies with the new federal regulations. But Ojai 
officials say the $10.62 rate should have been lowered to $9.92 starting Sept. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai City Manager Andrew Belknap said the regulations change frequently, 
leading to differing interpretations of how the regulations affect billing. 
Ojai, he said, hired an outside consultant to advise the city on rate 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant, Laurie DeVarney, principal of Laurel Communications Group, 
said the group's analysis of Cablevision's form for calculating monthly rates 
found some "inconsistencies and inaccuracies" in the numbers Cablevision used 
as well as their calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cablevision President David LaRue said his company has recalculated the 
rates in light of the consultant group's findings and still finds that the 
rates complied with FCC regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 At next Tuesday's meeting, which will begin at 5 p.m., officials will also 
discuss the consultant's suggestion to raise the franchise fee, which covers 
the city's administrative costs, from 3% to 5%, amounting to a monthly increase 
of no more than 40 cents. Belknap said the consultant suggested the increase 
because Ojai was not able to cover the costs it incurs from implementing the 
new regulations. JASON GRANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; POLICE SET UP 2ND STOREFRONT STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to reduce crime and improve community relations, the Ventura 
Police Department will open a second storefront station Thursday, this time 
behind the Vons shopping center at Main Street and Ventura Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 An opening ceremony will begin at 10 a.m. at the new storefront, located at 
110 N. Olive Ave.Students from Sheridan Way School, Westpark Kids recreational 
group, and the Boys and Girls Club will entertain visitors with music and other 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The storefront's opening comes about two months after hundreds of Ventura 
Avenue-area residents complained to City Council members about crime and gangs. 
Some residents told the council that gang members had thrown stones at their 
windows and threatened them. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar to a storefront on Bristol Road, space for the new mini-station was 
donated by a local business. The office will be staffed with two Police 
Department employees and volunteers. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; EVENT PROVIDES RELIEF TO HOMELESS VETERANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers have begun registering homeless veterans interested in taking part 
in Stand Down 1994, the three-day relief effort at Ventura College that offers 
legal, medical and other services to former members of the armed forces who are 
in need. 
</P>
<P>
 Information about pre-registration for the event, which attracted about 90 
homeless veterans in its first year last summer, can be obtained at dozens of 
social service and nonprofit agencies throughout Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to serve a specific population of the homeless community," said 
Sharon Dwyer, co-chair of Stand Down 1994. The military term "stand down" 
refers to troops being placed from combat readiness to recreation status. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will bring together representatives from dozens of local, state and 
federal agencies focused on helping veterans who may have fallen through the 
social-service cracks since they served in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day camp will provide for basic needs such as showers, tents and 
three meals a day at the Stand Down, which will be held July 29 through 31 on 
the college football field. 
</P>
<P>
 But there also will be a variety of other services available, including 
information about veterans' benefits, job-search training, counseling and more. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers have made some changes to attract more than the 90 or so veterans 
who showed up at Ventura College a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Dwyer said, the event will be held at the end of the month, 
weeks after government checks are distributed in the first part of the month. 
Organizers also have advertised the event in posters and flyers earlier than 
they did last year. For more information or to register, call 654-6459. JEFF

HOMELESSNESS IN THE VALLEY / SURVIVING DAY BY DAY; REJECTION OF VAN NUYS 
SHELTER SHOWS SOLUTIONS OFTEN TRANSIENT; CONFLICT: RESIDENTS' OPPOSITION KILLED 
THE PROPOSAL. CITIZENS AND OFFICIALS TRY TO BALANCE HOMEOWNERS' CONCERNS AND 
CONCERN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NO HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a dilemma faced by the homeless citywide, Van Nuys residents who have long 
complained of aggressive panhandlers and vagrants sleeping in their entryways 
last month shot down a proposed 150-bed shelter that would take some of those 
people off their streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama played out quietly, garnering little attention outside the Sepulveda 
Boulevard neighborhood near Saticoy Street. But it highlights the competing 
interests and philosophies often involved with homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we are threatened with something that has an adverse effect on our 
neighborhood, we react to it," said Van Nuys Homeowners Assn. President Don 
Schultz, who led the fight against the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz said the facility would lure more homeless people to the area. He 
added that he has an obligation to represent his constituents, who are 
homeowners, not the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the shelter dropped the idea because of opposition by Schultz 
and his group. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one city official familiar with the case: "People call and say, 'Get rid 
of the transients,' and when you come up with a solution, a lot of times it's 
thrown back in your face." 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys case is not uncommon, homeless advocates say, with both citizens 
and politicians struggling to balance concerns for the homeless and concerns of 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a problem throughout the city," said the city official. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeup of the San Fernando Valley, however, with its diverse communities 
and no central authority, may exacerbate the already difficult task of reducing 
homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley is "much more fragmented" than other parts of Los Angeles, said 
Jeff Farber of the L.A. Family Housing Corp., which proposed building the Van 
Nuys shelter. "With the geographic structure of the community, people are 
slower to accept they have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 And that problem is growing, everyone agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see homelessness in Woodland Hills and Encino, which seemed immune in the 
past," said Ken Bernsteing, spokesman for Councilwoman Laura Chick. 
</P>
<P>
 A few communities have taken small steps to address the problem. Studio City 
and Van Nuys, for example, both encourage residents to offer panhandlers cards 
that list homeless services rather than giving money. 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighborhoods have been receptive to shelters. And there are groups 
working to dispel stereotypes of the homeless in the hope that understanding 
will eventually lead to a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 But final decisions are usually decided by City Council members, who face the 
dilemma of trying to both serve voters and care for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The police face a similar dilemma: Residents call with complaints and ask 
officers to arrest people for sleeping in doorways, even if they have nowhere 
else to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't want to arrest them because we realize these people are down 
on their luck," said Sgt. Jim McMurray of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
West Valley Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Police raids are conducted occasionally, but they do little more than force 
the homeless from one park or underpass to another, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 While homelessness has increased in the Valley in recent years, the 
bureaucracy designed to combat it has grown as well -- some say to the point of 
becoming nearly as unwieldy as the homeless problem itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal, state, city, county and private groups all fund Valley programs for 
the homeless, but there is no single organization to coordinate the effort.  
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles, in fact, filed a lawsuit against Los Angeles County 
in 1987, claiming the county was failing in its state-mandated obligation to 
provide for indigent relief. The county, in turn, placed blame on the state and 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, as a result of the legal wrangling, an interagency organization 
called the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LHASA), was created to 
coordinate the homeless relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless advocates say improving coordination among agencies is nearly as 
important as getting more funding for job programs and other aid packages. 
</P>
<P>
 And all agree that more funding is needed. Some is coming from the Clinton 
Administration, said LAHSA analyst Arnold Garcia. But at the same time, local 
funding is dwindling, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, he said, "We're not getting ahead."

HOMELESSNESS IN THE VALLEY / SURVIVING DAY BY DAY; ADVOCATES FOR HOMELESS URGE 
MORE COMPASSION; POVERTY: PSYCHOLOGISTS OFFER EXPLANATIONS FOR THE OFTEN FICKLE 
REACTIONS THAT PASSERSBY SHOW TOWARD THOSE IN NEED.

 There he is again. That shaggy-looking guy who hangs around your favorite 
grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you say hello? Walk quickly past, looking at your shoes? Or figure out a 
way to help? Under different circumstances, after all, that could be you. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologists say our often fickle reactions to the homeless are partly based 
on whether we feel they are similar to us or blame them for their situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see someone who is like yourself, you may be more willing to help 
them," said Michele Wittig, a psychology professor at Cal State Northridge and 
a Santa Monica homeless advocate. "But you may also want to distance yourself 
from them, because that is usually easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Many people, Wittig said, make a split-second distinction when they see 
someone camped on the sidewalk or pushing a shopping cart: that the person is 
either a victim of society -- and therefore worth helping -- or crazy, drunk or 
on drugs and, therefore, deserving of homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, experts say, people have the latter reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 In their 1993 book "Malign Neglect," Los Angeles-based homeless researchers 
Jennifer Wolch and Michael Dear describe a general loss of compassion for the 
homeless during the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homeless people," according to Wolch and Dear, "tend to become tainted with 
the characteristics of the 'worst case' homeless subgroups: substance abusers, 
the chronically mentally unstable, those who are dangerous and unpredictable 
and those who are perceived as creating their own difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
 Ambivalence toward such people has even led to an anti-homeless attitude among 
some of their more fortunate counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, a Van Nuys man shot and killed a panhandler who had asked for 
money, according to witnesses. The man, who claimed self-defense, was not 
prosecuted for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 A month earlier, a Winnetka resident shot two homeless men rummaging through 
his bedroom, killing one. Deputy Police Chief Mark Kroeker called the shooting 
"characteristic of the tension and frustrations" between the housed and the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking along Van Nuys Boulevard near Victory Boulevard last week, Viola and 
Arthur Hernandez passed within two feet of a man slumped on the sidewalk. 
Arthur Hernandez made a little wave and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were homeless four months ago," explained Viola Hernandez. "The wave is 
both to say, 'Hello,' and, 'I understand.' I always promised myself that if I 
got off the street, I wouldn't start thinking I was better than other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Other passersby were less friendly. Minutes later, the better-dressed Grant 
Kowalski walks by without seeming to notice the man. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't look at everybody," Kowalski said. "You can't help everybody. What 
are you supposed to do? It's a problem. It's not going away."  
</P>
<P>
 It's that feeling of helplessness and alienation that can lead people to lose 
their sense of responsibility for the homeless, said Richard Lamb, professor of 
psychiatry at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people learn to just step over someone lying on the ground," Lamb 
said. "It's distressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you really want is for people to see the problem and want to do 
something about it badly enough that they go home and make some phone calls, 
contribute to an organization and become part of the solution," Lamb said. "We 
are a great country that loves a challenge, and this is a problem that can be 
remedied."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; FOR TOP SENIOR, A GOOD DEED IS ITS

 Connie Kraszewski cheerfully admits that when she starts talking, no one else 
can get a word in edgewise. But when she does pipe down, just for a minute, she 
tends to hear a lot of praise. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, for example, she was named Thousand Oaks' senior of the year. Her 
fellow senior citizens honored Kraszewski, 72, for a decade of dedicated 
volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't understand all the fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, she hadn't wanted to volunteer in the first place. "It was my 
daughter's fault," Kraszewski said, remembering her initial foray to the Goebel 
Senior Center back in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter, Newbury Park resident Carol Sharp, had prodded Kraszewski to 
make some friends at the senior center. Kraszewski preferred a more passive 
approach: staring out the window and hoping potential soul mates would wander 
by. But Sharp told her, "Mother, people don't go window shopping for friends," 
Kraszewski recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 So, reluctantly, she visited the senior center. She ate a hot lunch. She 
talked to some folks. And then she volunteered to dry the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 She's been at it ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Serving meals on wheels, translating for Polish patients at Los Robles Medical 
Center, answering phones at the Fitzgerald House, leading senior citizen trips 
to Las Vegas and New Orleans -- Kraszewski can't remember all her volunteer 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 But she knows it's all been immensely satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wake up early (to work at the senior center), and you think, 'I should be 
in bed.' " Kraszewski said. "But then you see all the frail women and men 
coming in, all smiles and hugs, so glad to see you, and you think, 'Why am I 
complaining?' You know, I think I do it for myself more than anything else."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CELLULAR-PHONE USERS TO AID CRIME

 Drivers with cellular phones can sign up now to join Thousand Oaks' new Mobile 
Crime Watch program, administered by the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with $3,000 in city funds, the chamber will train at least 75 people to 
serve as extra eyes and ears for the Police Department, reporting suspicious 
activity as they drive around Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 After an hourlong training session, Mobile Crime Watch members will receive 
two free magnetic signs to slap on their car doors. Crime busters hope the 
boldly colored signs -- either white, red and black; or purple, yellow and red 
-- will announce their presence and deter criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The visibility is the most effective part of this program," said Gary 
Koppenjan, communications manager for the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The first training session is scheduled be held within a month, as soon as the 
chamber gathers 25 volunteers. For more information, call 499-1993. STEPHANIE

VALLEY INTERVIEW; GUARDIAN ANGELS DIRECTOR SAYS RECRUITS FIND TRAINING TOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first they were called the Rock Brigade -- a handful of guys who picked up 
rocks from the streets to beautify the Big Apple. A year later the movement 
went underground where they were known as the Magnificent 13 for sweeping crime 
from New York City subways. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 15 years they have been known as the Guardian Angels, recognized 
by their bright red berets and white T-shirts. Membership has reached more than 
8,500, with chapters in more than a dozen countries; the newest chapter opened 
earlier this month at a Van Nuys strip mall at Sepulveda and Victory 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 But while most people know the name, they probably know little of the Guardian 
Angels' tactics, training, members and motivations. Weston Conwell, the 
Guardian Angels' western regional director, told Times special correspondent 
Jeff Schnaufer what to expect from the new Valley chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Is there a lack of protection in the Valley that warrants the 
Angels' presence?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes, there's a lack of protection in every city in America. In Los 
Angeles there were dreams of having a cop on every corner. We'll be doing 
battle with Darth Vader before we have a cop on every corner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Tell us about the new Valley chapter.  
</P>
<P>
 A: The Valley has always had Guardian Angels. They just have never had an 
office. This is just going to be their own Guardian Angels in their own office 
and dealing with their own problems. It won't be fully functional until we 
graduate them, which will be in about three months. We have about 25 recruits 
in the Valley. Of that, the first wave that become Guardian Angel is 2% to as 
much as 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: That's a low percentage. How do you screen the recruits?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We want to see what's in the hearts of the recruits. It takes about two to 
three weeks to find that out, and sometimes longer. If we feel they are out 
there to bang heads or kick butt, or they are out there to settle a personal 
score, we don't want them. This is where the media hurts us. They see the fad 
on TV or read an article about a new chapter and see they want to become a 
Guardian Angel. It brings out the wrong kind of recruit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Explain the training process that they go through.  
</P>
<P>
 A: There are three months of classroom training and patrols. On the street one 
night a week, one night a week going to the classroom. There will be one member 
in a patrol of six who is a trainee. They will have an experienced partner who 
will teach them the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 If something does happen on the street, the trainee steps back. He is not to 
take any initiative on his own whatsoever. They don't have the communications 
skills. They don't know if this is a gang member or a drug dealer, how do we 
deal with them. A lot of it is getting them street smarts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the classroom, we teach them martial arts. There are also legal training 
classes involving district attorneys and judges who come in and say this is 
what you can do and what you can't do. On top of that, they tell us what 
they're prosecuting for. That way, we don't waste a lot of their time when we 
bring somebody in. There's first aid training as well as CPR. Then they take 
the state government course called Powers of Arrest. It's what every security 
guard has. It says when you can make an arrest, what your duties are as a 
private citizen. Once they complete all of this, they don't necessarily become 
a Guardian Angel. This is one of our checks and balances. If somebody is not 
ready for it, we don't put them on the streets. It can take and has taken up to 
two years for some individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How would you describe the typical graduate? Their motivations?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Try to describe the average San Fernando Valley resident. If you told me 
the Valley is 60% Latino, the chapter will be 60% Latino. One common 
denominator they have is that they are frustrated with the crime on the 
streets. Above and beyond all, they will have a deep-seated need to help. The 
average person in the Valley will be 24, 25 years old, middle-class to poor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Angels do not carry weapons, nor do they have official police training. Yet 
Angel Glenn Doser was shot to death in March, 1993, when he tried to stop two 
men who were robbing someone in Hollywood. And the year before, Guardian Angel 
founder Curtis Sliwa was attacked twice: once by three men with clubs and the 
other time shot in the back of a New York cab. Are Angels really prepared to 
deal with crime on the streets?  
</P>
<P>
 A: What can you do about a gun? What can police officers do about a gun? How 
many police officers do we bury every year? And did their police training help 
them? How many Guardian Angels have we buried in the last 15 years? Very few in 
comparison. I think seven have lost their life. 
</P>
<P>
 About two weeks ago, a patrol in Hollywood hears a gunshot and they respond. 
They go into the apartment building, find a man on the floor with a shotgun 
blast in his chest. Then they heard the sound of a shotgun being cocked and 
found the shooter upstairs. Instead of waiting for police, they took the 
shooter out and held him for the police. Then they went back to the victim and 
did first aid until the paramedics showed up. The police said that we were 
crazy, that we should have waited until they showed up and shot the guy. The 
Angels took a chance and they saved the lives of others who could have been 
shot by this guy. But the amazing thing is that there is absolutely no report 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does that mean to you?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The police have always been threatened by us. But I'm not upset that they 
don't recognize what we do. We're not out there for the publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Speaking of publicity, founder Sliwa himself admitted that he faked his 
1980 kidnaping and five other exploits to help the Guardian Angels survive the 
early years as a crime-fighting group. Why should the public trust that there 
aren't going to be publicity stunts in the Valley?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That's a good question. But when Sliwa did it, he had no idea how big this 
thing was going to get. He was struggling just to get the group going. But the 
L.A. group stands for itself. We don't survive on the merits of Curtis Sliwa, 
we survive on the merits of the Guardian Angels in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Describe the street patrols.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Right now, it's a minimum of two patrols a week, Wednesdays and Fridays in 
the Valley. Right now we are patrolling a three-mile radius from the 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will patrols increase after graduation?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That depends upon the group in the Valley. We don't want to push them 
faster than what they are ready for. Generally, they take on more than they can 
handle off the bat, because the enthusiasm is so high at first. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What has happened during the patrols so far? Any citizen's arrests?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We've seen a lot of activity, but we haven't had any arrests. We've seen 
mostly gang members and drug dealers. If it was about making citizen's arrests, 
the last thing I would want to do is be wearing a red beret and a T-shirt. To 
be honest, if you're arrested by the Guardian Angels, you're a fool. Six guys 
in white T-shirts walking down the streets, we stand out worse than a 
black-and-white. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of neighborhood crimes will the Valley chapter focus on?  
</P>
<P>
 A: After we graduate the class, we'll sit down with the Valley chapter and 
discuss the logistics we have, what neighborhoods are bad, what neighborhoods 
we will focus on. There are so many factors that are involved on starting up 
the new chapter, but the most important is community support. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, we used to come into neighborhoods before we had community support. 
That was a little arrogant. If we go in into a neighborhood and they don't want 
us in, the problem will come back. If we have community support, we'll train 
them on how to deal with the problems after we leave. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How is community support so far?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Excellent. The Valley has always been the place with the most community 
support than any place else in the city. We have an office in Hollywood, where 
we get a lot of calls from the Valley. We have a lot of contacts in the Valley. 
But we're not really working with those people until we pick a neighborhood we 
want to focus on. Then we'll meet with the community or some neighborhood 
leader, where they tell us their concerns. Our main goal is to empower the 
community to take it back themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Once you've determined the target crime areas, how will you use the patrols 
to discourage prostitution, drug dealing, gang banging and other crimes?  
</P>
<P>
 A: By our presence. Who's going to want to pick up a prostitute when there are 
eight Guardian Angels standing around her? We also have a reputation that we 
will follow through after making a citizen's arrest. We will go to court and 
testify against them. The gang members know this. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Under what circumstances can you make a citizen's arrest?  
</P>
<P>
 A: When there is a misdemeanor that's been committed in our presence or when 
you're beyond a reasonable doubt in a felony. For example, the guy in the 
shotgun arrest, we had reasonable cause to believe he had fired the shot. Had 
he slapped somebody, we couldn't have made the arrest because it wasn't a 
felony and we didn't see it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much force can you use?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Whatever is reasonable to detain the individual. Guardian Angels are 
trained to take a guy down without ever hitting them. Let's take the Rodney 
King incident. Remove the weapons. Each grab an arm or a limb or something. If 
you have 12 guys, you can get him down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you saying the Guardian Angels could have done a better job than the 
police in apprehending King?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Who couldn't do a better job? They were all arrested. Girl Scouts could 
have probably done better. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not going to make any friends in the Police Department with this article. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Van Nuys Police Station Captain Jim McMurray said Angels have been cited 
within the last month for soliciting funds in the middle of the street from 
vehicles stopped at the intersection of Burbank and Sepulveda boulevards. Were 
you aware of this?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I wasn't aware that they were in the middle of the street. They don't 
interfere with traffic. That's why Guardian Angels haven't been arrested. 
That's our fund-raising technique. We find that it works better than paying 
somebody $100,000 to raise funds. With the Guardian Angels, 100% goes into the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, I'm impressed if that's the only thing the captain is worrying about. 
I know other things we should be focusing his attention on, like the child 
molester in the streets who hasn't been caught. I'm sorry we've occupied his 
time worrying about people in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: At what point will you know you have been successful in deterring crime?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Response from the community. When we see the looks in people's eyes when 
they get up in the morning and realize there were no stabbings in the 
neighborhood, that they don't have to step in a pool of blood to go to work. 
But our effort will last as long as the people of the Valley want it. 
</P>

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; AIDS SUFFERER INVOLVED IN CAR CRASH DIES

<P>
 A man in the advanced stages of AIDS who killed a 73-year-old woman when he 
ran a red light has died after refusing medical treatment since the June 17 
accident, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Dortman, 35, died at 1:30 a.m. Friday at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital in Valencia, Deputy Mark Slater of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's 
Station said.Slater said he did not know if Dortman died of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome or from injuries sustained in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of death will probably be released today, said Lt. Nils Linder of 
the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim in the crash was Bertha Olsen, who was killed when she tried to 
make a left turn onto Sierra Highway. Dortman hit the driver's side door of her 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen's car spun and hit a nearby van, but the driver of that vehicle was not 
seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Dortman was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter when witnesses 
told deputies they saw him drive off the road into a fence several miles before 
the crash, and he was swaying back and forth unsteadily in his truck as he 
continued to drive. He also admitted to deputies he smoked marijuana before the 
collision because, he said, it helped alleviate AIDS-related symptoms.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE WILL BUY 117-ACRE PARCEL; GROWTH: 
HOPING TO LURE NEW EMPLOYERS, COUNCIL OKS $1.5-MILLION PURCHASE. LAND WILL BE 
DEVELOPED AS AN INDUSTRIAL PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a bid to attract new employers, the City Council has voted to spend $1.5 
million to buy a 117-acre parcel that will be developed as an industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they plan to build roads and install utility lines on the 
property, then offer parcels to Chatsworth-based Packard Bell and other firms 
that have said they are considering a move to Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The price for the 117-acre site was far below the land's $3.5-million 
appraised value, city officials said. They also said it provides plenty of room 
for large employers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of deal economic development people dream about," said Danny 
R. Roberts, the city's redevelopment manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is the undeveloped Lusk Industrial Park at Avenue M and 10th Street 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members, in their role as directors of the Palmdale Redevelopment 
Agency, authorized the purchase in a 3-1 vote at a special meeting last week.  
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based Lusk Co. had agreed to sell the acreage for the reduced price 
if the council could approve the deal on or before this Friday. City staff 
members said Lusk is selling the land because the company wants to consolidate 
its holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Terence Judge cast the sole vote against the purchase, saying 
there's wasn't enough time to address some of his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still a lot of questions unanswered in my mind about whether it's a 
sound purchase," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge said the land has drainage problems, and its location may not fit the 
city's industrial development needs. "I'm not prepared to say yes just because 
the price itself is good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Jim Ledford and councilmen Jim Root and David Myers voted for the 
purchase. Councilman Joe Davies was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Price-wise, it was excellent," Ledford said. "I do have a concern about how 
we may be competing against other (privately owned) industrial properties. But 
I think we can fill a niche in the large-parcel projects." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to create more local jobs and boost the local economy, Palmdale 
officials have been trying to persuade industrial firms to relocate to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 But city leaders say there is a shortage of industrial land that is free of 
financial problems and land-use restrictions -- and that is ready for immediate 
construction. In addition, they said, there are few industrial areas that offer 
large parcels of 50 acres or more. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing the Lusk purchase, city officials said they will have plenty 
of land available for immediate use by a new employer. As part of an incentive 
package, Palmdale could offer land in the industrial park at greatly reduced 
prices, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Al McCord, deputy city administrator, said he will notify Packard Bell about 
the availability of the new industrial land. The computer maker, which has been 
negotiating with several cities, needs about 50 acres to relocate its 
operations, McCord said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; APARTMENT GUARD IS SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An armed security guard was shot in the shoulder at an apartment complex in 
east Newhall by a man wielding a handgun who demanded the guard leave or be 
gunned down, a sheriff's official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 11:40 p.m. Sunday in the 24000 block of Pine 
Street, said Lt. Art Valenzuela of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's 
Station.The gunman, described as a male Hispanic about 18 to 22 years old, 
remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Dago Natareno, 38, was listed in stable condition Monday evening at Henry Mayo 
Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia, Valenzuela said. Officials said they do 
not know what city Natareno lives in. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told us (that) prior to the shooting the occupants of a maroon Chevrolet 
Monte Carlo had driven by and said if he did not leave the area he would be 
shot," Valenzuela said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, the gunman stepped between two apartment buildings Natareno 
was guarding and fired four shots from a small caliber handgun, Valenzuela 
said. Natareno did not return fire. MARK SABBATINI

COP DOG; CHARLY THE CRIME-FIGHTING CANINE WINS HIGH PRAISE IN SIMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caught in the whirl of police lights, the man lingered menacingly close to the 
gun in the opened door of the motor home. 
</P>
<P>
 He had just led officers on a 25-minute chase across Simi Valley and now, 
cornered in an industrial park, he threatened to go out in a gunfight. 
</P>
<P>
 Police waited, revolvers drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crucial weapon that December night was one that Officer Sterling 
Johnson could just as easily have left with his 2-year-old son -- a German 
shepherd police dog. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 31-year-old man made his move, Johnson unleashed his longhaired partner 
and watched as the dog dashed through the blaze of headlights and knocked the 
suspect to the asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, sober and recovering from bites in the arm and leg, the man 
told his jailer, "I've got to tell you something. That dog really saved my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy was lucky I was there," Johnson added. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a way, he was lucky, too, said the Simi Valley police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like the movies. . . . If you shoot somebody, whether you kill them 
or not, you live with it your entire career." 
</P>
<P>
 Canine units, long used for searches and subduing suspects, have come under 
fire in some Southern California communities in recent years because of bite 
wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Simi Valley, statistically the nation's safest city, the two-man, 
two-dog detail is alive and well -- and eager to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good, excellent," Mayor Greg Stratton said of community support for the 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses, civic leaders, even schoolchildren have weighed in, and not just 
with words. A donation fund -- augmented with about $3,000 from the Rotary Club 
of Simi Sunrise on June 20 and $150 from the children of Crestview Elementary 
School on June 14 -- has been set up by the City Council to help bring in a 
third canine team, Police Capt. Jerry Boyce said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said it should cost about $12,000 for the team. The car would be extra. 
</P>
<P>
 "You often find that the public has a great deal of suspicion of the use of 
police dogs," Police Chief Willard R. Schlieter said. "But I've not found that 
to be true here." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason might be Johnson. Solidly built, with an impish glint to his eye, 
the 49-year-old father of seven alternately cuts the figure of a favorite uncle 
or a no-nonsense drill sergeant, depending upon the need. 
</P>
<P>
 His partner, Charly von der Dorstener Grenze, is an apt match. At one moment a 
98-pound bolt of fangs, at the next a playmate for Johnson's 2-year-old son, 
Charly is as much a boon to Johnson as a curse to criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a deterrent you cannot believe," Johnson said while on Sunday-night 
patrol with Charly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cross-trained," as Johnson put it, Charly belongs to a select group of police 
dogs that can do both narcotics detection and patrol work. The other Simi 
Valley canine, Max, whose handler is Officer Dwight Thompson, is similarly 
trained. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, these dogs and their predecessors have seen it all, Johnson said. 
They have found missing children and even a lost Alzheimer's patient. They have 
searched buildings, shown off their skills to the public, sniffed out drugs and 
helped control crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have defused potentially lethal confrontations, as Johnson's canine 
did that night in 1989, when the dog stopped the man just paces from the .357 
magnum in his motor home. 
</P>
<P>
 "And yet," Johnson added, a canine is "a weapon that does not do that much 
damage" to suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the chase involving Rodney King could have been quite 
different, for example, if Charly had been there, Johnson ventured. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our dogs are trained to never go to the head or the neck," he said. "You're 
going to get a whole lot of people disagreeing with me, but think about it. 
When they see a dog, suspects often comply." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At least that is the experience in Simi Valley, Lt. Dick Thomas said -- there 
have been thousands of arrests since the canine program began in 1977, yet few 
bites. Only three were reported last year and none so far this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Don Austin, who supervises the canine units, gave part of the credit to 
the department's "find and alert" tactic. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's dogs -- and those used by the Ventura, Santa Paula and Port 
Hueneme police departments, as well as the Ventura County Sheriff's Department 
-- are trained to attack suspects only when provoked or ordered directly, 
Johnson said. Otherwise, they bark. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative tactic -- "find and hold" -- essentially teaches dogs to 
attack immediately, said Lt. Thomas, a department spokesman. This is more 
appropriate in high-crime areas, he added, because more suspects there might be 
armed and prone to resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 That distinction, however, is dismissed by some critics of the widespread use 
of police dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole notion that you can expect the dog to know when to attack or not to 
attack is . . . absurd," said attorney Donald Cook, whose Los Angeles law 
office of Cook & Mann represents canine-bite plaintiffs throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 While conceding the value of dogs "as searching tools," Cook objects to their 
wider police use on two counts. "Number one, the dogs end up being used as a 
tool of punishment, and two, cops end up having the dogs do what they know they 
couldn't do." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook added, "You cannot delegate to the dog a human decision as to when force 
is appropriate. . . . The (find and alert) policy purports to do just that, to 
transfer the responsibility to the dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, however, said the responsibility ultimately rests with the suspect 
and not the dog. Resist, make a quick movement, and the dog might attack, he 
admitted, but he added: "Bites are bad only when a suspect fights." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Saturday night, he and Charly were trolling an industrial park for 
prowlers, vandals, anybody suspicious, when a call crackled over the cruiser's 
radio. Johnson acknowledged and gunned the engine. Charly began to pace in the 
back seat. He wagged his tail. He whined. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the red lights go on," Johnson said, "he knows something's going on: 
'Dad's going to need me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And Johnson should know. As do other trainers, he cares for Charly 24 hours a 
day, seven days a week. Each day alone and once a week with other canine teams 
from other Ventura County agencies, they train. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Charly even lives with Johnson and his family, as does the officer's retired 
canine partner, Atlas. 
</P>
<P>
 Both dogs also have excelled in police canine competitions. One reason, in 
addition to countless hours of work, Johnson said, is they have become the 
"beta" to his "alpha." 
</P>
<P>
 He has become their pack leader, in other words, and all others who populate 
the world -- fellow officers, thugs, a reporter -- "are just there," Johnson 
added delicately. It is he, not Charly, who is "top dog." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is one exception. Johnson, named 1994 officer of the year by his 
colleagues in Simi Valley, said: "You can get a dog to do anything except to 
use his nose." That depends on the dog's mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for Johnson that Saturday night -- and unluckily for a 21-year-old 
Agoura Hills man and his 14-year-old brother -- Charly was in the mood. 
</P>
<P>
 As Johnson pulled to a stop in an older subdivision, Charly whimpered eagerly. 
Another officer had stopped a battered Mazda RX-7. Seated on the curb, holding 
each other, were the brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the harsh glare of headlights, the two watched distractedly as Johnson led 
Charly into the back seat of the car, then the passenger area, then the hood, 
the hubcaps, then the driver's side. 
</P>
<P>
 There, barely visible in a vial stuffed down the map pocket of the door, the 
dog sniffed out what police suspected was a trace of marijuana residue.

BOYS AND THEIR TOYS; GI JOE WASN'T SOME DOLL FOR BOYS -- HE WAS AN ACTION

 "GI Joe . . . GI Joe . . . Fighting man from head to toe." -- From a 1960s 
Advertising Jingle 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the uniform. Maybe it was the tiny M-1 carbine he carried. Or the 
battle scar across his polyvinyl cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were kids, we really got off on that stuff," recalled Vincent 
Santelmo, 33, who received his first GI Joe at age 3 and now boasts of being 
the nation's foremost authority on the miniature man of war. "It was the cool 
toy to own." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was more than a toy. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe, as his fans refer to him, symbolized the changing values of the time. He 
reeked of 1950s patriotism and yet was the first doll for boys, a socially 
acceptable counterpart to Barbie. Joe allowed boys to fuss over clothes. He 
allowed them to accessorize, even if it was with grenade launchers and daggers. 
</P>
<P>
 And this summer, Joe turns 30. A reissue of the original figure will arrive at 
stores in late August. At the same time, thousands of fans and collectors are 
expected to board the U.S. aircraft carrier Intrepid in New York Harbor for a 
weekend convention. Christie's will mark the occasion with an auction of 
vintage Joe paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Santelmo, for his part, is finishing a commemorative book on the anniversary. 
As author of a previous 450-page tome, "The Complete Encyclopedia to GI Joe" 
(Krause Publications, 1993), he believes that the occasion calls for 
reflection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back then," the New York City collector said, "there was this mystique about 
GI Joe." 
</P>
<P>
 The mystique originated in Hollywood. In 1962, an independent toy designer 
approached Hasbro Inc. about producing a figure based on a television series 
called "The Lieutenant." Hasbro balked at tying its fortunes to a show that 
could be canceled before the toy had a chance to become popular. 
</P>
<P>
 But company president Merrill Hassenfeld and his top executive, a Korean War 
veteran named Don Levine, liked the idea of a doll-sized soldier. They used a 
wooden sculptor's mannequin to develop an 11 1/2-inch prototype. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept of doing a doll for boys in the early 1960s was a big risk," said 
Kirk Bozigian, a vice president at the Pawtucket, R.I., toy company. "What 
parent would let his son play with a doll?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro executives insisted on calling their new toy an "action figure." They 
chose its name from the 1945 Burgess Meredith film, "The Story of G.I. Joe." 
Accessories were designed with anxious fathers in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an engineer who would go to the National Guard armory here in Rhode 
Island and bring back weapons so they could be measured and duplicated," 
Bozigian said. "One day he came up Route 95 with a bazooka and an M-16 in the 
trunk of his car and he got stopped for speeding. The cop never looked in the 
trunk. But the whole time, the engineer was sweating bullets. Literally." 
</P>
<P>
 After all this, Hasbro still had to goad New York stores into giving the toy a 
test run. GI Joe hit the shelves on Aug. 1, 1964, and sold out within a week. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 2 million of the action figures sold, for a suggested retail 
price of $4 each, that first year. Hasbro raced to issue new features and 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, a set of foreign Joes hit the stores. The German version bore a 
sculpted Nordic face. The Japanese soldier had black hair and black eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The following year, Joe was given a mate. The fetching but nameless GI Nurse 
Action Girl, who stood a full inch shorter, was available as a blond or brunet 
and wore nylon stockings. But Joe's young fans were not yet interested in 
playing with girls. The nurse sold so poorly that it was discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 More successful was a talking version of the toy. With a tug of his dog tags, 
Joe grunted such commands as "Take Hill 79!" and "Medic, get that stretcher up 
here!" 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro had virtually obliterated the stigma of boys playing with dolls. By the 
late 1960s, other toy companies had begun marketing such figures as "Major Matt 
Mason" and "Captain America." But Joe soon faced a development more daunting 
than competition: the escalation of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were kids whose moms wouldn't allow them to buy Joes," Santelmo 
recalled. "Their moms didn't want military things around the house." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro tried to change with the times. In 1970, Joe shed his uniform, grew a 
beard and became an "adventurer." 
</P>
<P>
 This new figure hunted for pygmy gorillas and led an archeological dig for 
Egyptian artifacts. He was outfitted with such peaceful accessories as a 
Magnetic Flaw Detector, a Thermal Terrain Scanner and a Seismograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Purists called it the end of the GI Joe era. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the fighting man's last gasp came in 1974, when he acquired the 
"Kung-Fu Grip" that comedian Eddie Murphy made famous in a line from the film 
"Trading Places." By 1976, with sales declining and the energy crisis driving 
plastic prices skyward, Joe suffered the unkindest cut of all. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro scaled him down to 8 1/2 inches, then 3 3/4 inches a few years later. 
Gone was the 1950s patriot. In his place stood a collection of tiny characters 
in futuristic body armor. They were called Stalker, Short Fuse and Snake Eyes. 
They fought against the masked Cobra and Viper and Undertow. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the dark side of Joe, said Stevanne Auerbach, author of "The Toy 
Chest" (Carol Publishing Group, 1986) and former director of the San Francisco 
International Toy Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "GI Joe reverted to a kind of a man-monster-machine," she said. "The names and 
the descriptions of their brutality, this was not a good role model, not the 
type of character you would want boys to emulate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the real Joe, the good Joe, would not die. By the 1980s, his original fans 
had grown old enough to feel tugs of nostalgia. Some of them began to seek out 
the figure of their childhood. Santelmo, for example, happened upon a GI Joe in 
an antique shop and was happy to pay $35. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother saw me come home with that doll," he recalled. "She said, 'Why are 
you going to start with that again?' " 
</P>
<P>
 There were only a handful of collectors at first, men haunting garage sales 
and toy shows. But their numbers grew. Prices for mint-condition figures rose 
into the thousands. Collectors nagged Hasbro to resume producing a full-sized 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had them calling us every day. Guys from Europe and Japan, too," Bozigian 
said. "It was beyond our wildest expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro finally relented, producing a limited edition of "Duke, Master 
Sergeant," a modernized Joe that played off the glut of patriotism following 
the Persian Gulf War. That 1991 version sold well enough to pave the way for 
the upcoming reissue. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is why thousands of grown men, and perhaps some children as well, 
will crowd onto an aircraft carrier this summer for a birthday party that will 
be marked by sky divers, museum-like exhibits and what promises to be a 
relatively pricey auction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think it's odd, guys collecting dolls," said Santelmo, who 
declines to reveal how many of the figures he has collected. "The only people 
who understand are the guys who played with Joe in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the GI Joe consciousness," he said. "That's what I call it. The GI Joe 
consciousness."

BOYS AND THEIR TOYS; SO YOU THINK WAR TOYS ARE BAD? WELL, TELL THAT TO THE 
MOTHER OF A 4-YEAR-OLD NINJA TURTLE WHO LONGS TO FIGHT THE BAD GUYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was nursing our new baby the other day when guilt -- the amphetamine of the 
working-mom set -- prodded me to turn to my attention-starved 4-year-old son 
with an offer. "Tell ya what, hon," I said, my voice a little too eager, "when 
the baby is finished eating, we'll read a book. OK?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Nah," Taylor responded with that boyish shrug, the swaggering shuffle passed 
on like a bad suit from one generation of preschool boys to the next. "I have a 
better idea. . . . Let's fight bad guys !"  
</P>
<P>
 Bad Guys. They entered our lives about a year ago, and I'd venture a 
calculation that they'll be with us in one form or another for close to another 
decade -- as will the guns, grenades, swords and rocket launchers needed to 
defend against their onslaught.  
</P>
<P>
 For many mothers of small boys, this obsession with war toys is one of the 
most unnerving phases of childhood life. Sure, there are plenty of calm, 
nurturing little guys around (and some not-so-calm, not-so-nurturing girls). 
But to those of us who bore fiery balls of testosterone, like my own first son, 
the task of shaping them into civilized human beings can seem a daunting one. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to be part of the peacenik crowd that gets its politics from 
"Mother Jones" to get the chills watching your son and his friends toting water 
guns that resemble Uzis. Today, guns are in school bags, jean jackets and first 
cars. They're aimed at teachers and friends and rivals (who, after all, are 
real-world versions of Bad Guys). In some communities they've become as 
integral to youth culture as rap and rock.  
</P>
<P>
 My husband, who gets his kicks out of scanning Census Bureau tracts, likes to 
remind me how unlikely it is that an advantaged suburban kid is going to pull 
out an assault rifle and start firing into a McDonald's. Maybe he's got a 
point. But he even gets a little squeamish when his offspring starts blasting 
away at the cat.  
</P>
<P>
 I've witnessed a range of parental reactions, from those who permit their 
3-year-olds to watch "The Terminator" to those who won't allow anything more 
pointed than a stick near the house. There's even the thirdhand tale, probably 
a suburban myth, about the boy who became obsessed with firearms in his teens 
because his parents had denied him toy guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us fall somewhere in the middle, imposing controls but not wanting to 
act too totalitarian or even too interested (wouldn't that, after all, make 
guns seem even more interesting?). We draw lines in the sand, only to watch 
them disappear when friends give toy guns as presents, or our sons come home 
from school play-acting Ninja Turtle sword fights -- even if they've never seen 
the cartoon.  
</P>
<P>
 Two educators, Diane E. Levin and Nancy Carlsson-Paige, managed to write an 
entire book of advice on this puzzling issue. In "Who's Calling the Shots?" 
(New Society Publishers, 1990) the authors argue that it's normal and healthy 
for children to play imaginative war games. It's one way in which children work 
out feelings of anger and helplessness, and draw their own distinctions between 
good and evil. The trouble with today's war play, Carlsson-Paige and Levin say, 
is that it mimics the scripted, and often more gruesome or realistic, violence 
that children see in the media. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the authors, teachers report that today's children seem more 
obsessed with war play than in the past, and that it often spills into 
playground violence. Although some girls put aside their Barbies for Power 
Rangers, parents and teachers worry most about how re-enactments of violence 
dominate the play of boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys act out more violence today because cartoons and toy marketers over the 
past decade have promoted rigid gender stereotypes, Levin said in an interview. 
"Boys are shown over and over again that what you do is be violent," she said. 
"The most extreme possibilities for each gender is being emphasized." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Kostelny, a research associate at Chicago's Erikson Institute for 
Advanced Study in Early Childhood Development, also distinguishes between 
imaginative war play and realistic enactments. "Even if teachers take a toy gun 
away, kids are going to use a banana or finger or whatever," she said. "They 
have to play it out. This is a symbol of being in power and being in control. 
The important distinction is this: Is he playing or practicing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kostelny's bottom-line recommendation to parents: If your kids insist on 
playing with guns, let them use sticks or their fingers. "That way, you're not 
promoting it or encouraging it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All this advice is well and good, but it's too late for my household. We've 
made our uneasy truce with the war machine by engineering the disappearance of 
a realistic-looking toy gun given as a gift, but agreeing to allow Ninja Turtle 
swords and Power Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 As I watch my son play with his war paraphernalia, I am reminded of what 
several sociologists told me during research on other stories about societal 
ills: A thriving civilization depends on curbing and controlling the innate 
aggressions of males, finding a positive direction for potentially destructive 
impulses.  
</P>
<P>
 Fathers seem to understand this instinctively. When Taylor panicked over an 
impending blood test at the doctor's, my husband transformed them both into 
Ninja Turtles battling the forces of evil in the universe. The appointment went 
off without a hitch.  
</P>
<P>
 Then it was my turn to take Taylor to the dentist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Call me a spoilsport, but I just couldn't bring myself to play Leonardo to my 
son's Raphael. Still, every time I talked to Taylor about his upcoming dental 
trip, I could feel disaster looming. The picture, culled from previous 
encounters with big strangers in white coats, played itself out in my head: 
Tantrums in the office hallway, angry refusals to cooperate, rushed apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning of his appointment, I happened to have a conference with Taylor's 
preschool teacher, during which she explained her view that little boys 
transform themselves into weapon-laden superheroes because they feel so 
defenseless. "It empowers them," she said with a reassuring smile.  
</P>
<P>
 With those three words, something clicked. Two hours later, I set my war-toy 
guilt aside and handed Taylor his arsenal of plastic Turtle swords. He slipped 
one down the backside of his shirt, stuffed another down his shorts and hid a 
third in my purse.  
</P>
<P>
 As we opened the door to the dentist's office, I glanced over and saw that the 
anger and fear had dissipated from my little boy's face, like a summer fog 
blown out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
 He marched down the hall, settled into the too-big dental chair, and opened 
wide.

GROWTH -- AND GROWING PAINS -- FOR ASSOCIATION OF GAY DOCTORS; HEALTH: THE 
AMERICAN ASSN. OF PHYSICIANS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IS GETTING INVOLVED IN POLICY AND 
RESEARCH. BUT IT FACES AN IDENTITY CRISIS OVER A NAME CHANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Dr. Katherine O'Hanlan listened to her colleagues at a national meeting on 
breast cancer, she wasn't surprised that no one mentioned lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, held by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, was 
focusing on minority women's low access to cancer screening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone kept talking about minority women's access to mammography 
screening," recalled O'Hanlan, a gynecological cancer surgeon at Stanford. 
African Americans, Latinos -- each had poor mammography rates. But no one was 
mentioning gay women. 
</P>
<P>
 Then O'Hanlan took the floor. Lesbians, she pointed out, were the least likely 
to go for mammograms but, for reasons that are unclear, have among the highest 
rates of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because Shalala had invited me to that meeting, we were able to ask that all 
future research on breast cancer (include) sexual orientation," O'Hanlan 
recalled. Several large upcoming studies, including the sweeping Women's Health 
Initiative, will stratify data by sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 The story illustrates one of many recent inroads that can be claimed by the 
nation's predominant group of gay doctors -- the American Assn. of Physicians 
for Human Rights -- of which O'Hanlan is president. 
</P>
<P>
 As gay rights takes on greater importance under the Clinton Administration and 
with increasing social tolerance, this 13-year-old medical society is seizing 
the opportunity to make its mark, its leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This organization has always had enormous potential. But I think we're 
tapping into it more than ever before," said Benjamin Schatz, who took over as 
executive director of the San Francisco-based group in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Schatz said, when the American Medical Assn. recently convened a 
select group of members to discuss the future of medicine, AAPHR was asked to 
send a representative. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would never have happened even a few years ago," Schatz said. "We're 
finally getting somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's burgeoning presence is reflected in numbers; membership has almost 
tripled since 1993 to 1,200 members, and that number is expected to reach 2,000 
by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 But the expansion has had a price. Growing pains are obvious as the 
organization struggles to define its identity. It's thorniest problem is 
whether to change the cumbersome and euphemistic name to one that would clearly 
denote a homosexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 Members have until Friday to return ballots on the proposed name change, and 
Schatz, who is overseeing the vote, said he has no idea what the outcome will 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's dilemma reflects the same struggle facing gay doctors all over the 
country: whether to divulge their sexual identities to patients and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The anguish of this decision was apparent in the group's recent newsletter. 
Said O'Hanlan, who suggests a name such as Gay and Lesbian American Medical 
Assn.: "As agents of change, our most powerful tool is our visibility." 
</P>
<P>
 But, said another member, writing from a small rural town: "I cannot risk 
being associated with anything that would identify me as being gay . . . (it) 
would destroy my practice and throw me into bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 Schatz sighed when asked about the turmoil accompanying the name change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're turning 13. This is our bar mitzvah year," he said. "We are becoming an 
adult organization. And we are trying to find our identity and figure out what 
we'll be doing the rest of our lives. You can't change this much without 
conflicts. But that's good. It means people care about the organization." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Members give different reasons for why, after 13 years, both membership and 
outside acceptance have suddenly soared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's a coincidence that our membership increased during the 
Clinton presidency," Schatz said, noting that membership in other gay doctors 
groups -- such as medical students, lesbian doctors and medical specialty 
groups -- has also risen. "I think the gay and lesbian community, as a whole, 
was exhausted (during the Reagan and Bush eras) by being seen as second-class 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hanlan said the rising number of openly gay doctors is similar to what is 
occurring in other professions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gay and lesbian doctors have become fed up with homophobia. I think we have 
less patience for it now. More of us are saying, 'We ought not to hide.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the debate over a possible name change shows that it is not that easy to 
put one's beliefs before practical considerations. Many doctors within the 
organization say they fear a name change would jeopardize their practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Belonging to an openly gay group, they say, would put them one step closer to 
being "outed" in communities that are not ready for them. About half of AAPHR 
members have practices that treat mostly heterosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most gay and lesbian physicians feel very isolated," Schatz said. "Seventy 
percent of our members are outside New York and California. Chances are they 
are in a center in which they are the only one." 
</P>
<P>
 AAPHR leaders acknowledge this fear. In a recent member survey, the majority 
said they had experienced professional problems related to their sexual 
orientation. Almost two-thirds of the doctors said they thought their practices 
would be jeopardized if their colleagues found out they were gay. And almost 
75% believed that they would suffer if their patients found out. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen percent said they had been refused medical privileges, fired or 
denied educational opportunities, employment or promotions because of their 
sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 One California psychiatrist, who asked not to be named, recalled applying for 
a psychiatric residency in Massachusetts and receiving an unexpected rejection 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I later found out from others on the committee that I had been selected, but 
the committee chairman had rejected me because he wasn't comfortable having a 
gay resident," the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who stay in the closet, membership with the AAPHR helps fight the 
feeling of isolation and loneliness, O'Hanlan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Medical school was one of the most difficult times of my life," she said. "At 
the time, I was becoming aware I was a lesbian. Not only did I think I was the 
only doctor like this, I thought I was the only person like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he has publicly acknowledged his homosexuality and works in a very 
supportive community, Dr. Mark Litwin, a urological surgeon who is also on the 
faculty of UCLA, said he draws support from AAPHR. 
</P>
<P>
 "AAPHR allowed me to feel comfortable knowing I am not the only gay physician 
in the world," Litwin said. "Many of our issues are the same. Such as, what is 
going to happen to me if I come out professionally? What I found, to my 
pleasant surprise, is nothing changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming out as a group, however, may be more difficult. Litwin, like others, 
worries that his gay colleagues in more isolated areas might feel uncomfortable 
if the group changes its name. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The AAPHR focus, however, goes well beyond its members' concerns. The group's 
mission is also to work to improve the health of gay men and lesbians. In the 
past year, the group has started a Lesbian Health Project and this month will 
host a medical conference on HIV prevention among gays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The debate over gay and lesbian rights has been very much an issue of civil 
rights," Schatz said. "But there are so many ways in which homophobia has an 
impact on health. Discrimination is not only unfair but harmful to health." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, surveys have shown a high level of discomfort with homosexuality 
among heterosexual doctors. In one study of 1,121 primary care doctors, 35% 
said they would feel nervous among a group of homosexuals. And a survey of 930 
doctors in San Diego showed almost a quarter biased against gays. 
</P>
<P>
 Many gays, fearing rebuke, either refuse to seek medical care or hide their 
sexual orientation from their doctors, Schatz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most (homosexuals) go and hope the doctor is not going to hate them and will 
be somewhat knowledgeable," Schatz said. "Gays and lesbians deserve better than 
that. People shouldn't have to play medical Russian roulette." 
</P>
<P>
 AAPHR has worked with several medical specialty groups to urge them to welcome 
gay patients by adding non-discrimination statements to their bylaws and 
rewriting patient literature so it is sensitive to people of any sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Roy Schwarz, a vice president of the powerful AMA, credits Schatz with 
persuading the AMA to add a sexual-orientation non-discrimination clause to its 
bylaws last year. The AMA had refused similar requests in four previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made a lot of converts when he spoke on the floor to our house of 
delegates," Schwarz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the AMA, the 30,000-member American Medical Women's Assn. last 
November officially banned discrimination based on sexual orientation. But that 
is just a start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a long process," Schatz said. "It's a monumental task, not a 
small problem. We're talking about a profession in which anti-gay sentiment is 
pervasive." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors should lead the way in dispelling homophobia, O'Hanlan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that health professionals, who are frequently seen as the 
pillars of society, are no more educated about gay and lesbian people than the 
general public," she said. "Physicians could, potentially, be leaders in 
disseminating accurate information about gay and lesbian people. But instead 
they follow." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the AAPHR is leading this movement and has chosen to work quietly and 
professionally -- within mainstream medicine -- to lobby for change. Most of 
the organization's members -- 60% of whom are male -- are interested in 
science, not politics, O'Hanlan noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're distinguished physicians," she said. "Most of us are authors in our 
respective fields. We deserve to be recognized by people like Donna Shalala." 
</P>
<P>
 But whether the group can gain power under the guise of a misleading name is 
its biggest question. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, Schatz said he does wish that the office would stop getting 
calls from people "concerned about political prisoners in Costa Rica." 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't know what we do," he lamented. "Our name impinges on people 
hearing about what we do. We shouldn't be an organization whose name is in the 
closet."

BOYS AND THEIR TOYS; GI JOE TRIVIA

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Names originally considered for GI Joe: Salty the Sailor, Ace the Pilot, 
Rocky the Marine. 
</P>
<P>
 * The scar on Joe's cheek represents more than machismo.It was the only way 
Hasbro could trademark his face. Similarly, early prototypes featured a 
misplaced thumbnail that was incorporated into the design as another protection 
against copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
 * If Joe were built to human scale, he would stand 5 feet, 9 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Perhaps the most collectable GI Joe is the female version, which was 
discontinued afer one year. A mint-condition GI Nurse Action Girl sold for 
almost $5,000 at a toy show last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last fall, a group of performance artists in the East Village of Manhattan 
purchased as many as 300 "Talking Duke" GI Joes and "Teen Talk" Barbies and 
switched their voice mechanisms. They were able to sneak the toys back onto 
store shelves in at least two states. A number of boys who bought the miniature 
fighting man home were startled to hear him utter, in a high-pitched 
voice,"Let's plan our dream wedding!"

 Regular dental check-ups can reveal more than just cavities and other toothy 
problems. Sometimes a dentist can diagnose trouble elsewhere in the body 
because the first symptoms of many diseases show up in the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 The mouth, doctors say, is like a mirror to the rest of the body. 
</P>
<P>
 "The variety of tissues in the oral cavity represent so many similar tissues 
in parts of the body where it would be hard to readily detect a problem," says 
Dr. Alvan Sheath, an oral pathologist and specialist in diseases of the mouth 
at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a guide to what the gums, teeth, bone, tongue, salivary glands and soft 
tissues can say about your health:

 * Dental X-rays not only expose cavities, but may identify bone diseases by 
showing excessive bone growth or loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * X-rays may also reveal secondary growths of breast, lung, colon and prostate 
cancers, Sheath says. "A tumor within the jawbone may be the first tangible 
indication of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * Non-functioning adrenal glands may cause skin pigmentation changes inside 
the mouth, and pigmentation changes around the mouth can signal lower 
gastrointestinal tumors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Non-functioning salivary glands, or dry mouth, may be the result of an 
overly stressful lifestyle, Sheath says. "Salivary glands shut down when people 
are anxious." 
</P>
<P>
 * In some instances, an undetected heart attack may be felt as pain in the 
teeth and jaw. When all other dental problems are ruled out, a sharp dentist 
will consider heart attack as a possibility, Sheath says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pale tissues and gums or a very red tongue can indicate blood disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 * An enlarged tongue can suggest thyroid trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gum disease may signify diabetes, vitamin C or D deficiency, or infectious 
viruses. "If we find there's no other reason for severe gingivitis or lesions 
in the mouth, we question the patient further and may send them to be tested 
(for HIV) and then onto an appropriate physician," says Dr. Chih-Ko Yeh, an 
assistant professor specializing in infectious diseases/dental diagnostic 
science at the University of Texas, San Antonio, which has one of the nation's 
leading dental schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * HIV and AIDS may also manifest themselves as mouth ulcers. Candida 
infection, tuberculosis, vitamin B deficiency and allergies are also conditions 
that can produce ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
 * And what if you have a toothache? Most times, a toothache is just a 
toothache.

BODY WATCH; HURRAY FOR HAIR. LOTS OF IT. THE THICKER, LONGER OR BUSHIER, THE 
BETTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHNNY DODD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Today's important, thought-provoking topic is body hair and why it's so 
important for a guy to possess it. Lots of it. Torrents of it, erupting from 
every pore. I'm not really sure why that is. But any guy worth his weight in 
testosterone will tell you it's so. If he doesn't, he's either lying or 
suffering from the early stages of male pattern baldness. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's why: Whenever a guy spots hair on another guy, even something as 
innocuous as a thick bristle of nose hair, something happens. He thinks back to 
happier, saner times, long before the bubonic plague or organized religion or 
even golf. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all really subtle, kind of like an acid flashback, only without the part 
where your girlfriend begins to look like Alexander Haig covered in Day-Glo 
purple velvet. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a guy is transported back to the good old days, when his brain was 
no larger than a lemon-flavored Skittle and he and his buddies could spend 
hours shuffling semi-erect across a savanna, grunting: "You know, our bean may 
only be as large as a lemon-flavored Skittle, but at least we have hair." 
</P>
<P>
 And that somehow made everything better, especially for all those Cro-Magnon 
plumbers who were making a killing unclogging pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, though, our brains increased in volume to something resembling that of 
a good-sized yam. And although this would eventually lead to the development of 
aerosol food products, it also marked the beginning of hairlessness as we know 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's when all the problems started. Even though Heather Locklear was 
invented, life continued to get unbearably painful for most guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Why's that? Because body hair is like Novocain. He who lets it grow kills the 
pain of being a man. But he who lets it grow too long runs the risk of getting 
it caught in heavy machinery, a leading source of unpleasantness for many guys. 
</P>
<P>
 My very own highly interesting relationship with body hair started early. Like 
many guys, I was born without it. Owing to the fact that I come from a 
particularly hairless breed of Episcopalians, I stayed that way for a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 As a youth, I built a small shrine in my bedroom to a thick-bristled 
paintbrush I found in the garage. Each night, I prayed to Robin Williams, the 
Mirthful Deity of Hair Abundance, to grant me any sort of growth whatsoever. 
Anything at all. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those mutated, kinked mole hairs that my English lit teacher had 
growing on her chin would have been appreciated. So would a clump of eerily 
colored, menacingly textured rogue hairs, the kind that pop up from time to 
time in various places and convince you that maybe you and those in-bred folks 
in "Deliverance" had more in common than just a love for banjo music. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, though, I was rewarded for my perseverance with a couple of 
whiskers on my chin. Several were fruitful and multiplied up and down my 
cheeks. A few even took root above my lip. There was much rejoicing. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the unibrow incident. My mother, a good woman with admirable 
although often somewhat warped intentions, became concerned that being in 
possession of a singular brow would keep me out of college. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wanna look like Leonid Brezhnev?" she'd wail. 
</P>
<P>
 So one afternoon she handed me $35 and sent me to her electrologist. I 
pocketed the cash, eventually went to college, cultivated a fairly successful 
Vandyke and even sprouted a few scraggly chest hairs. They may not be much, but 
in a few decades I should have enough to comb up -- and over -- to create a 
decent pair of sideburns.

BODY WATCH; HAIR OR BARE?; WOMEN AND PEACH FUZZ? NO WAY. NOT THIS WOMAN, 
ANYWAY.

<P>
 A few years ago, my brother dated a medical student who also happened to be 
exceptionally vain, rich and beautiful. Naturally, I hated her. One day -- I'm 
guessing while studying endocrinology -- she roared out the door making tracks 
for the nearest electrolysis parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the matter, my dear?" asked the electrolysis lady. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to help me," pleaded the medical student. "I'm suffering from 
secondary hirsutism! " 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like the plague, doesn't it? Well, it was. 
</P>
<P>
 She had found a hair on her chin. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you know what happens when a pre-menopausal woman finds a hair on her chin? 
Have you ever seen "An American Werewolf in London"? Remember that scene where 
the guy's hair starts sprouting everywhere, his hands suddenly stretch into 
claws, his teeth become fangs? 
</P>
<P>
 You get a little emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm gonna tell you something that I don't share with most people, as long as 
you promise not to go blabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, after it became hormonally impossible to ignore, I accepted 
the fact of my Armenian heritage and brought home a tub of Jolen Cream Bleach. 
A five o'clock shadow might be fine for George Michael, but it's not such a 
great look for someone in a skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have never used Jolen, you probably don't know that it comes in two 
parts -- a white cream and a white powder. When you mix them, they turn into a 
concoction that gives off stinky fumes and scares the color right out of 
whatever hair it happens to come in contact with. 
</P>
<P>
 I managed to mix the two substances without blowing myself up. Then, following 
the directions, I slathered some of it under my nose. It was to sit there for 
15 minutes, or until my nose hairs were singed by the burnt-smelling fumes, 
whichever came first. 
</P>
<P>
 After about 10 minutes, when the pain became only slightly less intense than 
when I had my armpits waxed (more about that later), I had to scrape it off. 
</P>
<P>
 I rinsed my upper lip with cold water, trying hard not to swallow any of the 
goo because God knows, my teeth are white enough. I patted my lip with a towel 
and bent toward the bathroom mirror for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad. 
</P>
<P>
 I now had a mustache fit for an Alpine shepherdess, providing, of course, that 
she was a natural blond. It looked a little odd against my olive-toned skin, 
but it was a definite improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 And so I went about my fetching way, until about a month later when my darling 
husband took me in his arms, leaned in for a smooch and stopped well short of 
my lips. His eyes, no longer melting pools of passion, were riveted to a spot 
just between my upper lip and my nostrils. 
</P>
<P>
 He furrowed his brow. Then he smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ba-ack!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's the problem with body hair when you are a babe. You can't just get rid 
of it. It's like a poltergeist that way -- and about as welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 I opted for bleach because, although I strongly believe in suffering for 
beauty -- the alternatives seemed even too masochistic for me. 
</P>
<P>
 Electrolysis? Stick a small needle-like instrument into my hair follicle to 
shock it into oblivion? I don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxing? I'll tell you about waxing, then you'll understand why I tried it only 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you know what waxing involves? 
</P>
<P>
 You take hot melted wax and pour it onto your hairy body parts -- your legs, 
your armpits, your, ahem, bikini area. You let it cool and then rrrrrrippppppp 
the wax away. The wax peels every little hair right out of its follicle. 
</P>
<P>
 The next thing I knew, I was peeling myself off the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I kind of gave up on the idea of ever having a pristine upper lip. I just 
don't have the discipline to stay on top of new growth. 
</P>
<P>
 And after a major breakthrough with my therapist, I can now joke freely about 
it. Is it too much to expect people to get the humor? 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when I was invited to appear on "Oprah" in a segment on newspaper 
columnists, I made a little joke while the makeup artist was slathering 
something beautifying on my face. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, uh, hey," I said, trying to bond, since she had the thickest eyebrows I 
had ever seen. "Can you do something for this mustache?" 
</P>
<P>
 She did not laugh. She furrowed her fuzzy, fuzzy brow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow!" she said, shaking her head. "That thing is definitely gonna show up on 
camera. If I put some concealer on it, it'll just look like a big white stripe 
on your upper lip. . . . I know what! I'll trim it with my little scissors 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 What a great sense of humor, I'm thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 And then I see the glint of metal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go like this," she says, twisting her mouth to the side like Lily Tomlin 
doing Ernestine. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, it did not grow back thicker. So far. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to be on the safe side, though, I never drink milk in public.

DEFICIT-FINANCED STATE BUDGET GOES TO WILSON; GOVERNMENT: SENATE OKS PLAN. SOME 
DEMOCRATS COMPLAIN THAT THE GOVERNOR WON TOO MANY CONCESSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate, convening in a rare Independence Day session, gave final 
legislative passage Monday night to a recession-squeezed, $57.3-billion state 
budget that largely reflects the priorities of Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit-financed measure, passed by the Assembly on Saturday, continues a 
series of red-ink state spending plans unrivaled since the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 It accommodates growth in public schools and universities and the state prison 
system, but cuts health and social services to the poor and aid to local 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget includes no new taxes. The $60 renters credit, which was suspended 
in 1993, will be kept dormant for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was approved on a vote of 27 to 11 -- the bare two-thirds majority 
required for passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it came four days late, passage of the budget will allow the state to 
borrow more than $4 billion this month to stave off an embarrassing round of 
IOUs, such as those issued two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats provided 17 of the 27 votes for the budget, but some grumbled that 
their leaders gave too much ground to the Republican governor, who is running 
for reelection to a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Pete Wilson won this one," said state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica), who tried without success to win approval for higher taxes on the 
wealthy and on businesses. "He is being given all the tools he needs for his 
campaign arsenal." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfred Alquist (D-San Jose) complained that a personal income tax cut for 
the wealthy scheduled to take effect in 1996 was left untouched even as 
programs for the poor were cut back. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have here is a budget balanced on the backs of the poorest and most 
defenseless in our society," Alquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Senate Leader Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), while conceding that there was 
little in the budget for Democrats to be proud of, implored his colleagues to 
vote for it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time for argument, the time for negotiation, has ended," Lockyer said. 
"It's time to act." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is expected to sign the budget bill today or Wednesday, after both 
houses of the Legislature have completed action on all the related measures 
needed to balance the spending plan and make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor already has signed the budget's most important companion measure, 
an extraordinary standby plan that could trigger deep cuts in all services 
except education if the state's fiscal condition deteriorates over the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 That bill, which Wilson signed Friday, was demanded by a consortium of 
international banks that will vouch for the state's credit when it borrows more 
than $4 billion from Wall Street investors to keep state operations afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Bank of America, the syndicate said Wilson's hope for a $2.8-billion 
bailout from the federal government the year after next was not sufficient to 
assure jittery financial markets that the state's debts would be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno said the budget will not resolve 
the state's ongoing fiscal problems. He said it will take higher taxes or 
deeper spending cuts to end a string of state deficits, and there are not 
sufficient votes for either. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the plan carries over part of last fiscal year's deficit and assumes 
that the state will not climb out of the red again until 1996, and then only 
with new aid from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best you could do under the current political situation," Maddy 
said after he and the other legislative leaders reached agreement with Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "There is absolutely no doubt that a year from now, unless there's a 
dramatic, beyond-all-belief recovery, that everything we have visited the last 
five or six years we will have to revisit. It will probably be the greatest 
opportunity we've ever had to restructure government and perhaps take some 
realistic view of what we're doing in California, what the future holds." 
</P>
<P>
 The budget provides enough money to allow kindergarten through 12th-grade 
schools to keep up with rising enrollments, though not inflation. State and 
local funding will total about $4,200 per student for the third consecutive 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Community college budgets also will hold steady, and the governor's proposal 
to raise fees 50% -- from $13 per unit to $20 -- was defeated. Fees for 
students at the University of California and California State University are 
expected to climb 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 The state prisons will get a 9% boost in taxpayer funding, enough to keep pace 
with the rapidly expanding number of felons behind bars. The budget includes 
money to pay for the expected increase in prison admissions caused by the 
passage earlier this year of the "three strikes" sentencing measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget trims funding for the poor who are in managed-care health plans and 
reduces payments to hospitals that care for the indigent. It eliminates funding 
for prenatal care for pregnant illegal immigrants. And it trims funds to the 
regional centers that care for the developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare grants will be reduced 2.3%, to $593 a month for a family of three. 
Aid to aged, blind and disabled couples also will be cut, from $1,297 a month 
to $1,267. Individuals in the program will see nominal reduction in their 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson and the legislative leaders agreed last week to deny 
additional benefits to women who conceive children after they go on the welfare 
rolls, a dispute developed Monday about the details of that accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Democrats, according to one aide, wanted to exempt from the provision 
welfare mothers who say they were using contraception when they became 
pregnant. Wilson opposes that idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was resolved by allowing the additional benefits -- about $120 per 
child -- to couples who have records showing they used contraceptive implants 
or sterilization that failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Carl Ingram contributed to this story. How the New Budget 
Affects You 
</P>
<P>
 The state budget with its billions of dollars in spending, and sizable 
deficit, will have an impact on most Californians, especially the poor and the 
young. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are: 
</P>
<P>
 * A tenant, you will lose the renters tax credit for another year. The credit 
-- $60 for individuals and $120 for couples -- has been suspended for the past 
year but was scheduled to go back into effect at the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 * A University of California student, your fees will go up by 10%. That means 
the typical fee for undergraduates for the 1994-95 school year will be about 
$3,799 -- in addition to room, board and books. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Cal State student, your fees will go up $144, or 10%. That means that 
undergraduate fees will average $1,584 for the upcoming school year in addition 
to personal expenses, books and various activity charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * The parent of a student in primary or secondary schools, your child's school 
will get about the same amount as last year but will lose ground to inflation 
for the third year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 * A welfare parent with two children, your grant from the state will drop from 
$607 a month to $593. Parents who conceive additional children while on welfare 
no longer will receive additional benefits when the child is born. 
</P>
<P>
 * A poor, aged or disabled person, living independently, your monthly grant 
will drop from $603 to $602. Grants to couples will drop more sharply, from 
$1,109 monthly to $1,083. 
</P>
<P>
 * Blind, your monthly grant will drop from $670 for an individual to $657 and 
from $1,297 to $1,267 for a blind couple. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Medi-Cal patient who needs prescription drugs, you will be limited to six 
prescriptions per month without prior approval from the state.

REBELS TAKE OVER CAPITAL IN RWANDA; AFRICA: FRANCE BROADENS ROLE, THREATENS 
FORCE IF INSURGENTS CROSS LINE. ACTIONS COULD MARK TURNING POINT IN 3-MONTH-OLD 
WAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rebel troops overran Rwanda's capital and consolidated their hold on its 
second-largest city Monday, prompting French forces to declare the shrinking 
government-held pocket in the southwest a safe area under French protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The advances by the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels and 
France's determination to protect the Hutu-led rump government in the southwest 
seemed to mark a turning point in the 3-month-old civil war, which has torn 
this small Central African nation apart and led to extensive tribal slaughter, 
leaving hundreds of thousands dead. 
</P>
<P>
 France previously had insisted that its 12-day-old military intervention would 
be strictly humanitarian, steering clear of the civil war that has raged since 
April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 But Col. Didier Thiebault, French commander in the south, announced at forward 
headquarters here Monday that he has ordered that if the rebel front "comes 
here and threatens the population, we will open fire against them without any 
hesitation." 
</P>
<P>
 With the capital, Kigali, and the second-largest city, Butare, in their hands, 
the rebels control two-thirds of the country, mainly in the northeast and 
southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent rapid rebel advances have left France with a choice of risking direct 
involvement in the war or withdrawing its troops farther west toward the border 
with Zaire, 95 miles from here. 
</P>
<P>
 To have done the latter, French officers argued, would have made a mockery of 
the humanitarian mission that France says is the reason for its involvement 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, drawing a line around a large stretch of southwestern Rwanda and 
declaring it an inviolable humanitarian protection zone leaves France open to 
charges of once again propping up the reeling Rwandan army and the Hutu 
extremists responsible for much of the killing. In the early 1990s, French 
helicopters intervened decisively against the rebels to protect the regime of 
the late President Juvenal Habyarimana, whose death in a suspicious plane crash 
April 6 sparked the latest round of bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
 French officials insisted that their action in Rwanda is purely humanitarian. 
"Despite the deteriorating situation and the intensified fighting, we are 
resolutely continuing our humanitarian operation," a French Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said. "We have taken the initiative of setting up a safe humanitarian 
zone in western Rwanda." 
</P>
<P>
 Paris decided to go ahead with the zone without waiting for a formal green 
light from the U.N. Security Council president, expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels said they would ignore the French ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and to the U.N. 
Security Council president, the rebels said French troops have no business in 
Rwanda and risked a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The so-called security zone which France proposes to establish is in effect 
really only a safe haven for the authors and perpetrators of the genocide," 
wrote Gerald Gahima, the front's special envoy to the United States and the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels urged the Security Council to facilitate the deployment of a 
proposed force from the Organization of African Unity and the immediate 
withdrawal of French forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The front is composed mostly of Tutsis, who make up only 14% of Rwanda's 
population. Almost everyone else in the country is Hutu, including the bulk of 
the army. 
</P>
<P>
 White House spokesman Jeff Eller said, "The Administration continues to 
monitor French efforts in Rwanda" but had not yet had a chance to ask the 
French for details. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear Monday whether the fall of Kigali marked a major rout of 
government forces by the rebels or whether the government troops simply decided 
to stage a tactical withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reports of large numbers of government troops being killed or 
taken prisoner, and it appeared that most of the troops defending the capital 
had fled well ahead of the rebels' entry. 
</P>
<P>
 There were only a few thousand people left in Kigali, most of them seeking 
shelter. Almost the entire population was dependent on relief food that comes 
in intermittently on two daily Canadian flights from Nairobi, Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels' arrival in Kigali freed more than 8,000 Tutsis who had been living 
in terror of government-trained Hutu militias. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the small U.N. peacekeeping mission in Rwanda said the rebels 
had overrun the Defense Ministry, army headquarters and Radio Rwanda, which had 
incited massacres of Tutsis by civilian militiamen with its broadcasts of 
ethnic hate messages. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were jubilant," spokesman Maj. Jean-Guy Plante said of the Tutsi 
civilians freed from refuges in churches and a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to avoid a confrontation, the French withdrew Sunday from Butare as 
rebels approached. But they vowed Monday to stand and fight if rebels attempt 
military action beyond Gikongoro, 15 miles west of Butare. 
</P>
<P>
 The French have jet fighter-bombers stationed 300 miles away in Kisangani in 
eastern Zaire to provide potential air support, but their decision still 
appeared fraught with pitfalls. There are fewer than 1,000 French soldiers 
inside Rwanda, armed with nothing heftier than heavy mortars, antitank 
missiles, helicopters and armored cars equipped with 90-millimeter cannon. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees fleeing into Burundi or Zaire could pose serious problems for those 
countries, and even before Monday's rebel advances, up to 100,000 Rwandans were 
reported heading toward Burundi. 
</P>
<P>
 Burundi, with the same ethnic mix as Rwanda, is undergoing an ethnic and 
political crisis as it prepares to choose a new president next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaire is already politically shaky. Thousands of Rwandans were reportedly 
massacred in ethnic clashes last year in areas bordering Rwanda.

1-0 WORLD CUP LOSS TO BRAZIL ENDS U.S. HOPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing on the Fourth of July, and with a one-man advantage for much of the 
game, the United States seemed to have everything going for it in its bid for 
another historic soccer upset Monday -- except for one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Its opponent was Brazil, a three-time World Cup champion and the favorite to 
win this one. 
</P>
<P>
 At Stanford Stadium in front of a lively holiday crowd of 84,147 who dueled 
throughout the game with chants of "U.S.A.! U.S.A.!" and "Brazil! Brazil!" the 
United States held fast until 16 minutes from the finish, when the Brazilians 
broke through with the only goal they needed to advance to the quarterfinals 
next Saturday in Dallas against the Netherlands. The defeat eliminated the 
United States from further World Cup play. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Brazil Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said that his team, despite 
the closeness of a 1-0 score, was clearly dominant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The winners are always right," U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Milutinovic also said that he was proud of his team, a winner in the first 
round over another South American power, Colombia, and the first from the 
United States to advance to the World Cup's second round since 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sad that we haven't been able to go forward (to the next round)," he 
said. "At the same time, I'm happy because of the effort my players put forth 
in this World Cup. I'd like to thank my players for doing something truly 
spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic, who became known as a miracle worker among soccer coaches for the 
results he had in previous World Cups with Mexico and Costa Rica, devised a 
game plan Monday that made it extremely difficult for even a team as gifted as 
Brazil to score, deploying as many as nine men on defense at times. 
</P>
<P>
 While the United States made virtually no effort to penetrate Brazil's half of 
the field, the Brazilians were repelled time after time. But they continued to 
attack even while playing one man short for almost half the game. A defender, 
Leonardo, was banished with a red card one minute before halftime for slinging 
an elbow that connected with U.S. midfielder Tab Ramos' head. Ramos, who 
suffered a bone fracture above his left ear, had to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as it appeared that Milutinovic's goal of a scoreless draw that would 
send the game into overtime might materialize, Brazil's incomparable forward 
combination of Bebeto and Romario clicked. Drawing the defense toward him with 
a run down the middle of the field, Romario pushed off a pass into the right 
side of the penalty area to an open Bebeto, who scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just one ball went in," Romario said, "but, with a little more luck, two or 
three others could have too." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, which was playing in only its second World Cup since 1950 
and was winless in its most recent effort four years ago in Italy, could argue 
that, with a little more luck going its way, it could have stunned the soccer 
world for the second time in 12 days. As it is, it will have to be satisfied 
with the progress it has made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years ago when we left Italy, if anybody would have said that the U.S. 
team would make it to the round of 16, play Brazil and scare the living 
daylights out of a team that everybody acknowledges is the best in the world, 
they would have been considered absolutely crazy," U.S. Soccer Federation 
President Alan Rothenberg said. "But that's exactly what we did."

SIMPSON CASE CREATES TV JOB OPENINGS FOR LAWYERS; LAW: MANY ARE CALLED ON AS 
COMMENTATORS. BUT NOT ALL ARE QUALIFIED TO OFFER INSTANT ANALYSIS, SOME 
COLLEAGUES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Brown was sitting in an NBC affiliate 
station's studio opining about the O.J. Simpson case when he happened to look 
up at a monitor showing a rival station's program. 
</P>
<P>
 "For crying out loud, there was Peter," said Brown, referring to Peter Keane, 
a lawyer who sits 20 feet from him at their office. "We were competing against 
each other for ratings!" 
</P>
<P>
 Brown did a double take, but perhaps he should not have been so surprised. 
During the last several days, lawyers around the country have filed out of 
courtrooms and into television studios to interpret for viewers the latest 
legal maneuvers in Simpson's preliminary hearing, which has created a media 
feeding frenzy like no other murder case in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
 "This looks like the Lawyers Full Employment Act," cracked prominent Los 
Angeles criminal defense attorney Barry Tarlow, who has appeared on KNBC-TV 
Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
 These aspiring Howard Cosells of the legal world will be at it again today, 
calling the courtroom plays in the third day of the preliminary hearing to 
decide whether Simpson will go on trial on charges that he murdered his ex-wife 
and a friend of hers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the busiest of lawyers seem to have cleared their calendars to spend a 
few minutes in the spotlight, and networks and local stations have raced to 
sign up the biggest names. NBC has former Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner. ABC has one of the Menendez lawyers, Leslie Abramson. Johnnie L. 
Cochran Jr., Michael Jackson's lawyer, has been a roving free agent, appearing 
on Court TV, ABC's "Nightline" and NBC's "Today Show." 
</P>
<P>
 The commentaries of the TV lawyers have rankled some of their colleagues. They 
complain that lawyers without criminal law background or recent trial 
experience are weighing in on matters beyond their expertise. Even experienced 
criminal defense attorneys, they grumble, have made mistakes about the law in 
their scramble for a sound bite. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have some very good lawyers who are doing it," said Tarlow, "but then you 
have people who are either not criminal defense lawyers, or they are not anyone 
whose judgment a person would depend on. " 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers have long been subjects of television and radio news interviews. But 
during the Simpson trial they have leaped into a new role as consultants who 
watch the proceedings with the journalists and provide commentary during the 
breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lawyers who are appearing on television lament that they must give ready 
replies to legal questions without consulting a lawbook or reading a case. They 
feel they should be glib even when the truth requires a lot of qualification or 
specific knowledge of the facts of the crime or the police conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown recalled watching a high-priced Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer make 
a major gaffe on a national news program last week. He was asked about the 
admissibility of 911 tapes of Nicole Brown Simpson summoning police to 
intervene in domestic disputes in 1989 and 1993. The lawyer told the national 
TV audience the tapes might be introduced to show the ex-athlete's propensity 
for violence. But the lawyer was wrong, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could tell right away he felt uncomfortable about what he was saying," 
Brown said. "He wanted time to think about his answer, but he had to give the 
answer right there and then." 
</P>
<P>
 The neutrality of the lawyers may also be questionable. Some defense attorneys 
said they would purposely withhold comments from interviewers that could damage 
Simpson's defense, both out of concern for his rights and respect for his chief 
lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are saying a motion has no chance," a highly respected Southern 
California criminal defense lawyer said, referring to recent comments by 
lawyers in the news media, "you set up an expectation. And to the extent that 
saturates through the media, through the public and into the brain cells of the 
judge or judges who are going to be reviewing that, it might have some impact." 
</P>
<P>
 This lawyer, who has handled high-profile cases, refused to be identified by 
name because of his low opinion of some of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 On the prosecution side, former Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Robert 
Philibosian has also popped up frequently on news shows. Many lawyers 
questioned whether Philibosian, who is known for his strong law-and-order 
views, could be objective in analyzing the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 When called for a response, Philibosian could not be reached. A secretary said 
he was doing legal analysis for ABC News anchor Peter Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Levenson, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School, agreed that 
lawyers could bring their biases into their analyses before the cameras. "As 
long as your prior position is reported, if you make disclosure, you are OK," 
said Levenson, who is commenting on the Simpson proceedings for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Levenson is a former federal prosecutor. To make up for her lack of experience 
in state courts, she said, "I do an awful lot of studying." As part of her 
teaching and research, she also sits in on criminal trials in state court. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA law professor Peter Arenella, who practiced as a defense lawyer in Boston 
for 17 years, said he confines his commentary on ABC to legal areas in which he 
has expertise. He has not tried a case in years, he said, so on questions about 
defense tactics he defers to fellow commentator Leslie Abramson. Both are being 
paid for their commentary, said an ABC spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers agree to sign on as commentators for a variety of reasons. Money is 
one consideration, although neither the networks nor the lawyers would say how 
lucrative the assignments are. 
</P>
<P>
 But the broadcast barristers claim they are not getting rich off TV 
appearances. Arenella said his pay from ABC is substantially less than the 
average hourly fee earned by an attorney. Levenson said she has not yet 
received a contract but probably will donate what she receives to her law 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles defense attorney Joel R. Isaacson, who has handled many death 
penalty cases, provided legal commentary last week for Channel 9, watching the 
preliminary hearing at the station with the news anchors and commenting on it 
for viewers during court breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is exciting," said Isaacson, who is not getting paid for his time on the 
air. "You have to be on your toes and follow it closely and try to be prepared 
to respond to reporter questions." 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge arranged his court schedule Thursday so that he could 
be at the television studio for the opening of the Simpson hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Other practicing lawyers said juggling a few days away from the office to sit 
in a studio was not particularly difficult last week, although sustaining it 
throughout Simpson's preliminary hearing -- which could run at least another 
week -- would take a toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a big thrill for a lot of people early on," said Los Angeles 
defense attorney Alvin Michaelson, who has provided unpaid commentary for CNN 
and others on the Simpson case, "but I don't think it is going to last very 
long for those who have other lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Isaacson expects his television work will be "a positive thing" for his 
career. "But I think the reality is that maybe it is impressive to the legal 
community," he said. " . . . You become respected by other professionals in the 
field, which helps in general terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarlow, who is frequently interviewed by the news media, insisted that his 
high profile has not brought a dime to his lucrative practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you get," he complained, "is a bunch of crackpots, someone calling up and 
saying, 'The FBI planted a bug in my head, and will you file a civil-rights 
action?' " 
</P>

LOVE OF FAMILY TURNED TO TRAGEDY IN CRASH KILLING 14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Claudia Jean Funches took her grandchildren with her everywhere. To the 
market, to the beach, to the park -- more than a dozen children in all. They 
filled her life and her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of them lived with her in a South-Central Los Angeles townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would say to us, 'Y'all need to stop having all these babies,' but they'd 
still keep coming," said Mary Adams, mother of two of Funches' grandchildren. 
"And she'd be right there." 
</P>
<P>
 So it made sense that Funches would want to take as many of the children as 
possible along for the 1,500-mile drive to Vicksburg, Miss., where she was born 
and grew up. The occasion was a family reunion, and she had been anticipating 
the visit for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wanted to show off her grandchildren," Adams said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Funches and her family had gotten to Weatherford, Tex., on Sunday morning when 
tragedy struck. Fourteen passengers, including 11 of her grandchildren, died in 
a fiery wreck along the interstate. Only four people who had been riding in the 
Funches van survived, including the 47-year-old grandmother of the clan. 
</P>
<P>
 Funches was driving on a suspended California driver's license, Texas 
authorities said Monday. Because of the Fourth of July holiday, they were not 
able to determine why it had been suspended. The accident was under 
investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board and Texas officials. 
Autopsies were pending. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, Funches pulled the van 
over to the shoulder because of a malfunction in the suspension. She was 
driving the van back onto the interstate when a tractor-trailer slammed into 
its rear, sending it 600 feet down the side of the road into a guardrail and 
finally across two lanes of traffic and into the median. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest of the dead grandchildren was 8-month-old Eric Bell, the oldest 
12-year-old Lashawn Wingfield, according to family members in Los Angeles. The 
victims included Claudia Funches' daughter, Henrietta, a grand-nephew and a 
family friend, Katherine Deal. Another daughter, Nicole, 22, survived the crash 
as did two grandsons, Ricky Wince and Gregory Bell, both 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Funches was at Parkland Hospital in Dallas on Monday in good condition. "She 
blames herself," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi had been her past and she wanted it to be her future too. The 
sometime nursing assistant told Adams recently that she wanted to move back. 
"She told me, 'Mary, I'm going to buy some land and move all the grandchildren 
back,' " Adams recalled Monday. "She said it was cheaper out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Funches had been back several times in the last few years -- driving her 
brother's 1977 Dodge van or taking a bus -- but the occasions were always sad 
ones. "The only times she'd been back were for funerals," Adams said. "She lost 
her mother last year. She lost her father a couple of months ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there is another sad journey to be made to Mississippi -- the funerals of 
the accident victims will all be held there, according to a family member. 
</P>
<P>
 Funches had wanted to take Adams' children on the trip but their father, 
Claude Bell, Funches' son, had vetoed the idea. "He had a bad feeling," Adams 
said. Bell is serving a prison term and expects to be out in January, according 
to Adams. "He said, 'Mama, don't go. Wait until I come back and we'll all go.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Funches had raised eight children -- a ninth died of pneumonia very young -- 
on her own. She was on a second round of mothering. Five grandchildren lived 
with her in her small, three-bedroom townhouse. It was also home to a couple of 
her daughters, a future son-in-law and the 1-year-old grandson of her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we go over there, all the kids would be there, running up and down 
the stairs, or running in the kitchen," Adams remembered, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday, when Adams and her sister went to the house to be with relatives, 
it was quiet. "There was nothing," said the sister who asked not to be named. 
"It was so still." 
</P>
<P>
 In the house Monday, family members were still coping with the shock and 
recalling the children who died. Trevon and Nicholas liked art -- as well as 
helping their uncles work on cars. Paul Haye, the fiance of survivor Nicole 
Funches, talked about their daughter, Jovanea, who was killed in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a happy little girl," he said. "I would play with her out there in 
front," he said, pointing to a dirt front yard brightened by sprigs of pink 
bougainvillea intertwined on the iron grates of the fence. Haye smiled 
ruefully. "I just miss my little baby," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family members tried to explain how Claudia Funches took care of so many 
children. According to Adams, she worked sometimes as a nursing assistant. She 
also received aid for the children from the county, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't difficult, that's what she liked to do," said Kimberly Funches. "It 
wasn't like she did it by herself. Everyone pitched in." 
</P>
<P>
 In the living room of the white stucco townhouse, with the television silently 
turned to news, they sifted through color snapshots and showed off a framed 
picture of Jovanea smiling, her hair a garden of colorful barrettes. With a 
surreal calm, they scrutinized the heartbreakingly long list of names of the 
dead or injured for reporters, supplying correct last names, pointing out 
misspelled first names and wrong ages, retelling family stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams talked about how they celebrated Christmas and Easter as a family. On 
Easter, there was a big egg hunt. Among the hidden eggs was one with a $25 sign 
painted on it. Whoever found that egg got $25 as a present from Claude Bell, 
the father of Adams' children. "It was only for the kids," Adams said laughing. 
"All the parents had to stay out." 
</P>
<P>
 One daughter, Henrietta, died in the crash with her four children. Two 
daughters who stayed in Los Angeles each lost a child. Willie May Bell, another 
daughter in Los Angeles who is six months pregnant, lost one daughter and three 
sons and had to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives said that the official police accounting of names and ages contains 
some errors. Not listed as either a victim or survivor, they said, is a baby 
named Ezelle Conley, who was a grand-nephew of Claudia Funches. 
</P>
<P>
 They paused and looked up at the television as news of their tragedy suddenly 
played. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the screen door, the smell of barbecue wafted by, a reminder of the 
holiday that they would not get a chance to celebrate.

COLUMN ONE; CLINTON'S VISCERAL OPPOSITION; THE PRESIDENT HAS BECOME THE TARGET 
OF BITTER ACCUSATIONS UNPRECEDENTED IN TONE AND INTENSITY. SOME SAY THE VITRIOL 
IS BEING FUELED BY A NEW ATTACK CULTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It doesn't take much to oppose a President's budget or denounce his health 
care plan or fulminate against members of his Cabinet. But you really have to 
hate a guy to picket his mother's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Fred Phelps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I got his attention," says Phelps, a Baptist minister, disbarred 
attorney and sometime political candidate, recalling how he and members of his 
congregation drove the 439 miles from Wichita, Kan., to Hot Springs, Ark., in 
January to denounce Clinton outside the church where his mother was eulogized. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps' words are as rough-edged as his tactics. "People don't trust that 
sleazy hypocrite, babbling the Bible out one side of his mouth while pushing 
his baby-killing, fag-promoting agenda on the world," he says when asked why he 
dislikes Clinton so. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a mistake to call Phelps typical. Even among those who share his 
intense dislike for the President, most would stop short of disturbing the 
dead. But in his flamboyance, Phelps vividly exemplifies a phenomenon abroad in 
the land -- the Clinton haters. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Wotring is one. A soft-spoken 54-year-old widow who runs a small 
business outside Toledo, Ohio, and listens regularly to broadcasts of the Rev. 
Pat Robertson, she worries that Clinton is heading the nation toward "a 
socialist government." She has heard, and is inclined to believe, tales 
circulated by conservative activists that link Clinton to drug running, 
multiple murders and financial corruption. And she shares with many other 
conservatives a deep distaste for the two H's of Clinton Hatred -- Hillary and 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I disapprove of women in high positions like that. She has no business doing 
what she's doing," Wotring says. 
</P>
<P>
 As for gays, well, "this is a free country," she says. "Gays have rights, but 
we have rights too. Gays are going to have AIDS, that's almost a known fact. 
They want to be in the military so that when they get AIDS the government can 
take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
 At least a quarter of the population tells pollsters they "strongly 
disapprove" of Clinton -- a measure of presidential opposition almost unheard 
of during a period of peace and moderate prosperity. Within that group, 
pollsters estimate that perhaps half -- about 30 million Americans -- nurture a 
dislike of Clinton that burns with the pure flame of hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of such a large and visceral opposition has damaged Clinton -- 
distracting him, as he showed on June 24 with an outburst during a radio 
interview aboard Air Force One in which he denounced attacks by the Rev. Jerry 
Falwell and talk-show host Rush Limbaugh; stiffening his Republican opponents 
in Congress against compromise, and keeping his aides and the media occupied 
with a steady rain of charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the attacks eat up information time," says Clinton strategist Mandy 
Grunwald. "He says 'health care' and the opposition says 'Whitewater.' He says 
'crime' and they say 'Paula Jones.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The result is "an environment that has been really hard to communicate in." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's background -- from his avoidance of the draft to his alleged marital 
infidelities -- make him an inviting target. But both conservative and liberal 
analysts agree that the intensity, tenor and extent of the attacks on him are 
part of a broader trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've entered an era in which people are more shrill, more negative. Clinton 
is just an example of that," says Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. "There is, 
today, a new-found institutionalization of hate -- of anti-politician hatred. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say things now that 15 years ago, you would never say," Mellman adds. 
"We've loosened the bounds." New Attack Culture 
</P>
<P>
 Some political analysts believe the vitriol of the attacks will backfire, and 
already some prominent conservatives have begun distancing themselves from 
Clinton's most fervent opponents. "I think this is beyond the pale," said 
former Education Secretary William J. Bennett, an often-mentioned Republican 
presidential hopeful. "When you start getting into bizarre stuff that I think 
lacks any substantiation whatsoever, you discredit responsible criticism." 
</P>
<P>
 That this President has become the object and test case for the power of the 
new attack culture is a matter of considerable irony, for Bill Clinton -- a 
politician who considers compromise not a necessary evil, but a positive good 
-- came into office saying that he had a special mission to knit the nation 
back together after a decade and more of ideological strife. Just get past the 
"false choices" of ideological extremes and political leaders could forge a new 
consensus of the center, Clinton and many of his advisers believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, notes Republican pollster William McInturff, 17 months into his term, 
Clinton has become a polarizing figure approaching the scale of Ronald Reagan 
in the depths of the 1982 recession or Lyndon Johnson during Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Even by that measure, the attacks on Clinton are different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ronald Reagan had some very hostile, very articulate, very combative 
detractors," notes Reagan's former pollster, Richard Wirthlin. But "most of 
Reagan's opposition was political," while Clinton's is "cultural, not 
political" in the traditional sense. That "cultural disconnect has added 
another gallon of gasoline to the fires." 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural anxieties center on the issue that Clinton has made his mantra -- 
change. For those -- including many white Americans -- who feel their dominant 
status in society slipping, who see the values they have long cherished 
challenged by newcomers espousing different views, and who worry about the 
future that awaits them and their children, Clinton's espousal of still more 
change has come to symbolize all the threats to their way of life. That focus 
helps explain why Mrs. Clinton and the Administration's support for the civil 
rights of gays and lesbians have both become lightning rods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like all this," said Raymond Reiland, 72, of Iowa City, Iowa, in a 
comment typical of many Clinton detractors. "I'm an older guy, we've seen an 
awful lot of changes recently. We kind of thought the way we looked at life was 
a better way of doing things." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's personal conduct deepens that anxiety. His detractors see Clinton's 
stands on issues such as abortion or civil rights for gays combining with 
aspects of his personal life -- from his alleged infidelities to his wife's 
non-traditional role -- into a unified attack on traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
 His most ardent opponents go beyond that, seeing Clinton as not just a 
President whom they dislike, but one whom they regard as illegitimate -- one 
who achieved his high office by hoodwinking the country into viewing him as a 
moderate, rather than a liberal, and who has disgraced the country by his 
personal conduct. The idea of illegitimacy was clearly expressed by a hero of 
the right, Oliver L. North, in his speech accepting the Republican nomination 
for the U.S. Senate in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We send the Clintons and their cronies a simple but unmistakable message," 
North declared. "This is our government. You stole it, and we are going to take 
it back." Barriers Lowered 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, several factors have lowered the barriers that, in earlier days, 
protected a President from attacks: 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the Cold War has changed the stature of the President -- moving him 
off the imperial heights of the "most powerful man in the world" to the mundane 
level of a political leader struggling over incremental domestic policy 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton's own willingness to engage fully in the world of popular culture 
-- appearing on Arsenio Hall's TV show during the campaign and on MTV forums 
during his presidency -- has leveled the distance from ordinary voters that 
insulated past presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moving from Fleetwood Mac to 'Ruffles and Flourishes' is very tough," says 
Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, referring to the rock band that performed 
Clinton's campaign theme song and the presidential fanfare. "Voters are in a 
very conflicted mood about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But overlaying all that, "conservatives do seem to have channels of 
communicating with their own," says Wirthlin. "Rush Limbaugh, Ralph Reed, Pat 
Robertson -- that adds an intensity. There's simply a more vitriolic tone that 
I didn't see evident (from the opposition) during the Reagan years." Reckless 
Accusations 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Clinton's most visceral opponents have unleashed a barrage both 
breathtakingly intense and astonishingly reckless. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent letter sent to media organizations, for example, former Rep. 
William Dannemeyer, the conservative Orange County Republican who left Congress 
in 1992 to run for the U.S. Senate, demanded a congressional hearing into what 
he termed a "frightening" series of deaths "under other than natural 
circumstances" of people with a connection to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since President Clinton had a direct or indirect contact with these people 
who have died, it raises the very serious question of whether he is involved, 
directly or indirectly, in their deaths," Dannemeyer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In another example, Falwell ran a promotion in May on his "Old Time Gospel 
Hour" for a videotape on which longtime opponents accuse Clinton, in lurid 
fashion, of having a hand in multiple murders. The attackers also suggest that 
Vincent Foster, the deputy White House counsel whose death last summer was 
ruled a suicide, actually was assassinated to cover up a massive stock 
manipulation swindle engineered by Mrs. Clinton and officers of the wealthy, 
Arkansas-based Stevens family. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark DeMoss, a spokesman for Falwell, says the conservative minister, who sold 
"tens of thousands" of the videotapes at $43 per copy, does not know whether 
the accusations are true or false. "He thinks they should be investigated," 
DeMoss said in a recent interview. Proceeds from tape sales paid for almost all 
of Falwell's air time on about 200 TV stations nationwide, DeMoss added. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of the videotapes, along with fund-raising drives by Clinton 
attackers such as conservative activist Floyd Brown, represent one aspect of 
the new attack culture -- the rise of what might be called "scandal 
entrepreneurs." 
</P>
<P>
 A generation ago, direct-mail fund-raisers discovered how well the specter of 
powerful enemies could generate money for political candidates. A second 
generation of the direct-mail industry learned to use the technique to raise 
money not primarily for a candidate, but for the fund-raisers themselves. The 
scandal entrepreneurs represent a third generation who first create an issue 
and then milk it as a source of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the company that produced Falwell's videotape, Citizens for 
Honest Government, based in Winchester, Calif., recently produced a sequel that 
repeats the earlier allegations and adds the charge that as governor of 
Arkansas, Clinton took part in an effort to use the Arkansas Development 
Finance Agency to launder millions of dollars in profits from drug running. So 
far, 20,000 copies of the sequel have been sold, along with more than 100,000 
of the original, company officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusers offer no evidence for any of their allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arkansas finance agency, known as ADFA, was the subject of extensive 
investigation by The Times and other news organizations during the 1992 
campaign. Reporters found that law firms and bond underwriters with ties to 
Clinton were enriched by contracts with the agency and that ADFA provided state 
assistance to many companies whose executives gave contributions to Clinton's 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 But the investigations uncovered no evidence of money laundering or drug 
transactions. Indeed, Clinton's main accuser, Larry Nichols, a disgruntled 
former mid-level ADFA employee who has fed reporters allegations against 
Clinton since 1990, only recently began making the drug accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer, for his part, includes in his list of "unnatural" deaths many that 
only the most determined conspiracy theorist could find suspicious -- the 
demise, for example, of Paul Tully, a brilliant Democratic political strategist 
who was also an overweight chain smoker and who died of a heart attack in his 
Little Rock hotel room during the 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The former congressman also attempts to link Clinton to the deaths of four 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents in the assault on the David 
Koresh compound in Waco, Tex., last year. Dannemeyer identifies the four men as 
"Clinton bodyguards" -- a notion first circulated shortly after the Waco 
disaster by supporters of Koresh, who insisted the men had been shot in the 
back by fellow agents to prevent them from revealing Clinton's secrets. Role of 
the Media 
</P>
<P>
 Like many such stories, this one has a grain of truth at its base. Every four 
years, the Secret Service, an arm of the Treasury Department, recruits agents 
from other parts of Treasury, particularly ATF, to help with protecting 
candidates. The four men did assist at some Clinton appearances, but did not 
have close contact with him, according to ATF officials. Evidence at the trial 
of surviving followers of Koresh did not indicate that any federal agents were 
shot in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, such accusations have become staples of radio programs, 
television broadcasts, magazines and newsletters of the political right. And 
prominent Clinton attackers are now regular features at conservative 
gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Corbin Jones, for example, first aired her accusations of sexual 
harassment against Clinton at a Washington news conference sponsored by the 
American Conservative Union. She subsequently repeated her charges on 
Robertson's "700 Club" television program. 
</P>
<P>
 And in April, the two Arkansas state troopers whose accusations of sexual 
misconduct by Clinton formed the basis for articles in The Times and the 
American Spectator magazine were the featured breakfast guests at the annual 
convention of the California Republican Assembly, the state's largest 
grass-roots conservative group. The delegates passed breadbaskets from their 
tables around the hall to collect donations for the troopers while leaders of 
the assembly gathered on the stage at the front of the room, placed their hands 
on the troopers' heads and prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's culture, accusations quickly spread beyond committed activists, 
particularly because of the now-ubiquitous medium of talk radio, with its 
insatiable demand for entertainingly bizarre tales. And they keep alive the 
sort of political passions that usually calm after an election year. "The 
constant barrage of negatives has kept the electorate more polarized," says 
Democratic pollster Lake. "It's like red meat." Pervasive Allegations 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols, for example, conducted about 150 radio interviews during March, April 
and May -- more than one a day -- according to Jan Carroll, a publicist at 
Citizens for Honest Government. 
</P>
<P>
 Some indirect evidence of the reach of the anti-Clinton allegations can be 
gleaned from opinion polls and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, when the Times Mirror Center for the People & the Press asked in a 
poll whether Americans recognized the name Vincent Foster, only 22% did so 
correctly. But among the 15% of the population who reported that they regularly 
listen to talk radio, 49% knew who he was. 
</P>
<P>
 Several voters interviewed for this story also volunteered that they had heard 
the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Pierce, a 46-year-old private investigator from Pittsburgh said he had 
"heard a lot" of dramatic allegations against Clinton on the talk shows he 
listens to on his car radio. And he added a comment that would be music to the 
ears of propagandists the world around: "When you heard one or two allegations, 
you can dismiss them. But when you've got 40 or 50, you start thinking, well, 
maybe one or two are true." 
</P>
<P>
 And Wotring said: "I just feel he was involved in all of that." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, she asks, "who would want to pin something on the President of the 
United States" if it weren't true?

ROAD PROJECTS TAKE BACK SEAT TO SEISMIC WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Millions of dollars in road projects designed to ease congestion on Los 
Angeles' clogged freeways face lengthy delays because of a severe financial 
crisis in the state's transportation program. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail projects critical to getting residents out of their cars may also be 
vulnerable as state officials attempt to make good on their promise to give 
highway earthquake safety first priority for scarce transportation dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 For Los Angeles County the crisis means that everything from the long-awaited 
extension of the Foothill Freeway in the San Gabriel Valley to the completion 
of a system of high-occupancy-vehicle lanes along the San Diego Freeway may be 
put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Even mass transit projects such as the extension of the Blue Line to Pasadena 
and the planned east-west San Fernando Valley rail line could be postponed as 
officials try to squeeze enough funds out of road and rail projects to pay for 
strengthening of highway bridges susceptible to damage in severe earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The official estimate is that the projects will be delayed at least a year, 
but other transportation experts predict that it could be much longer, as the 
state continues to identify more bridges in need of earthquake retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The revenue crisis is "going to ricochet back and forth, up and down the 
state," said California Transportation Commission Chairwoman Octavia Diener. "A 
lot of projects are going to be stretched out and take a lot longer to build, 
and it already takes too long to build these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials will use the summer months to formally pick and 
choose among the projects and identify which will be postponed to free up funds 
for retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as congestion-easing projects are being delayed, Los Angeles 
residents should not lose sight of what they are getting in return -- the peace 
of mind that highway bridges will not collapse in a major temblor, Assembly 
Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is at much greater risk because of a lack of seismic retrofit 
than the expansion of road projects," he said. "Having to make the choice, I 
think seismic retrofit is much more important than new roads. We ought to make 
the roads that we have safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The funding tug of war between roads and earthquake retrofitting was 
precipitated by the rejection of Proposition 1A in the June primary. The 
defeated bond measure earmarked $1 billion for seismic strengthening of 
bridges. As a result of its rejection, all bridge retrofitting costs will have 
to be absorbed by the transportation program, which is already facing funding 
shortages because of a slump in gasoline tax revenues and voter rejection of an 
earlier rail bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, last January, even before the Northridge earthquake made seismic 
retrofitting a high-profile issue, Caltrans Director James van Loben Sels 
confided to a legislative workshop that insufficient revenues would send the 
state's transportation program "off the cliff" in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the June 7 defeat of Proposition 1A . . . the voters shoved the 
program over the precipice and into a free fall about six months sooner than 
expected," Arthur Bauer, executive director of Californians for Better 
Transportation, wrote his members in the group's latest newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, state transportation officials determined that the second 
phase of their retrofitting program will involve the strengthening of an 
additional 1,364 overpasses at a cost of $1.05 billion. They have already 
identified 1,039 other bridges that need strengthening in the first phase of 
the program, which is funded. 
</P>
<P>
 The vulnerable projects will be those, like the Foothill Freeway extension and 
the widening of a 35.9-mile stretch of the Antelope Valley Freeway, that are 
not scheduled for construction until after 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail projects are less threatened because, in most cases, they do not have to 
share scarce gasoline tax dollars with the seismic program; much of their 
financing is from bond issues or specially earmarked federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch there is that a $1-billion rail bond scheduled to go on the ballot 
in November is considered to have little chance of passing, given the fiscally 
conservative mood of the voters. Some officials, including Katz, are pushing to 
keep the measure off the ballot rather than face what they predict is certain 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Without that bond issue, the state's transportation funding shortage would 
climb to about $3 billion, and financing would become less certain for projects 
such as the Pasadena light rail line and the San Fernando Valley's east-west 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't have a bond issue or some other way to fund those (rail) 
projects, they could be impacted (by the crisis)," said Linda Bohlinger, the 
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's deputy executive 
officer for capital planning. She said one hopeful sign that these projects may 
have a better chance of keeping on track than the road projects is that both 
Katz and Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), chairman of the state Senate 
Transportation Committee, are urging the Wilson Administration not to delay any 
mass transit projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rationale for leaving rail out of the freeze is that rail is the one 
thing that worked well both in the Loma Prieta and the Northridge earthquakes," 
said Katz. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials acknowledge that road projects are the ones most likely to 
be postponed, but they do not yet know how many. What they do know is that 
delays are likely to affect most large projects scheduled for the latter half 
of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "At all those (places) where Angelenos spend hours in congestion, they're 
going to have to grin and bear it, because in all likelihood the state's not 
going to have the resources to go ahead and push those projects through on a 
timely schedule," said Jim Drago, Caltrans press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 He said an exception will be made for highway safety projects that, like 
seismic projects, will get top priority for funding. But he said these are 
usually small, low-cost jobs that involve minor construction to straighten out 
a dangerous curve or install a stoplight at a busy intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Drago said one of the knotty decisions facing officials will be what to do 
with mammoth projects that are being done in stages over many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of the Santa Ana Freeway widening, an ambitious, decade-long 
project that ultimately will double the number of lanes from southern Orange 
County to the Los Angeles County line. About a third of the project is 
completed, another third is under way and the final phase is set to begin soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The final segment calls for the replacement of several bridges. If the project 
is delayed, the bridges would have to be earthquake retrofitted only to be torn 
down in a few years when the project is started up again. "On all these 
projects, we're going to have to weigh what makes the most sense from an 
engineering and financial view," Drago said. Stuck in Traffic 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the Los Angeles County road projects that could face delays because 
of a financial crisis in the state's transportation program: 
</P>
<P>
 * The six-mile extension of the Foothill Freeway from its terminus at Foothill 
Boulevard in La Verne to the San Bernardino County line. The $274-million 
project has been the highest-priority freeway project in Los Angeles County for 
years because it would relieve a critical bottleneck in the fast-growing 
northeast sector of the county. Plans for the extension call for the 
construction of four lanes -- including a car-pool lane -- in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
 * The construction of a San Diego Freeway interchange at Arbor Vitae Street in 
Inglewood, a project first requested by the Los Angeles Department of Airports 
in 1976. The $24-million project would provide access to Los Angeles 
International Airport from the San Diego Freeway as well as the Century 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * The widening of a 35.9-mile stretch of the Antelope Valley Freeway from the 
Golden State Freeway in Santa Clarita to the Avenue P-8 overcrossing in 
Palmdale. The $134-million project, expected to take 10 years to complete, 
would add a car-pool lane in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
 * The addition of car-pool lanes in both directions on a 7.6-mile section of 
the San Diego Freeway from the Orange County line to the Long Beach Freeway in 
Long Beach. The $37-million project is a key element in local plans for a major 
high-occupancy-vehicle system designed to relieve congestion on Los Angeles 
County freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 * The widening and rehabilitation of Baseline Road in the northeast part of 
the county, making it a continuous four-lane highway from Foothill Boulevard in 
La Verne to the San Bernardino County line. Costing $11 million, the 5.3-mile 
project is to be completed in four segments.

CALTRANS TO OPERATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS TEST CENTER; COMPUTERS: THOUSAND OAKS 
FACILITY WILL BE DESIGNED TO TEACH RESIDENTS HOW TO FIND SERVICES WITH 
KEYSTROKES INSTEAD OF CAR KEYS. IT IS TO OPEN EARLY NEXT YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This city soon will boast the state's first telecommunications test center, a 
research facility that will show residents high-tech ways to consult doctors, 
question teachers or train employees simply by tapping a few computer 
keystrokes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pilot project administered by Caltrans, the federal government will put 
up $1.2 million for an Advanced Telecommunication Center designed to evaluate 
the practical applications of emerging technology. 
</P>
<P>
 By stacking the center with dozens of cutting-edge programs, Caltrans 
officials hope to teach residents how to transact daily business through 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Caltrans wants to persuade residents to go on-line rather than on 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to study how to use telecommunications as a means of avoiding a 
trip," program coordinator Margaret Moilov said, "how to bring services to you 
instead of having you drive to the services." 
</P>
<P>
 The technology on display, for example, could show teen-agers how to view the 
hottest fashions by tapping into a computer video hooked up at a mall. Families 
might be able to organize virtual-reality reunions with faraway relatives. And 
accountants might be able to check their clients' books through video 
conferencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks leaders admit they don't quite understand the newfangled 
technology. But they see the Advanced Telecommunications Center as a speedy 
on-ramp to the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will contribute $14,000 to the telecommunications center, plus space 
at the Civic Arts Plaza now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Slated to open early next year, the Advanced Telecommunications Center will 
feature several components. Most will be set up in the Civic Arts Plaza, but 
officials also envision mobile units that will travel to classrooms, businesses 
and homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A teleconference room allowing business people to hold cross-country or even 
overseas meetings through video screens, providing that the partners have 
compatible software. 
</P>
<P>
 * A mobility-management program offering up-to-the-minute information, in both 
English and Spanish, on traffic, road conditions and public-transit options. 
</P>
<P>
 * A job training center allowing employers to instruct workers at various 
sites through a single video program. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials will monitor each program, hoping to pinpoint the most 
popular technologies. By the end of the two-year pilot project, they should be 
able to advise cities throughout California on which systems nudge the most 
commuters out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 As they gear up for the Thousand Oaks center, officials said they have not yet 
determined whether to charge residents for using the technology. 
</P>
<P>
 But they emphasize that they hope to make the programs available to everyone. 
Indeed, plans call for setting up community test sites to evaluate how 
youngsters, disabled residents, health care providers and others respond to the 
new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a few months of market research, Caltrans officials expressed 
confidence that Thousand Oaks residents will clamor to join the test groups.

TROUBLE NEVER STAYED AWAY LONG IN LIFE OF ACCUSED KILLER; CRIME: THE CASE OF 
EDWARD MORGAN -- CONVICTED THREE TIMES OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS -- HAS RAISED 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF SERIAL ASSAILANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When fellow students taunted him about being in special education, or 
cross-town sports rivals jeered, or family squabbles turned ugly, the anger in 
young Eddie Morgan would build like the steam in a pressure cooker. 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, Morgan would explode, his placid, boyish features 
twisting in rage, his fists, fired by a bodybuilder's bulk, thudding in an 
almost cathartic frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 As abruptly as it started, the storm of violence would end. In its wake, there 
would be a jagged hole in his bedroom wall or a battered teen-ager's face or, 
later, young girls bloodied and assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 And there would be Morgan, charming and repentant, suddenly worried about the 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could see it in him," said Brian Hoyt, Morgan's high school special 
education teacher. "He'd try to get out of it. A tear would come to his eye and 
he'd say, 'I'm sorry. I'll never do it again.' Then, of course, he would." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Edward Patrick Morgan, 28, sits in an isolation cell in Orange County 
Jail, charged with savagely beating to death a 23-year-old Huntington Beach 
woman outside an Orange nightclub and ripping apart her insides with an object 
police have yet to find. His case has raised questions about the criminal 
justice system's treatment of serial rapists and angered some who say Morgan 
never should have been free to claim another victim. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past decade, Morgan was accused four times of sexual assault. Three 
times he was convicted, but his brief prison stays -- never more than two years 
-- did little to change his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's is not a new story -- his troubled future was foreshadowed in his 
high school years. He was the shy one with the easy smile. Towheaded, 
California handsome. Athletic. 
</P>
<P>
 But "little Eddie" Morgan had a tripwire. Now his teen-age bursts of violence 
seem prophetic, signals of a growing frustration that friends and neighbors say 
was born at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviews with dozens of Morgan's high school classmates, current friends, 
former teachers, coaches, neighbors and victims, as well as court documents and 
parole and police reports, detail a pattern of behavior that seemed to escalate 
unchecked by any friend or authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have a substantial way to break that pattern, it'll just keep 
happening, and it doesn't get any better," said Mike Wellins, a licensed 
therapist and crisis intervention counselor who worked up a psychological 
profile of the Huntington Beach woman's killer for the Orange Police Department 
before Morgan was arrested. "That behavior doesn't just magically go away." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the thick plexiglass of a jail visitor's booth, Morgan said he wasn't 
"some mean basher that ripped some girl apart with my bare hands." 
</P>
<P>
 While he did not deny the first two sexual assaults that sent him to prison, 
he insisted that the accusations of the second two were unfounded. And he said 
he would not blame his troubles on his home life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the most wonderful, caring parents anyone could have," he said, 
cradling the jail phone between tightly handcuffed wrists. "Everyone's trying 
to blame my parents for everything, and it's not true. I've had good times and 
bad times like anyone else. Most parents would have given up on their kid a 
long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan did not dispute his high school friends' accounts of almost daily 
violence at the Morgans' spacious, two-story Madia Circle home in La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 "No comment," he said when asked about it. His father denies it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not true," his father said. "Talk to Ed. He's trying to set the record 
straight." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's friends, a tightknit group known as the Bellhaven Boys after the 
street where many of them lived, recalled how they would often head to Morgan's 
house after school for an afternoon of lifting weights or hanging out by the 
back-yard pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, friends said, confrontations, often physical, would occur between 
Morgan and his parents, most often with his mother -- something that both 
Morgan and his parents deny. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Weatherill, a close friend who has known Morgan since junior high school, 
said he never knew what a visit to the Morgan household would be like. "It was 
like you were always walking on eggshells." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the heated exchanges, and the violence that Morgan showed with others, 
"he never raised a hand toward his mother or father," said Chris, a close 
friend who has known Morgan since eighth grade and spoke on the condition that 
his last name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Morgan's pent-up fury, Chris said, "I think he saved it for everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Libby McElmurry recalls hearing his mother's shouts ring out among 
the well-kept homes in the cul-de-sac, then the roar of Eddie Morgan's car 
speeding off. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morgan never complained to his friends. "It was like family business and 
that's it. In that house you never talked about anything that happened in the 
family," Weatherill recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's parents, Diana, 49, and Edward Sr., 53, a retired Hoover vacuum 
executive, now live in the Cleveland suburb of Strongsville, Ohio, and have 
declined to talk in detail about their son. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I want to do is to express my sorrow for the family of the girl," said 
Edward Morgan Sr. "I hope my son didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's family arrived in La Palma in 1977. A native of Cleveland, Morgan's 
father had moved the family to Maryland when Morgan was 2, to Georgia when he 
was 8 and to California when he was about 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan remembered that it was tough, bouncing around the country. "You meet 
friends. You get close to people and then you had to leave and go to another 
school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before junior high school, Morgan was obsessed with pumping up the 
muscles on his now 5-foot-8-inch, 200-pound frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just something I liked to do," said Morgan, lamenting that he had lost 
3 inches from his 21-inch biceps during his first few weeks in jail. For a 
while, he said, he dreamed of being a professional bodybuilder, but never liked 
the look of muscular legs. 
</P>
<P>
 During his sophomore year at John F. Kennedy High School, he joined the 
wrestling team, achieving a small degree of success, said his coach, George 
Peterman. 
</P>
<P>
 On campus, the muscular Morgan was known for having a hair trigger. Often shy, 
Morgan says that he seldom initiated the violence. But if provoked, his friends 
said, he joined in with a fury and mindlessness that frightened more than one 
in his circle. 
</P>
<P>
 After one senseless fistfight with a stranger, Morgan told a friend that he 
"felt better afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 "Alcohol provoked him," remembered Brian Folsom, Morgan's best high school 
chum. "He'd yell (at police officers), 'Take off your guns. Take off your 
badges, and I'll whup your butts.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Morgan was sensitive about landing in special education courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got special attention and we got special tutors," Morgan said. "Then again 
there's other times you wish you were in a normal class with normal friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, a C-minus student, was placed in special education because of 
difficulties that he had with math and written language, said Hoyt, who taught 
Morgan and headed the special education department his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why he became a tough guy, so people couldn't make fun of him," Folsom 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For about nine months in his senior year, everything seemed fine. Morgan, 
handsome with wavy, light brown hair, had a girlfriend, a pretty blonde 
cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
 Then after a football game on Oct. 15, 1983 -- after the relationship had 
ended -- Morgan appeared at his ex-girlfriend's window asking to come inside. 
According to court records, the girl said no. A short while later, a man in a 
ski mask burst into her home and dragged her outside, splitting her lip with a 
punch and raping her. 
</P>
<P>
 After the girl returned to the house, Morgan came running back to the 
residence wearing different clothes, saying he had seen a suspicious car drive 
away, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan called Weatherill from the girl's house. "Someone raped (the girl) and 
they think it was me," he said. But the girl, uncertain that it was Morgan, did 
not press charges at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, the Bellhaven Boys began to scatter. Many said they 
distanced themselves from Morgan, suspecting that he really had raped his 
ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan fell in with another crowd and saw little of his old cronies until a 
party in Buena Park brought them together Oct. 21, 1984, about a year and a 
half after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Just past midnight, he persuaded a 16-year-old girl to take a walk with him, 
steering her to the darkness between two houses. When the girl objected, Morgan 
dragged her there, court records show. When she continued to struggle, Morgan 
yanked off her pants and slammed her head and face against the pavement while 
he raped her, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, now 26, remembers that Morgan "seemed like a very nice man. He 
turned almost into another person within seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest, Morgan's ex-girlfriend came forward. Convicted of both sex 
crimes, Morgan went to prison on Jan. 16, 1985. While in prison, he married 
Jacqueline Helleis, a woman he had met at a party in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 When Morgan was paroled 21 months later, the couple moved to New York, where 
his family had relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple moved back to Huntington Beach, and for a short time everything 
seemed stable. But in October, 1990, just days after Helleis filed for divorce, 
another 16-year-old accused Morgan of rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors charged Morgan with two counts of rape, but dropped 
the more serious charge of violent rape, which could have gotten him 10 years 
in prison, after Morgan agreed to plead guilty to the lesser charge of sex with 
a minor. He was sentenced to the minimum term of 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
 When he got out, Morgan said, he headed back to serve his parole near his 
family in the Cleveland area. He got a job, a new Toyota MR2 and a new 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a good life," Morgan recalled. Then Ohio, which had allowed him to stay 
on 30-day passes, denied him additional stays. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his girlfriend, Lisa, moved back to Fullerton where he started a job as 
an apartment complex handyman and moved up to superintendent for another 
complex. The couple had a baby named Ashley. 
</P>
<P>
 But once again, Morgan's rage apparently overtook him. A fourth woman reported 
to Huntington Beach police that Morgan had raped her. Prosecutors, citing 
inconsistencies in the woman's statements to police, declined to press charges 
again him, allowing the parole board to revoke his parole and send him back to 
prison for 12 months. If convicted of a fourth rape, Morgan could have received 
a sentence of 12 years. Lisa took the baby and returned to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said the second two women who accused him of rape "are loony tunes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what's wrong with these girls," Morgan said. "It was consensual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any girl can cry rape," he said. "If they don't like you they could claim 
it." But the girl's testimony convinced the parole board to return him to 
prison for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 23, Morgan was released from a California prison for the third time 
in a decade. He had a new girlfriend, Sonya Marvin, the sister of his 
cellmate's fiance. "We were going to get married," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 But less than two months later, Morgan was on the run again. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, police say, he took a life. On May 20, they say, Morgan 
sweet-talked Leanora Annette Wong, 23, into a parking lot across the street 
from the Australian Beach Club in Orange, and then killed and mutilated her. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of an Ontario woman whom he had known less than a week, Morgan 
fled to Marvin's home in Quincy, a small town in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Chased down by Plumas County sheriff's deputies, Morgan screamed: "Shoot me! 
Shoot me! I didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Explains Morgan: "I just knew . . . I was going to have to come back here and 
face a murder trial. I didn't want to hassle with it."

MASTER MAKER OF VIOLINS IS A PIED PIPER TO STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On one side of the room, Julie Katana, with two sets of eyeglasses perched on 
her nose, bends over the top half of a viola, planing the surface into sheer 
smoothness with tiny, meticulous strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other, Harold Hirsch brushes hot glue on the maple frame of a cello, 
while Jim Viele sits patiently next to two slabs of pale wood just beginning to 
resemble parts of a violin, waiting for directions on what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 These three are among a class of 10 students learning a rare skill: the 
centuries-old art of violin making in the Italian tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 They came to California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks from such 
far-flung places as Brazil and Hawaii to study with Karl Roy, a master violin 
maker from Germany who has been building stringed instruments for more than 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Building just one instrument under the tutelage of Roy can take as long as 
three years, but the students are eager to learn from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the very best in the world," said Katana, a secretary from 
Stockton who began studying with Roy in 1991. "He holds nothing back." 
</P>
<P>
 His students range from professionals such as Brazilian Rafael Sando, who can 
turn out an entire violin in about two weeks, to novices such as Mike Krawtz, 
who is in his fourth year of classes with Roy and is nowhere near finishing his 
first violin. 
</P>
<P>
 In a classroom that has been converted into a workshop, a band saw stands near 
a window and tools needed to create the curves and edges of a fine violin are 
littered around the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this class really is is how to use tools," said Katana. "That we end up 
with a violin in the end is almost incidental." 
</P>
<P>
 She watched Roy as he tapped on the edges of a violin frame to see if they 
were even. He cocked his head and listened for the slightly off sound 
indicating something was not quite right. Hearing it, he pointed it out to 
student Charles Pracha and began to smooth the edges with a plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes it look so easy," Katana said enviously. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever Roy goes in the classroom he draws a crowd. When he shows Viele how 
to gouge out the top piece of his violin and form its gentle arching shape, all 
the students come over to observe, even though all have already passed that 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe the training of a violin master still follows the course it has for 
centuries. After three years of basic training at a school such as the Bavarian 
State School of Violin Making, where Roy used to teach, young craftspeople are 
sent out for a five-year apprenticeship. After that, they take an exam. Those 
who pass become masters. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the United States, no such programs exist. The closest things are the 
training sessions at Cal Lutheran and a similar program at the University of 
New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
 Viele started building violins in his San Diego garage several years ago. He 
made five, he said, using such untraditional materials as plywood and lumber 
scraps, things Roy wouldn't allow in his classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Viele is proud of his garage creations, pulling a Polaroid 
photograph from a pocket and handing it around as if it were a picture of his 
firstborn. 
</P>
<P>
 He checked out several library books on violin construction before enrolling 
in Roy's class. The idea of how-to books brought a grimace of disgust to the 
teacher's face. 
</P>
<P>
 "This art has never been written down or published," Roy said. "You have to 
study it on the bench. That is the only way it can be taught." 
</P>
<P>
 That said, he darts around the room, checking on the progress of his students, 
complaining about the quality of the makeshift equipment at Cal Lutheran and 
maintaining a firm but friendly teaching relationship with his admiring 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the students welcome any encouraging word from the master, the class 
is not a competitive one. Because it is open to professionals and amateurs, 
people such as Krawtz are perfectly welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Krawtz, who is from the island of Maui in Hawaii, has traveled to New 
Hampshire three times and Cal Lutheran once. He is far behind students such as 
Sando, still concentrating hard on gouging out the inside of the instrument's 
top half. 
</P>
<P>
 For him, the work itself is pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really plan to finish at the rate I'm going," he said. "But if I do, 
I think I'll hang it on the wall and just look at it."

 A strong earthquake rocked southern areas, killing at least two people, 
authorities said.The U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information 
Center in Golden, Colo., estimated the magnitude of the quake at 6.0. The quake 
was centered about 325 miles southeast of Mexico City, off the Pacific coast of 
Oaxaca state, the center said. It was felt strongly in the state capital of 
Oaxaca, a colonial town popular with tourists. Two masons were killed when the 
quake brought down a wall they were working on in the city center.

MIFFED GAZANS PROMPT ARAFAT TO EASE TIGHT SECURITY; MIDEAST: EVEN PLO CHIEF 
APPEARS DISMAYED BY MASSIVE SHOW OF FORCE. HE HEADS FOR JERICHO TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a windy graveyard that is said to house the tomb of Yasser Arafat's father, 
a thin young man called Ahmed waited for hours for the Palestine Liberation 
Organization chairman's motorcade to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 He had earlier tried to catch a glimpse of Arafat in Gaza City's crowded main 
square, to little avail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can only see him from far away," he said with a shrug. "It's not people 
like us who get close. The security, the police, always stop us. He has so much 
security." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for a great many Gazans, Arafat's whirlwind tour through his homeland 
has been little more than a flash of a black-and-white kaffiyeh and the arm of 
a green combat uniform, glimpsed though a wall of Kalashnikov rifles, burly 
bodyguards and roaring military trucks full of soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaza, sullen from 27 years of Israeli military occupation, has not taken well 
to the sight of its returned leader buried in a military convoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of the army, the massive amount of police in the streets, this has 
to be changed. Because people psychologically hate the army," a prominent Gaza 
businessman said. "And our army, they've been thrown all over the world and now 
they're happy to be here. They make a big show of themselves, and that's 
provocative for the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Arafat appears to have been dismayed by the massive security entourage 
that greeted his arrival: Before his departure for the West Bank town of 
Jericho, the seat of government for the Palestinians' self-rule authority, he 
ordered a major reduction in the uniformed military presence around him. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat travels to Jericho today to swear in the new Palestinian Authority. 
After that, he will fly to Paris for a summit with Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin, then return to the self-rule areas -- for good -- on Saturday, 
his aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jericho stop will be the toughest test yet of a new security cooperation 
pact between Israel and the PLO. Arafat, whose arrival in the Gaza Strip on 
Friday ended a 27-year exile, will fly to Jericho by helicopter under the 
escort of two Israeli military helicopters. The Israeli army set up roadblocks 
Monday to keep away Jewish settlers who threatened to disrupt the visit, which 
is expected to draw tens of thousands of people to the sleepy oasis town. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, Arafat gathered his own military and police chiefs and 
informed them that the major duties for presidential security would immediately 
be transferred to the plainclothes preventive security detail. 
</P>
<P>
 "This came together with an instruction that says we will minimize to the 
maximum the number of vehicles and guards that travel with the president," a 
senior security official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a point of view of the street that was conveyed to the president -- 
that there is no need to exaggerate the security precautions -- and also 
Arafat's personal assessment that he doesn't need that much here in his 
homeland." 
</P>
<P>
 The new security orders represent a dramatic shift in the approach toward 
Arafat's visit to turbulent Gaza, a center of Islamic fundamentalist opposition 
to the peace agreement he signed with Israel and the home of 4,000 Jewish 
settlers, most of them also opposed to the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arafat, apparently cheered by the enthusiastic reception he got from 
throngs lining Gaza's streets, recalled Nelson Mandela's example in South 
Africa and insisted on mixing it up with the masses, his aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the first day, the security men were worried," Arafat said in a meeting 
with a small group of reporters Monday. "I told them, I refuse what you are 
doing. I gave strict orders to stop all this. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I am not afraid of my people," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In his subsequent motorcades, Arafat has toured the streets in an open car, 
waving to the crowds and clutching hands as he passed by. 
</P>
<P>
 The public has been captivated and curious. "I was surprised how old and tired 
he looked," said Mohammed Sultan, a 35-year-old construction worker in 
Jabaliya. "He is also quite small. I have spent my life convinced that he is a 
tall, strong and energetic person." 
</P>
<P>
 Many rejected any idea that the PLO chairman might be risking his life by 
traveling through his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Palestinian people didn't want Yasser Arafat, he would have been shot 
as he crossed in at Rafah," one laborer said. "Actually, we would have shot him 
in Lebanon. But we wanted him, and it is we who protected him going through 
Jabaliya." 
</P>
<P>
 Some police officials expressed skepticism about the wisdom of reducing 
security around the PLO leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every president in the world is protected. Why shouldn't ours be?" said one. 
"You can't forget that he is the person who built the revolution, and he went 
on building until we got a state. And you don't want us to protect him?" 
</P>
<P>
 Security officials see relatively little threat to Arafat from his crowds of 
supporters. In any case, they said, the actual number of guards protecting 
Arafat will not be reduced by much. 
</P>
<P>
 "In reality there is no difference between an officer who is in uniform and 
one who is not," one official said. "However, our people at large feel more 
comfortable with people who are not wearing uniforms. It is not the time for 
intimidation."

67 BOATS INTERCEPTED; ANOTHER SINKS

<P>
 The U.S. Coast Guard intercepted 2,628 Haitian refugees heading toward U.S. 
shores in 67 boats Monday, the most ever in a single day. 
</P>
<P>
 Another boat, packed with at least 200 refugees, capsized off the west coast 
early Monday, and two survivors said dozens drowned.The toll could reach 150, 
the survivors and townspeople said, but an accurate death count could not be 
determined by late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. refugee-processing facilities off Jamaica and at the U.S. naval base in 
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are already strained just two weeks after a more liberal 
program toward the refugees went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Panama said Monday that it is planning to house up to 10,000 Haitians. But 
that would accommodate only a few days of refugees if the exodus continues at 
its current pace.

 When the last Apollo astronaut's memory has blurred, the only real evidence of 
humanity's first venture to another world will be a cache of gray rocks in a 
guarded vault that proves Earth and the moon, however distant, are one. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years after the Apollo 11 astronauts returned to Earth with the 
first bag of moon rocks, 65 scientists around the world still are using NASA's 
unique collection of lunar samples to analyze the history of Earth's nearest 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarer than diamonds, as closely guarded as bank bullion, the nondescript 
chunks of breccia, feldspar and basalt plucked from the surface of the moon 
have helped open a window into the earliest moments of the solar system, 
answering some of the most fundamental puzzles about the moon and its origin. 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, it was almost comical how ignorant people were about the 
moon," said James L. Gooding, curator of the lunar sample laboratory at NASA's 
Johnson Space Center in Houston, where the moon rocks are stored. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were lots of theories, lots of ideas and a complete lack of 
information. What the samples have taught us so far is the skeleton of lunar 
history," Gooding said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of gaps. Twenty-five years later, people are still asking for 
details." 
</P>
<P>
 To satisfy the demand, lab technician Linda Watts is still slicing moon rocks. 
She has worked in the lab 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 At a measured pace that makes a diamond cutter seem precipitous, Watts takes 
six months to prepare the samples from a single pristine core of moon rock. 
Three times a year, a committee doles out the samples. 
</P>
<P>
 One day soon, however, she will have worked herself out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Apollo astronauts brought back 54 core samples from the lunar surface. Now 
only four are unopened and uncontaminated. Five years ago, there were eight. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the 12 Apollo astronauts who walked on the moon from 1969 to 1973 
collected 842 pounds of lunar rocks, pebbles and dust from six spots on the 
moon. With no plans to return to the moon, there is no chance that anyone will 
prospect for more soon. The only other known lunar rocks are a few meteorites 
found on the Antarctic ice sheet in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the science community realized that this was the world's fixed, limited 
supply of lunar samples, they became pretty concerned about their safety," 
Gooding said. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA takes extraordinary care to keep its rocks unsullied by Earth's 
atmosphere or bacteria. Each sample is stored inside a double thickness of 
Teflon and then bolted inside a sealed stainless steel container flooded with 
nitrogen gas. The containers are isolated by an air lock and a 14-ton vault 
door with two separate combination locks. The vault is monitored by security 
guards, motion sensors and video cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also follows an elaborate accounting procedure to ensure none are 
lost or stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their inherent scientific value, the moon rocks also are souvenirs of 
a $25-billion space race with the Soviet Union, in which U.S. astronauts won by 
simply touching the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there is a piece of the moon in almost every state and nearly every one 
of the world's nations, most distributed as diplomatic largess in the Richard 
Nixon-era "spirit of Apollo." 
</P>
<P>
 There is even a piece of the moon in Pasadena -- on display at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 After decades of investigation, the moon samples convey a complex saga to 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 The chemistry of the rocks suggests the moon formed from the same material as 
the planet it orbits, providing key evidence for the theory that the moon was 
formed out of the molten splash caused when some object collided with Earth 4.5 
billion years ago -- the approximate age of the oldest moon rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The rocks show that the moon has never known life, has no water, and no 
sedimentary layering. All of the rocks examined were produced by extreme heat 
and melting caused by volcanic eruptions or by intense meteor bombardment. 
</P>
<P>
 The rocks also revealed the one thing scientists had not expected -- traces of 
a planetary magnetic field like Earth's. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly self-conscious about the dwindling store of pristine moon 
samples, lunar scientists are quick to take advantage of advances in 
electron-beam probes and other techniques that allow them to look for trace 
elements, isotopes and other characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1970, to do that kind of analysis, you would have needed a chunk of rock 
big enough to hold in your hand," Gooding said. "In 25 years, the technology 
has advanced to the point you can do the same thing with a tiny grain of 
material."

TECHNOLOGY; ALASKANS TO USE SLED ON INFORMATION HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alaska is so vast and parts of it are so isolated that many residents spend 
most of their lives cut off from the rest of the world. But the state has taken 
extraordinary measures to bring the world to their doorsteps via an on-line 
communication network that is free to every Alaskan with a computer and a 
modem. 
</P>
<P>
 In time, every public library in Alaska will have a computer to serve the 
needs of those who do not own one, thus making the largest state in the Union a 
bit smaller through modern technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Computers are already in surprisingly wide use in the state. Nearly every desk 
in the high school of the oil-rich, isolated community of Barrow has a computer 
on it, making classrooms look more like research centers. It is on that 
tradition that state information specialists hope to build. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the network offers primarily library and government reference 
materials, but it is expected to grow as more services are offered. 
</P>
<P>
 The network, called the Statewide Library Electronic Doorway, or SLED, ties in 
to the Internet, that great cloud of information networks that spans the globe. 
It grew largely out of recognition by state librarians that if they fail to 
keep up with advances in the Information Age, they may be left out in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 "If libraries don't get into this, other people will step in and do it," said 
Steve Smith of the Rasmuson Library at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, 
one of the creators of the network. Smith and others did not want to see their 
primary function -- providing information -- pass into the hands of commercial 
computer networks, leaving librarians as custodians of book warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We expect it to grow quite a bit" as more government agencies and 
private corporations join the network. 
</P>
<P>
 The network is similar to programs now being developed for California that 
will allow residents to tap into medical research and check the status of bills 
in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 But it could be particularly important for Alaskans who feel cut off from the 
outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, we are going to really start giving access (to 
information) to some of the rural areas," said Karen Crane, director of the 
Alaska State Library system. She said she also expects the network to help 
rural Alaskans have more of an impact on the state decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
 That latter goal is critical, because most of the vast resources that Alaska 
hopes to exploit in the coming decades are in isolated parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope early input from rural Alaskans could help head off the kind of 
standoff that nearly blocked the Alaska pipeline. It took the Alaska Native 
Land Claims Settlement Act to clear the way for construction of the pipeline, 
but that same law also vested millions of acres of Alaskan land in native-owned 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Alaska's richest natural resources are in land owned by native 
corporations. State officials see better communication as a step toward 
developing those resources. 
</P>
<P>
 And since the new network is also tied into the Internet, it will be easier 
for people outside the state to keep tabs on developments, ranging from bills 
in the state Legislature to plans to open areas for development. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was developed jointly by the University of Alaska in Fairbanks and 
the Alaska State Library, and it is paid for by various state agencies that 
want to either disseminate or collect information.

HOT DOGS, PEPSI AND BUD MARK 4TH IN SARAJEVO AS U.S. OPENS EMBASSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diet Pepsi and Bud, grilled hot dogs and napkins emblazoned with the Statue of 
Liberty and the U.S. flag. A band playing "The Star-Spangled Banner." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States brought a bit of itself to Sarajevo on Monday, celebrating 
Independence Day with the festive opening of an embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while American patriotism and idealism were on full display, fighting 
persisted in Bosnia and international mediators were gearing up for meetings 
that could determine whether there is peace or more war. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the U.S. Embassy, a three-story house newly coated with white 
paint and surrounded by a large neatly trimmed lawn, was a sign of U.S. 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 A cease-fire has largely held around Sarajevo since Serbs were forced to 
withdraw most of their heavy weapons in February or face North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's government long has looked to the United States as its principal 
backer in its battle with Serbian rebels, and U.S. Ambassador Victor Jackovich 
reiterated Washington's backing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are thoroughly committed to assisting you to achieve the twin goals of 
peace and democracy, so you may get on with the important task of rebuilding 
your country," Jackovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city that only Sunday marked the second anniversary of a humanitarian 
airlift that kept it alive, about 700 military officials, doctors, cultural 
figures, politicians and prominent Sarajevans enjoyed a traditional Fourth of 
July picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 American idealism was on display. Jim Benazani, a volunteer firefighter from 
Fairfax County, Va., who gave up his summer holiday to help out in Sarajevo, 
was flipping burgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like doing this," he said. "If I didn't, I'd be home doing this with my 
family. But I'm here now showing the people of Bosnia a piece of the Fourth of 
July." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's Muslim president, Alija Izetbegovic, found hope in the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, it is a clear message of encouragement," he said. "And for those who 
are on the other side of the barricade this is a warning that fascism has no 
future, and cannot succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 But war still rages in Bosnia. Serbs still control about 70% of the republic 
and Izetbegovic's government is still fighting to try to take pieces of it 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officials from the United States, Russia, and European powers met 
Monday in Geneva to put the finishing touches on a new proposal to give a 
Muslim-Croatian federation 51% of Bosnia and Serbs 49%. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan must be approved by a meeting today of foreign ministers, presented 
to the warring parties and then submitted to the Naples, Italy, summit of the 
top seven industrialized powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbs have complained that the division of territory is unfair. So did a 
senior Bosnian army commander at the picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If America stands behind that 51-49 division of Bosnia-Herzegovina, then it 
is not expressing democracy," said Gen. Jovan Divjak, an ethnic Serb. 
"Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be divided by percentages."

RUSSIAN POLICE BACK PLAN FOR JOINT ANTI-MOB EFFORT; LAW ENFORCEMENT: FBI CHIEF 
WINDS UP TRIP THROUGH FORMER SOVIET BLOC. HE CITES NUCLEAR PIRACY FEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warning that organized crime in Russia poses "a significant and direct threat 
to the United States," FBI Director Louis J. Freeh won support from Russian 
police Monday for a joint crackdown on mobsters, including anyone trying to 
pirate and sell nuclear bomb-making material. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are proud to join in this battle with you," Freeh said in a pep talk to 
500 elite officers at Russia's Interior Ministry Academy. He urged them to act 
decisively, but within the law, to stop Russia's mob from growing as powerful 
as the American Mafia of the 1920s and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-hour address was the keynote of a three-day visit to lay down what 
Freeh called "a police-to-police bridge" between the former Cold War enemies. 
He closed with verse from the late Russian poet Anna Akhmatova: "The hour for 
courage strikes upon our clocks, And courage will not desert us." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh is winding up a 10-day trip -- the first by an FBI chief through the 
former Soviet Bloc -- that netted agreements allowing his agents to gather 
records, interview witnesses and seek criminal evidence in Germany, the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar accord, to be signed here today, will clear the way for systematic 
exchanges between the FBI and Russian police to prevent and solve such crimes 
as drug trafficking, kidnaping, extortion, fraud, money laundering and 
terrorism in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
 To oversee these exchanges, the FBI is setting up a permanent office in Moscow 
and staffing it with two Russian-speaking agents supervised by the U.S. 
ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have now already joined (forces)," Sergei V. Stepashin, chief of the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service, said after meeting Freeh at his office 
inside one of the most dreaded Soviet landmarks -- the former KGB headquarters 
and execution chamber on Moscow's Lubyanka Square. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we are together, we're undefeatable," the Russian spymaster added. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it remains to be seen how much police cooperation there can be between two 
powerful nations that still spy on each other. It was only five months ago that 
the arrest of a high-level Russian "mole" inside the CIA shook up the 
post-Soviet friendship between Washington and Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Freeh's arrival Saturday night, Stepashin dismissed as unwarranted the 
nightmare scenario that prompted the visit in the first place -- that Russian 
nuclear weapons and materials are vulnerable to terrorists and criminal groups 
throughout the old Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 "All attempts to accuse Russia of being unable to control its nuclear weapons 
have clear political goals," Alexander Mikhailov, a spokesman for Stepashin's 
spy agency, said last week. "They are aimed at preparing Western public opinion 
for the idea of establishing political control over Russian nuclear weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and German officials have reported three suspected diversions of 
weapons-grade uranium and plutonium material from Russia since 1993. While the 
quantity of material in each case was thought to be insufficient to produce a 
bomb, Freeh said Monday that the risk of "loose nukes" is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot afford to wait until there is a successful diversion of a 
significant amount of nuclear material before we develop and implement . . . a 
plan of action to address this grave threat," he told the academy officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Andrei V. Tikhanov, a 29-year-old student in the packed auditorium, 
agreed. "Worse come to worst, the consequences wouldn't spare anyone," he said. 
"Mr. Freeh calls for cooperation just in time for us to be able to avert this 
menace." 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from daily news reports, the officers in the audience, who earn an 
average of $150 per month, are fighting a losing battle against rich and 
powerful criminal gangs that have mushroomed since the Soviet police state 
collapsed in 1991 and now number an estimated 5,600. 
</P>
<P>
 While the United States is "an increasingly desirable target of opportunity" 
for such gangs, Freeh said, they pose an even greater danger to their own 
country's democratic hopes. He said Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin was 
right to call the mob Russia's top security threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to show their guest that Yeltsin's latest crackdown on crime is working, 
the police said Monday that they had arrested a gang for allegedly holding an 
8-month-old girl hostage for 32 days and collecting a $270,000 ransom from her 
businessman father by threatening to cut off her head. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate announcement said police had seized members of a neo-Nazi skinhead 
group called Legion of Werewolf, accused of plotting to burn down every Moscow 
theater showing the Oscar-winning film "Schindler's List."

A TROUBLED CLINTON, HIS RATINGS, CURRENCY DOWN, LEAVES TODAY FOR 2ND G-7 
SUMMIT; ECONOMIES: PRESIDENT'S IMAGE AMONG OTHER LEADERS IS NOW MIXED. MANY 
FACING STICKY PROBLEMS AT HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a year ago, an increasingly popular President Clinton was heading for his 
first economic summit in Tokyo, where he showed the world a flattering new side 
of a leader who had been focusing on domestic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 How things change. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Clinton departs for his second economic summit, this one in Naples, 
Italy, starting Friday, with his roller-coaster standing in opinion polls on 
the downward slope and his currency scraping a rocky bottom. Last year's new 
guy in the Group of Seven major industrial nations, to whom the other six 
looked for leadership, is now just one of the gang, struggling with political 
problems at home. 
</P>
<P>
 With his six partners, Clinton's image is mixed. One senior Western diplomat 
whose country will be represented at Naples said Clinton's problem at home and 
abroad is simple: "He hasn't delivered." 
</P>
<P>
 "Admired? Respected? Yes. But there's an impotence" about his presidency, the 
diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 This view of Clinton is not universal. "If you look back at the economic 
agenda, he comes as someone who can deliver," said Henning Christophersen, the 
European Union's commissioner for financial affairs. "The U.S. has 
non-inflationary growth; the U.S. has a much better job-creation record than 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 It is against such an uncertain backdrop that Clinton will meet with the 
leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. During their 
final session Sunday they will be joined by Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 None can claim an overwhelming mandate at home, although Prime Ministers Jean 
Chretien of Canada and Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, newly chosen, have not yet 
been subject to the sniping with which many of the others must deal. "The 
tragedy is, this is not a summit that has any leaders," said Stephan Richter, 
president of TransAtlantic Futures, an economic consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-day overseas trip -- the fifth of his presidency -- will also take 
Clinton to Poland and Latvia before the summit and to Germany after it. In each 
place he will try to offer reassurance that America will maintain its political 
and economic commitments amid a splintered world order. 
</P>
<P>
 The image of the first visit by a U.S. President to Latvia, one of the three 
freedom-seeking Baltic countries that had been part of the Soviet Union since 
World War II, may prove stirring. And Clinton's planned speech against the 
backdrop of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate is likely to be dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the White House is hoping the trip will rack up political points at 
home, the goal may prove more elusive than on the earlier trips. Foreign policy 
is now rated in most polls as Clinton's weak point, trailing his overall 
approval rating by a large margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton's overseas appearances have brought him generally favorable 
publicity, they have done little to budge opinion. He got no more than the 
slightest bounce in the polls from his well-received speech at the June 6 D-day 
commemoration. 
</P>
<P>
 What sets this economic summit apart from the 19 previous annual meetings is 
the unusual economic situation in the leading industrialized democracies. In 
the past, such issues as economic growth, unemployment, inflation and interest 
rates have dominated the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is not the case in 1994. Washington is no longer beating up on Germany to 
reduce interest rates to propel faster economic growth. While the Clinton 
Administration would like Japan to do more to boost its growth rate, the 
outlook there is for the current, rare recession to give way to moderate 
economic growth later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 If U.S. interest rates set by the Federal Reserve are edging upward, they are 
not doing so at a pace that frightens political leaders. Inflation remains 
largely in check. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a bad picture," said Robert D. Hormats, a vice president of the 
investment firm of Goldman, Sachs International and a former Treasury and State 
Department official. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have portrayed the agenda as more of the same. "The 
strategy we put in place last year is working," Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen said: The U.S. budget deficit has been cut, European interest rates are 
falling, and there are signs that the Japanese economy is beginning to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 The four European nations that will be represented at Naples recognize that 
they cannot criticize the U.S. economy at a time when the European unemployment 
rate -- an astonishing 12% -- is about double the U.S. rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can they complain about America's failure to take decisive action to solve 
the civil war in Bosnia or rescue Russia's faltering economy -- issues on which 
Western Europe has fared no better. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't fair to criticize the United States, because the Europeans have been 
even less prepared to deliver than the U.S.," said Christophersen, the EU's 
financial affairs commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, one U.S.-related problem on the informal agenda: the 
beleaguered dollar. Since the beginning of the year it has lost roughly 11% of 
its value in relation to the Japanese yen and has fallen against most European 
currencies as well. 
</P>
<P>
 This development makes U.S. goods cheaper overseas, to the benefit of U.S. 
manufacturers, and adds the equivalent of an 11% tax on Japanese goods sold 
here. But it also makes foreign investment in the United States less attractive 
because, with the dollar falling, it takes an ever-greater return just to stay 
even when earnings are converted into other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's troubles place the G-7 partners in a difficult position. The 
group is limited in the steps it can take to shore up the dollar, short of a 
significant increase in U.S. interest rates that would make investments here 
more attractive but risk stifling growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Europeans, who regard the dollar as weak mostly against the yen and mostly 
as a result of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan, are not particularly eager to 
do anything at Naples. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hormats, the Goldman Sachs executive, said the G-7 leaders cannot duck the 
issue. If they do not deliver a program that looks able to stabilize the 
currency, he said, "the markets will be disappointed and set off a new round of 
volatility." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems with the U.S. currency present a dilemma for Clinton. In the view 
of many experts, the U.S. economy is fundamentally sound; there is no good 
economic reason for the dollar's decline. Rather, it is a general international 
uncertainty about Clinton's leadership, both in economic matters and in foreign 
policy, that is contributing to the dollar's plight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollar is an embarrassment to the President," said Rudiger Dornbusch, an 
economist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Clinton's total lack of 
leadership plays into it very strongly. It's not very often a President comes 
to the summit with his currency in the emergency ward. It reflects very poorly 
on him. If he wanted to project a strong leadership image for the United 
States, who would believe it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Investors see the U.S. economy slowing from its strong post-recession growth. 
While economic conditions have strengthened overseas, there is "a lack of 
confidence here," said Olin Wethington, a former assistant secretary of the 
treasury for international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton's got to be worried, thinking, 'Am I going to be sitting there and 
see the dollar hit a new post-World War II low? What does that say about the 
credibility of my leadership?' " Wethington said. 
</P>
<P>
 One chronic problem that just a few weeks ago seemed solvable -- the stubborn 
trade deficit with Japan -- has in recent days turned cloudy. Officials had 
hoped that a new round of negotiations with Japan would allow them to announce 
some progress. 
</P>
<P>
 But Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's governing coalition fell apart. He 
was replaced by Tomiichi Murayama, a Socialist, and the new government is 
considered unlikely to make the reductions in government support for farmers, 
retailers and industry required to achieve significant progress in trade 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, Yeltsin's presence at the meeting will renew an old question 
for the Group of Seven: When will it become the Group of Eight? Moscow has been 
pressing for such an expansion, but others point to Russia's serious economic 
woes and say it is far from earning the sort of status as an economic giant 
that would let it join the club. 
</P>
<P>
 While the G-7 nations account for roughly 11% of the world's population, their 
economies are valued at 70% of the world's gross domestic product. Russia is 
not in the same league. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices continue to surge in Russia, government revenue may be as much as 30% 
below anticipated levels, unemployment is at least 8%, and crime is interwoven 
throughout the economy "like a ganglion," said Robert Legvold of Columbia 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 So, there is little expectation that Yeltsin will come away even with the 
promises of support that were given to Russia in 1993, when the international 
community pledged roughly $44 billion in aid.

INVESTIGATORS SEEK CLUES IN FATAL N. CAROLINA JET CRASH; ACCIDENT: EXPERTS LOOK 
FOR EVIDENCE THAT WIND SHEARS CAUSED DC-9 TO SINK, KILLING 37. CREW'S ACTION IN 
ABORTED LANDING QUESTIONED. 
</P>

<P>
 A powerful thunderstorm -- and the violent, shearing wind that it may have 
spawned -- were prime suspects Monday as several investigators probed the 
charred wreckage for clues on why a USAir jetliner crashed Saturday night, 
killing 37 of the 57 people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 It was typically hot, muggy weather here on the Fourth of July, and the going 
was slow and tedious for the two dozen specialists brought in by the National 
Transportation Safety Board to study the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Their work required patience and precision -- noting the exact position and 
condition of each of the thousands of pieces of twisted, shattered debris that 
once made up a massive DC-9 jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say co-pilot James Hayes, 41, apparently was at the controls 
Saturday night as USAir's Flight 1016 from Columbia, S.C., prepared to land at 
the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Encountering the heavy rain and dwindling visibility of a rapidly intensifying 
thunderstorm, the cockpit crew decided to abort the landing attempt and climb 
to the right, according to transcripts of conversations between the airport 
tower and the crew. 
</P>
<P>
 But after climbing briefly, the plane suddenly sank, slamming into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 About a minute before the crash, the tower had warned that there might be wind 
shears. Wind shears are sudden shifts in the direction and velocity of 
localized gusts, which occur at dangerously low levels and can deprive a plane 
of the airspeed needed to keep it aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are studying data from cockpit recording devices and from 
wind-shear monitoring systems on the ground, but there has been no definitive 
word yet on whether there were wind shears. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no mention of engine failure, and the plane's abrupt drop could 
be explained by wind shear. In addition, two witnesses on the ground said 
Monday that gusts at the time of the crash had been strong enough to shake 
their truck. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, preliminary readings from monitoring systems on the ground 
show none of the wind-direction shifts normally associated with wind shear. 
</P>
<P>
 And John Hammerschmidt, the NTSB member heading the accident probe, said other 
pilots landing about the time of the crash reported heavy rain but none said he 
encountered wind shear. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue is whether Hayes and his pilot, Capt. Michael Greenlee, handled 
the plane properly after they made the decision to abort the landing and told 
the tower they were "on the go" and circling to the right for another landing 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called go-arounds are not uncommon, and USAir officials said Hayes and 
Greenlee were thoroughly trained on handling a DC-9 in wind-shear conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes and Greenlee survived in relatively good condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB positioned investigators the length of the straight, 1,100-foot swath 
the plane carved after first striking the ground about 2,200 feet west of the 
north-south runway. 
</P>
<P>
 The landing gear on the right side of the plane hit first, followed by the 
left landing gear about 18 feet later. 
</P>
<P>
 The right wingtip struck the ground a few feet after that, literally mowing 
the grass as the plane continued to hurtle forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The DC-9 sawed through a grove of small trees, scattering tree limbs and 
debris before colliding into two large oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact with the oaks tore the fuselage into three pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 All that was left of the mid-section of the fuselage, which burned furiously 
after the crash, was a five-foot pile of charred debris wrapped around one of 
the oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Still scattered around it Monday were personal possessions of the living and 
dead -- torn magazines, a baby's clothing, videocassettes and a stained 
T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The mutilated aft section of the fuselage had hacked its way into a house like 
an ax into a soft log. 
</P>
<P>
 The occupants of the house, Walter and Martha Dunn, were in South Carolina 
when the accident occurred. The smashed remains of two of the Dunns' cars were 
still in their driveway Monday, a few yards from a blue plastic tarp on which 
rescuers had placed human remains.

BABY KILLED, 6 HURT IN DOWNTOWN L.A. CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 6-month-old boy was killed and six other people were injured in the 
collision of a pickup truck and another vehicle Monday night in Downtown Los 
Angeles. The unidentified child died of cardiac arrest shortly after being 
taken to California Hospital Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two children were flown from the scene at Olympic Boulevard and Hill Street to 
Childrens Hospital in a Los Angeles Fire Department air ambulance, spokesman 
Brian Humphrey said. The cause of the accident was under investigation, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of four children and three adults were hurt in the crash. Most of the 
injuries occurred when the pickup rolled over several times and its occupants, 
riding inside a camper shell, were ejected, Humphrey said.

 John Wayne Bobbitt faces new charges of domestic battery after he, his fiancee 
and another man were arrested following a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbitt, who gained international attention last year when his wife cut off 
his penis, and his fiancee, Kristina Elliott, were arrested along with a 
friend, Todd Biro, after a fracas early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott, 21, said she was beaten by the two men, and Bobbitt told police he 
was struck and bitten on the chest by Elliott.

SIMPSON'S PRELIMINARY HEARING RESUMES TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attention will be focused on the courtroom of Municipal Judge Kathleen 
Kennedy-Powell again this morning when a hearing resumes to determine whether 
O.J. Simpson should be held for trial on charges of murdering his former wife 
and a friend of hers. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is scheduled to resume at 9 a.m. and to be aired live by the major 
television networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy-Powell indicated last week that she will take up Simpson's motion to 
exclude evidence that the defense contends was improperly taken by police from 
the former athlete's property the morning after the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 If successful, the motion would force prosecutors to proceed without such 
items as a bloody glove that matches one found at the crime scene, and 
bloodstains recovered from Simpson's car, driveway, bedroom and bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, hundreds of gawkers congregated near Simpson's Brentwood mansion 
and the condominium where his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, 
Ronald Lyle Goldman, were stabbed to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, meanwhile, was visited in jail by his psychiatrist, Dr. Saul 
Faerstein, and his former USC and Buffalo Bills teammate, Bob Chandler. Neither 
man would comment on what they discussed.

TEACHERS UNION OPPOSES 'SAVE OUR STATE' INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rejecting claims that U.S. taxpayers are being unfairly penalized, the 
nation's largest teachers union Monday came out against California's proposal 
to deny social services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "California makes it a sin to be a child of a person who is seeking the 
American dream," said Darlene Chavez, granddaughter of an undocumented 
immigrant and an Arizona delegate to the National Education Assn.'s annual 
convention of teachers and school personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The California delegation had asked the 2.2 million-member NEA to take a broad 
approach, actively opposing any bill or initiative to deny illegal aliens equal 
access to a public education and other public services, but its motion was 
narrowed during debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the California initiative argued that it requires schools to 
become agents for the Immigration and Naturalization Service and denies 
undocumented students equal access to education. Supporters cite the cost of 
providing services to people who do not pay taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Illegal immigrants do not play by the rules. They break the rules," said Jane 
Stern, a delegate from Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an emotional address to the convention, Amy Tsubokawa of California 
recalled how she had been interned with other Japanese Americans during World 
War II. "There was no due process although my mother is American. . . . I was 
denied equal access to public education." 
</P>
<P>
 The INS estimates that there are nearly 4 million illegal immigrants in the 
country and that the number is growing by about 300,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 California, Arizona, Florida and other states have filed suit against the 
federal government seeking to recoup some of the cost of providing education, 
health care and other services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The California "save our state" initiative has qualified for the Nov. 8 
statewide ballot.

FUNDING CRISIS SHOULDN'T AFFECT O.C.'S I-5 WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A severe financial crisis in the state's transportation program is expected to 
delay millions of dollars in road projects designed to ease congestion on 
clogged Los Angeles freeways, but Orange County's biggest highway-widening 
project should be spared. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail projects critical to getting Southland motorists out of their cars may 
also be vulnerable as state officials attempt to make good on their promise to 
give earthquake safety first priority for scarce transportation dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the biggest project in the state transportation plan -- the 
massive expansion of the Santa Ana Freeway through the heart of the region -- 
is likely to escape unscathed. Local transportation officials plan to use money 
from the county's half-cent sales tax measure for transportation, which was 
approved by voters in 1990, to make up for any shortfalls in state money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done a shift to keep our priority on the Interstate 5 at a high level," 
said Stanley T. Oftelie, Orange County Transportation Authority executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2-billion project, which will double the number of lanes from southern 
Orange County to the Los Angeles County line, won't be completed until early 
next century. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Interstate 5 project shouldn't be hurt, widening work on the Costa 
Mesa and Riverside freeways will be delayed four years or longer. That's 
because sales tax money planned for those projects would be diverted to keep 
the Santa Ana Freeway project moving. 
</P>
<P>
 About $94 million would come from funds intended for widening the Costa Mesa 
Freeway north of the Garden Grove Freeway, and $114 million would come from 
funds for widening the Riverside Freeway between the Orange Freeway and the Los 
Angeles County line. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County residents commuting northward may also feel the effect of 
project delays in Los Angeles County, where the crisis means that everything 
from the long-awaited extension of the Foothill Freeway in the San Gabriel 
Valley to the completion of a system of high-occupancy vehicle lanes along the 
San Diego Freeway may be put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Even mass transit projects like the Pasadena Light Rail and the extension of 
the Red Line into the San Fernando Valley could be subject to postponements as 
officials try to squeeze enough funds out of road and rail projects to pay for 
the strengthening of highway bridges subject to damage in severe earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The official estimate is that the delays would last at least a year, but other 
transportation experts predict it could be much longer as the state continues 
to identify more bridges in need of retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 The revenue crisis "is going to ricochet back and forth, up and down the 
state," said California Transportation Commission Chairwoman Octavia Diener. "A 
lot of projects are going to be stretched out and take a lot longer to build, 
and it already takes too long to build these things." 
</P>
<P>
 But even as congestion-easing projects are being delayed, Assembly 
Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said motorists 
shouldn't lose sight of what they are getting in return -- the peace of mind 
that highway bridges will not collapse in a major temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is at much greater risk because of a lack of seismic retrofit 
than the expansion of road projects," he said. "Having to make the choice, I 
think seismic retrofit is much more important than new roads. We ought to make 
the roads that we have safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The tug of war over funds between roads and retrofitting was precipitated by 
the voters' rejection in the June 7 primary election of Proposition 1A, a 
proposed bond issue that earmarked $1 billion for the seismic strengthening of 
bridges. The bond issue's failure meant that all bridge retrofitting costs 
would then have to be absorbed by the transportation program, which was already 
facing funding shortages because of a slump in gasoline tax revenue and voter 
rejection of an earlier rail bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in January, even before the Northridge earthquake made seismic 
retrofitting a high-profile issue, Caltrans Director James van Loben Sels 
confided to a legislative workshop that insufficient revenue would send the 
state's transportation program "off the cliff" in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the June 7 defeat of Proposition 1A . . . the voters shoved the 
program over the precipice and into a free fall about six months sooner than 
expected," Arthur Bauer, executive director of Californians for Better 
Transportation, wrote his members in their latest newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few days transportation officials will put a cost estimate on the 
second phase of the seismic strengthening program. Once that is done, they will 
face the unsavory task of determining which other road and rail projects will 
be slowed down to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail projects are less threatened because in most cases they don't have to 
share scarce gasoline tax dollars with the seismic program; much of their 
financing is from bond issues or specially earmarked federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch there is that, given the fiscally conservative mood of the voters, a 
$1-billion bond issue scheduled to go on the ballot in November is considered 
to have little likelihood of passing. Some officials, including Katz, are 
pushing to keep the measure off the ballot rather than face what they predict 
is certain defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Without that bond issue, the funding shortage would climb to about $3 billion 
and financing would become less certain for projects like the Pasadena Light 
Rail and the East-West Valley Line, a mass transit rail line that will run 
across the San Fernando Valley connecting with the Red Line subway. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't have a bond issue or some other way to fund those projects, they 
could be impacted (by the crisis)," said Linda Bohlinger, the Los Angeles 
County Metropolitan Transportation's deputy executive officer for capital 
planning. She said one hopeful sign that these projects may have a better 
chance of keeping on track than the road projects is that both Senate 
Transportation Committee Chairman Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) and Katz are 
urging the Wilson Administration not to delay any mass transit projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rationale for leaving rail out of the freeze is that rail is the one 
thing that worked well both in the Loma Prieta and the Northridge earthquakes," 
Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials confirm that it is mostly road projects that will be 
delayed, but they say how many will not be known until an assessment is 
completed of the number of bridges that will need retrofitting. They 
acknowledge, however, that delays are likely to hit most large projects 
scheduled for the latter half of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, projects likely to face delays include: 
</P>
<P>
 * The addition of car-pool lanes in both directions on a 7.6-mile section of 
the San Diego Freeway from the Orange County line to the Long Beach Freeway. 
Bohlinger said the $37-million project is a key element in local plans for a 
major high-occupancy vehicle system designed to relieve congestion on Los 
Angeles County freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 * The six-mile extension of the Foothill Freeway from its terminus at Foothill 
Boulevard to the San Bernardino County Line. Bohlinger said that for years the 
$274-million project has had the highest priority in Los Angeles County freeway 
system because it would relieve a critical bottleneck in the fast-growing 
northeast sector of the county. Plans for the extension call for the 
construction of four lanes, including a car-pool lane, in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
 * The construction of a San Diego Freeway interchange at Arbor Vitae Street, a 
project first requested by the Los Angeles Department of Airports in 1976. The 
$24-million project would provide access to LAX from the San Diego Freeway as 
well as the Century Freeway.

MIKE DOWNEY: WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; IT WAS THEIR FINEST HOUR, FOR 74 
MINUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You don't have the United States to kick around anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 It sure was fun, though. From the fateful moment shortly past noon when 22 
soccer players from South America sashayed into this university football 
stadium, squeezing hands like schoolboys about to play ring-around-the-rosey, 
their feeling of confidence that there was no way in the World Cup that they 
really could be outplayed by these precocious North American candy-stripers 
gradually disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 And OK, in reality they were not outplayed, winning the game, as we do 
willingly accept. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, but what patience and extra effort it took for Bebeto, Romario and Brasil 
'94, who had to endure nearly 74 full minutes of scoreless stalemate and 
fruitless near-misses before finally breaking through. In the sunlight at 
Stanford Stadium, the hosts "scared the daylights" out of the haughty 
Brazilians, in the words of U.S. Soccer Federation President Alan Rothenberg, 
who could only imagine the number of people sweating out this result in Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," summarized Hugo Perez, a U.S. player originally from El Salvador, 
"could have been the greatest day in history in the sport of soccer in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 And likely Brazil's darkest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, though, the ultra-conservative play of the U.S. team could do 
little else but hold down the score. Twelve minutes into the contest, an 
acrobatic attempt by Thomas Dooley went barely awry, leaving teammate Alexi 
Lalas tangled in the netting, but not the ball. No other chance after Yankee 
Dooley's dandy came so close to making this a holiday to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 The question was, was this a moral victory? 
</P>
<P>
 And the next question was, had U.S. soccer progressed past the point of moral 
victories? 
</P>
<P>
 Timo Liekoski, an assistant coach, tried to answer both. He said, "I think 
this was the game that Brazil feared the most. I'm absolutely sure that, 
psychologically, this was the most difficult game for them so far in this 
tournament. It must be a huge relief for them to get this one behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really thought this could be the game that would surprise the world. But it 
wasn't meant to be. Maybe someone's telling us, 'Just keep working and it will 
come.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So circle those calendars: 
</P>
<P>
 Paris, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil will work harder and harder to become defending champions. The winners 
put one of the U.S. guys in the hospital Monday and were obligated to play 
short-handed because of it. A player named Leonardo, who henceforward can 
consider himself regarded as Leonardo di Vicious, whipped an elbow in the 
direction of Tab Ramos' temple that makes him the new leader for Dirtiest Play 
of the Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing 10-against-11 for most of the second half, the Brazilians had to 
"leave the spectacle and play with our hearts," as their gifted player Romario 
observed. No dirty plays are necessary in the repertoire of Super Romario, 
whose textbook pass to Bebeto arranged the game's only goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto embraced Romario's neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario hugged Bebeto's waist. 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto kissed Romario's cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 A continent away, others did the same. They knew. They all knew. One goal was 
going to be enough in this game. Team USA had adopted a strategy for the 
occasion like a chess player more attuned to salvaging a draw than attacking 
toward a checkmate. In this sport, tactics make perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been a huge mistake for us to get into a shooting match with 
Brazil," Liekoski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zero-zero could have been a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Zero-zero could have led to the kind of shooting match the U.S. did want to 
get into with Brazil -- a postgame shooting match. 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 So, OK, the United States really didn't defeat Brazil, 0-1. But the U.S. did 
do its best. The U.S. did give it the old college try. The U.S. did give notice 
that better days are ahead. Brazil, rest of the world, it's time everybody 
understood this.

JIM MURRAY: WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; DEATH WILL BE THE LASTING MEMORY 
</P>

 The 1972 Olympics will never be remembered for world records, non-winning 
fractions or general brotherhood of the athletic community. It will be 
remembered for the slaughter of a dozen fine athletes by a band of terrorists. 
It will forever be the "Massacre" Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1919 World Series will never be remembered for called shots, spectacular 
catches, base-stealing splurges or brilliant pitching. It will be remembered 
for underworld intrusion into the grand old game -- the Black Sox Scandal, the 
Fixed Fall Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 And the 1994 World Cup will not be remembered for strikers, sweepers, keepers 
or waving flags or national anthems. It will be remembered for a murder. A 
sudden, shocking act of homicide of a fine young athlete who had done nothing 
more serious than cost his team a game. It was the most terrible kind of 
lynching. The death of an innocent. Cause of death: World Cup soccer. Murder 
One. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia is a not-so-good neighbor to the south of us that is the only country 
in South America to have a coastline on two oceans. It is split by the mighty 
Magdalena River, and it produces the best coffee in the world. It also produces 
some of the finest coca in the world, the biggest crop of heartbreak in any 
hemisphere. It is the home of the infamous Medellin cartel, brokers of the 
world's cocaine, and it comes into focus as one of the great lawless centers of 
the universe, one that makes Chicago of the '20s and the 19th Century Barbary 
Coast look like monasteries by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 But even for Medellin, this was a shocking burst of mindless violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia wasn't always an international outlaw. It was here that the great 
Simon Bolivar threw the Spaniards out of the New World and introduced the first 
democracy in South America. It was, in some ways, a beacon of enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 A World Cup, in some cases, is nationalism gone mad. But not even runaway 
drug-trafficking could give Colombia the international image some enraged 
"patriots" with guns gave it last week. It didn't do much for soccer's image 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 It cost the life of a bright young athlete, Andres Escobar. He was brutally 
slain outside a Medellin restaurant by self-appointed executioners. His crime? 
He accidentally scored the goal by which the United States defeated Colombia in 
the first round of World Cup competition. An accident. A bit of misfortune. 
Happens all the time in net sports from hockey to basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia came into the World Cup as one of the favorites. It was 7-1 on the 
morning line. Only Germany and Brazil (4-1) had shorter prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States was held at 200-1. Therefore, there was no reason for anyone 
to expect the North Americans to defeat Colombia in the opening round. And they 
wouldn't have -- except for a ball that ricocheted off Escobar's foot 
accidentally into his own goal. Because that goal lost the game and prevented 
Colombia from advancing, it aroused a terrible passion in some of his 
countrymen, a murderous rage. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a tragic example of the psychological damage chauvinistic rooting can 
engender. The my-country-can-beat-your-country complex gone stark raving mad. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the World Cup format itself to blame? Well, we have seen an instance of a 
match triggering a war (El Salvador vs. Honduras). Even victories have 
triggered riots. And fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 But sports fans have lived with disappointments before. It goes with the 
territory. No one ostracized Fred Merkle for his "bonehead" play -- failing to 
touch second -- costing the Giants the pennant in 1908. When Roy Riegels ran 
the wrong way in the Rose Bowl in 1929, it went into the lore and literature, 
of the game, not on any police blotter. There is some evidence memory of that 
event left some scars on Riegels' psyche, but the facts of the matter are, the 
rest of America thought it was funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, there's a good chance a man -- or woman -- who commits a classic 
boo-boo could become a national hero of sorts. It's for sure they'd be on all 
the talk shows, probably get a shoe endorsement or two and probably a line of 
Wrong Way soft drink products. They would be invited to cut supermarket ribbons 
and attain celebrity status and be widely held to be surrogate for every guy 
who ever left the water running or the keys in the car or his wallet in the 
restaurant or lost a winning lottery ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 When winning becomes, literally, life or death, it's time to examine 
priorities. It's all right to cheer for your school, your town, your country. 
But when it goes beyond good-natured cheering, it gets ugly. It has always made 
me uneasy to see fans show up for Olympic Games draped in flags or signs and 
howling "USA!"on one side and booing fine athletes from other countries on the 
other. Olympic Games have always been held to be contests between individuals, 
not countries. You cheer for a great athlete like Pele or Carl Lewis regardless 
of the colors of his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unfortunate for a sport and a format that had finally seemed to be 
gaining wide, enthusiastic acceptance in this country. Soccer sold out 
practically wherever it was staged in the United States. We had finally been 
let in on a grand international party, and we liked it. It was like your first 
prom. 
</P>
<P>
 It will probably be won by Brazil or Germany. It always is. But whoever wins, 
it might be beside the point. It will not be known for that. It will be known 
for Murder in Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup football might have taken a bullet to the belly too. We don't know 
who won World Cup '94. But we know who lost it. All of us.

FORMER AUSTRALIAN TENNIS GREAT HOAD DEAD AT 59; OBITUARY: TWO-TIME WIMBLEDON 
SINGLES CHAMPION FOUGHT LONG BATTLE WITH LEUKEMIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tributes flowed Monday for former Australian tennis great Lew Hoad, who 
died at the age of 59 on the day Pete Sampras emulated his feat of winning two 
consecutive Wimbledon titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoad, winner of 13 Grand Slam singles and doubles titles, died in Spain on 
Sunday after a long battle with leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 His former Davis Cup teammate and 1960 Wimbledon singles champion Neale Fraser 
noted the irony in the timing of Hoad's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps it was his last hurrah -- saying don't forget me, I was one of the 
greatest," Fraser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoad reportedly experienced respiratory problems at his tennis-camp home near 
Marbella on Saturday night and was taken to a hospital, where he died the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his contemporaries and countrymen had been organizing a seniors 
tournament for this month at his Campo de Tenis to raise money for his 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul McNamee, a former Australian Davis Cup player and 1980 and 1982 Wimbledon 
champion, said the tournament would still be played. 
</P>
<P>
 McNamee visited Hoad in Spain recently to organize the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "His spirits were very good right until the end," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoad was the first post-war player to win consecutive Wimbledon singles 
titles, in 1956 and 1957. He won doubles titles in 1953, 1955 and 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the first of the charismatic players we saw in the '50s," Fraser said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He produced a brand of tennis that was exciting, different to everyone else 
and a joy to watch. It was great to know that he was part of the Australian 
tennis team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played him many times and have no doubt he was the greatest player I ever 
played. He had everything, he was just a joy to play and to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew in January that he was ill, but it was sad to hear it happened 
suddenly." 
</P>
<P>
 Said ITF President Brian Tobin: "Tennis has lost one of its true legends. Many 
of his contemporaries believe that, at his best, Lew was one of the greatest 
players ever to grace the game. He was a spectacular player, a great 
personality, a good guy and a friend to all who knew him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoad won the Australian, French and Wimbledon titles in 1956, missing the 
Grand Slam when countryman Ken Rosewall beat him in the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 He won six Grand Slam doubles titles with Rosewall, including Wimbledon in 
1953 and '56, the 1955 Wimbledon title with another Australian, Rex Hartwig, 
the 1957 Australian title with Fraser, and the 1954 French mixed doubles with 
Maureen Connolly. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last 30 years, Hoad and his wife, Jenny, lived in Spain.

OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; 'SCHINDLER' HAS SPECIAL MEANING TO EX-TROJAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Leyson lives in the shadow of history. 
</P>
<P>
 As a water polo player for the Olympic Festival's South team, Leyson is well 
recognized by his peers as an outstanding player: He was an All-American at USC 
from 1990 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 At 24, he has a good life, and he says so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does it bother me that I have to live at home to be able to afford to be a 
full-time water polo player? And not have to get a regular job?" Leyson asks 
almost mockingly. He answers with a laugh, "Naaahhhh. " 
</P>
<P>
 Leyson has perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 He has had it since the fifth grade. That's when a teacher asked the students 
to do reports on their families. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Leyson's father told him about Schindler's list 13 years before 
the movie came out. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Leyson told him about it, because Leon Leyson was on that list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daniel was in fourth or fifth grade and he interviewed me for his class," the 
elder Leyson said. "When he read the paper to the class, the teacher was 
shocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daniel reported on (Schindler's list) long before (the movie) came out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Leyson's were invited to a special screening of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1989, we went to Poland and saw where everything was," Dan Leyson said. 
"It was good in one way, but tough. I knew I was going to see that movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Leyson said that seeing the movie was "natural for me to do. The kids 
(Dan and his sister Stacy) have always known, so it wasn't easy for them 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 Entranced by the movie, the Leyson's were not conscious of each other's 
reactions to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the scenes were so authentic, I was stunned," Leon Leyson said. "It 
was like being in the '40s. My parents, my sister and brother were on that 
list. Everyone else in Europe, in our family, perished. We were the only five 
to survive. I lost two brothers because they were not on Schindler's list." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon and Dan Leyson haven't talked about the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't ask him about it," Dan said. "I know I had a hard time of it -- it's 
not like going to see 'Pet Detective' -- that whole movie was a gut wrencher." 
</P>
<P>
 Leyson talks freely about his dad's experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I think it's important that you understand the magnitude of it and 
keep it in mind, but you have to move on," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Which is playing for the South team when the water polo part of the festival 
starts today. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic Festival Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The West team of Leoni Baker of Malibu, Heather Bender-Atwell of Burbank, 
Dennis Callin of Westlake Village and Steffen Peters of Escondido won the gold 
medal in the Equestrian dressage competition with a score of 3,778 points. . . 
. Swimmer Emily Mastin of Tempe, Ariz., set an Olympic Festival record in the 
200 individual medley final with a time of 2 minutes 19.77 seconds. . . . In 
tennis, only one semifinal, mixed doubles, was held because the heat and 
humidity forced several players to be treated for heat exhaustion. Temperatures 
were in the low 90s and the humidity was in the high 80s. The other semifinals 
will be made up today.

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; MALIGNED DEFENSE OF THE U.S. MADE ITS MARK; 
BACK LINE: FOR THE MOST PART, BALBOA AND HIS HARD-NOSED MATES DEFUSED BRAZIL'S 
EXPLOSIVE FORWARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 So much of their time was spent on the grass Monday afternoon -- sliding, 
diving and lunging -- it seemed only natural that a couple of the American 
players remained sprawled on the turf minutes after the final whistle signaled 
Brazil's 1-0 victory over the United States in the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Defender Marcelo Balboa, physically and emotionally spent, leaned back on the 
grass as the happy scene unfolded around him, a sea of Brazilian yellow and 
green bouncing up and down at Stanford Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sad thing for us, a very emotional thing and a hard thing to get 
over," Balboa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several yards away from Balboa sat Cobi Jones. Jones, 24, had made his first 
World Cup start, taking the place of midfielder John Harkes, who received two 
yellow cards in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones sat on the grass, staring at his feet. Nearby, an official extended a 
hand to Eric Wynalda and helped him up. Bebeto, whose goal in the 74th minute 
made the difference, came over and hugged Balboa. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an acknowledgment of a job well done -- on both sides. Certainly, it 
had been no secret how the United States intended to approach this match 
against Brazil. If the Americans were to have any chance, it was going to be an 
unappealing brand of ugly and unglamorous soccer for 90 minutes . . . 30 more 
grueling minutes of overtime and then pray for penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a page from the successful Swedish strategy against Brazil, the United 
States did a formidable job of packing the middle and was able to catch the 
Brazilians several times with an offside trap in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was interesting that every team that has played against us in the World 
Cup has changed their tactics," Bebeto said. "And marked us more one-on-one." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the United States had seven or eight players back in the first half. 
Was eight enough? 
</P>
<P>
 No, as it turned out. Adopting such a defensive posture really left no margin 
for error. One minute breakdown in the midfield -- which led to Brazil's goal 
-- and that was the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that we had to keep playing like we did in the first half, and it was 
just one of those things where we broke down in the middle of the field and 
they capitalized on it," Balboa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said midfielder Roy Wegerle: "The first 45 minutes we thought we might upset 
them. The second 45 minutes, they proved to be too strong and too smart." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel had ample opportunity to watch, since he 
faced but four shots. He probably could have provided on-the-spot radio 
commentary from his vantage point. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were marking very well," Taffarel said. "The American team was showing 
us a great deal of respect and was playing us very close but was attacking very 
little. I know it was a hard game. The American soccer team was very physical 
against us." 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, the U.S. defense was much maligned before the World Cup 
tournament. It was considered by many to be the primary weakness -- too old, 
too slow. But these four games were a revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense we have really came of age," assistant coach Timo Liekoski said. 
"(Alexi) Lalas and Marcelo played exceptionally well. (Paul) Caligiuri is 
playing better every game." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense wasn't the only unit to come of age. U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic 
was asked about the improvement of his younger players, those who had never 
participated in a World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to single out Lalas, Mike Sorber and Cobi Jones," Milutinovic said. "I 
mention them because they came straight out of college. They have faced the 
players who have the greatest experience in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "That should show everybody that the U.S. has a great future in soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant coach Sigi Schmid agreed, saying: "Look at the experience we've 
gained from four years ago. If we can make half the progress from this time. . 
. . For Cobi, Alexi, (Mike) Lapper and Claudio (Reyna), this experience is 
invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like that theme."

WORLD CUP USA '94: ROUND OF 16; ALL EYES AND EXPECTATIONS ON MEXICO; SOCCER: 
PLAYERS CAN'T GET AWAY FROM ADORING FANS -- UNTIL THEY GET ON THE FIELD TODAY 
FOR GAME AGAINST BULGARIA AT GIANTS STADIUM.

<P>
 Nothing like a nice swim to cool down after a couple of hours of soccer 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 For Luis Garcia and Luis Salvador, that was the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The two forwards for the Mexican World Cup team were so hot after a recent 
workout in stifling northern New Jersey heat, they didn't even bother to put on 
bathing suits. 
</P>
<P>
 They stripped off their shirts and jumped into the hotel pool in only their 
uniform shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 It was relaxing, all right. Until they came up for air. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they looked around and saw faces. More than a dozen, pressed against the 
floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Elderly men, young girls, babies hanging from the thick arms of hard labor, 
all quiet, all staring. Faces of excitement, of hope, of need. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon those faces were partially blocked by more faces, of Mexican TV 
journalists bold enough to run into the pool area with cameras and microphones 
to record this monumental, uh, dip. 
</P>
<P>
 A hotel security guard, accustomed to guarding mere celebrities, was so awed 
he did not move. 
</P>
<P>
 "For gosh sakes," he exclaimed. "They're swimming ." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed they are, the entire team, thrashing about in expectations that grow 
deeper by the day. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mexico plays Bulgaria today at 1:30 p.m. PDT in a second-round game at 
Giants Stadium, the police will be on alert in two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City officials fear more wild celebrations such as the one that 
resulted in one confirmed death after Mexico's recent 1-1 tie with Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Police departments in Los Angeles communities are also on alert in hopes of 
avoiding the postgame disturbances such as the ones that have plagued 
Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has to realize that lives of people are more important than a game, 
right?" asked Garcia, one of Mexico's top offensive threats. 
</P>
<P>
 He phrases the obvious as a question because, as the furor has grown around 
his surprisingly successful team, the answer is appearing more uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment Mexico won Group E and advanced to the second round for the 
first time in a World Cup held outside of Mexico, the players have not been 
able to leave their hotel without an escort clearing a path through the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of seven security guards has been hired for 22 players and coaches. 
Their practices have been held within an orange wire fence, with fans and media 
forced to stand several hundred yards behind that fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet dozens still stand on their toes, in the heat, for a look. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand these feelings, because we understand that we make history," 
Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Understanding is one thing. Coping is quite another. 
</P>
<P>
 When taking the field today against a less talented Bulgarian team, will their 
main opponent be themselves? 
</P>
<P>
 And if they beat Bulgaria as expected -- the Bulgarians had never even won a 
World Cup match until this year -- what happens next? 
</P>
<P>
 How on earth do they remain on earth in the days before a quarterfinal match 
against defending champion Germany? 
</P>
<P>
 "But we like this," goalkeeper Jorge Campos said, giggling. "This feeling we 
get from everybody, it motivates us." 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike in past World Cups, the feeling they get from each other apparently 
strengthens them. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Mejia Baron, who gave up his dental practice to become their coach, put 
together this team as carefully as he would tell his patients to brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of relying only on headstrong stars, he favored players with 
educations. All 22 players have at least finished high school, and several have 
college degrees, a first for Mexican soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 He also encouraged players with families -- 80% of the team is married. Then 
he allowed them to bring their families on this World Cup trip, although wives 
and children stay at a different hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he forced the players to understand that only team, and not 
individual, performances count. Witness the benching of forward Hugo Sanchez, 
Mexico's best-known soccer player, in favor of Carlos Hermosillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez is known for leaping bicycle kicks, long individual runs and dramatic 
shots. Hermosillo is best known for his ability to distribute the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexicans lost the only game in this tournament in which they used Sanchez. 
They are unbeaten in two games with Hermosillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been through something like this before, and I'm not taking it 
well," Sanchez said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Campos explained, "There are no stars on this team. Mexico is the 
star." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Campos has become increasingly famous -- he can be seen on commercials 
for Nike and McDonald's -- he has spread that fame around. 
</P>
<P>
 He might seem self-indulgent when wearing a baseball cap adorned with the 
rainbow-colored letters "J. Campos." 
</P>
<P>
 But hang around the Mexican team for a while and you realize all of the 
players have those caps. 
</P>
<P>
 The players are rarely seen without each other. When they were allowed to 
remain out until midnight after the tie with Italy, most of them were back at 
the hotel by 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The players agree it is this unity that represents their best chance to 
endure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not promise a victory," Baron said of the Bulgaria game today. "But we 
will play with conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 All agree it is the least they can do.

VALENCIA RUNNING BACK DRAFT GETTING A CHANCE TO SHOW HIS LIGHTER SIDE; PREP 
FOOTBALL: NORTH'S PRACTICES FOR COUNTY ALL-STAR GAME HAVE BEEN LOOSE, BUT 
STANFORD-BOUND BACK SAYS GAME WILL BE INTENSE.

 Practice just started, and Chris Draft is, well, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 And not just smiling. Draft appears jovial, an on-field demeanor not often 
associated with the swift, powerful running back. 
</P>
<P>
 This, however, is not a typical practice. Draft, formerly of Valencia High, is 
preparing for the 35th Orange County North-South All-Star football game 
scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Friday at Orange Coast College's LeBard Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Draft and his teammates on the North squad are learning their roles at Savanna 
High. Moreover, Draft said, they are learning about one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best part (of being selected to the team) is messing around with all the 
guys, talking and having fun," Draft said. "During the season we have to 
compete, and personalities change (on the field) because you want to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "This allows us to find out what everybody is really about." 
</P>
<P>
 Draft, 18, is no mystery to anyone on the field -- except for would-be 
tacklers. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a brilliant three-year varsity career at Valencia, rushing for 3,038 
yards. Draft (6 feet 2, 210 pounds) capped his career by being selected The 
Times Orange County back of the year in 1993 after gaining 1,338 yards rushing 
with 24 touchdowns as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Also a starter on defense, Draft, a linebacker, finished third on the team in 
tackles and had nine sacks. His overall excellence was a big reason Valencia 
won the Orange League title and advanced to the semifinals of the Southern 
Section Division VI playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 He has accepted a football scholarship from Stanford and will leave for Palo 
Alto on Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really not thinking much about college yet," Draft said. "Once it gets 
closer to the time I have to leave, then I'm sure I'll feel all the different 
emotions associated with going to college. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now I just want to have my summer and get in shape for the all-star 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Draft and his teammates have worked toward that goal since practice began June 
22. Despite the good times, Draft said work has been done. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a real social group, everyone has been talking to each other a lot, 
but we're getting everything covered," Draft said. "Everything is real 
organized. We've put (the plays) in, now it's just a matter of getting the 
timing down and making it all work." 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive rhythm is usually helped by continuity -- something neither the 
North nor South squads has enjoyed. The rosters have seemingly changed by the 
minute almost since the day they were initially typed. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem? Draft believes he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the last summer before college, and a lot of guys just want to mess 
around and relax with their friends," Draft said. "When you're out there 
practicing, you can't get the most out of your summer like you want to. 
</P>
<P>
 "But all the guys still out there are real dedicated to play." 
</P>
<P>
 So much so that Draft expects an intense battle. Fun or not, football is 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to play the game, you can't just go out there and joke around," 
Draft said. "Once game time comes, everyone will do their job. We know what we 
have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Draft, at least, is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a game where I can show people what I can do," he said. "A lot of 
people from different schools will be watching this game, a lot of people who 
haven't see me play yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I can give them a show."

 Foli, a three-sport standout at Notre Dame High in Sherman Oaks, came to the 
Angels in 1982 in a deal that sent Brian Harper to Milwaukee.The fiery 
shortstop led the league in fielding that year and helped the club to its 
second divisional title. He was traded to the Yankees after the 1983 season and 
retired in '85 with a lifetime .251 average.

 Foli, who turned down a football scholarship at USC to pursue his baseball 
career, is in his third year as the infield and first-base coach for the 
Brewers. Now 43, he spends the off-season hunting, fishing and playing golf 
near his Florida home.

NO KIDDING, THIS AGENT HAS TALENT; LISA SANTOS IS ONLY 22, BUT SHE REPRESENTS 
MORE THAN 30 HOT WRITING TALENTS AFTER LESS THAN SEVEN MONTHS ON THE JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GRANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood literary agent Lisa Santos, all of 22, is sitting in her office 
eating Girl Scout cookies. "I used to sell these, you know," she says, chomping 
on a peanut-butter cookie. Her tousled brown hair flips back as she emits a 
bawdy laugh. Of course, she knows that it wasn't that long ago that she was a 
Girl Scout, and she isn't about to apologize for it. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in a town obsessed with youth and youth culture, Santos throws her 
clout around at least partly because she herself is of that culture. Despite 
being no one's Hollywood progeny -- and never even having gone to college -- 
she now represents more than 30 hot writing talents, including "Saturday Night 
Live's" Rosie Shuster and "Quantum Leap's" Robert Duncan, after less than seven 
months on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 While enduring brief stints as a receptionist, makeup artist and perfume 
saleswoman, the California native fell in love with a struggling comedian, 
Jason Neswick, and began her circuitous route to the agency business. 
</P>
<P>
 The young couple moved to the Bay Area a few years ago and then, one fateful 
day when her boyfriend couldn't track down his manager, Santos was recruited to 
make a phone call to a comedy club and land him a gig. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me: 'I don't care what you do or say -- just get me that spot.' " She 
did. The next day, her beau fired his manager and Santos continued to manage 
Neswick's career, landing him appearances as well as a spot on an ABC pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months later, the couple moved back to Hollywood, where Santos soon 
realized that Neswick's having a manager was not enough; an agent was also 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I called myself an agent and created a fake agency and named it CTA, for 
Creative Talent Agency," she says. "I had just read Premiere's Top 100 powerful 
people list and seen CAA and thought that if you said the name quick enough. . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, to pay the bills, Santos took a job as a receptionist at Spelling 
Entertainment. "I tried to get my boyfriend another agent at a real agency," 
she explains. "I had no ambitions of being anything." 
</P>
<P>
 She also became an informational sponge at Spelling. "I learned how to read a 
ratings sheet. I learned how to take a television show from the glimmer of an 
idea through production." 
</P>
<P>
 After a year, she was let go, and two weeks later, she waltzed into Innovative 
Artists Inc., an agency that handles actors, directors, producers and writers, 
and demanded to be interviewed that day for a temporary receptionist position. 
She got the job.  
</P>
<P>
 " Then I got ambitious," she says gleefully. Four months after joining the 
agency, she wrote a four-page outline to Scott Harris, the head of the company, 
on why the firm should have a comedy booking division. "It got me a lot of 
attention. He said: 'I don't want to do it (install the division), but you're 
smart. If a position opens up, I will support you to become an assistant.' "  
</P>
<P>
 After eight months on the reception desk, last year Santos became an assistant 
to top literary agent Paul Yamamoto, who was joining the agency. She was 
promoted 5 1/2 months later and now runs the television literary department. In 
fact, she is the television literary department, and also represents Bob Gunter 
("The Sandlot"), Stuart Ross ("Forever Plaid") and Lynn Mamet ("Under 
Suspicion"). 
</P>
<P>
 "What is impressive about Lisa is that she really knows television inside and 
out," observes Innovative Artists' Harris. "As a result, she is able to talk to 
producers about their shows practically like she's a staff writer." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Harris nor Santos pretend that she has the experience of her 
predecessors, such as Phyllis Carlyle, Rosalie Swedlin or the legendary Sue 
Mengers. But she may just have the spark that propelled those dynamic women to 
success; she has already signed 14 writers and one director to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you promote someone who is young and up and coming, they learn as they 
go," says Harris. "I'm not saying that she is as sophisticated an agent as she 
will be three years from now, but she has the foundation, the passion, and she 
loves the writers and that's really what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Her clients are the first to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm out all over town," says Duncan. "Lisa did more for me in the first three 
weeks than my previous agent did in two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan admits that he was initially put off by her youth. "I walked in to meet 
with her and this 16-year-old walked up to me. I thought: 'OK. Let's get this 
one over with quick.' " But the meeting lasted several hours. "Out of all of 
the agents I met with, she was the only one who knew my material intimately. 
</P>
<P>
 "She talked about what writers love to talk about: writing. It wasn't like the 
other meetings where they would say things like, 'I am going to make you a 
star.' I signed with her that day."  
</P>
<P>
 Santos prides herself on knowing intimately the story lines and characters of 
prime-time shows, which, surprisingly, she claims is not the norm for many 
agents. "Not a lot of people in the industry, from those I've run into, watch 
TV," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 During meetings with fellow agents, Santos will frequently be singled out 
because, as a twenty-something professional, she represents a desirable 
demographic. "They jokingly call me 'The Voice of America,' " she says, rolling 
her eyes.  
</P>
<P>
 Her toughest challenge? "Changing someone's mind. I run into situations where 
someone has read a piece of material and the response is, 'I like it, but I 
have a few problems here and there.' And to convince someone otherwise is a 
challenge. But it's a game -- a game against myself."  
</P>
<P>
 As she stands up to leave, she suddenly looks up in astonishment. "Oh, I just 
remembered something. This used to be the storage room and, on my first temp 
day, there was an assistant who was so mean to me that I ran in here and called 
the temp agency I was with, crying: 'You have to get me out of here. I can't 
stand it!' And it ended up being my office." She grins widely. "Oh, gosh. 
That's sooo weird."

IT'S STILL CLEAR WHICH FILM IS THE 'KING'; MOVIES: DISNEY'S ANIMATED FEATURE 
BRINGS IN AN ESTIMATED $34 MILLION OVER THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND, GIVING IT MORE 
THAN $100 MILLION AFTER 11 DAYS OF NATIONWIDE RELEASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Walt Disney Pictures' animated musical "The Lion King" continued to roar at 
the nation's box offices while "star-vehicles" floundered during the long 
Independence Day weekend. "The Lion King" attracted a massive $34 million in 
ticket sales, for a total of slightly more than $100 million after only 11 days 
of nationwide release. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last summer's "Jurassic Park" and 1989's "Batman" reached the 
$100-million plateau faster -- "Jurassic" in nine days, "Batman" in 10. But 
considering that easily half the tickets sold for "The Lion King" are at 
children's prices, the $100-million milestone is all the more impressive. 
Disney's president of distribution, Richard Cook, estimated that more than 25 
million have seen the animated musical fable since it opened in Los Angeles and 
New York on June 15 and then nationally on June 22. Even subtracting the gross 
for the preliminary two-city engagement puts "Lion King" over $100 million, 
Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Film industry estimates for the Friday-through-Monday weekend placed the total 
value of tickets sold for all films at about $113 million, which would be down 
about 10% to 15% from last summer's record Fourth of July weekend (paced by 
"The Firm," "Jurassic Park" and "Sleepless in Seattle"). 
</P>
<P>
 But the total was well ahead of other Fourth of July weekends during the last 
decade, which have fallen in the $75-million to $90-million range. "It clearly 
means that the marketplace has expanded," said Tom Sherak, 20th Century Fox 
executive vice president. The leap in the grosses for this summer and last has 
outpaced the rate of ticket-price inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia Pictures' distribution president Jeff Blake anticipates the summer 
movie business will stay hot "and extremely competitive" with dozens of movies 
competing for space at the nation's theaters. "The trouble is that there isn't 
room in the market for that second- or third-choice movie. When you are 
offering audiences new must-see movies every week, it's going to be very hard 
for moviegoers to get around to the second and third choices." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lion King's" total was bigger than the combined gross of the next three 
highest films of the weekend: Universal Pictures' "The Shadow" at $12.3 
million, 20th Century Fox's "Speed" at $12.2 million and MGM's "Blown Away" at 
$10.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend's results again underscored what a bad summer this is for movie 
"stars." The latest in a list of disappointing results came with the 
sixth-place opening of the Disney/Touchstone release "I Love Trouble," starring 
Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte, which had an estimated gross of $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, such films as the three-hour plus "Wyatt Earp" with Kevin Costner, 
"City Slickers II" with Billy Crystal, "Getting Even With Dad" with Macaulay 
Culkin and "Beverly Hills Cop III" with Eddie Murphy failed to catch fire with 
audiences. The exception has been Columbia Pictures' "Wolf" starring Jack 
Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer, which reported a gross of $8 million for its 
third weekend in release, though some industry analysts said that figure would 
probably end up lower when final numbers are reported today. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential exception is Paramount Pictures' "Forrest Gump," starring 
Tom Hanks, which opens Wednesday. Sneak previews of "Gump" helped boost the 
Saturday night grosses for "City Slickers II" and "Maverick." 
</P>
<P>
 Universal's stylishly mounted production "The Shadow," with Alec Baldwin 
playing the comic-book hero, surprised most box-office watchers with its 
stronger than expected, second-place debut. Universal senior vice president 
Nikki Rocco said the movie is playing strongly to those above 25 who remember 
the comic books, but "also looks like a hit with the under-25s." 
</P>
<P>
 The $10.5-million opening of the action film "Blown Away," which stars Jeff 
Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones, while not blockbuster-level business, is 
nevertheless the biggest opening week that the beleaguered MGM has known since 
1984 when the studio began to experience a series of ownership and management 
turnovers. "This puts us back in the mainstream of movie distribution," said 
Larry Gleason, MGM's president of worldwide theatrical distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Another film in the weekend's Top 10 included "Wyatt Earp," $5.2 million for 
seventh position. "The Flintstones" grossed $4.1 million for eighth place and 
has amassed $112.1 million since the Memorial Day weekend. In ninth place was 
Fox's "Baby's Day Out" with an estimated $4 million.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maverick" and "City Slickers II" appeared to be tied for 10th place with 
about $3 million each. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the Fourth of July holiday, the weekend box-office results usually 
found in Tuesday's Calendar will run on Wednesday.

A 'SUPERSTAR' START ON A NEW CAREER; THEATER: SYREETA WRIGHT PLAYS MARY 
MADGALENE IN 'JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR.' IT'S HER FIRST STAGE ROLE EVER AND FIRST 
SINGING JOB SINCE THE '80S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 "Ooohh, I was sooooo scared," shrieked singer Syreeta Wright, recalling her 
opening night as Mary Madgalene in "Jesus Christ Superstar" last October in 
Buffalo, N.Y. "I was so scared I can't remember doing it. It's a blank now. I 
really didn't think I was going to make it through another night." 
</P>
<P>
 She did, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that horrible attack of opening-night jitters, she has been singing the 
role about eight times a week in the national touring company of the rock 
opera, which is at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium tonight through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason Wright had such a bad case of nerves was because, as she explains, 
"It was the opening night of a whole new life." 
</P>
<P>
 As melodramatic as it sounds (actually she's a bubbly, outspoken chatterbox 
who makes everything sound melodramatic), it was quite true. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was it her first theatrical role ever, it was the first time Wright 
had sung professionally since the early '80s, when she was in the final stages 
of her career as an R&B singer-songwriter at Motown. Also, it was the first 
time she'd worked since a divorce forced her into a career change. For about 10 
years she'd been partners with her husband in a business booking motivational 
speakers. But after the divorce she bowed out of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was emotionally drained," admits Wright, who, in the 1 1/2 years before 
taking the "Superstar" role, concentrated on being a mother to her four 
children -- two daughters, 6 and 8, and two sons, 14 and 18. "But I knew I 
needed a new career." 
</P>
<P>
 However, it was Wright's first career and marriage -- to Stevie Wonder -- that 
brought her notoriety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a very happy time," she recalls, referring to their married years 
-- 1970-72. "But I'm friends with him now." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright did, though, have her biggest success collaborating with Wonder. In 
addition to writing with him on his albums "Music of My Mind" and "Talking 
Book," together they wrote his hit "Signed, Sealed and Delivered." He also 
produced and co-wrote her album "Stevie Wonder Presents Syreeta," which came 
out in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of my six albums, that was the best," she recalls wistfully. "What's funny is 
that we were going through a divorce while we were making it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who currently lives in Los Angeles, doesn't give her age ("Let's just 
say I've been around") -- but is probably 40ish. "I look good too," she says 
laughing -- but clearly believing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although born in Pittsburgh, Wright grew up in a suburb of Detroit. She 
started out singing jazz and show tunes but switched to R&B when she got a shot 
to record for Motown in 1968. But she was one of those "budding superstars" who 
never had the huge hit album or single that everyone expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some wonderful years at Motown, but I was also frustrated and unhappy 
for some of those years," she recalls. "I never did what I wanted to do. I was 
always butting heads with the executives about my career." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her final album with Motown was "Spell," produced in 1983 by Jermaine Jackson. 
"I didn't like the way the album turned out," she says. "I was fighting with 
the company about it. But then I didn't like a lot of the albums I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Her harsh summary of her Motown years: "It was like a bad marriage. You have 
to know when it's not going to work and call it quits. But I was young and 
dumb. I should have broken away from Motown years before I left, but I didn't 
have enough sense to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 She finally parted company with the label -- and the music business -- in 
1983. But, after being away from it all for more than a decade, she's yearning 
to plunge back in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been doing a lot of writing but that's about to change," she 
insists. "I'm going to buy a little keyboard for the road so I can start 
writing regularly again. Then I'll start making demos looking for a record 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to her former career seemed like a logical step. "I always felt I 
had been born to sing," she says with pride. "I hadn't done it for over 10 
years and I missed it badly. I wasn't sure how to get back into it, but I never 
thought it would be through theater." 
</P>
<P>
 She has her pal Carl Anderson, who's also in "Superstar," to thank for the 
opportunity. He alerted her about auditions for the role of Mary Madgalene. "I 
never thought I'd get it because I'd never done theatrical singing," she 
explains. "It's very different -- in terms of breathing and technique -- from 
the kind of pop singing I'd done. But I taught myself how to do it and got the 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 What about the new career? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably be with this show until February," she says. "I'd consider 
another show if it was the right show and I didn't have to travel too much. 
I'll have to wait until this show is finished before I figure out my next 
step."

 For me, "Rites of Passage" at the Fullerton Museum was not just another 
exhibition. Coming from a somewhat eccentric, proudly tradition-free family 
that had to be persuaded to celebrate Thanksgiving, I had always shrugged off 
rites and rituals as so much claptrap. 
</P>
<P>
 But last winter, I discovered that there is something to be said, after all, 
for such ceremonies, so long as they allow true feelings to be shared and 
voiced. 
</P>
<P>
 After going to a hospital in San Francisco to treat one of several types of 
cancer that had dogged her during her adult life, my mother suddenly fell into 
in a coma before anyone had a chance to say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 During the days and hours before her death, her body was tethered to 
life-giving equipment in the emergency ward. For a few moments each day, family 
members stood at her bedside -- numbed by some intensely personal combination 
of anguish and guilt -- while implacable machines sighed and hummed, and a 
wavering graph charted her breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 When there was no more hope and we tearfully made the decision to take Mom off 
life support, the hospital's counselor approached my father to ask about 
funeral arrangements. My father said he didn't want some guy with a collar 
talking about my mother, so there would be no funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, we wondered aloud about what to do with the ashes after my mother was 
cremated, according to her wish. We agreed that it was gruesome to keep them in 
a jar on somebody's mantle. But it seemed ghastly just to fling them out with 
the trash. The bizarre humor that consorts so easily with grief bubbled up in 
the tiny white-walled hospital "quiet room" we had commandeered. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, we learned that her ashes would be strewn at sea the following week 
by the company that would perform the cremation. My father said he wouldn't be 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can cry just as well at home," he said. Nor did he warm to the idea of 
dedicating some bench or stone to her memory. 
</P>
<P>
 But my youngest brother was troubled. We had to do something , he said. Why 
not agree to return to San Francisco in the spring and voice our thoughts about 
Mom in the secluded Shakespeare Garden in Golden Gate Park? 
</P>
<P>
 Despite unexpectedly chilly weather that made us hug ourselves and stamp our 
feet when we weren't crying or laughing, it turned out to be a wonderful idea 
-- as suited to our strengths and tensions as a family as to the 
extraordinarily subtle and private woman few of us felt we ever really knew. 
</P>
<P>
 The three of us siblings who write for a living each read essays that turned 
out to spotlight radically different aspects of Mom. 
</P>
<P>
 My black-sheep brother cracked loving but awkwardly inappropriate jokes. My 
uncle reminisced wryly about the long-ago day he taught his little sister to 
swim. One of my sisters burst out with an impromptu emotional message, at once 
loving and accusatory. My father poignantly addressed my mother as if she were 
still alive and able to recall their poor-but-happy early years and harmonious 
middle age right along with him. 
</P>
<P>
 And then we spent hours drinking wine and eating the Lucullan feast prepared 
by my other sister -- who had protested at the ceremony that she was a cook, 
not a writer, and had nothing to say. CATHY CURTIS
